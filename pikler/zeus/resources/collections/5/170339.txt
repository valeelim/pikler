Pandora's box    pandora 's box in greek mythology , pandora 's box was a large jar ( πιθος `` pithos '' ) carried by pandora . it contained the evils to be let loose on mankind . when the box was empty , hope remained . the actual evils are not specified by hesiod . the word in the original text is `` pithos '' , which usually refers to a large container ; used to store wine or other things . such containers were also used for funerals . in the case of pandora , this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense , or , instead , of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison . the mistranslation of `` pithos '' as `` box '' is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist erasmus of rotterdam . erasums is thought to have made the error when he translated hesiod 's tale of pandora into latin . hesiod 's `` pithos '' refers to a storage jar for oil or grain . erasmus , however , translated `` pithos '' into the latin word `` pyxis '' , meaning `` box '' . the phrase `` pandora 's box '' has endured ever since . this error was further backed by dante gabriel rossetti 's painting `` pandora '' .
