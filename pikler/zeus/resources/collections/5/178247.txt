Voter registration     voter registration is needed in some democracies for citizens and residents to check in with some central registry so that they will be allowed to vote in elections . in australia , for example , everyone over the age of 18 must register with the australian electoral commission ( aec ) . their names are then added to the electoral roll , a list of all people able to vote in future elections . part of the aec 's job is make sure everyone who is allowed to vote is listed on the roll . they also have to make sure that people who have died are removed from the lists .
