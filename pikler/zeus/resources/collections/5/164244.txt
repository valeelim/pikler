Ozone layer     the ozone layer is a layer of ozone high up in the earth 's atmosphere stratosphere . in the region between about 10 kilometres and about 50 kilometres above ground , the atmosphere contains more ozone ( o ) . the exact amount of ozone that can be found varies , the seasons influence it ; it is also different in different places on the earth . over the last hundred years the ozone layer has been damaged by man-made chemicals , especially ones called cfcs ( chlorofluorocarbons ) . cfcs were used for various purposes . they have been replaced by other substances for most applications . these cfcs are broken down in the upper atmosphere where they react with the ozone . this causes ozone depletion . the ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the french physicists charles fabry and henri buisson . its properties were explored in detail by the british meteorologist g. m. b. dobson , who developed a simple spectrophotometer , the dobsonmeter . this tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground . between 1928 and 1958 dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations . most of these stations are still in use today . the `` dobson unit '' , a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead , is named in his honor .
