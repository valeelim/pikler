Commitment scheme     in cryptography , a commitment scheme is a way for a someone to tell something to someone without letting other people know . someone would do this to make sure they can prove who they are . someone also might do this to make sure that someone does not cheat . this is done by using a one-way function to change a string into a hash . this is called the `` commit phase '' . later , if someone needs to prove that they were the one who made the commitment , then they can tell people the original string they used . this is called the `` reveal phase '' .
