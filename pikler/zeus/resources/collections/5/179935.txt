Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra     the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra ( in german : gewandhausorchester leipzig or just gewandhausorchester ) is a famous german orchestra based in leipzig , germany . it is named after the concert hall in which it is based , the gewandhaus ( pronounce : “ ge-vant-house ” ) . the word “ gewandhaus ” means `` textiles hall '' . it is a hall that originally was used for people to buy and sell textiles . the beginnings of the orchestra go back to 1743 , when a society called the `` grosses concert '' began performing in private homes . in 1744 the `` grosses concert '' moved its concerts to the `` three swans '' tavern . their concerts continued there for 36 years . gradually more and more people started to complain about the noise and the behaviour in the tavern , so in 1780 the mayor and city council of leipzig offered to let the orchestra use part of the gewandhaus , the building where the merchants were selling textiles . the orchestra gave its first concert in the gewandhaus in 1781. it is the oldest orchestra in germany , apart from private orchestras who belonged to rich people .
