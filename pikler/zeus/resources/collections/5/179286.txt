Shock wave     a shock wave is when lots of energy comes from a very small spot and shakes the material around it . the energy makes the material around the spot move very quickly , and very hard . this is a special type of vibration , and it is very strong . the shock wave can be so powerful that it can knock things over . for example , bombs create shock waves . a shock wave can be destructive because it vibrates the material around the point in an extremely hard and fast wave , which causes other things that the material touches to vibrate too , and even make them explode . shock waves make bombs more dangerous and sometimes are the most dangerous part of an explosion . however , the shock wave moves much faster than the rest of the bomb 's energy , and fades away quickly . it is called a shock `` wave '' , and not simply a shock , because the force goes up and down , like an ocean wave . a shock wave can move through any material . an earthquake is a shockwave traveling through the ground . shock waves can also be felt in water . a shock wave is affected by the materials it travels through , and different materials have different effects . a thick material , like water , might help the shock wave travel further , where as a thin material , like air , would not . this is similar to the way that sound waves are affected by what they move through , but sound waves and shock waves are not the same .
