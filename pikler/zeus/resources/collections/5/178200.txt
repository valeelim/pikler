Wudu     wudu ( al-wuū ' , `` ābdast '' , , wazū ' ) is the islamic act of washing parts of the body using water . it is necessary to do this before one prays . abu huraira ( رضي الله عنه ) reported that the messenger of allah ( صلى الله عليه وسلّم ) said , `` when the muslim - or believing - slave does wudu ' and washes his face , every wrong thing at which his eyes have looked leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water . when he washes his hands , every wrong thing which his hands have touched leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water . when he washes his feet . every wrong thing to which his feet have walked leaves with the water – or with the last drop of water , until he emerges cleansed of sins .
