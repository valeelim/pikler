Coca     coca is a plant in the family erythroxylaceae , native to north-western south america . the plant plays a significant role in traditional andean culture . coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids , a basis for the drug cocaine , which is a powerful stimulant . today the plant has many uses , including traditional use by andean cultures to flavoring coca-cola products to use as an anesthetic . coca has been cultivated by andean cultures for thousands of years . traditionally people would chew the leaf or soak it in hot water to make tea in order to experience the various benefits the leaf provides . coca was introduced to europe in the 16th century . after its stimulating effects were described by a european doctor in the 19th century , people began to refine the leaves to get cocaine . as people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries . in 1961 the united nations classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive . this has led the united states to pressure coca-growing countries such as peru and bolivia to stop growing coca entirely . these countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision , trying to remove the coca plant from the list .
