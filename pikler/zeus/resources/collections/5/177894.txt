Joseph Schumpeter     joseph alois schumpeter ( 8 february 1883 â€“ 8 january 1950 ) was an austrian-german-american researcher in economics and political science . he studied the theory of marxism and capitalism . in his view , capitalism can not work because of what he called creative destruction . this term was originally used by karl marx to describe the capitalist system , but schumpeter used it differently : he says that each time innovation by entrepreneur occurs , it must ( also ) change what already exists . in this context , certain structures that already exist will also be destroyed . a current example of this is that digital photography has made the instant camera , such as polaroid almost disappear . schumpeter was finance minister of austria in 1919 .
