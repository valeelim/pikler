Lemuriformes     lemuriformes are an infraorder of primates . it combines the lemurs of madagascar , with the galagos and lorises of africa and asia . the lorises and lemurs are a monophyletic clade . however , a popular alternative taxonomy puts the lorises in their own infraorder , the lorisiformes . lemuriform origins are unclear and debated . the main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils . molecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in africa during the paleocene , about 62 mya . between 47 and 54 mya , lemurs got to madagascar by rafting . in isolation , the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today . in africa , the lorises and galagos diverged during the eocene , about 40 mya . unlike the lemurs in madagascar , they have had to compete with monkeys and apes , as well as other mammals . because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises , researchers have often referred to them as `` primitive '' strepsirrhines , lemur ancestors , or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines . they are included in strepsirrhini , and are considered basal members of the clade .
