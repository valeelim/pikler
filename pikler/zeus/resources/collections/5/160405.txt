British Rail DP2     dp2 , meaning diesel prototype number 2 , was a prototype type 4 mainline diesel locomotive built in 1962 by english electric at their vulcan foundry in newton-le-willows to demonstrate its wares to british railways . as the deltics were then in production , it was decided to produce the locomotive on the same production line ; the bodyshell used for dp2 reputedly being the eighteenth made . while dp2 looked like a class 55 locomotive in outline , there were many detail differences ; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end , and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the deltics . these differences were the external effect of dp2 being totally different from the twin-engined deltics internally , being the forerunner of the class 50 .
