Laplace transform     the laplace transform is a way to turn functions into other functions in order to do certain calculations more easily . this way of turning functions to other functions is very similar to u substitution . the aim of this change is to be able to turn the hard work of integration into a simple algebraic addition and subtraction , just as logarithms allow us to add and subtract instead of multiplying and dividing . an example of its use is in ruin theory which is a subject of actuarial science with regards to insurance . functions usually take a variable ( say `` t '' ) as an input , and give some output ( say `` f '' ) . the laplace transform converts these functions to take some other input ( `` s '' ) and give some other output ( `` f '' ) . because of certain shared properties of laplace transforms , this makes it very easy to manipulate the original function into something useful . the laplace transform is often formulated as : - f ( s ) = the laplace transform of f ( t ) - f ( t ) = the input function - s = the new domain
