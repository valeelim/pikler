Reform     reform means a useful change , or sometimes to a pure original state . reform is generally distinguished from revolution . revolution means basic or radical change ; reform may be no more than fine tuning , or the removing of serious wrongs without changing the whole system . reform seeks to improve the system as it stands , never to overthrow it . the uk government frequently uses the term `` reform '' to describe changes to public services , such as the national health service . but these changes are not accepted by all people as useful . a note about grammar : when used to describe something which is `` physically '' formed again , such as re-casting it in a mold/mould , or a band that gets back together , the proper term is re-form ( with a hyphen ) , not `` reform '' .
