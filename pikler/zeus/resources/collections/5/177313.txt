Classical conditioning     classical conditioning ( also pavlovian conditioning ) is a form of associative learning . ivan pavlov was the first to show in what way it works . he did this in 1927 , using dogs . there is one stimulus which is called `` neutral '' , and there is another , which has some meaning . if the two stimuli are often presented together , the organism `` learns '' that they belong together . as a result , it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get what pavlov referred this learned relationships to as a `` conditional reflex '' , or to what is today called a conditioned reflex or response . pavlov did the experiment with dogs . each time before he fed the dogs , he rang a bell . the dogs then learned that when the bell rang they would be fed . so they started to salivate , when they heard the bell ring , even before they saw or smelled the food .
