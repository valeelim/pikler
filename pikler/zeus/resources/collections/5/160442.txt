Acanthocephala     the acanthocephala ( greek `` akanthos '' , thorn + `` kephale '' , head ) are a group of parasitic worms . they may be called known as `` acanthocephales '' , `` thorny-headed worms '' , or `` spiny-headed worms '' . they have an evertable proboscis , armed with spines , which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of the host . acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the host â€™ s gut . acanthocephalans have complex life cycles , with various hosts , including invertebrates , fishes , amphibians , birds , and mammals . the juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects . adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates , especially fish . about 1150 species have been described . the acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum . recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers . since all parasites are derived from free-living forms , the acanthocephalans are modified rotifers . this is an example of molecular phylogenetics . in due course , spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum , such as sub-phylum or class .
