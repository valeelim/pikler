Black smoker     a black smoker is a kind of hydrothermal vent that can be found on the ocean floor . it is a crack in the planet 's surface from which geothermally heated water comes out . hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places , areas where tectonic plates are moving apart , ocean basins , and hotspots . hydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust . common land types include hot springs , fumaroles and geysers . the most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within yellowstone national park in the united states . under the sea , hydrothermal vents may form features called `` black smokers '' . relative to the majority of the deep sea , the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive , often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids . chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain , supporting diverse organisms , including giant tube worms , clams , limpets and shrimp .
