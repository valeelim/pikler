Gravitational constant     the gravitational constant , called g in physics equations , is an empirical physical constant . it is used to show the force between two objects caused by gravity . the gravitational constant appears in newton 's universal law of gravitation . g is about 6.6738 x10-11nâ‹…m/kg , and is denoted by letter . it usually appears in sir isaac newton 's law of universal gravitation , and in albert einstein 's general theory of relativity . it is also known as the universal gravitational constant , newton 's constant , and colloquially as big g. it should not be confused with `` small g '' ( `` g '' ) , which is the local gravitational field of the earth ( equivalent to the free-fall acceleration ) .
