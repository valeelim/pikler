Poincaré conjecture     the poincaré conjecture is a question about spheres in mathematics . it is named after henri poincaré , the french mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904. the sphere ( also called the 2-sphere , as it is a 2-dimensional surface , although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space ) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point ( if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere , it is possible to slide it down to a point ) . mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected . other spaces do not have this property , for example the donut : a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once can not be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface . mathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere , in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough ( in mathematician terms , that is compact ) is in fact the 2-sphere . it is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however , as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected . also , a regular disk ( a circle and its interior ) is simply connected , but it has an edge ( the bounding circle ) .
