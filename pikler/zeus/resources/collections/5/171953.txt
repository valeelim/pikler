Carbonation     carbonation is the process of carbon dioxide dissolving in a liquid . for example , carbon dioxide is added to flavored water under pressure to make it `` fizz '' as a carbonated soft drink . when rain passes through the atmosphere , it takes in or mixes with carbon dioxide , turning it into a weak carbonic acid . when the rain falls in limestone , it dissolves the calcium carbonate in the rock , turning it into calcium bicarbonate . this basically dissolves the rock . holes and large cracks can form in the rock , which are called grikes , or in german ship docking `` kruftkarren '' . the limestone that is left is called clint . in a large karst area which is a large area of limestone , there are a lot of big grikes . if a stream or river passes through it , it could be swallowed up by a hole called a swallow hole . it can go through a series of underground caves and may appear on the surface again . an example of a karst area is the burren , in county clare , ireland . carbon dioxide is weakly soluble in water , therefore it separates into a gas . the process of carbon dioxide bubbling out ( effervescing ) from a solution is represented by the following chemical reaction . this shows aqueous carbonic acid converts to carbon dioxide and water :
