Gel     a gel is a semi-solid substance material which usually wobbles . by weight , gels are mostly liquid . but gels also behave like solids . they have a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid . it is the crosslinks in the fluid that give a gel its structure . as colloids , gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid . in a gel , the solid is the continuous phase ; the liquid is the discontinuous phase . examples : jellies , agar , contact lenses , organic slime .
