Square metre     the square metre ( also spelled square meter , see spelling differences ) is the si derived unit of area , with symbol mÂ² ( 33a1 in unicode ) . it is defined as the area of a square whose sides measure exactly one metre . the square metre is derived from the si base unit of the metre , which in turn is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in absolute vacuum during a time interval of of a second . adding si prefixes creates multiples and submultiples ; however , as the unit is squared , the order of magnitude difference between units doubles from their comparable linear units . for example , a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre , but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre . a square metre is not the same as a metre square , an area 2 metres wide by 5 metres long would be 10 square metres . in contrast , a 10-metre square ( 10 metres by 10 metres ) is actually 100 square metres . the square metre may be used with all si prefixes used with the metre .
