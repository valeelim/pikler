Laminar flow     laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of a liquid . this tends to happen at low velocities when there are few disturbances , such as in a straight , smooth pipe . in laminar flow through a pipe , it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the boundaries of the pipe and is at a maximum in the center ; mathematically , the velocity profile is parabolic . microscopically , the particles or pieces of the liquid flow in a straight line along the direction of the pipe and do not mix with other layers of fluid . the layers slide past one another like playing cards . this is in contrast to turbulent flow , when a fluid swirls around . even though there is no mixing , there is still some friction in the flow . this friction will cause a pressure drop and its numerical value is given by the hagen-poiseuille equation .
