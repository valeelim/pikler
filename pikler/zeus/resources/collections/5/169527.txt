Coeliac disease     coeliac disease ( spelled celiac disease in north america ) is an illness which makes people ill if they eat gluten . if someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten ( for example , wheat ) , cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine . this means that they can not digest ( eat ) food properly , making them unable to have enough energy , vitamins , or minerals . children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly . people with coeliac disease often lose weight . they are also frequently tired . people with coeliac disease often have diarrhoea ( watery stools ) or steatorrhea ( fat in their stools ) . these symptoms can lead to flatulence . their stomach also hurts and they might suffer from joint pains , seizures , rashes , loss of bone density and fertility issues . to relieve the effects of coeliac disease , one must stop eating gluten . there are no medicines that can stop coeliac disease . to get fully better , it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten , during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover . they must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition .
