Convergent boundary     a convergent boundary is where two or more tectonic plates collide with each other causing massive earth movements . the himalayas were formed by such a collision . earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries . this is because of pressure , friction , and plate material melting in the mantle , the diagram illustrates some differences between the two types of subduction . 1. oceanic crust moves under . a deep ocean trench forms at the coast , and an arc of mountainous volcanoes forms inland . seen along the western edge of the americas . 1. continental crust moves under . the edge of the continental plate folds into a huge mountain range . behind it is a high plateau . the himalayas and the tibetan plateau are a perfect example of this .
