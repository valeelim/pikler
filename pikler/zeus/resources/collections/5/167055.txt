Field (mathematics)    field ( mathematics ) in mathematics a field is a certain kind of algebraic structure . in a field you can add ( formula_1 ) , subtract ( formula_2 ) , multiply ( formula_3 ) and divide ( formula_4 ) two numbers ( with division only allowed if formula_5 is not equal to zero ) . a field is a special ring , in which you can divide . as the field is always a ring , it consists of a set ( represented here with the letter r ) with two operations : addition ( + ) and multiplication ( • ) . the properties of a ring are : - `` closure '' : if an operation is used on any elements in the ring , the element that is formed will also be part of the ring . - for all a , b in r , the result of the operation a + b is also in r. - for all a , b in r , the result of the operation a • b is also in r. - `` additive identity element '' : one element of the ring is special . it is called the additive identity element ( or zero ) . if addition is used with the identity element and another element , the other element will not change . - there exists an element 0 in r , such that for all elements a in r , the equation 0 + a = a + 0 = a holds .
