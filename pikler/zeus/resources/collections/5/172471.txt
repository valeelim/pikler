Orbitron     the orbitron is a custom car built by ed roth . it was lost for many years until it was found again in mexico in 2007. built in 1964 , the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 chevrolet v8 and a powerglide automatic transmission . the body was made by hand out of fiberglass . the driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car . this was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car . it was lined with a funny-looking material called `` fake fur '' and it even had an 11 '' general electric portable television in the console . on top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy , clear plastic . a top like this is called a `` bubble top '' since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver . it raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood . the hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed . roth built the frame himself out of box-shaped steel tubing . the engine came from one of his 1955 chevrolets . he removed it so that he could put in a newer , larger v8 engine given to him by general motors . the orbitron was one of the very few cars which mroth thought was a `` mistake '' after he built it . he was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars ; the orbitron 's engine and frame were covered by the body . the orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood . it was said that the automatic hood did not fit well .
