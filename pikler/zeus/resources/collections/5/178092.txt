Adhan     the adhān ( also athaan : ipa : [ ʔæˈðæːn ] ) ( أَذَان ) is the islamic call to prayer . the muezzin reads it out aloud . the root of the word is ' `` to permit '' , and another derivative of this word is ' , meaning `` ear . '' the muezzin reads adhan in the mosque , sometimes from a minaret . he usually does this five times a day . adhan is used to call other muslims to do the prayers . there is a second call , known as iqama ( set up ) that is used to tell muslims to line up for the start of the prayers . sometimes , loudspeakers are used on the minarets . sunni and shi'a use versions of adhan which are slightly different from each other .
