5145 Pholus     5145 pholus is a centaur ( minor planetoid ) of the solar system running in a stretched orbit , with a perihelion ( closest approach to the sun ) less than saturn 's and aphelion ( farthest approach from the sun ) farther than neptune 's . close approaches of the object are not common : it has not come within one astronomical unit ( about 150 million km ) of a planet since 764 bc , and will not again until 5290. astronomers think that pholus started out as a kuiper belt object . it was found by david l. rabinowitz , then of the university of arizona 's spacewatch project , and named after pholus , the brother of the mythological chiron , after which 2060 chiron was named to follow the tradition of naming this class of outer planet crossing objects after centaurs . pholus was the second centaur type asteroid to be found and was quickly found to be very red in color . because it 's very red , it is sometimes called `` big red '' . astronomers think the color is because of organic compounds on its surface .
