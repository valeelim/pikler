Ticket of leave     a ticket of leave was an important document given to convicts who had been sent to australia . convicts who were well-behaved were given a ticket of leave . this gave them some rights , and they did not have to stay in gaol . with a ticket of leave , a convict was able to look for work in a particular area but could not leave the area without permission from a court . every change of employer or district was written on the ticket . governor philip gidley king started the tickets of leave in 1801. it gave prisoners a reason to behave themselves . also , it helped to provide cheap workers for farmers who were settling in australia . the government saved money as it did not have to feed and clothe the prisoners . those with a ticket of leave were able to marry or to bring their families from britain . they could buy land but not carry guns or get onto a ship . they were often made to pay back the cost of their travel in the prison ship to australia . the ticket of leave had to be renewed every year , and those with one had to attend ( where it could be checked they were still living in the area ) , and church services . prisoners could lose their ticket and be sent back to prison if they were lazy , if they tried to get paid too much , or if they were rude to the police or soldiers . sometimes , prisoners who helped the government , by capturing escaped convicts for example , might be given a ticket of leave as a reward .
