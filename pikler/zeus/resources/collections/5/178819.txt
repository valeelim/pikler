Falklands War     the falklands war was a war between the united kingdom and argentina over the falkland islands in 1982. the falkland islands are 480 kilometres from argentina in the southern atlantic ocean . argentina and the united kingdom have argued over which country the falklands islands belongs to since the 1800s . in the 1760s and 1770s , the british set up a town at port egmont , which nearly led to a war with spain who had a town at port louis . then argentina became a separate country from spain in 1817 and set up a colony on the islands ( which they call `` malvinas '' ) in 1820. an american warship later destroyed this town , and the british took the islands again in 1833. the british kept the islands until argentinian special forces invaded on 2 april , 1982 and took control of the island . the united nations security council asked argentina to withdraw , and tried to end the crisis with diplomacy . after seven weeks , argentina did not withdraw , so the united kingdom sent their military to attack . after a short battle in the air and at sea , the british landed on 21 may and fought on land until argentina 's army surrendered on 14 june .
