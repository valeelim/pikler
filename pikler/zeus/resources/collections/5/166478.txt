Quartz clock     a quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time . this crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency , so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than good mechanical clocks . generally , some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display , usually in units of hours , minutes , and seconds . since the 1970s , they have become the most widely used timekeeping technology . other websites . - animation of quartz clock
