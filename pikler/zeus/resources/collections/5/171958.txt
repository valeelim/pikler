Feynman diagram     a feynman diagram is a diagram that shows what happens when elementary particles collide . feynman diagrams are used in quantum mechanics . a feynman diagram has `` lines '' in different shapes—straight , dotted , and squiggly—which meet up at points called `` vertices '' . the vertices are where the lines begin and end . the points in feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time . the `` lines '' in a feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another . in feynman diagrams , the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time . when a particle is going backward in time , it is called an antiparticle . the meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time , so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point , that means that the particle was either created or destroyed , depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from .
