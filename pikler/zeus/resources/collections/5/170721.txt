Roman à clef     roman à clef ( said like it rhymes with `` a don a day '' ) means `` novel with a key '' in french . it is a phrase used for talking about literature and movies . a roman à clef is a type of story that 's true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character . the `` key '' part of the meaning–what someone needs to unlock the real story–changes from book to book . for some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person . for others it is knowing that the main character is really the author . authors usually write these types of stories ( instead of telling the whole truth ) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved ca n't sue them . a couple of movies that are written like this are citizen kane ( a movie about a man a lot like william randolph hearst ) and dreamgirls ( a movie about a motown group a lot like the supremes ) . because it comes from french , the plural of roman à clef is `` romans à clef '' .
