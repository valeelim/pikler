Nocturnal emission     a nocturnal emission or `` wet dream '' is when a boy or man has an orgasm while sleeping . wet dreams can begin after a boy goes through puberty . many young men have their first orgasm this way . they might not understand what has happened to them , if they have not been taught anything about sex . nocturnal emissions are called wet dreams because of the dampness caused by ejaculation and because the orgasm and ejaculation often happen during a sexually exciting dream . scientists are not sure what causes them . most sexual dreams `` do not '' cause orgasms . wet dreams are natural and harmless . they do not mean that anything is wrong with you . many men stop having wet dreams if they masturbate often or once they begin having sexual intercourse on a regular basis . if you urinate while asleep , this is called wetting the bed , not a wet dream .
