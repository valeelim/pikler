Victoria line     the victoria line is part of the london underground network . it is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from brixton in the south of london to the walthamstow central in the north-east . it started running in 1968. on the tube map it is shown with a light blue colour . it is the fourth busiest line on the london underground network . it is the only line on the underground , other than the two-stop waterloo & city line , which is completely underground . the only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from seven sisters to northumberland park . the line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations . the stations are on top of small hills , or humps . as the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down . as the train leaves the station it travels down the hill , with gravity helping the train to speed up . this saves 5 % energy and makes the trains run 9 % faster . each new platform built for the victoria line is 132.6 metres long . 183 million people use the victoria line each year .
