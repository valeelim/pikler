North Magnetic Pole     the north magnetic pole is one of two places on the earth where its magnetic field points vertically downwards . the other is the south magnetic pole . at any other place on earth , the magnetic field points to the north magnetic pole . this is why a compass works to find where north is . the north magnetic pole is not identical to the north pole , which is the geographic north pole . it wanders slowly . in 2001 , a team of scientists estimated that the north magnetic pole is near ellesmere island in northern canada at . it was estimated to be at in 2005. as of 2015 , the pole is thought to have moved east beyond the canadian arctic territorial claim to . because the north magnetic pole is different from the north pole , a compass does not always point straight north . but usually the difference is small . because the earth 's magnetic field is not symmetrical , the south magnetic pole is not directly opposite . a line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the centre of the earth .
