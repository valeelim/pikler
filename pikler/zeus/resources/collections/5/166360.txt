Disk buffer     a disk buffer is a small amount of memory on a hard drive . sometimes it is also called cache buffer , or disk cache , but these words should not be used , a disk buffer is not a cache . in early 2015 , hard disks usually have between 16 and 128 megabytes of such memory . when writing data to the disk , the data needs to be written to a certain position on the disk . this is done by a component called disk read/write head . this head needs to be moved to ( or near ) the correct track . after some settling time the read head begins to pick up bits . usually , the first sectors to be read are not the ones that have been requested by the operating system . the disk 's embedded computer typically saves these unrequested sectors in the disk buffer , in case the operating system requests them later . the disk is attached to the computer by what is called an i/o interface . this interface almost always works at a different speed than that of the hard disk platter . in such a case , the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk , before it sent to the computer , or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk .
