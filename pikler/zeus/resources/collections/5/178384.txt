Pitch (baseball)    pitch ( baseball ) a pitch , in baseball , is when a pitcher throws the baseball to the batter . this is a pitcher 's main job . the pitcher tries to get the player who is at-bat out . if a pitcher throws three strikes , the batter strikes out ( unless the third strike is a foul tip ) . a strike is when a pitch is in the zone from the batter 's knees to the belt and the width of home plate ( the `` strike zone '' ) , and if the batter does not swing . a strike is also called if a batter swings at any pitch and misses , or if a batter hits a ball into foul territory ( this is called a `` foul tip '' ) . if a pitcher throws a ball outside of the strike zone and the batter does not swing , this is called a `` ball '' . if four of these are thrown , the batter gets to go to first base for free . this is called a `` walk '' . pitchers use different pitches to try to get the batter out . the most common is a fastball . a fastball is when the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he or she can . the pitcher is trying to get the ball past the batter before the batter can hit it . another type of pitch is a changeup . a pitcher throws a changeup when he or she wants the batter to swing before the ball gets to home plate . the batter might do this because he or she thinks the pitch is a fastball and the baseball will get to the plate faster . in addition to these two types of pitches , there are also many others .
