Hanged, drawn and quartered    hanged , drawn and quartered to be hanged , drawn and quartered was a punishment in england used for men found guilty of high treason . the full punishment was made up of the following - the victim was : 1. dragged , usually by a horse , on a wooden frame to the place where he was to be publicly put to death . this is one possible meaning of `` drawn '' . a more likely meaning of `` drawn '' is the removal of the inner organs . 1. hanged by the neck for a short time or until almost dead ( `` hanged '' ) . 1. removed from hanging and placed on a table . still alive , the victim was cut open in the abdomen and his intestines and sex organs removed ( this is another meaning of `` drawn '' â€”see the reference to the `` oxford english dictionary '' below ) . the removed organs were burned in a flame , prepared close to the prisoner . 1. the victim 's head was cut off , and the rest of the body hacked into four parts or quarters ( `` quartered '' ) . typically , the five body parts ( i.e . the four quarters of the body and the head ) would be put on public display in different parts of the city , town , or - in more famous cases such as that of william wallace - in the country , to discourage would-be traitors who had not seen the execution . after the crimes act 1814 was passed by the parliament of the united kingdom , the prisoner was instead hanged until dead - not having to suffer the extremely painful remainder of the punishment while alive . the public display of the bodies of executed prisoners ( whether by `` hanging , drawing and quartering '' , or some other method ) was removed from english criminal law in 1843 ; `` drawing '' and `` quartering '' in 1870 .
