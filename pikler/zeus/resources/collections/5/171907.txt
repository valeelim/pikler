Reflection nebula     in astronomy , a reflection nebula is a cloud of dust which reflects the light of a star or many stars . the light from the nearby stars is not hot enough to ionize the gas of the nebula to make an emission nebula . however , is enough to make the dust visible because the light reflects off of the dust . reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering works better for blue light than red ( this is the same reason that the sky is blue and sunsets are red ) . reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are usually seen together and sometimes are called 'diffuse nebulae ' . a good example of this is the orion nebula . reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation . other pages . - variable nebula references . - james b. kaler ( 1998 ) . `` kosmische wolken . materie-kreisläufe in der milchstraße .
