Czechoslovak government-in-exile     the czechoslovak government-in-exile ( sometimes called officially as : provisional government of czechoslovakia ) was an informal name given to the czechoslovak national liberation committee , first by british diplomatic recognition . the name was used by other world war ii allies as they followed the british in recognizing it . the committee was originally created by the former czechoslovak president , edvard bene≈° in paris , france in october 1939. unsuccessful negotiations with france for diplomatic status , as well as the impending nazi occupation of france , forced the committee to move to london in 1940. from there , it moved to aston abbots , buckinghamshire in 1941 , where it sought relative safety from the london blitz . it was the true government for czechoslovakia throughout the second world war . a specifically anti-fascist government , it sought to reverse the munich agreement and the following german occupation of czechoslovakia , and to return the republic to its 1937 boundaries . due to this it was considered , by those countries that recognized it , the legal continuation of the first republic of czechoslovakia .
