Transonic     transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound ( 1,236 kph or 768 mph ) . the speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed . - subsonic - transonic - supersonic - hypersonic transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic . subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach 1 , so transonic goes from mach 0.8 to 1.2. when you are going through transonic speeds , drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster . this is the sound barrier .
