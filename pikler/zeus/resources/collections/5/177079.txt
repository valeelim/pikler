Alpha particle     an alpha particle is made up of two protons and two neutrons . it is a kind of helium , except without electrons . radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay , known as alpha decay . during alpha decay , the atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle . the nucleus will lose two protons and two neutrons when this happens . after the decay , the atom will change to another element , because the atom loses two protons . for example , if americium were to go through alpha decay it would change into neptunium because neptunium is defined to have two protons less than americium . alpha decay usually happens in heavy elements , those containing more neutrons and protons , such as uranium , thorium , plutonium , and radium . alpha particles can not even go through a few centimetres of air . alpha irradiation can not hurt humans when the alpha source is outside the human body , because human skin does not let the alpha particles go through . alpha radiation can be very harmful if the source is inside the body , such as when people breathe dust or gas containing materials which decay by emitting alpha particles .
