Nepotism     nepotism is when a person in authority gives jobs to their relatives . it comes from the practice of mediaeval popes , appointing their nephews to important positions . `` nepote '' is italian for 'nephew ' . for instance , pope callixtus iii , head of the borgia family , made two of his nephews cardinals ; one of them , rodrigo , later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy , becoming pope alexander vi . alexander then elevated alessandro farnese , his mistress 's brother , to cardinal ; farnese would later go on to become pope paul iii . paul iii was a notorious nepotist . when elected pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews , aged 14 and 16 , as cardinals . the practice was finally ended when pope innocent xii issued the bull `` romanum decet pontificem '' , in 1692. the papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates , offices , or revenues on any relative , with the exception that one qualified relative ( at most ) could be made a cardinal . in the modern world , nepotism is thought to be wrong , and conflicts with the principle of merit , where the best person gets the job ( meritocracy ) . the argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like italy is that it damages the economy of the country , though that is difficult to prove .
