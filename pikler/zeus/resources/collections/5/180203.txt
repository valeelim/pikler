Tachyon     a tachyon is any hypothetical particle that can travel faster than the speed of light . the concept is an invention of o. m. p. bilaniuk , v. k. deshpande , and e. c. g. sudarshan in 1962 most scientists think that tachyons do not exist . einstein 's theory of special relativity says nothing can accelerate faster than the speed of light , the theory is that these particles would be constantly traveling faster than the speed of light . if a tachyon did exist , it would have an imaginary number as its mass . many scientists believe that if one tachyon existed in the universe at any time , then the universe would be overrun by more and more tachyons . tachyon is a device that will gain speed as it looses energy . so if a tachyon starts moving at some speed after some time it will come at a point where it will catch the speed of light and then it will continually gain speed . this is probably due to the fact that as they slow down , they increase energy . however , some scientists still believe that they could exist if they did not interact with normal matter .
