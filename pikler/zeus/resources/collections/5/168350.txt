Network bridge     a network bridge is a device which connects two parts of a network together at the data link layer ( layer 2 of the osi model ) . network bridges work similarly to network switches , but the traffic is managed differently . a bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side . this is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side . sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches . since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them , they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater . how is bridge different to a switch ? network switches and bridges are both layer 2 devices . they operate at the data link layer ( layer 2 ) of the osi reference model . network switches and bridges have many similarities and similar function . but switches are considered as superior devices than bridges . following are the major differences between network switchs and bridges . â€¢ packet forwarding in bridges are performed using software . packet forwarding in switches are performed using asics ( application specific integrated circuits ) .
