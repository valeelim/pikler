Standartenführer     standartenführer was a nazi party rank that was used in both the s.a. and the s.s.. first started as a rank in 1925 , in 1928 the rank became one of the first commissioned nazi ranks and was given to s.a. and s.s. officers who commanded units known as `` standarten '' which were between three hundred and five hundred men . in 1929 the rank of standartenführer was split into two ranks known as `` standartenführer ( i ) '' and `` standartenführer ( ii ) '' . this idea was given up in 1930 when both the s.a. and s.s. grew their rank systems to allow for more ranks . by the start of world war ii , standartenführer was widely used as both an ss rank and a rank of the s.a.. in the waffen-ss , the rank was considered the equivalent of an `` oberst '' ( colonel ) . the insignia for standartenführer was of a single oak leaf worn on both collars and was the first of the s.s. and s.a. ranks to be worn on both collars . from 1938 , newer ss uniforms featured the shoulder boards of a german oberst as well as the oak leaf collar patches .
