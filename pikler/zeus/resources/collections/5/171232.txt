Event horizon     `` for the movie , see event horizon '' in general relativity , an event horizon is a part of a black hole . imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness . the event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball . the space between the ball and the larger bubble would be the event horizon . if an object goes past the event horizon , it can never get away from it . light that is emitted from the side of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side . if an observer saw an object fall into a black hole , it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever . the reason this happens is because of the gravity of the black hole slows down time around it , making it look like the object will take an infinite amount of time to reach it . further reading . - `` the universe in a nutshell '' by stephen hawking
