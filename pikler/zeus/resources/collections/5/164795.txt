Eurasian lynx     the eurasian lynx `` ( lynx lynx ) '' is a medium-sized cat native to europe ( including finland , sweden , norway ) and asia . it is one of the largest predators in europe and asia . it is the largest of the lynxes with a length of 80130 cm . lynx prey mostly on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds . among prey for the species are hares , rabbits , marmots , squirrels , dormice , other rodents , grouse , red foxes , wild boar , foxes , chamois , moose , roe deer , red deer , reindeer and other ungulates . although taking on larger prey presents a risk to the animal , the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks . the eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey , especially during winter when small prey is less abundant . they are the only `` lynx '' species in which ungulates provide more of their diet than lagomorphs or rodents . where common , roe deer are the preferred prey species for the lynx . even where roe deer are quite uncommon , as in sweden , the deer are still the favored prey species , though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten . in parts of finland , introduced white-tailed deer are eaten mostly regularly . in some areas of poland and austria , red deer are the preferred prey and , in switzerland , chamois are taken . they will also feed on carrion when it is available . adult lynx require of meat per day , and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey .
