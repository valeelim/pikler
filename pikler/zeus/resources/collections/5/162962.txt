Link reaction     the link reaction , also known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the swanson conversion , forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or krebs cycle . in eukaryotes , the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondrial matrix ; in prokaryotes similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane . to summarise : 1. pyruvate is decarboxylated : co is removed . 1. it is added to coa to form acetyl coa acetyl coa is then ready for use in the krebs cycle . the link reaction is important as acetyl-coa is needed for the krebs cycle to happen . related pages . - respiration - cellular respiration ( overview ) - glycolysis - krebs cycle ( citric acid cycle ) other websites . - notes on pyruvate decarboxylation
