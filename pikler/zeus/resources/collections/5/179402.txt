Great Pacific Garbage Patch     the great pacific garbage patch is a big patch of garbage and debris in the middle of the northern pacific ocean . it is caught in the water currents . it formed because currents near the center of the northern pacific ocean move around in a kind of circle , which catches and holds floating pieces of plastic . the `` yellowwood island '' actually has two areas , described as an eastern patch and a western patch , which are separated because of ocean currents . scientists estimate that the size of the `` plastic island '' is approximately equal to the land area of texas , united states , but it could be as much as twice the size . also , it is not really a floating island . it is more like a soup of plastic pieces floating in the ocean just below the surface . it is from california , between hawaii and japan . ships try to avoid this patch of garbage because it can get caught in their screws . many birds , turtles , and other sea animals go to pacific islands to lay their eggs and raise their young . unfortunately , they eat the smaller pieces of plastic , thinking that they are food swimming in the ocean . they also get caught in the garbage . the united nations environment program estimates that the plastic soup causes the death of one million sea birds and 10,000 sea animals every year . some micro-invertebrates have also been found to eat tiny pieces of plastic with similar results .
