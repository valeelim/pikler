Vermiform appendix     in human anatomy , the appendix ( other names `` vermiform appendix '' ; `` cecal ( or caecal ) appendix '' ; `` vermix '' ) is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum ( or caecum ) . the caecum is a pouch-like part of the colon . the appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine . the term `` vermiform '' comes from latin and means `` worm-like in appearance '' . the appendix has no function in humans , but it can cause diseases ( like appendicitis ) . in us , it is a vestigial organ . darwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates . over time , humans have eaten fewer vegetables and have evolved . over thousands of years , this organ has become smaller to make room for the stomach . it is a vestigial organ which has degraded to nearly nothing in the course of evolution . herbivorous mammals such as the koala have large appendices , and usually other adaptations as well . cellulose , from plant cell walls , is hard to break down . the cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines as it is in humans , but is very long . this enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown .
