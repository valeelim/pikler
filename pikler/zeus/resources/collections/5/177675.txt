Runes     runes are very old letters which germanic people used before they started using latin letters in the middle ages . in its broadest sense , the word `` runes '' can mean any cryptic letters , but it usually means the alphabets used by scandinavian people from about the year 150 ce to the middle ages . the oldest of these is called the `` elder fuþark '' , used from about 150 to 800 ce . around the year 800 the runes changed into the `` younger fuþark '' , and these were used until about 1100 , when the latin alphabet replaced them . the anglo-saxon runes were used about the same time ( 400-1100 ) in britain . the scandinavian runes are called `` fuþark '' because the first six letters in the runic alphabet are ᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚨ ᚱ ᚲ ( f u þ a r k ) . the anglo-saxon runes are called `` fuþorc '' because they are a little different . runes are found carved into stones ( called runestones ) in many places in scandinavia ( denmark , norway and sweden ) , and in the british isles , iceland , greenland , the faroe islands and frisia . runes have been used for writing poems and eulogies , and they are still sometimes used to write ciphers . runes were also used by j. r. r. tolkien in his fantasy works , which were based on germanic mythology . because of their association with germanic mythology , runes were also used by the nazis to support a new mysticism and a romantic sense of germanic heritage . the rune ᚦ survived into the middle ages in the english language and to modern times in icelandic as the letter þ ( pronounced `` th '' as in `` thing '' ) . after the norman conquest , this letter was replaced by the letters `` th '' because it was unknown to the french-speaking normans . similarly , the letter ð ( pronounced `` th '' as in `` this '' ) was used in old english and is still used in icelandic , but it is from irish , not from the runes .
