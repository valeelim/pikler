Hot air balloon     a hot air balloon is a type of aircraft . it is lifted by heating the air inside the balloon , usually with fire . hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air ( it is less dense ) , which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it , just like a bubble of air in a pot of water . the greater the difference between the hot and the cold , the greater the difference in density , and the stronger the balloon will pull up . this means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day , or if the air inside the balloon is very hot . at higher temperature , the air molecules move faster . this causes the molecules to spread out and therefore hot air is less dense than cooler air . the hot air balloon is the oldest form of flying technology that can successfully carry people . the earliest use of hot air to make objects fly was made in ancient china . paper lanterns were sent into the air for signalling . the first hot air balloon to carry a person was made by the montgolfier brothers . on 19 september 1783 , they demonstrated their invention for king louis xvi and queen marie antoinette at the french court in paris . the passengers were a sheep , a duck and a rooster . they flew for 480 metres . the first flight carrying a person was on 15 october 1783. it carried jacques-etienne montgolfier . the balloon was attached to the ground by a rope . the first `` free '' flight , without being attached to the ground , was a few weeks later , on 21 november 1783. it carried marquis fran√ßois d'arlandes and pilatre de rozier . memes .
