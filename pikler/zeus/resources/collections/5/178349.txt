History of saffron cultivation     the history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3,000 years . the wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called `` crocus cartwrightianus '' . humans began choosing wild plants that had long `` stigmas '' . gradually , a form of `` c. cartwrightianus '' , `` c. sativus '' , came into being in the late bronze age crete . experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a 7th-century bc assyrian book about botany which was written in the time of ashurbanipal . since then , we have found evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4,000 years . the minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces as long ago as 1500â€“1600 bc , showing how it could be used as a medicine . later , greek legends told of sea voyages to cilicia , where adventurers hoped to find the world 's most valuable saffron . another legend tells how someone named crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus . ancient mediterranean peoples - including perfumers in egypt , physicians in gaza , townspeople in rhodes , and the greek `` hetaerae '' courtesans- used saffron in their perfumes , ointments , potpourris , mascaras , divine offerings , and medical treatments .
