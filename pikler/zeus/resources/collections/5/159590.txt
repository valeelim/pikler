LNWR electric units     during 1909-1922 , the london and north western railway embarked on a large-scale project to electrify their whole london inner-suburban network , encompassing the lines from london euston to watford and the north london railway from london broad street to richmond . this also included branch lines such as watford to croxley green ( where a depot was built to house the electric units ) , and links to what was to become the london underground network . for this reason , the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630v dc system , the electricity being generated at the lnwr 's own power station in stonebridge park . the first electric passenger trains ran in 1914 , limited to the west london line route ( willesden to earls court ) , and full services over the whole network did not commence until 1922 , work having been delayed by the first world war . the london , midland and scottish railway extended the network in 1927 by electrifying the branch to rickmansworth .
