SIMATIC     simatic is the name of an automation system which was developed by the german company siemens . the automation system controls machines used for industrial production . this system makes it possible for machines to run automatically . depending on the needed function of the machine you have to upload the right program on your simatic unit . this unit is kept in a control cabinet near the machine . simatic is similar to a digital computer which can store and run programs . the simatic also has some inputs and outputs . the running program on the simatic controls these inputs and outputs . both are connected by electrical wires with the machine . that makes a communication between the simatic and any machine possible . as the case may be the inputs and outputs are set on a “ high ” signal or on a “ low ” signal by the program . these are different electrical definitions . finally these signals are important if an action in the machine happens or not . example for different signals at the output to a motor :
