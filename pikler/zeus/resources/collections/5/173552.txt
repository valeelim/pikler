Polygar Wars     polygar war or palayakarar wars refers to the wars fought between the polygars ( `` palayakarrars '' ) of former madurai kingdom in tamil nadu , india and the british colonial forces between march 1799 to may 1802. the british finally won after carrying out long and difficult protracted jungle campaigns against the polygar armies and finally defeated them . many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over polygars made large part of territories of tamil nadu coming under british control enabling them to get a strong hold in india . the war between the british and kattabomman nayak of panchalankurichi palayam in the then tirunelveli region is often classified as the first polygar war . in 1799 , a brief meeting ( over pending taxes ) between kattabomman and the british ended in a bloody encounter in which the british commander of the forces was slain by the former . a price was put on kattabomman head prompting many polygars to an open rebellion . after a series of battles in the panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from thiruchirapalli , kattabomman was defeated but he escaped to the jungles in pudukottai country . here he was captured by pudukottai rajah ( after an agreement with the british ) and after a summary trial kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them , near kayattar fort , close to the town of kovilpatti and in front of fellow polygars too who had been summoned to witness the execution .
