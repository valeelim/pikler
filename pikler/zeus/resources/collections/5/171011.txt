Direct memory access     direct memory access ( usually shortened to dma ) is a technology used in computers and microprocessors . with it , certain hardware components can use parts of the main memory for their applications , without the need to ask the cpu . the cpu will request data from memory once and the dma will continue to fetch the data , freeing the cpu to do other work . this way , the cpu does not have to request every byte .
