Ionization     ionization is the physical process of giving or taking away electrons from an atom . that makes it an ion , because it now has an electric charge . in the process of ionization , an electrically neutral atom becomes either positively or negatively charged . some substances are easier to ionize than others . this depends on the ionization energy . ionizing radiation is a common cause , but ionization can also be done artificially .
