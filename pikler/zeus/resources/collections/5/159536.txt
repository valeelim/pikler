Suzerainty     suzerainty ( rp or rp ) ( ga ) is a situation in which a region or people is a tributary to a more powerful entity which allows the tributary some limited domestic . the more powerful entity in the suzerainty relationship , or the head of state of that more powerful entity , is called a suzerain . the term suzerainty was originally used to describe the relationship between the ottoman empire and its surrounding regions . it differs from sovereignty in that the tributary has some ( limited ) self-rule . a suzerain can also mean a feudal lord , to whom vassals must pay tribute . the word is often spelled `` suzerainity '' , though this has come to be considered incorrect . following india 's independence in 1947 , a treaty signed between the chogyal and the then indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru gave india suzerainty over sikkim in exchange for it retaining its independence . this continued until 1975 , when the sikkimese monarchy was abrogated in favour of a merger into india . sikkim is now one of the states of india .
