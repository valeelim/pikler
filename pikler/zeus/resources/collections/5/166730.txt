RFID     radio-frequency identification ( rfid ) is a technology to record the presence of an object using radio signals . it is used for inventory control or timing sporting events . rfid is not a replacement for the barcoding , but a complement for distant reading of codes . the technology is used for automatically identifying a person , a package or an item . to do this , it relies on `` rfid tags '' . these are small `` transponders '' ( combined radio `` receiver '' and `` transmitter '' ) that will transmit identity information over a short distance , when asked . the other piece to make use of rfid tags is an rfid tag reader . an rfid tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product , animal , or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves . some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader . most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics .
