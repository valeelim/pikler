Convex regular 4-polytope     in mathematics , a convex regular 4-polytope ( or polychoron ) is 4-dimensional ( 4d ) polytope which is both regular and convex . these are the four-dimensional analogs of the platonic solids ( in three dimensions ) and the regular polygons ( in two dimensions ) . these polytopes were first described by the swiss mathematician ludwig schläfli in the mid-19th century . schläfli discovered that there are precisely six such figures . five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the platonic solids . there is one additional figure ( the 24-cell ) which has no three-dimensional equivalent . each convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional `` cells '' which are all platonic solids of the same type and size . these are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion . the following tables lists some properties of the six convex regular polychora . the symmetry groups of these polychora are all coxeter groups and given in the notation described in that article . the number following the name of the group is the order of the group .
