Attosecond     an attosecond ( as ) is a very short period of time . it is equal to one quintillionth of a second ( or 0.000000000000000001 seconds ) . it can also be written as 10 seconds . because it can be hard to think about how short this period of time is , on this page is a list of descriptions of periods of time longer than 1 attosecond , but shorter than one femtosecond ( which is 10 seconds ) . this should help when thinking about periods of time that have different orders of magnitude . - 1 attosecond : it takes 1 attosecond for light to travel the length of three hydrogen atoms . - 1 attosecond : it takes 1 attosecond for an atomic nucleus to react when another particle hits it . - 150 attoseconds : it takes 150 attoseconds for an electron to circle the nucleus of an atom . - 320 attoseconds : it takes about 300 attoseconds for an electron to jump from one atom to another . related pages . - click this link for times shorter than one attosecond .
