Potassium nitrate     potassium nitrate is a chemical compound . it has the chemical formula kno . it contains potassium and nitrate ions . it is often called saltpeter . potassium nitrate is a colorless solid . it dissolves in water . it is a common source of the nitrate ion . potassium nitrate is a strong oxidizer . it decomposes to potassium nitrite and oxygen when heated . its ph is almost neutral . it burns with a lilac flame . it can be made by reacting ammonium nitrate with potassium hydroxide . it can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with ammonium nitrate . it might be made by reacting potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with nitric acid . saltpeter is a mineral form of potassium nitrate . it is only found in very dry areas . it is one of the few minerals that have nitrogen in them . potassium nitrate is used in explosives . oxygen from the air is the most common chemical that is used for oxidation , which is how most fires and explosions happen . some explosions will use up oxygen so quickly , though , that there is not enough to finish the reaction , and the explosion is not very strong . potassium nitrate replaces the need for oxygen and takes up much less space , which lets the explosion be stronger and faster . it is a main ingredient of gunpowder .
