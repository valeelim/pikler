Method (computer science)    method ( computer science ) in object-oriented programming , a method is a part of an object . a method allows the object to perform an action , whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value . an example is : public int getone ( ) { this syntax is the same in different programming languages such as java and c # . 1488 the codice_1 identifier means that this method is publicly accessible , that anyone is allowed to use this . in comparison , a method may be codice_2 or sometimes codice_3 , the latter of which means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method , and never a human user . a privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to , to edit it . this is used to give data security . the codice_4 identifier means that the return type is an integer value .
