De Wahl's rule    de wahl 's rule de wahl 's rule is a rule of word formation , developed by the linguist edgar de wahl and applied in a constructed language occidental ( known also as `` interlingue '' ) created by him . it is useful to create certain grammatical forms from others ( for example substantives from verbs ) . infinitives of verbs in the language occidental have usually the ending -ar or -er . the root is obtained in the following manner : 1. if , after removing -r or -er from the infinitive , the root finishes with a vowel , one should add -t or should change the ending y into t : `` crea/r , crea/t- , crea/t/or ; atiny/er , atin/t , atin/t/ion '' 1. if the ending consonant of the root is d or r , one should change it into s : `` decid/er , deci/s- , deci/s/ion '' 1. in remaining cases , with six exceptions , the removing the ending gives the demanded root : `` duct/er , duct- , duct/ion '' . these six exceptions are : 1 . `` ced/er , cess- '' 1 . `` sed/er , sess- '' 1 . `` mov/er , mot- '' 1 . `` ten/er , tent- '' 1 . `` vert/er , vers- '' 1 . `` veni/r , vent- '' and the verbs formed from them with prefixes .
