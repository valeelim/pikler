Origin of birds     the origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution . birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the mesozoic era . thomas henry huxley ( `` darwin 's bulldog '' ) , who was a comparative anatomist , made a study of this nearly 150 years ago . he compared the first fossil bird , `` archaeopteryx '' , with a small theropod dinosaur , `` compsognathus '' . they are two fossils from the same place and time : the solnhofen limestone in bavaria , germany . the strata come from the end of the jurassic period , about 144 million years ago . huxley 's papers on `` archaeopteryx '' , and the origin of birds , were of great interest then , and still are . he showed that the two fossils were almost identical , except for the front limbs and feathers of `` archaeopteryx '' . he united reptiles and birds under the title of sauropsida , and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs . all palaeontologists since huxley agreed that `` archaeopteryx '' evolved from reptiles , but many thought it was derived from an earlier type than dinosaurs . it took a long time before they agreed with huxley . almost all now think that early members of a group of small carnivorous dinosaur were ancestral to birds .
