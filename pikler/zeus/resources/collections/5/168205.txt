Adverse possession     adverse possession is a rule in property law . this rule says that if property is not being used by its owner while another person is using the property , this other person ( called an `` adverse possessor '' ) becomes the new owner of the property . to get these rights , the adverse possessor usually must use the property in the way a normal owner would do for a period of time , typically 20 years . in some jurisdictions , a form of adverse possession exists in which the adverse possessor ends up with sharing some rights to property with the owner , such as a right-of-way , instead of getting all the rights .
