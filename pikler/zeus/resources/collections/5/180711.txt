Anglerfish     anglerfish are marine fish that belong to the order lophiiformes . anglerfish are noted for having a bait-like appendage in front of their heads , right above their mouths . the appendage , which resembles a fishing pole , is attached to the end of the dorsal fin 's front spine , which is separated from the rest of the fin . anglerfish light their rod with bioluminescence ( their own light ) and then wiggle it to mimic a small marine animal . when other creatures come to eat the small marine animal , the anglerfish eats them . they are called anglerfish because they catch fish with bait , just like anglers , who use a rod and line ( rather than nets ) . one of the families , the ceratiidae , has an extraordinary mating system where the male actually fuses into the female . a mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested that anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the lower cretaceous , between 130 and 100 million years ago .
