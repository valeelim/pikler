Carnival of the Animals     the carnival of the animals ( french : `` le carnaval des animaux '' ) is a musical composition by camille saint-saëns . it is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children . saint-saëns wrote the `` carnival of the animals '' as a distraction while composing his `` symphony no . 3 '' . `` carnival '' was performed at a small gathering of friends . saint-saëns did not want the general public to hear it , because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces . he wanted to be thought of as a serious composer . just one movement was published during his lifetime : the famous swan movement for solo cello . the rest of the work was not performed until a year after saint-saëns ’ death . following a disastrous concert tour of germany in 1885–86 , saint-saëns withdrew to a small austrian village , where he composed the carnival of the animals in february 1886. it is scored for two pianos , two violins , viola , cello , double bass , flute ( and piccolo ) , clarinet ( c and b♭ ) , glass harmonica , and xylophone .
