Tar     tar is a sticky black liquid made of thick oil . it is a natural substance , oozing out of the ground in places like the la brea tar pits . usually it is made by heating coal inside a chemical apparatus . most tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production , but it can also be produced from petroleum , peat or wood . the `` destructive distillation '' of a ton of coal can produce 700 kg of coke , 100 litres of liquor ammonia , 50 litres of coal tar and 400 m of coal gas . it used to be one of the products of gasworks . tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic . it causes cancer because of its high benzene content . in low concentrations , however , tar is used as a medicine on the skin . tar kilns are dry destillation ovens , used in scandinavia for producing tar from wood . they were built close to the forest , from limestone or from more primitve holes in the ground . the bottom is sloped into an outlet hole , to allow the tar to pour out . the wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely , and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering . on top of this , a fire is stacked and lit . after a few hours , the tar starts to pour out , and continues to do so for a few days .
