German Confederation     the german confederation replaced the holy roman empire in central europe . after the holy roman empire fell , germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms . in 1815 , the congress of vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep france from trying to take them over , which it had already done once under napoleon . so the congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries , which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of europe . the problem was that the congress did not want to make them too strong , or they 'd start taking over other countries . so they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries , but they agreed to help defend each other , and in some ways acted like one big country . but the confederation was never strong enough to be able to attack another country . the german confederation lasted until 1866 , when the members fought each other . the winners formed a new north german confederation . in 1871 after winning the franco-prussian war , otto von bismarck , chancellor of prussia , combined all the countries of germany into the german empire .
