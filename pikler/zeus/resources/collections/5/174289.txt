Toxic assets     the term toxic asset is a nontechnical term used to describe certain financial assets when their value has fallen significantly and when there is no longer a functioning market for these assets , so that they can not reasonably be sold . this term became common during the financial crisis that began in august 2007. toxic assets played a major role in that crisis . when the market for such assets ceases to function , it is described as `` frozen '' . markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007 , and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008. several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic-asset markets . the value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions , and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets . banks and other , major financial-institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices , since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets , making them appear insolvent .
