ALPHA Collaboration     the alpha collaboration is a group of physicists from about 11 universities who work together ( or `` collaborate '' ) to try to trap neutral antimatter . the neutral antimatter they are working to trap is antihydrogen . this is the antimatter version of hydrogen , the first atom in the periodic table . antihydrogen , like hydrogen , has two oppositely charged particles . hydrogen has a proton and an electron , and so antihydrogen would have an antiproton and a positron . a positron is the common name for the antielectron . the alpha collaboration has its experiment at cern in geneva in switzerland . cern is the only place in the world that can provide `` slow '' antiprotons that can be easily captured by alpha . alpha then brings these antiprotons into contact with positrons and form antihydrogen . antihydrogen has , like many atoms and especially hydrogen , a small magnetic dipole moment . a dipole moment is another way of saying that the atom behaves a bit as if it was a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole . normally such small magnets are attracted to other magnets . however , some atoms in some states behave such that they are repelled by magnetic fields . this means that the atoms could possibly be trapped in space by making a minimum of the magnetic field . alpha is trying to do just that with antihydrogen . by a clever arrangement of magnets , alpha has a so-called magnetic minimum trap , in which antihydrogen may be trapped .
