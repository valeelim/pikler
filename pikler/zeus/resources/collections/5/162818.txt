Chromalveolate     chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by thomas cavalier-smith as a refinement of his kingdom chromista , which was first proposed in 1981. the origin of the chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont ( cell with two flagella ) and a red alga . this union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c. in cavalier-smith 's classification , the chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes . the classification has been challenged .
