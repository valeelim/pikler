Urolagnia     urolagnia ( also urophilia , undinism ) is a paraphilia where people gain sexual pleasure from urine and/or urination . the term has origins in the greek language ( from `` ouron '' , urine , and `` lagneia '' , lust ) . those who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people , or being urinated on . the practice of drinking the urine is called urophagia , although this word also applies to non-sexual situations . people who practice urolagnia may participate in urolagnia as part of a domination and submission scene , though not all sexual activity involving urine is so . these activities are often described with the slang terms `` golden showers '' , `` water sports '' , or `` piss play '' . urolagnia is sometimes associated with omorashi , but omorashi is usually described in western culture using terms such as `` bladder desperation '' or `` panty wetting '' . in new zealand , publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia , whether in print or online , is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison .
