Xylophone     a xylophone is a musical instrument that is part of the percussion family . it belongs to the group which is often called `` pitched percussion '' or tuned percussion because it can play different pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it creats . ( notes ) . xylophones have bars which are made of wood . people play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet ( a kind of drum stick ) . each piece of wood is a different length , so they play different notes when they are hit . the bars are arranged like the keys of a piano . underneath the bars there are long tubes , called resonators , which make the sound last longer . the modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in africa and asia . it came as a folk instrument to countries in central europe . it was first used in an orchestra by humperdinck in his opera `` hansel and gretel '' . it was also used by saint-saÃ«ns in his `` danse macabre '' where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton , and in his `` carnival of the animals '' where it is supposed to sound like fossils .
