Logical disk     a logical disk is a concept from computing . logical disks provide a certain amount of space to store data . unlike real ( called `` physical '' ) hard disks that can be touched , logical disks can take this storage space from different locations . common locations where this can be taken from : - a disk partition on a hard disk - a logical volume from a logical volume manager - a combination of hard drives ( as in a raid system , which contains the physical disks ) - a storage area network - the main memory of a computer ( this can be used for temporary files , which can be deleted when the system shuts down ) the disk is described as `` logical '' because it does not actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right . when ibm first released the magnetic disk drive in the 1956 ( ibm 305 ) a single drive would be directly attached to the using system , with each disk managed as a single entity . as the development of drives continued , it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using raid technology evolved . this means that more than one physical disks are `` raid-ed '' together to produce a single logical disk .
