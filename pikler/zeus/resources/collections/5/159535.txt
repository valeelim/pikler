British Rail Classes 485 and 486     the british rail class 485 ( or 4vec ) and british rail class 486 ( or 3tis ) electrical multiple units were originally built for the london electric railway from 1923-31 as their 'standard ' tube stock . they were purchased by british rail in 1967 and transported to the isle of wight to work 'mainline ' services on the newly electrified ryde to shanklin line . at the time the units had already worked for over forty years on the london underground , but their introduction allowed the final steam locomotives on the line to be withdrawn .
