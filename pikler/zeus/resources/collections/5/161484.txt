Graphics Processing Unit     a graphics processing unit ( short : gpu ) is a processor whose task is calculating the graphical output for monitors . it is mostly used in computers and video game systems . the gpu can be put on the motherboard or on separate video cards . today , there are generally two types of images which gpu has to calculate , which is also called rendering . most applications like the operating system ’ s desktop ( except e.g . windows vista ’ s aero desktop ) or office applications the gpu has to render two dimensional ( 2d ) pictures . modern gpus are so powerful that there is no difference in 2d performance between low-cost and expensive gpus . the minor part of today ’ s applications use 3d pictures to simulate three-dimensionality . examples for such applications are computer and video games or applications for design and technical construction ( cad ) . the 3d acceleration performance of gpus differs greatly . generally , more expensive gpus can render faster than low-cost ones . today ’ s market leaders for gpus are amd ( under the label of ati ) , intel and nvidia . there are some smaller manufacturers whose market share is rather small , e.g . matrox and s3 graphics . they are concentrating on niche products . some of them have focused on research only instead of producing real products , e.g . powervr and xgi technology inc .
