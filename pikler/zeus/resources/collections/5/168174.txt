Polymerization     polymerization is the process in which small molecules , called monomers , join chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecules , called a polymer . the monomer molecules may all be alike , or they may represent two , three , or more different compounds . usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical properties—such as elasticity , high tensile strength , or the ability to form fibres—that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules . often , many thousands of monomer units are in a single molecule of a polymer . the formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes , such as crystallization , in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces . alkene molecules can react with themselves , by adding polymerization to form 'plastic ' or polymeric materials . when a catalyst ( a substance that speeds up chemical processes ) is added to the reaction , or it is heated under pressure , unsaturated alkenes link together , when the double bond partially breaks .
