Hippocampus     the hippocampus is part of the mammalian brain , and belongs to the limbic system . humans and other mammals have two , one in each side of the brain . the hippocampus is under the cerebral cortex . it is important in spatial memory and navigation , and helps turn short-term memory into long-term memory . the hippocampus is named after the `` seahorse '' because its shape is similar . in alzheimer 's disease , the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage ; memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms . people with extensive , bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia the inability to form or retain new memories . the different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus . it has often been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology . long-term potentiation ( ltp ) , a neural mechanism for storing memory , was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus . the connection of hippocampus with memory was made by a famous report . this gave the results of the destruction of the hippocampi by surgery ( an attempt to relieve epileptic seizures ) . the unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde and partial retrograde amnesia . the patient could not form new memories of events after his surgery , and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery . however , he did remember events from many years earlier , right back to his childhood .
