Ma'loula     ma'loula ( , `` ma ‘ lūlā '' , from the aramaic word ܡܥܠܐ , `` ma ‘ lā '' , meaning 'entrance ' ) is a town in syria dominated by speakers of western neo-aramaic . with two other nearby towns bakh'a and jubb'adin , it is the only place where the western branch of the aramaic languages is still spoken . the town is located 56 km to the northeast of damascus , and built into the rugged mountainside , at an altitude of more than 1500 meters . the distance and geological features only aided the longevity of this linguistic oasis for over one and half thousand years . however , modern roads and transportation , as well as accessibility to arabic-language television and print media - and for some time until recently , also state policy - have eroded that linguistic heritage . as of 2005 , the town has a population of 2,000. religiously , the population consists of both christians and muslims . for the muslim inhabitants , the legacy is all the more remarkable given that they were not arabized , unlike most other syrians who like them were islamized over the centuries but also adopted arabic and shifted to an `` arab '' ethnic identity .
