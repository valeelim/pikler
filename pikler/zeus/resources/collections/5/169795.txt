Ice cube     ice cubes are small , cube-shaped parts of ice . these pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks . ice cubes are used in mixed drinks , when the drink has the words `` on the rocks . '' ice cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer . many freezers also have an icemaker . icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin . after that , they can be put in a glass . ice cubes are also made commercially and sold in big amounts . these ice cubes are usually cylindrical , and might have holes through the center . commercially made ice cubes are very clear , as the water does n't have much air dissolved in it . ice cubes can also be crushed into different-shaped flakes , which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better . crushed ice is also used when it needs to be made fast , because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles . american physician and humanitarian john gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air . his refrigerator made ice , which he hung from the ceiling in a basin . gorrie is the creator of ice cubes , even though he was not trying to cool drinks . instead , he used the ice to cool the room 's temperature . during that time , people thought that bad air quality made people sick . so , to help treat sickness , he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms .
