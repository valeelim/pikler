Bridle     a bridle is a piece of equipment used to direct and control a horse . the bridle includes the headstall ( that goes around the horse 's head ) and holds a bit that goes in the mouth of a horse , and also the reins that are joined to the bit . a headstall without a bit uses a noseband to control a horse , is called a hackamore , or a bitless bridle . there are many different designs with many different names , but all use a noseband that puts pressure on sensitive areas of the animal 's face in order to provide direction and control . a bridle as said in a dictionary is a piece of equipment that helps contral a horse . in the poem `` the man from snowy river '' by banjo paterson it says `` he never drew the `` bridle '' till he landed safe and sound , '' this is talking about the same thing .
