Stamp Act     a stamp act is a law that puts a tax on the transfer of some documents . those that pay the tax get an official stamp on their documents . many products have been covered by stamp acts such as playing cards , patent medicines , cheques , mortgages , contracts and newspapers . the items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty , although other methods with annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common . stamp acts have been made common in many countries , like australia , china , canada , ireland , malaysia , israel , the united kingdom and the united states . the money raised by the tax , called stamp duty , was first used in the netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax . however , it has more been used in great britain and its colonies . the stamp act of 1765 was upsetting to some american colonists and was one of the causes of the american revolutionary war .
