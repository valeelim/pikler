Domain Name System     the domain name system ( dns ) is a system used to convert a computer 's host name into an ip address on the internet . for example , if a computer needs to communicate with the web server `` example.net '' , your computer needs the ip address of the web server `` example.net '' . it is the job of the dns to convert the host name to the ip address of the web server . the dns uses the udp port 53 or tcp port 53. it is defined mainly by rfc 1034 and rfc 1035. there are later rfc which define changes to the system . domain names are made up of one or more parts , or `` labels '' that are joined and kept separate by dots , such as codice_1 . - the label on the right is the `` top-level domain or tld . '' for example , the top-level domain of codice_1 is codice_3 . - the next one along is the subsection ( or subdomain as is the proper word ) of the tld . in codice_4 this is codice_5 . - the furthest to the left is the codice_6 which is a subdomain of codice_5 . the codice_6 means the site is part of the world wide web ( not the same as the internet )
