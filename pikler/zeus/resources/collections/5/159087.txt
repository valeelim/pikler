Street prostitution     street prostitution is a form of prostitution . sex workers working in street prostitution work on the street , rather than in brothels . this form of sex work can be more dangerous than working in a brothel , but it also offers some benefits : - the prostitutes have more control over who they want to have sexual intercourse with - very often , the prostitutes do not have to share the money they earn ; for example with owners of brothels . people working in this area are often regarded as the lowest type of prostitutes , but street prostitution also allows for people to only work occasionally , for example when they need money to buy drugs . some of the problems associated with street prostitution are : - there are little to no controls over the prostitutes ; they might be younger than legally allowed ( having sex with a child is a crime ) , they may also have various sexually transmitted diseases , for example aids . - the clients of the prostitutes are often defrauded ; that means that the prostitute does not do what was agreed upon , or that prostitutes want a higher price to do what was agreed .
