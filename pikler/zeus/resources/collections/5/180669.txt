Cymbal     cymbals ( pronounce like the word “ symbol ” ) are percussion instruments . they are discs made of copper , bronze or a special alloy . they look rather like saucepan lids , but in the middle they jut out a little and they have straps there that pass through a hole . there are two ways of playing cymbals . one way is to use a pair of cymbals that are the same . the player holds one cymbal in each hand , holding them by the strap . he then bangs the cymbals together . there are many ways of doing this depending on the sort of sound that is wanted . for example , a very quiet sound can be made by rubbing the edges of the cymbals together . a very loud sound can be made by hitting them together as the arms form a circle , and letting the cymbals vibrate for a long time by holding them in the air . another way of playing the cymbal is to use just one cymbal , and to hang it on a stand . it can then be played with a beater , stick or wire brush . it can be hit at the edge , in the middle , or half way between , depending on the sound that is wanted .
