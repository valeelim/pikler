Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge     the pacific electric railroad bridge or southern pacific railroad bridge is a historic railroad bridge in torrance , california usa . it spans across torrance boulevard at bow street , a short distance west of western avenue . it was once part of the north/south torrance to san pedro spur line of the pacific electric railway . the line was the railroad 's first interurban line to san pedro . after splitting off to the east from the union tool company plant which was once a short distance south of the bridge , the line ended at a columbia steel steel mill ( later united states steel ) by running up and over the east/west torrance local line . it is the only part of the pe which crossed itself this way . this was due to the area 's geography . if the railroad simply built a spur off of the main line , it would have meant that trains trying to get to the steel mill would have faced too steep a climb . the steel mill has since been torn down to make way for the national headquarters of american honda motor company , but the remaining part of the torrance line - which once had two separate tracks - was rebuilt in 2003 and is still in use for local train runs by the union pacific railroad . gone too are the pacific electric 's torrance shops at the western branch of the split , now the site of an industrial park and which still receives trains on the local line .
