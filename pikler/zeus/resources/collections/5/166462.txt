Gavotte     the gavotte was a folk dance , performed by the peasants in the brittany region of france . later it was popular in french and english courts in the 17th and 18th centuries . it was especially popular in the french courts of king louis xiv . the music for a gavotte has a four beat feel , with upbeats on beats three and four . to dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern , with each step followed by a hop . singers often provided the accompaniment , though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin , a drum , bagpipes or shawm , a forerunner of the modern oboe . the gavotte later became a musical , rather than a dance piece . in the baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form . when composers began writing suites , six short dance based pieces , the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue . the best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by j.s.bach .
