Post Office Protocol     in computing , the post office protocol version 3 ( pop3 ) is an application-layer internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to get e-mail from a remote server over a tcp/ip connection . pop3 and imap4 ( internet message access protocol ) are the two most widely accepted internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval . almost all modern e-mail clients and servers support both . while not yet an official standardized mail protocol , a proposal has been outlined for a pop4 specification , complete with a working server implementation . the proposed pop4 extension adds basic folder management , multipart message support , as well as message flag management , allowing for a light protocol which supports some popular imap features which pop3 currently lacks . no progress has been found in the pop4 specification since 2003. related requests for comments ( rfcs ) . - rfc 1939 – post office protocol - version 3 ( std 53 ) - rfc 1957 – some observations on implementations of the post office protocol ( pop3 )
