Eid al-Adha     eid al-adha ( `` ‘ īdu l- ’ aḍḥā '' ) `` festival of sacrifice '' or `` greater bairam '' is a religious festival celebrated by muslims all over the world . it is when muslims sacrifice a goat , sheep , cow or a camel , sending part of the meat to poor people as a donation . it marks the end of the pilgrimage or hajj for the millions of muslims who make the trip to mecca each year and pray 5 times a day . they like to tell allah what they are thinking and hope for him to help them , and remember ibrahim and ishmael 's courage and devotion to god . the festival is to celebrate ibrahim 's ( abraham ) willingness to sacrifice his son , ishmael , because allah told him to do so in a dream . at the final moment , as he was swinging his age to kill his son god told an angel to switch a lamb instead of his son , and this act of sacrificing a lamb is copied by muslims all over the world on eid . ibrahim was tempted by satan not to listen to god , and ibrahim drove satan away by throwing pebbles at him . this is also still commemorated by muslims during hajj .
