Cilia     a cilium ( plural `` cilia '' ) is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells . cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body . there are two types of cilia : 1 . `` motile '' cilia , which beat against fluid outside the cell . 1 . `` non-motile '' , or `` primary cilia '' , which typically serve as sensory organelles . in eukaryotes , cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia . eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella , although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length . motile cilia are found on protist ciliates like `` paramecium '' . they are how `` paramecium '' moves around . they are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans , such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs . non-motile ( or `` primary '' ) cilia usually occur one per cell ; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile `` primary cilium '' . in addition , examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose :
