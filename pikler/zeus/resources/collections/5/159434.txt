True Cross     the true cross is the name given to parts which are believed to be from the actual cross upon which jesus was crucified . empress helena ( c.250â€“c.330 ad ) was the mother of constantine , the first christian emperor of rome . christianity was legalised through the roman empire in 312. according to the early writers , like socrates scolaticus , helena travelled to the holy land , founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor . she is said to have discovered the resting place of the three crosses used at the crucifixion of jesus and the two thieves - dismas and gestas - who were executed with him . through a miracle it was revealed which of the three was the `` true cross '' . many churches have fragmentary remains which are by tradition alleged to be those of the `` true cross . '' their authenticity is not accepted by all those of the christian faith . many christians question the accuracy of the reports surrounding the discovery of the `` true cross '' . the acceptance and belief of that part of the tradition that pertains to the early christian church is generally restricted to the catholic and orthodox churches . the medieval legends where it came from are not the same in catholic and orthodox tradition . these churches honour helena as a saint , as does also the anglican communion .
