Fairness     fairness is the concept in sociology , law and generally in society , that something should be equal and not be a contradiction to accepted standards . it 's related to justice in both the legal and sociological sense . fairness is also treating others equally or in a way that is considered right or reasonable . fairness can mean sameness where everything is kept equal by being the same . fairness can also mean `` deservedness '' meaning a person gets what they deserve . people who are successful by working hard get what they deserve . people who are lazy and do not work hard get less . fairness can also be based on need . those who have more should give more to help others . this is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other . judges , lawmakers , referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions . fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination . in the united states fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity . equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity . if all the horses in a race start from the same point , the horse that wins is the fastest . equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities . one should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense . for example , in the game of golf , when playing a skilled golfer , a less skilled golfer may be given a `` handicap '' ( extra points ) at the start of the game . this is to help make the final score fair for both players .
