Denial-of-Service attack     a denial-of-service attack ( dos ) is when someone arranges for multiple computers to open a website . this then stops the ability for everyone else to access the website as there is too much traffic flowing to it . people who have slower internet connections , such as dial-up , are affected more by attacks . there are different kinds of dos attacks : - flood attack - this is when a system gets too much internet traffic ( people trying to connect to it ) . the traffic uses bandwidth and the internet servers slow down and eventually stop . - logic and software attacks - internet packets are sent that are supposed to use bugs in the software or system . these attacks are easier to defend against because firewall or software patches usually correct the problem . - distributed denial-of-service attack - this type of attack uses either flood attacks or logic attacks , but it uses many different computers under the attacker 's control ( see botnet ) . this type of attack is one of the most often used , and usually against company websites . this type of attack is often the hardest to prevent , track , and stop .
