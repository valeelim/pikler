Dendrite     dendrites are the branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons and pass the signals into the cell body ( or soma ) . a cell may have hundreds or thousands of dendrites , but may have only one axon . the dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma , whereas the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber . a dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse , which is a very narrow gap between the two cells . when electrical impulses ( action potentials ) reach the end of an axon , the signal must pass over a synapse again . there are two types of synapse : chemical or electrical . if it 's a chemical synapse , the active potential triggers the release of special chemicals called neurotransmitters from the axon . these chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite , where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell . the movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current , which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal . if the current is positively charged , it will make the soma ( which is normally negatively charged compared to its surroundings ) become more positive . if the current is negatively charged , then it will make the soma even more negative . if a strong enough positive charge builds up in the soma quickly enough ( caused by the dendrites receiving lots of signals from axons ) , then it will set off a chain reaction in a part of the soma called the axon hillock . the axon hillock is the place where the soma connects to the axon . the chain reaction that begins in the axon hillock is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse .
