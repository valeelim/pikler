Similarity (psychology)    similarity ( psychology ) similarity in the area of cognitive psychology refers to things or ideas that people put together in the same groups , or categories , in their minds . many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar . one important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling . scientists will , for example , ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other . then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave . for instance , a person might say that `` cat '' and `` dog '' are similar words , so a good computer model should be able to take the word `` dog '' and respond with the word `` cat '' in a list of similar words . computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text ( called a corpus ) . once a model can respond with the correct ( similar ) words , then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar .
