Pinnacle Point Man     the pinnacle point man is a name given to a group of homo sapiens believed to have lived in a cave at pinnacle point 164,000 years ago . this cave is near mosselbaai/mossel bay on the south coast south africa . discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces , and used ochre to paint their bodies . the discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45,000 years ago . it also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a `` large cultural leap '' . because the african climate became cool and dry , the food resources were reduced dramatically . this was the reason why the pinnacle point man moved to the shores . there , they could eat marine creatures like mussels , snails and crabs . these men also used amazingly subtle tools . microliths were mounted on wood shafts the startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team , including the palaeoanthropologist curtis marean from the `` institute of human origins '' of the arizona state university and three graduate students of the `` school of human evolution and social change '' . they came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods . they added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet . the cause for this evolution was the climate change . it is the first evidence that mankind was able to this . the report in the magazine nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found . this is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70,000 years ago .
