Installation (computer programs)    installation ( computer programs ) installation means to put a program on a computer so that the computer can run it . most programs are stored in special ways to make them smaller , or to gather all the different pieces of a program up into one big piece . before it can be used , though , the program needs to have these changes undone . some programs also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on , so while it is installing , it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later .
