Australopithecus anamensis     australopithecus anamensis is a species of `` australopithecus '' . the first fossilized specimen of the species , though not recognized as such at the time , was a single arm bone found in pliocene strata in the kanapoi region of east lake turkana by a harvard university research team in 1965. the specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to `` australopithecus '' and dated about four million years old . little additional information was uncovered until 1987 , when canadian archaeologist allan morton ( with harvard university 's koobi fora field school ) discovered fragments of a specimen sticking out of a partially eroded hillside east of allia bay , near lake turkana , kenya . six years later the london-born kenyan paleoanthropologist meave leakey and archaeologist alan walker excavated the allia bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid , including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee ( `` pan troglodytes '' ) but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human . in 1995 , meave leakey and her associates , taking note of differences between `` australopithecus afarensis '' and the new finds , assigned them to a new species , `` a. anamensis '' , deriving its name from the turkana word anam , meaning `` lake '' .
