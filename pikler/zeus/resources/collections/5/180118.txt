Wiener schnitzel     wiener schnitzel ( `` viennese schnitzel '' in german , where `` schnitzel '' means a without bones ) is a traditional austrian dish and is a popular part of viennese and austrian cuisine , consisting of a thin slice of veal coated in breadcrumbs and fried . in austria the dish is traditionally served with a lemon slice , lingonberry jam and either potato salad or potatoes with parsley and butter . while the traditional wiener schnitzel is made of veal , it is now sometimes made of pork , though in that case it is often called `` schnitzel wiener art '' ( germany ) ( viennese style schnitzel ) or `` wiener schnitzel vom schwein '' ( austria ) ( viennese schnitzel from the pig ) to differentiate it from the original . in austria , the term `` wiener schnitzel '' is protected by law , and any schnitzel called by that name has to be made from veal . the dish may have originated in milan , northern italy , as `` cotoletta alla milanese '' , and may have appeared in vienna during the 15th or 16th century . according to another theory , it was introduced in 1857 by field marshal radetzky , who spent much of his life in milan . the term `` wiener schnitzel '' itself dates to at least 1862 .
