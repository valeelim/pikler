Steamboat     a steamboat ( also called a steamship or steamer ) is a ship that uses a steam engine or steam turbine to move . at first , these were paddle steamboats . some had a paddle wheel on the back . others had two wheels on the sides . most went down rivers . from about 1836 , marine propellers , invented by josef ressel are used . claude françois jouffroy d ’ abbans built the first working steamship in 1783. there were many steamboats in the 19th century in the united states and other countries . however , the first steamboat was built by john fitch in 1787. it had many paddles . fitch tried to make money from the steamboat , but could not do so . he died in 1798 , and did not live long enough to see robert fulton become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money . in 1807 , fulton built a steamboat that could travel from new york city to albany in 32 hours . steamboats became much faster later in the 19th century . after the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare , as the marine propeller gave more speed and burned less fuel . during the 20th century , marine diesel engines largely replaced steam propulsion .
