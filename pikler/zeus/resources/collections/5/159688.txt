SR Class 4DD     conceived by oliver bulleid for the southern railway 's dartford commuter route , the two 4dd electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in britain . the upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges . the 4dd was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated ( the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance ) . the compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome . also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door . to obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought , it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten .
