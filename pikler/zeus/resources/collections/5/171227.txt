Beta particle     beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted by some radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40 or carbon-14 ( which becomes nitrogen-14 ) . the beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation sometimes called beta rays . henri becquerel and ernest rutherford discovered beta rays in the 1890s . beta particles are made by beta decay . when scientists write it in an equation , they are use the greek letter beta ( β ) . there are two forms of beta decay , β and β , which make the electron and the positron . β is a single electron that has a negative charge of -1. both beta decays also turn a neutron into a proton .
