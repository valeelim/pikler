Pure mathematics     pure mathematics is a field of mathematics . other fields of mathematics are driven and motivated by applications , they can be used to solve `` real-world '' problems , for example in physics or engineering . in contrast , pure mathematics studies abstract ideas or it tries to make proofs more beautiful or easier to understand . examples . - generalizing theorems : finding a more general theorem can lead to a better understanding of mathematics . - generality can also shorten proofs : there no longer is a need to handle special cases . this makes proofs shorter , simpler , and easier to follow or explain .
