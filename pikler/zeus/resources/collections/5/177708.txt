Visual cortex     the visual cortex is a part of the brain that allows vision . it is relatively thin â€“ between 1.5mm and 2mm in humans . in monkeys and apes the visual cortex take up much of their brain . physically , the visual cortex is at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe . david hubel and torsten wiesel did research on the visual cortex for many years . they won the 1981 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system . 1. their work in the 1960s and 1970s was on how the visual system developed . they worked on parts of the visual cortex of the brain which get signals from the right or left eye . 1. their work describing how signals from the eye are processed by the brain to generate edge detectors , motion detectors , stereoscopic depth detectors and colour detectors . these are building blocks of the visual scene . research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats , ferrets , rats , mice , or monkeys . alternatively , signals can be recorded outside the animal by eeg , meg , or fmri . these techniques gather information without invading the brain .
