Proper motion     proper motion is the name for the way the stars seem to slowly move `` relative to each other '' when seen from earth . the movement is caused by the fact that all stars ( including the sun ) are moving through space at hundreds of kilometres per second . however , because they are so far away , it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved , and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference . because of this , for a long time , most people thought that the stars did not move at all . even the ancient greeks , who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move , such as stellar precession , did not discover proper motion ( although they probably suspected it ) . proper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when edmond halley noticed the stars sirius , arcturus and aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that hipparchus had drawn around 130 bc . however , even after more than 1,800 years , they had moved less than half a degree .
