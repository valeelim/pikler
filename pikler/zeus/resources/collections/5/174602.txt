Mutualism     mutualism is a relationship between two organisms in which both benefit . it is a type of symbiosis which improves the biological fitness of both parties . the two organisms usually come from widely different types , often from different phyla or even kingdoms . the term is not used for any cooperation between animals of the same species . pierre-joseph van beneden ( 18091894 ) introduced the term into evolutionary biology and ecology in the 1870s . examples : - mycorrhiza : relationship between roots of plants and fungi . - rhizobia : relationship between roots of plants and bacteria which promotes nitrogen fixation . - many relationships between insects and flowering plants , where the insect gets food , and the plant gets transfer of pollen . - gut flora : many relationships between gut bacteria and herbivores . the bacteria digest cellulose , and get a regular supply of nutrients . almost no animal can digest cellulose by itself . - lichen : an extremely close relationship between algae and fungi . probably a mutualistic relationship , but less clearly .
