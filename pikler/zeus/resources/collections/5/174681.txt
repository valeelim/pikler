Canadian English     canadian english is the type of english that is used by canadians . it is like american english in terms of vocabulary , but its grammar is like that of british english . canadian english is generally taught in schools using british ways of spelling , such as colour , flavour , and so on . however , the word themselves are usually american , in part because canadians watch a lot of american tv shows and listen to a lot of american pop music . rarely , the british form of words may be replaced with american forms , such as plow , program , and so on . the main exception to this rule is terms related to cars and the auto industry . because canada 's auto industry has always been dominated by american firms , canadians use american words and spelling for such terms . canadians and americans spell the outer rubber portion of a wheel as `` tire '' instead of `` tyre '' , put `` gasoline '' or `` gas '' in their vehicles instead of `` petrol '' , store items in the `` trunk '' instead of the `` boot '' , and may drive a `` truck '' instead of a `` lorry '' .
