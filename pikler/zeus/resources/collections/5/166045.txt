Carbon copy     carbon copy is produced when a sheet of carbon paper is placed between two sheets of writing paper . as a pen , pencil , or typerwriter element presses down to write on the first sheet , exactly the same writing appears on the second sheet . the same is true if the two sheets of paper and carbon paper are placed into a typerwriter to generate two copies of a document . people would type `` cc '' at the bottom of the paper to show where the carbon copy was sent . when people began using email , the carbon copy ( cc ) shows that the same email is sent to more than one person .
