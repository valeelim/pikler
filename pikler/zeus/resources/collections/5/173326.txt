Cashew     the cashew is a tropical tree in the flowering plant . the plant is native to northeastern brazil . it is now widely grown in tropical climates for its cashew nuts ( see below ) and cashew apples . cashew nuts are a popular snack and food source . cashews , unlike other oily tree nuts , contain starch to about 10 % of their weight . this makes them more effective than other nuts in thickening water-based dishes such as soups , meat stews , and some indian milk-based desserts . many southeast asian and south asian cuisines use cashews for this unusual characteristic , rather than other nuts . because the shell of the cashew nut is toxic , it is removed before it is sold to consumers .
