Rule against perpetuities     the rule against perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts . in general , the rule states that a gift of a will ( or a trust ) will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now , and will not be able to be known , by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive ( including children in their mother 's uterus but not yet born ) at the time the gift was created . for example , if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given `` to the children of her children when they graduate from college '' this would be not be enforced by a court . it would not be enforced because one ( or more ) of her children 's children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman 's death has died . the purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for `` perpetuity '' ( a very long time ) . the courts ( and many people in society ) do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift-giver . first , this would result in a waste of the courts ' time and resources . second , it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift . if a gift in a will violates the rule against perpetuities , the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it .
