Probable prime     in mathematics , particularly number theory , a probable prime is a whole number that is likely to be prime by having passed a probabilistic test such as fermat 's primality test . probable primes may be composite , but the tests are designed so they are really unlikely to be composite . these probabilistic tests are easier to do than tests that actually guarantee primality , and the composite probable primes are useful too in encryption that uses prime numbers . other websites . - the prime glossary â€“ probable prime - the prp top 10000 ( the largest known probable primes )
