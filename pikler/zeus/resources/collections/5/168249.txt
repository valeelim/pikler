Audiobook     audiobooks or `` talking books '' are books that have been read aloud by someone and recorded . nowadays , they are usually recorded onto compact discs ( cds ) , although some older editions remain on cassette tapes . ( this is why many texts in this format were first called books-on-tape . ) more recently , audiobooks have been available to download from the internet ( free or paid-for ) and pre-recorded on special mp3 players . while audiobooks can be used by anyone , they serve as a main resource for people who are blind or can not see well . many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks . the original author may or may not be involved in choosing the narrator for the reading . some authors often use the same reader for many books , so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style .
