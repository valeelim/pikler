Digital subscriber line     dsl ( for digital subscriber loop or digital subscriber line ) is a way to transmit digital data over a telephone line . telephone lines only transmit a limited spectrum of signals ( roughly 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz , for voice ) . this means that the other frequencies can be used to transmit data . the data is combined or multiplexed onto the telephone line . at both ends , a device called a `` splitter '' ( or dsl filter ) separates the data part and the telephony part . dsl provides the physical layer , the lowest layer of the osi model that is used for understanding how the different parts of a telecommunications network can connect with each other . in this model , atm or ethernet are two communications protocols used as the data link layer ( layer 2 ) and ip is used at the network layer ( layer 3 ) . while most dsl signals are multiplexed for transmission onto telephone lines , dsl can also be used without a telephony line ( or multiplexed onto something else , for example cable tv ) .
