Alternation of generations     the term alternation of generations is used to describe a process in the life cycle of some eukaryotes . it describes an alternation in forms which occurs in plants and some protists . one form is diploid , with 2 '' n '' chromosomes : the sporophyte . the other form is haploid with only one set of chromosomes : the gametophyte . both forms are multicellular . in sexual reproduction , organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosomes and a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes . in animals the body ( soma ) is usually diploid , while the haploid stage is only the gametes . in other eukaryotes alternation of generations may occur . it means that both the diploid and the haploid phases are multi-cellular organisms . the classic example is the mosses , where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte , and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophyte . the two forms often occur together , as shown in the illustration on the right the term `` alternation of generations '' refers only to the sexual cycle ; organisms often have asexual reproduction as well . the term should not be confused with life cycle stages in animals , which may look very different , but where all cells have two sets of chromosomes .
