Stem cell     stem cells are cells of the body ( somatic cells ) which can divide and become differentiated . when an organism grows , stem cells specialize , and take specific functions . for instance , mature tissues like skin , muscle , blood , bone , liver , nerves , all have different types of cells . because stem cells are not yet differentiated , they can change to become some kind of specialized cells . organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells . stem cells are found in most , if not all , plants and animals . they divide and differentiate into a range of cell types . research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the 1960s . the two broad types of mammalian stem cells are : embryonic stem cells , and adult stem cells , which are found in adult tissues . in a developing embryo , stem cells can differentiate into `` all '' of the specialised embryonic tissues . in adult organisms , stem cells act as a repair system for the body , replenishing specialized cells , but also maintain the normal turnover of blood , skin , and intestinal tissues .
