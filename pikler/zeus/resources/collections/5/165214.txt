Fullerene     a fullerene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon , in the form of a hollow sphere , ellipsoid , or tube . spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs , and they resemble the balls used in association football . cylindrical ones are called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes . they are usually made in the form of a hollow ball or tube . the fullerene was found in 1985 by robert curl , harold kroto and richard smalley at the university of sussex and rice university , and was named after buckminster fuller because his famous geodesic domes are similar in shape . fullerenes are made by the heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gases such as helium or argon .
