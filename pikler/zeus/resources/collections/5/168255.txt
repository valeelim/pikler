Parsec     a parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy . it is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years , or just under 31 trillion kilometres ( about 19 trillion miles ) . this is from the definition : a parsec is the distance from the sun to an object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond . distances measured in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within the same star system . surveying provides an everyday example of parallax . go outside and look at a distant object . hold your hand out with one finger raised and close one eye . line up your finger so it covers the object from view . then close that eye and open the other without moving your arm . now , move your finger to block that eye 's line of sight . the two positions your finger was at can be used to find the distance from the object . this is what a survey crew does to figure out land plot boundaries . the mathematical technique used in the calculation is trigonometry.a parsec is so large that if you could see that far that you would be looking in to the past . you are looking 3.26 years in the past because it takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away .
