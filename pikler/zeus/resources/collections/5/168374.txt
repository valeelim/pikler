Hospice     a hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from . many people staying in hospices have cancer or aids . people who stay in hospices are expected to die soon , but sometimes they get better . hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them . hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible . hospices have doctors , nurses , and other people who go to patients houses , nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine . the hospice movement was started in england in the 1950s by a nurse named dame cicely saunders . the word dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the queen of england made her a female knight . a different nurse named florence wald brought hospice medicine to the united states because she worked with dame cicely saunders and liked what she did .
