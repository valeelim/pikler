Simplex     in geometry , a simplex ( plural : `` simplices '' or `` simplexes '' ) , sometimes called `` n-simplex '' is the `` n '' -dimensional analogue figure of the triangle . a triangle is a 2-simplex . the 0-simplex is the point , the 1-simplex is the line segment ( line connecting two points ) . the 3-simplex is the tetrahedron , and the 4-simplex is the pentachoron . a regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope . a regular `` n '' -simplex may be made from a regular ( `` n '' - 1 ) -simplex by connecting a new vertex to all the other vertices . all the vertices have the same length .
