Bakerloo line     the bakerloo line is a line of the london underground , coloured brown on the tube map . it runs partly on the surface and partly at deep level , from elephant and castle in south-east to wealdstone in north-west of london . the lines serves 25 stations of which 15 are underground . it is the seventh busiest line on the network and platforms are 110 metres long . `` note : for the former stanmore branch of the bakerloo line , see the jubilee line article . '' the extension to camberwell was a plan to extend the bakerloo line . the project was to start at the late 1940s , but they cancelled it for an unknown reason . then in the 21st century , they revised the extension plan and proposed it again . so far , nothing has been agreed . the 1940s version of the extension had two stations . one rumour of why they cancelled the project was because camberwell was quite a bad location to do further extensions . between 1917 and 1982 , bakerloo line trains continued along the dc line past harrow & wealdstone to watford junction . these stations continue to be served by london overground .
