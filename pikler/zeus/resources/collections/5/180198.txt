Tambourine     the tambourine is a well-known percussion instrument . it is often used in large orchestras but can also be used in marching bands and other music groups . the tambourine looks like a small hand-held drum , but in addition to the skin ( drumhead ) which can be hit in various ways by the other hand or fingers , there are also small pairs of jingles - like tiny cymbals - which are fixed in slots around the frame . this is the usual kind used in orchestras . however , tambourines come in many shapes and forms . some are made without a skin , particularly for use in schools . they are also found in various forms in many parts of the world . the tambourine came to europe through the arabs who brought it to italy and spain . they can be used in classical music as well as in pop music and rock music . the tambourine is usually held in the hand . the jingles can be made to sound by hitting the frame of the instrument with the other hand , or by shaking the instrument in various ways . very often the player will hold the instrument high in the air . this not only looks good , but it can also be heard well . the other hand can tap rhythms on the skin which makes it sound like a drum as well as making the jingles sound . it can be hit by the knuckles , or with the finger tips , or the flat of the hand or the back of the hand . it can also be hit against the side of the leg . a good player with a good tambourine can sometimes create a nice effect with a `` thumb roll '' . this is done by making the tip of the thumb slightly wet and then moving it fast along the edge of the skin so that the thumb bounces very fast .
