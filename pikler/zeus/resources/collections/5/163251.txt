Homo ergaster     homo ergaster , also called `` african `` homo erectus '' '' , is an extinct chronospecies of `` homo '' which lived in eastern and southern africa during the early pleistocene , between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago . there is still disagreement on the subject of the classification and ancestry of `` h. ergaster '' . however , it is now widely accepted as the direct ancestor of asian `` homo erectus '' , `` homo neanderthalensis '' , `` homo heidelbergensis '' , and hence `` homo sapiens '' . it is one of the earliest members of the genus `` homo '' , possibly ancestral to , or sharing a common ancestor with , `` homo erectus '' . some paleoanthropologists consider `` h. ergaster '' is just the african variety of `` h. erectus '' . there are asian fossils of `` h. erectus '' , which was the first human species to spread from africa . the name `` ergaster '' means `` workman '' , in reference to the acheulean hand axe industry developed by the species . the species ' period in eastern and southern africa coincided with the first part of the pleistocene , the cooling of the global climate and the start of the ice ages . these events would have shrunk the rainforests in africa , and expanded the savannahs and open forests to which `` ergaster '' was well suited .
