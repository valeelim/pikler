Ecdysozoa     the ecdysozoa ( including cycloneuralia ) are a group of protostome animal phyla . this is a taxon above the level of phylum . it includes the arthropoda ( insects and crustaceans ) , nematoda , and several smaller phyla . they were first defined in 1997 , based mainly on phylogenetic trees taken from 18s ribosomal rna genes . a large study in 2008 strongly supported the ecdysozoa as a clade , that is , a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants . the group is also supported by morphological characters , and includes all animals that shed their exoskeleton ( see ecdysis ) .
