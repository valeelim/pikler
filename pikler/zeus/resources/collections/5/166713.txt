Empty set     in mathematics , the empty set is the set that has no things in it . for example , consider the set of integer numbers between two and three . since there are no integer numbers between two and three , the set of integer numbers between them is `` empty '' . any statement about all elements of the empty set is considered true . for example , all integers between two and three are greater then seven . this only makes sense because there are no integers between two and three .
