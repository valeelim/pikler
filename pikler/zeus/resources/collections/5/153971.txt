Lemming     lemmings are small rodents , usually found in or near the arctic , in tundra biomes . the lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the arctic . the lemmings have very short tails . they live underground in summer . because the top soil freezes in the winter , they can not burrow underground then , so they live under the snow during the colder months . they eat plants and roots . if they find plenty of food , they will have extra large families that year . in a year with plenty of food , millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra . the owls and foxes have more food than they can eat . they will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings . however , the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings . they rush across the tundra looking for food , and are eaten by predators or starve to death . many lemmings leave to find a new home , when they run out of food and space . soon , millions of lemmings decide to follow the crowd . they go across the arctic as a huge mass . foxes and owls kill many of them . some drown when trying to swim across rivers . it is often said that they fall off cliffs or even commit mass suicide , but that is an urban legend created by a disney documentary ( `` white wilderness '' , 1958 ) in which someone actually pushed the lemmings over the edge .
