Algorithm     an algorithm is a fancy to-do list for a computer . algorithms take in zero or more inputs and give back one or more outputs . a recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it tells you what you need to do step by step . it takes inputs ( ingredients ) and produces an output ( the completed dish ) . the words 'algorithm ' and 'algorism ' come from the name of a persian mathematician called al-khwārizmī ( persian : خوارزمی‎‎ , c. 780–850 ) . informally an algorithm can be called a `` list of steps '' . this is nice , but it does n't say much about algorithms . formally , an algorithm is a precise list of operations that can be done by a turing machine . algorithms can be written in regular english , but it takes a long time to do so . instead , algorithms are written in pseudocode , flow charts , or programming languages . algorithms are usually meant to be run by a computer . there is usually more than one way to solve a problem . there may be many different recipes to make a certain dish which looks different but ends up tasting the same when all is said and done . the same is true for algorithms . however , some of these ways will be better than others . if a recipe needs lots of complicated ingredients that you do not have , it is not as a good as a simple recipe .
