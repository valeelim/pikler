Réaumur scale     the réaumur scale is a way of measuring temperature . the unit associated with the scale is called `` réaumur '' , named after the physicist rené-antoine ferchault de réaumur who created it in 1731. the unit is usually abbreviated `` ré '' , sometimes `` r '' . the two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water , both at normal pressure . there are 80 degrees between those values , one degree réaumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference . réaumur used ethanol for his thermometers . thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury . this is because , when heated , ethanol expands faster than mercury . there is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures - it is non-linear . ethanol has a very low boiling point , which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications . soon , instrument-makers used other liquids , and then chose `` 80°ré '' as the boiling point of water .
