Methane hydrate     methane hydrate , also called methane ice or methane clathrate , consists of methane , which is enclosed in frozen water . the water molecules completely surround the methane . methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine ( ocean ) geosphere . in 1971 , it was first discovered in black sea . methane hydrate is often described as “ methane gas surrounded by ice. ” although this description is easy to understand , it 's not completely accurate . a more accurate description would be that methane hydrate consists of `` methane gas trapped inside cage-like crystal structures made up of water molecules . '' these “ cages ” have a size of atoms and molecules , far too small to see with the naked eye . under normal temperature and pressure , one litre methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres methane gas . methane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earth 's layers , and then broken down by microorganisms and the earth 's heat . the process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth , except that it occurs deep below the earth 's surface . the organisms which produce methane by a process of fermentation are the methanogen archaea .
