Endosymbiosis     endosymbiosis occurs when a symbiont lives inside the body or the cells of another organism . it is a very widespread phenomenon in living things . examples are : - rhizobia : nitrogen-fixing bacteria which live in root nodules on plants of the pea family . - singly-celled forams which include a single-celled alga inside the cell . this is 'facultative ' , which means they may or may not do it . a more far-reaching version is `` idioplastic '' endosymbiosis . here , the foram consumes the alga , but keeps its chloroplasts in working order . - green algae inside marine polychaete worms . - single-celled algae inside reef-building corals . - gut flora ( often flagellates ) inside the digestive systems of insects and vertebrates which digest plant cellulose . these are 'obligate ' symbionts , which means the host must have them . - lichen : fungus+alga or bacterium . - mycorrhiza : fungal hyphae and roots of trees . endosymbiont theory is the idea that eukaryote cells arose in evolution by the fusion of previously free-living protists ( prokaryotes ) . the theory was first suggested by the russian botanist mereshkovsky in 1905. the nature of lichens had been worked out ; mitochondria and chloroplasts had been seen in cells , and their similarity to bacteria noted . the theory was initially dismissed , but was re-examined when more was known about cell biology .
