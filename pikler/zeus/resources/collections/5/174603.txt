16-cell     in four dimensional geometry , a 16-cell , is a regular convex polychoron , or polytope existing in four dimensions . it is also known as the hexadecachoron . it is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the swiss mathematician ludwig schläfli in the mid-19th century . conway calls it an orthoplex for `` orthant complex '' , as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes . the hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross-polytopes , which exist in all dimensions . as such , its dual polychoron is the tesseract ( the 4-dimensional hypercube ) . it is bounded by 16 cells , all of which are regular tetrahedra . it has 32 triangular faces , 24 edges , and 8 vertices . the 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes . the eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are ( ±1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , ±1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , ±1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 0 , ±1 ) . all vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs . the schläfli symbol of the hexadecachoron is { 3,3,4 } . its vertex figure is a regular octahedron . there are 8 tetrahedra , 12 triangles , and 6 edges meeting at every vertex . its edge figure is a square . there are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge .
