Evolutionary psychology     evolutionary psychology is a branch of psychology which investigates behaviour which has evolved . it is similar in this respect to ethology , which has always used ideas from evolutionary biology . it seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations , that is , functional products of natural selection or sexual selection . evolutionary psychology usually focuses on behaviour most people share . some of the more common areas evolutionary psychology is focused on are sex , and social behaviour . events like violent behaviour need explanation in evolutionary terms . evolutionary psychology is related to other fields of science like sociobiology , social psychology , and sociocultural anthropology . evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behaviour is the result of adaptations which evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments . the adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general field of psychology . evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations . this includes our ability to infer others ' emotions , discern kin from non-kin , identify and prefer healthier mates , and cooperate with others . they report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide , intelligence , marriage patterns , promiscuity , perception of beauty , bride price and parental investment .
