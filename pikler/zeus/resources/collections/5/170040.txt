Minor planet designation     minor planet designations are number-name combinations given by the minor planet center , a part of the iau . they are used for dwarf planets and small solar system bodies such as asteroids , but not comets . they are given to a body once its orbit is secured , and are unrelated to provisional designations , which are given when an object is found . the two parts of a formal designation are - a number , historically given in a similar order to the order that it was found , now given only after the orbit is secured - a name , either the name assigned by the astronomer who found it , or , more commonly , the provisional designation . it looks like this : codice_1 , for example ( 90377 ) sedna or . the brackets are now often removed , as in 90377 sedna , according to what the astronomer wants . in practice , however , for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry , and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation : sedna , .
