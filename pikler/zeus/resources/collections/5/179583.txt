Claret     claret is a type of french red wine . it is also known as bordeaux after its region of `` appellation d'origine contrôlée '' . this is the french system which certifies where food and drink comes from . the wine from bordeaux was a dark rosé spiced drink in the middle ages . that 's why it was called `` claret '' , from the french `` clairet '' . it changed to the present dry dark red in the 18th century . the wine industry in bordeaux has economic problems . it faces fierce competition from new world wines . also , the french drink less wine nowadays . in 2004 , exports to the u.s. dropped 59 % in value over the previous year . sales in britain dropped 33 % in value during the same period . the uk , a major market , now imports more wine from australia than from france . chilean red wine is also extremely popular now . probably there is no single reason for these changes . bordeaux wines are almost always blends from two or more types of vine . many new world wines are single vine strains such as cabernet sauvignon , merlot , pinot noir , syrah ( shiraz ) , and the white wine grapes chardonnay and sauvignon blanc . bottles labelled by type of grape ( and so by taste ) has caught on with the public . also , the cheaper french wines are much more expensive when exported . all wines and spirits into countries like the uk are heavily taxed . a cheap french ( or spanish or italian ) wine which might sell in at home fore under £1 , will sell for £4 or more in the uk . customers have evidently decided that wine from elsewhere is a better deal .
