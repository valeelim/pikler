Cone cell     cone cells or simply cones are special photoreceptor cells in the retina . they react to light and work best in relatively bright light . cone cells are less sensitive to light than rod cells . rod cells are more sensitive to light , but can not tell colors apart . human eyes usually have different types of cone cells . that way , cones allow the brain to tell colors apart . their reaction to stimuli is faster than that of the rod cells . for this reason , they can perceive finer details , and more rapid changes in images . humans usually have three kinds of cones , with different photopsins . each photopsin has different response curves to light , and so responds to color in different ways . this gives trichromatic vision . being color blind means a lack of one or two types of cone . in a publication done in 1935 , osterberg thinks that there are about 6 million cone cells in a human eye .
