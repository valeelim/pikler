Implied repeal     the doctrine of implied repeal is an idea in english constitutional theory which states that an earlier law can not be used to amend or repeal a later law . if two laws about the same subject say different things , it will be the more recently enacted law that says what must be done . this doctrine is expressed in the latin phrase `` leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant '' - more recent law overwrites earlier law that says differently .
