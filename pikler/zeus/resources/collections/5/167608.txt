Order theory     order theory is a field of mathematics . it concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set . given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order . it is also possible to say that a certain element `` comes before '' another one , for that relation . another way to say this is to say that one of the two is `` smaller than '' the other . for a specific set to be ordered it must be : `` reflexive : `` each element of the set is within a relation with itself . `` anti-symmetric : '' if a and b are in relation , and b is also in a relation with a , then a must be equal to b . `` transitive : `` if a and b in a relation , and b is in a relation with c , then a and c must be in a relation .
