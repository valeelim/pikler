Tragedy of the commons     the tragedy of the commons was an article published by garrett hardin in the journal `` science '' in 1968. it describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse , even if no one wants to . for example , even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy , it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons , like washing and throwing away rubbish . each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water , but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing . this may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps . the idea was not hardin 's , but a person named william forster lloyd who wrote about it in 1833. in those days herders often grazed cows on common land . lloyd pointed out that each cow added benefit to its owner but damaged the land overall for all herders by overgrazing .
