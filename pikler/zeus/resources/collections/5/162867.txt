David Rosenhan     david l. rosenhan ( 1929 â€“ february 6 , 2012 ) was an american psychologist . he was best known for the rosenhan experiment . this was a study which looked at how valid psychiatry diagnoses were . rosenhan got his bachelor of arts degree from yeshiva university . at columbia university in 1953 he earned his master 's degree . five years later , he earned a ph.d in psychology . rosenhan was an expert on psychology and law . in 1973 rosenhan published `` on being sane in insane places '' . this was one of the most-read pieces of writing in psychology . the article talks about the rosenhan experiment . the experiment was that eight people with no history of psychopathology would try to get into twelve psychiatric hospitals . all of these people were allowed in , and were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder . psychiatrists then tried to cure the people using psychiatric medicines . all eight were allowed to leave within 7 to 52 days , but only when they had said that they accepted the illness they had been diagnosed with . later in the study , a research and teaching hospital challenged rosenhan to run a similar experiment with its own diagnoses and rules for letting people in to the hospital . psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their hospital . at least one staff member thought that 83 out of the 193 new patients were actors . in fact , rosenhan sent no actors . the study showed that the ways diagnosis was done was very inaccurate in telling people with mental disorders and people without mental disorders apart . the paper made a lot of controversy . some people are not sure of how valid and credible the study was , but say that psychiatric diagnoses need to be improved .
