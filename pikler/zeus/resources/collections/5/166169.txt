Isabella of France     isabella of france ( 1295 â€“ 22 august 1358 ) was the queen consort of england as the wife of edward ii of england . she was also regent of england for her son edward iii of england during his minority . until 1325 she was a traditional queen consort . after that time she had one of the worst reputations of any english queen . she was the daughter of philip iv of france and joan i of navarre . as the daughter of two monarchs she was destined to be a queen . while france and england had a common culture , political relations between them were tense . to ease this situation pope boniface viii arranged two marriages . this double-alliance was between edward i of england and marguerite of france and also the infant edward ii marrying isabel . in 1299 the marriage between edward i and marguerite took place . the marriage between edward ii and isabella would wait until she was old enough . they were married in 1308 at boulogne-sur-mer in france . at age 12 the young bride was already considered a great beauty . since his father 's death a year earlier , the 24 year old edward ii was now king . but he showed very little interest in isabella . his first act as king was to recall the exiled piers gaveston . one chronicler wrote `` he had home his greatest love .
