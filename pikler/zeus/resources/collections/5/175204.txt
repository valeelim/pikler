Fiat money     fiat money is legal tender , or currency ( bank notes and coins ) , which has value only because a government says so , and because the people using it maintain faith in it having value . fiat money such as us dollars can be used as an exchange for goods and services . the point is that other kinds of money have been used . fiat money differs from commodity money and representative money . commodity money is based on a `` good '' , often a precious metal such as gold or silver , which is desired or has other uses . representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good . in that case , the gold stays in a bank , and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used . why might a good be used at all ? one reason is that governments can not just make it . it is said that this stops inflation because , with fiat money , governments can just print more . some economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit . this means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries .
