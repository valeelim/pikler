Viking Age     the viking age was a period in northern european and scandinavian history from the eighth to eleventh centuries . scandinavian vikings , also called norsemen , explored the oceans and rivers of europe through trade and warfare . the vikings also reached iceland , greenland , newfoundland , and anatolia . some vikings are believed to have settled at l'anse aux meadows , an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of the island of newfoundland , canada , at a place they called vinland . in england the viking age began dramatically on june 8 , 793 , when norsemen destroyed the abbey on lindisfarne . monks were killed in the abbey , thrown into the sea to drown , or carried away as slaves along with the church 's wealth . the viking devastation of northumbria 's holy island shocked and alerted the royal courts of europe . `` never before has such an atrocity been seen , '' declared the northumbrian scholar alcuin of york . more than any other single event , the attack on lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the vikings for the next 1100 years . in the 1890s scholars outside scandinavia began to rethink the achievements , artistry , technological skills and seamanship of the vikings .
