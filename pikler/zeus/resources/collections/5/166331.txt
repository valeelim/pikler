Kenyanthropus platyops     kenyanthropus platyops is an extinct hominid species discovered in lake turkana , kenya in 1999. it was by justus erus , who was part of meave leakey 's team . the fossil 3.5 to 3.2 million year old . it has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright . teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms . leakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus . others classify it as a separate species of `` australopithecus '' , australopithecus platyops , and still others interpret it as an individual of `` australopithecus afarensis '' . if some palaeoanthropologists are correct , `` kenyanthropus '' may not even represent a valid taxon . the specimen is so distorted by matrix-filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence .
