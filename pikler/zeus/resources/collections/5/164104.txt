Food web     a food web is similar to a food chain but larger , and it is a diagram that combines many food chains into one picture . food webs show how plants and animals are connected in many ways to help them all survive , unlike food chains that just follow one path . for example , a tree produces acorns - this is called the producer . mice , squirrels , and insects eat these acorns and because there are many mice , the weasels , snakes and raccoons have food . with insects in the acorns , other predators would be attracted ( like skunks or opossums ) and therefore , foxes , hawks or owls could all find food . food webs can be effected in many ways considering the urban areas of major countries are taking no action and care . it uses arrows to show the energy relationships among organisms
