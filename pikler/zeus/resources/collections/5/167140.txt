Violone     the violone ( pronounce : `` vee-o-loh-ne '' ) is a very big string instrument that used to be used in the 16th and 17th centuries . it is like a double bass , but it belongs to the viol family . the name `` violone '' means `` large viol '' . it was really a `` double-bass viola da gamba '' . it usually had six strings , and the fingerboard had frets ( like a guitar ) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes . the bow was held underhand ( with the palm of the hand facing up ) . the violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing renaissance and early baroque music music . the instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones . the violone was the last member of the viol family to die out . when the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins , violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass . bach used the violone in his cantatas . eventually the violone was no longer used , and the double bass was used instead . the double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths .
