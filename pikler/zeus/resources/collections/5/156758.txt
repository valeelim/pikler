Lysosome     a lysosome is a cell organelle . they are like spheres . they have hydrolytic enzymes which can break down almost all kinds of biomolecules , including proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , lipids , and cellular debris . they contain more than 50 different enzymes . by convention , lysosome is the term used for animal cells . in plant cells , vacuoles do similar functions . with a wider definition , lysosomes are found in the cytoplasm of plant and protists as well as animal cell . lysosomes work like the digestive system to break down , or digest , proteins , acids , carbohydrates , dead organelles , and other unwanted materials . they break up larger molecules into smaller molecules . those smaller molecules can then be used again as building blocks for other large molecules .
