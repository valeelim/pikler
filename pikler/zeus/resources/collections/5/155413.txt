Simple Network Management Protocol     simple network management protocol ( snmp ) is a part of the internet protocol suite . snmp is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems . it consists of a set of standards for network management , including an application layer protocol , a database schema , and a set of data objects . snmp exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems , which describe the system configuration . these variables can then be queried ( and sometimes set ) by managing applications . in common snmp usage , there are a number of systems to be managed , and one or more systems managing them . a software component called an `` agent '' ( see below ) runs on each managed system and reports information via snmp to the managing systems . snmp agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables ( such as `` free memory '' , `` system name '' , `` number of running processes '' , `` default route '' ) . but the protocol also allows active management tasks , such as modifying and applying a new configuration .
