Harem     harem means the women and the place where they live in a polygynous household . most men are not allowed in there . the word `` harem '' comes from the turkish word `` haram '' , meaning a sacred , forbidden place . harems were meant for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men . these women would be educated so that they were ready to appear in public as a royal wife . no forms of sexual activity took place inside of harems . in the west people thought that harems ( especially those in the ottoman empire ) were brothels full of women who gave themselves up to please rich men . in modern terms the word maybe used to describe a group of admiring women attracted to one man .
