National Fuel Gas     - utility - pipeline and storage - exploration and production - energy marketing - timber national fuel gas was incorporated in 1902 and is based in williamsville , new york . the utility division sells natural gas or moves natural gas from one part of the country to another . the pipeline and storage division provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for related and non-related companies . the exploration and production division prospects for and extracts natural gas and oil from the ground . the energy marketing division markets natural gas to industrial , commercial , government , and residential customers . the timber division markets wood from its new york and pennsylvania forests , and it owns two sawmills in northwestern pennsylvania , to cut wood into useful sizes and treat it with chemicals to make it last longer . national fuel gas was one of the first gas utility companies in the united states , and so they have been the first to create some new technologies . engineers at the company discovered that empty underground gas fields could be used to store gas that has been taken from the ground somewhere else . thus , the first such storage facility in the us was set up at zoar field , about forty miles south of buffalo . this turned out to be a good financial decision for nfg in the 1940s and 50s , when increased demand for natural gas led to long pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states . nfg could then buy huge amounts of cheaper summer gas from the southwest , pipe it to the new york storage fields , pump it down into the ground , then take it back out when demand and prices went up in the winter months .
