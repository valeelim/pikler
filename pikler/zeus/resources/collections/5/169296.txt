Unicycle     a unicycle ( or simply cycle ) is a pedal vehicle . it is like a bicycle , but it has only one wheel . it has a seat and pedals , but no chain or gears . there is no handlebar , it is steered by gripping the seat with the legs and twisting the body . a rider keeps their balance by moving their arms , and controlling their speed . it is usually used for acting and performing . a unicycle is more expensive than a cheap bicycle , because unicycles are far less common . there are two kinds of unicycles ; giraffe unicycles and traditional unicycles . giraffe unicycles are much taller than traditional unicycles , and use a chain so that the performer 's legs do not have to stretch very far . giraffe unicycles are mostly used by performers in circuses . unicycles are often used while the performer is simultaneously juggling or plate spinning . to do this , performers usually rock back and forth on the unicycle . this is called `` idling '' . it lets the performer pay attention to what they are doing in their hands , instead of to the ground in front of them . to `` idle '' a unicycle , performers usually press one foot down , anchoring it in the bottom position of the wheel . this foot both provides support and completes the rocking motion that is necessary to keep the unicycle balanced .
