RNA virus     rna viruses are viruses that use rna as their genetic material . in humans , well-known rna viruses are those that cause sars , influenza or hepatitis c. viruses that are not rna viruses use dna for their genome and are called dna viruses . viruses have a classification system , invented by david baltimore , a nobel prize winner . the rna viruses in the baltimore system are classified as : - iv : ( + ) ssrna viruses ( + strand or sense ) rna ( e.g . picornaviruses , togaviruses ) - v : ( − ) ssrna viruses ( − strand or antisense ) rna ( e.g . orthomyxoviruses , rhabdoviruses ) - vi : ssrna-rt viruses ( + strand or sense ) rna with dna intermediate in life-cycle ( e.g . retroviruses ) `` sense '' in rna means `` ready to make proteins , as messenger rna does '' . `` antisense '' in rna means `` complementary to messenger rna '' . in complete complementarity each nucleotide is across from its opposite number , so antisense rna can produce sense rna . another system is run by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ( ictv ) . it uses terms from the familiar linnaean taxonomy , like orders and families .
