Emerald ash borer     the emerald ash borer ( `` agrilus planipennis '' or `` agrilus marcopoli '' ) is a shiny green beetle native to asia . it made its way into the united states by accident and has since been spread to eleven states and to the border with canada . the beetle is an invasive species , and a serious pest which destroys ash trees . it has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout north america . adults lay eggs in crevasses in the bark . larvae burrow into the bark after hatching and consume the living tissue of cambium and phloem . this causes death within two years . the average emerging season for the emerald ash borer is early spring to late summer . females lay around 75 eggs , but up to 300 from early may to mid-july . the borer 's life cycle is estimated to be one year in southern michigan but may be up to two years in colder regions . huge efforts have been made to slow down its spread , but nothing has worked so far . parasitoid wasps from asia are being released , and a fungus which kills insects is being tried .
