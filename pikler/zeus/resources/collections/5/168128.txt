Tevatron     the tevatron was a giant particle accelerator in illinois that was used by scientists to make protons go very fast , almost the speed of light in some cases . scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of . the tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the fermi national accelerator laboratory ( also known as fermilab ) , just east of batavia , illinois . it was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . the tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km ( 3.90 miles ) ring to energies of up to 1 tev , hence its name . the tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $ 120 million ( $ today ) and has been regularly upgraded since then . ( the 'energy doubler ' , as it was known then , produced its first accelerated beam — 512 gev — on july 3 , 1983 . ) the `` main injector '' was the most substantial addition , built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $ 290 million . the tevatron was shut down on september 30 , 2011 .
