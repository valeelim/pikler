Paraceratherium     paraceratherium is an extinct genus of mammal , a large hornless rhinoceros . it lived in eurasia during the late oligocene epoch of the tertiary period , ( 34â€“23 million years ago ) . `` paraceratherium '' is one of the largest land mammal known . its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils . the size of adults was about tall , about in length . estimates of its weight have varied greatly . it was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees . it had a long , low , hornless skull and long frontal and nasal bones . its front teeth had a single pair of incisors in either jaw . they were round , pointed , and so large that they looked like small tusks . the upper incisors pointed straight downwards , while the lower ones jutted outwards . the upper lip was evidently extremely mobile . the neck was very long , the body big and strong , and the limbs long and thick , column-like . its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils . estimates have been based on skull , teeth , and limb bone measurements . however , the known bone elements are from individuals of different sizes . all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations . this resulted in weight estimates from 11 to 20 tonnes . its maximum height has been estimated as at the shoulders . its length was around from front to back . as explained , such figure are only approximations . these figures are of the largest of the three species in the genus .
