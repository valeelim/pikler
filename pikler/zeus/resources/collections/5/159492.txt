Ctenophore     the phylum ctenophora , the comb jellies , is a phylum of marine invertebrates . they are part of the plankton , and there are also pelagic species . the phylum includes the sea gooseberry ( `` pleurobrachia pileus '' ) and venus ' girdle ( `` cestum veneris '' ) . the phylum was grouped with cnidaria ( jellyfish ) in the former coelenterata phylum . ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals . even though they look like jellyfish , they are zoologically not related to them . they lack the characteristic nematocysts ( stinging cells ) , but have `` colloblasts '' , sticky cells that snare small victims . they have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb , hence ctenophore = comb-bearer . ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous system . there are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world 's oceans , from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea . although there are a few benthic species , most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide . a few species , such as the sea gooseberry , native to the north sea , have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen 's nets , while of other species only a few examples are known . the fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult . for this reason their lifespan is not known , but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age .
