Feud     a feud ( ) ( also called blood feud or vendetta ) is a long-running argument or fight between parties . in most cases it involves whole familles or clans . people are seen as guilty , not because they did something , but because they were seen with other people ( who are considered guilty ) . this is called guilt by association . feuds start because one party thinks they were attacked , insulted , or otherwise harmed by the other party . intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge , which causes the other party to feel the same way . the dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence . this ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully . feuds frequently involve the original parties ' family members and/or associates . they can last for generations . up to the early modern period , feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments . the state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds . once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force , feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation .
