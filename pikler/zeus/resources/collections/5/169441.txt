Dinoflagellate     the dinoflagellates are a large group of flagellate protists . about half are photosynthetic , the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists . the ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called 'algae ' ; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called 'protozoa ' . they have been classified as an order , a class and a phylum by different authors . active research is being done on their relationships . most are marine plankton , but they are common in fresh water habitats as well . their populations are distributed depending on temperature , salinity , or depth . the group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species . about 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described . the latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species , which includes marine , freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates . some dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae : endosymbionts of marine eukaryotes , and animals such as anthozoan corals . these reef-building corals largely depend on them . other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include jellyfish , clams , foraminifera , sea slugs i.e . nudibranchs , and also ciliates and radiolaria .
