Castanets     castanets are percussion instruments which come from spain . they are often used in an orchestra . castanets are hollowed-out wooden shells . a hardwood such as ebony or rosewood is used . castanets are used in pairs . traditionally two pairs are played together , one pair held in each hand . there is a string which passes through small holes in the shells . the player winds the string round the thumb and finger so that the two shells can be clicked together . the two pairs of castanets used are slightly different sizes so that they make a slightly different pitch . the higher pair , known as `` hembra '' ( female ) , is usually held in the right hand , with the larger `` macho '' ( male ) pair held in the left . castanets are traditionally played by singers and dancers . spanish folk dancers often use castanets . they are often associated with flamenco dancing . when they are played in an orchestra they are often attached to a stand . the technique of playing is therefore different . they can be tapped by the fingers and palm of the hand . they are often used in music which is supposed to sound spanish . in ballet and opera they are used to accompany spanish dances . carmen , the character in bizet 's opera `` carmen '' , sings a song and accompanies herself on the castanets . normally the opera singer will not have the skill to play them , so the castanets are played by a percussion player in the orchestra while carmen pretends to be playing them .
