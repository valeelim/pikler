Passive solar building design     in passive solar building design , windows , walls , and floors are made to collect , store , and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer . this is called passive solar design or climatic design because , unlike active solar heating systems , it does n't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices . the key to designing a passive solar home is to best take advantage of the local climate . elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type , thermal insulation , thermal mass , and shading . passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings , but existing buildings can be adapted or `` retrofitted '' .
