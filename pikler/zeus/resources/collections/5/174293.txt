Tesseract     a tesseract is a four-dimensional object , much like a cube is a three-dimensional object . a square has two dimensions . you can make a cube from six squares . a cube has three dimensions . the tesseract is made in the same way , but in four dimensions , so it looks different from what a person might expect . the tesseract has eight cells ; each cell is a cube . the tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes . unlike three-dimensional objects which rotate on both an axis and a plane ( the plane being of length and width and the axis being of the leftover dimension , height ) , a tesseract rotates on two planes , one made up of length and width , and one made up of height and the fourth dimension . it is the simplest hypercube .
