Power spectrum     the power spectrum of a signal is the power or more simply the energy of the signal at each frequency that it contains . it can also be considered as the range or spectra of energy or power of the given signal derived from the signals ' range of frequencies . for example , white noise , which contains all frequencies at the same power , has a flat power spectrum . the power spectrum of the sound of the bottom key on a piano would have a high value at the frequency corresponding to its note , and low values elsewhere .
