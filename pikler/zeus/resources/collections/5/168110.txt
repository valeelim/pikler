Newton's method    newton 's method newton 's method provides a way for finding the real zeros of a function . this algorithm is sometimes called the newtonâ€“raphson method , named after sir isaac newton and joseph raphson . the method uses the derivative of the function in order to find its roots . an initial `` guess value '' for the location of the zero must be made . from this value , a new guess is calculated by this formula : formula_1 here x is the initial guess and x is the next guess . the function f ( whose zero is being solved for ) has the derivative f ' . by repeatedly applying this formula to the generated guesses ( that is by setting the value of x to the formula 's output and recomputing ) , the value of the guesses will approach a zero of the function . newton 's method can be explained graphically by looking at intersections of tangent lines with the x-axis . first , a line tangent to the f at x is calculated . next , the intersection between this tangent line and the x-axis is found . finally , the x-position of this intersection is recorded as the next guess , x .
