Pygmalion effect     pygmalion was a sculptor who lived in cyprus . women who lived on cyprus did n't stay virtuous , so pygmalion decided to live alone and made a sculpture , galatea . during the aphrodite feast , thanks to pygmalion`s prayers , the sculpture turned into a real person . this was called the pygmalion effect . the pygmalion effect shows that if we want something enough , we 'll get it . it is named after the scholar who demonstrated it . it is also called `` rosenthal effect '' and is quoted when we refer to `` the power of affirmation '' and `` the power of praise '' . another example of the pygmalion effect is in groups . if there are two groups , one group thought that their teacher was `` good '' , the other group thought he was `` not good '' . the teacher treated both groups the same , but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others ; simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students . the pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory . it makes managers be aware , that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification , personal qualities or working environment . manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results . in such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work .
