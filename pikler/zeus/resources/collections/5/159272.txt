Perpetual motion     perpetual motion refers to a movement that goes on forever once started without additional energy added . a machine that could be set in motion once would continue to move forever . such a device or system would be against the law of conservation of energy . this law states that energy can not be created , or destroyed , but one form of energy can be transformed into a different one . perpetual motion machines have interested inventors for a long time , and even though it has been shown that such a machine can not exist , people still try to build them . perpetual motion machines have been classified into different types . each type breaks a different law of thermodynamics : 1. a perpetual motion machine of the first kind produces energy from nothing . it gives its user unlimited free energy . it violates the law of the conservation of energy . 1. a perpetual motion machine of the second kind spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work . in itself , this does not violate the law of the conservation of energy , because there is the same amount of mechanical work than there was of thermal energy . such machines violate the second law of thermodynamics . real heat engines , such as those found in cars , also convert heat energy to work . such engines have two reservoirs : the heat is transferred from the hot one to the cold one . some of the heat is converted into mechanical work , the rest is used to heat the cold reservoir . perpetual motion machines only have one reservoir for the heat . for this reason , they can convert all the heat into mechanical work .
