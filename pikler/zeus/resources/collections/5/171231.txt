Supermassive black hole     a supermassive black hole is a black hole with a mass that is between 10 and 10 the mass of the sun . scientists are confident that almost all galaxies , including the milky way , have supermassive black holes at their centers . how supermassive black holes get started is not yet known . astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is in place in the center of a galaxy , it can grow by attracting matter and by merging with other black holes . formation of ordinary ( star-sized ) black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and supported by observations . however , there appears to be a gap between stellar-mass black holes , and supermassive black holes . stellar-mass black holes , formed from collapsing stars , range up to perhaps 33 solar masses . the minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses . between these extremes there appears to be few intermediate-mass black holes . such a gap would suggest that the two types were formed by different processes .
