Pumice     pumice is a term for a lightweight volcanic rock . it is a solidified frothy lava , created when highly-heated , pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano . its light weight is due to air spaces , which are caused by fast cooling and loss of pressure . the loss of pressure makes bubbles by lowering the boiling point of the lava ( like the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened ) . the cooling then freezes the bubbles in the matrix . most famously , pumice stone has been used as a skin-scraper . it is used in pedicure to remove excess skin from the bottom of the foot , and on calluses ( tough areas of skin ) . it has also been used to make lightweight blocks for building , and as a powdered ingredient in polishing .
