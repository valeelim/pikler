Superparamagnetism     superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism . a superparamagnetic material has many small clusters of magnetic things in its structure , but they are not all pointed the same way , so the material is not magnetic by itself . if a magnetic field is applied to the material , then the clusters change direction to match the magnetic field and the material becomes magnetic . superparamagnetism is like paramagnetism , except it can happen at near room temperature . it happens when materials are made up of very small parts ( 1-10 nm ) .
