Corpus callosum     the corpus callosum is part of the brain in humans and other eutherian mammals . it is the largest connective pathway in the brain . its over 200 million nerve fibers connect the left and right hemispheres of the brain . the corpus callosum relates to the lateralization of brain function . because the two side of the brain communicate so intensively , they can afford to specialise in doing somewhat different things . the corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals ( the eutherians ) . it is absent in monotremes and marsupials , and other vertebrates such as birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish . other groups do have brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres . the anterior commissure serves as the main cross-hemisphere communication in marsupials . the fibrous bundle of the corpus callosum increases to such an extent in humans that it wedges apart the hippocampal structures .
