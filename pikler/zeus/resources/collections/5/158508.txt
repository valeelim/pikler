Slide rule     the slide rule , or `` slipstick '' , is a mechanical analog computer . the slide rule is used mainly for multiplication and division , and also for `` scientific '' functions such as roots , logarithms and trigonometry , but usually not for addition or subtraction . there are many different styles of slide rules . they are usually linear or circular . they have a standardised set of markings ( called scales ) . these scales are used for mathematical computations . some slide rules have been made for special use , as for aviation or finance . those slide rules have special scales for those applications , as well as normal scales . william oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 1600s . the slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by john napier . before electronic calculators were developed , slide rules were the tool used most often in science and engineering . the use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced ; but around 1974 the pocket calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business .
