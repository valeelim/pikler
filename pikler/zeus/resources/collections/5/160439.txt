Southampton Corporation Tramways 45     southampton corporation tramways no . 45 , or southampton 45 , is an open-top tramcar . it was built in 1903 by hurst nelson . at first it had a three window saloon , before being rebuilt by southampton corporation tramways with a four window one . the tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low bathgate arch in the centre of southampton . a normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch . the tramcar operated from 1903 until the southampton system closed in 1949. at an enthusiasts ' tour of the system the museum committee of the light railway transport league bought the tram for Â£10 . this price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint . this act began the entire preservation movement of british tramways . after it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram . by 1955 the tram was being stored at marton depot in blackpool . it was soon given to the tramway museum society ( tms ) and moved to the national motor museum at beaulieu , hampshire . it was placed next to newcastle 102 , another preserved tramcar . both of the trams were in an open-air display .
