OEM     oem stands for original equipment manufacturing . it is mainly used to describe parts for cars , airplanes and electrical systems . it is also used for computer parts and computer programs . the name oem is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it . the new company will sell the product at a cheaper price , but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version . for example , an oem computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence , but no instruction manuals .
