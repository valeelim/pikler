Chlorophytum comosum     the spider plant , chlorophytum comosum , is a species of `` chlorophytum '' native to south africa . spider plants have long narrow leaves that are 20–40 cm ( 8–15 in ) long and 5–20 mm ( 0.2–0.8 in ) broad . they grow from a central rosette . it also produces branched stolons with small white flowers and baby plantlets . it is a very popular houseplant . the most widely grown is the variegated cultivar 'variegatum ' . it has one or two broad yellowish-white bands running along the length of each leaf . natural , entirely green plants are also grown . the spider plant is very easy to spread . they can be propagated by splitting its main rosette . it is even easier to remove plantlets from the stolons and plant them separately or put them in a glass of water . they will grow roots readily in water but establish faster in soil while still attached to the parent plant . pinning the plantlet to the soil with a bent paper clip can be helpful . make sure the soil is damp and well drained . the plantlet can then be removed from the parent plant in 7-10 days .
