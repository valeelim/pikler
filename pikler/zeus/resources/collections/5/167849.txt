Car navigation     car navigation allows an automobile driver to see where he or she is on a map at any given time . automobile navigation can rely on gps ( global positioning system ) , or it can be dvd- or data-based . gps-bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission . the gps receiver catches the signal and calculates the time . the gps can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well-known radio signal speed . when driving a car with such a gps receiver , the driver may receive information from a satellite which is above for instance dover in the south and another one which is above perth in the north . then the gps receiver knows precisely how far it is from dover and how far it is from perth . with that `` two '' possible positions of the car at the flat land are precisely determined . to know which one of those positions is the right place , the gps receiver needs a third satellite , for instance above land 's end in the west . with that information , the gps receiver can also determine elevation . with three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point , but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earth 's surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel .
