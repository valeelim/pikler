Lagrange's theorem (group theory)    lagrange 's theorem ( group theory ) lagrange 's theorem in group theory states if g is a finite group and h is a subgroup of g , then |h| ( how many elements are in h , called the order of h ) divides |g| . moreover , the number of distinct left ( right ) cosets of h in g is |g|/|h| . applications - for any g in a group g , formula_1 for some k that divides the |g| - any group of prime order cyclic ( any element in g can be created by a single element ) and simple ( no normal subgroups that are n't trivial )
