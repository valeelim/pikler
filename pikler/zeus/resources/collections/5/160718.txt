Ephesus     ephesus ( ; ) was an ancient greek city on the west coast of anatolia , now in turkey . it was one of the twelve cities of the ionian league . the apostle paul is said to have addressed an epistle to the christians of the city. , and it is now known as the epistle to the ephesians in the new testament . the site still possesses many well preserved roman ruins side by side with rich history . most significant are the odeon , used as a concert hall and city council with the capacity of 1.500 people , temple of hadrian dating back to the second century where one of the best sculpture craftsmanship can be seen , curettes street hosting many monuments and countless colums on the sides of its marble paved ground , a fountain dedicated to emperor trajan where a part of a remaining statue shows us that romans knew the round shape of the world in the first century ad , and latrines ( toilets ) where it can be seen how they cared about public sanity . two other of ephesus 's outstanding monuments hold importance not just for their home city also for world 's cultural and architectural heritage . the first one is the library of celsus which is located at the end of the curettes street . the library looks like a two storeyed building seen from the facade but as we know it former had three stories inside . the facade shows a rare found craftsmanship . also the library was the third biggest library of the ancient world , after the libraries of alexandria and pergamon . anyone who stands in front of this monumental building can understand why did it take twenty years ( 115 ad to 135 ad ) to complete it .
