Program specification     in computer science , a program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do . it can be informal , in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view , or formal , in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms . in practice , most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed , although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development . specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable . in systems engineering a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items , materials , or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met . specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies , allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources , act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes , provide documentation of configuration , and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of systems engineering . they provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives . they provide guidance to testers for verification ( qualification ) of each technical requirement .
