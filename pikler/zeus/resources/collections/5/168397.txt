Taylor series     a taylor series is an idea used in computer science , calculus , and other kinds of higher-level mathematics . it is a series that is used to create an estimate ( guess ) of what a function looks like . there is also a special kind of taylor series called a maclaurin series . the theory behind the taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane ( x- and y-axes ) , then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point . this is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together . the idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum . in mathematics , a taylor series shows a function as the sum of an . the sum 's terms are taken from the function 's derivatives . taylor series come from taylor 's theorem . the ancient greek philosopher zeno of elea first came up with the idea of this series . the paradox called `` '' was the result . he believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result .
