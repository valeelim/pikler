Muezzin     a muezzin is a man who calls muslims to prayer from the minaret of a mosque . he leads the call ( `` adhan '' ) to friday service and the five daily prayers ( also known as the salat ) from one of the mosque 's minarets . blind people often got the position ; this is so that they could not see the places where women gathered . today , many mosques have electronic amplification , and the muezzin no longer needs to be on the minaret . in the city of abu dhabi , the call to prayer is coordinated , all mosques transmit the call of the muezzin of sheikh zayed mosque . the idea for a similar system in cairo failed in 2004 .
