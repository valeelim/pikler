British Rail coach designations     the london , midland and scottish railway and the london and north eastern railway both developed a system of identifying carriages by means of alphabetic codes . when british railways was formed in 1948 , it decided to adopt the former lner method of carriage classification . the codes are made up from a combination of letters , some of which can indicate more than one word ; their meaning can only be determined according to their position , or the presence of other letters , in the code . the letters used are : these letters ( except for `` y '' and `` z '' ) did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans ( e.g . parcels vans , horse boxes , milk and fish vans ) . their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description , e.g . guv for general utility vans . the following list lists those codes that were actually used on british railways , cross-referred to the comparable code used by the lms , with the exception that the letter `` s '' ( `` '' second '' , later `` standard '' ) is used where until 1956 the letter `` t '' ( `` third '' ) is used . suffix codes `` y '' or `` z '' are not shown , as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types .
