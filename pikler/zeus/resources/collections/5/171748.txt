Young's double-slit experiment    young 's double-slit experiment the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics is an experiment devised by physicist thomas young . it shows that light has both a wave nature or characteristic and a particle nature or characteristic , and that these natures are inseparable . so light is said to have waveâ€“particle duality rather than be only a wave or only a particle . the same is true of electrons and other quantum particles . this experiment is very simple . it requires only a double slit device like the one in the picture , something to hold the double slit device still , and a good laser such as the kind that is used by workmen to `` draw '' straight lines when they are building . the laser is supported so it can only be moved on purpose . it is aimed at the central point between the two slits from a point about one half meter away . something like a movie screen or a smooth white wall is put up on the other side of the double slit device several meters away . when everything is fixed , a pattern of light and dark bands will show up .
