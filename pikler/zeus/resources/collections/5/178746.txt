Terrestrial planet     a terrestrial planet is mostly made of rock ( silicate ) earth is the `` original '' terrestrial planet . when astronomers started understanding the kinds of planet they extended the term to include our nearest rocky neighbours : mercury , venus and mars . it is often said that they are similar to earth . this is true of most of the structure and composition , but not the surface or the atmosphere . a terrestrial planet may be much hotter or colder than earth , and may have much more or much less atmosphere . with the discovery of planets orbiting other stars ( exoplanets ) , the term terrestrial planet has been extended again to any rocky ( silicate ) planet orbiting any star . all terrestrial planets have a core , a mantle , and a crust . they are a bit like a boiled egg : the central yolk is the core ; the white albumin is the mantle ; and the shell is the crust . the crust of a terrestrial planet is thin , with the core and the mantle taking up the vast bulk , sometimes with a very large core , sometimes much smaller . terrestrial planets have metallic cores of mostly iron , with rocky mantles and crusts .
