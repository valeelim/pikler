Vibraphone     the vibraphone is an percussion instrument . it looks like a xylophone but the bars are made of aluminium instead of wood . like the xylophone , the bars are arranged in a similar way to a piano keyboard so that tunes can be played . an alternate form is the 6-plus-6-system , where each row has the bars in a whole-tone distance and both rows are in a half-tone distance . the player uses mallets ( beaters ) , either one or two in each hand . there are tubes underneath each bar . these are called `` resonators '' . they make the sound louder . there is also an electric motor which can be switched on by a pedal . this makes fans go round and round in the ventilators and makes a very strong , vibrating sound . this is why the instrument has its name . sometimes people call a vibraphone vibes . vibraphones were first made in the united states in 1921. the mallets are beaters with a rubber ball at the end . yarn or a hard cord is wound tightly round these balls . vibraphone mallets are usually slightly harder than the ones ones used for the marimba . they usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel , most commonly made of rattan or birch ( other materials , such as nylon , are sometimes used ) . mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba . there are different ways of holding them . a common way is to hold them between the thumb and index finger , using the other fingers to help control the sticks . playing with four mallets is harder , but allows the player to play harmony ( chord with four notes ) .
