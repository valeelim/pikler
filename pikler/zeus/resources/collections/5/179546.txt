Navel lint     navel lint , also called belly button lint , belly button fluff or navel fluff , is a collection of fluffy fibres in one 's navel . individuals with personal hygiene habits favorable to `` navel lint '' also have a higher incidence of `` toe jam '' ( podiaphyllangelade ) . ( 6 ) many people find that , at the beginning and end of the day , a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity . people have wondered why this happens for many years . in 2001 , dr. karl kruszelnicki of the university of sydney , australia , did a survey to find out why this happens . this is what he found out : - navel lint is mostly stray fibers from one 's clothing , mixed with some dead skin cells and body hair . - unlike what most people think , navel lint comes from a person 's underwear and not from their shirts or tops . the fibres move there from friction of body hair on underwear . - women have less navel lint because of their finer and shorter body hairs . older men have it more because they have more hair and it is thicker .
