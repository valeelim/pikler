Genotype     the genotype is the genetic constitution of an organism , mainly its genome . the term is contrasted with the term phenotype , as follows : the terms were invented by wilhelm johanssen to distinguish between inherited and environmentally produced variation . `` the distinction was not new . it had , for instance , been discussed by francis galton as `` nature '' vs. `` nurture '' . the extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely . `` some '' aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity , such as eye colour and blood types . human language is an interesting case . the `` capacity '' to learn and speak a language is entirely inherited , but `` which '' language is spoken is entirely learnt , and hence is environmental .
