Bookworm (insect)    bookworm ( insect ) bookworm is a term for any kind of insect which supposedly chews through books . this behaviour is uncommon . both the larvae of the death watch beetle ( `` xestobium rufovillosum '' ) and the common furniture beetle ( `` anobium punctatum '' ) will go through wood and if paper is nearby they will pass into that . a major book-feeding insect is the booklouse ( or book louse ) . a tiny ( under 1 mm ) , soft-bodied wingless `` psocoptera '' ( usually `` trogium pulsatorium '' ) . the insect actually eats molds and other plants found in books that were not kept clean and safe , but they will also attack bindings and other parts . it is also not a true louse . many other insects , like the silverfish ( `` lepisma saccharina '' ) or cockroach ( various `` blattodea '' ) , will eat these molds , including rotten paper or the starch-based binding pastes â€“ warmth and moisture or high humidity are needed , so damage is more common in the tropics . modern glues and paper are less attractive to insects . `` tineola bisselliella '' and `` hofmannophila pseudospretella '' will attack cloth bindings . leather-bound books attract lots of bugs , like the `` dermestes lardarius '' and the larvae of `` attagenus unicolor '' and `` stegobium paniceum '' .
