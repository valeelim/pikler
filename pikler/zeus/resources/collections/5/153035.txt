Structural engineering     structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of buildings and large non-building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters . besides , it may also cover design of machinery , medical equipment , vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved . structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes . major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages : `` research '' , `` design '' , `` testing '' , and `` construction '' which are featured with the images below : structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures . it became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century . entry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure , for example , beams , columns , and floors of a building . more experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system , such as a building .
