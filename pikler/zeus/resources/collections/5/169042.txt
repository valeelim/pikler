Unified field theory     unified field theory is an idea about a theory of fields in physics that will explain all natural phenomena . theories in physics can be very different and even disagree with each other . this is true for example for quantum mechanics ( the science of very small things ) and general relativity ( the science of space and time ) . the goal of unified field theory is to take all the different parts of physics and combine them into one theory that explains everything . the standard model is a theory close to a unified field theory , combining everything except general relativity .
