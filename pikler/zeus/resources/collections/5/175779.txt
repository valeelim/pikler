Base (mathematics)    base ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a base or radix is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers . for example , the most common base used today is the decimal system . because `` dec '' means 10 , it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers . a base can be any whole number bigger than 0 ( if it was 0 , then there would be no digits ) . the base of a number may be written next to the number : for instance , formula_1means 23 in base 8 ( which is equal to 19 in base 10 ) . different bases are often used in computers . binary ( base 2 ) is used because at the most simple level , computers can only deal with 0s and 1s . hexadecimal ( base 16 ) is used because of how computers group binary digits together . every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them . because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal , the six digits after 9 are shown as a , b , c , d , e , and f .
