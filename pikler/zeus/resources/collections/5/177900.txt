Vexillology     vexillology is the study of flags . the word comes from both the latin word `` vexilla '' `` little sail '' for flag plus the greek suffix '' -ology '' that means `` study of '' . the `` vexillum '' was a particular kind of flag used by the roman legions . vexillology is a kind of study of symbols related to heraldry . a person who studies flags is a `` vexillologist '' , and a person who designs flags is a `` vexillographer '' . because they are flown outside , where they move with the wind , flags are usually designed with bold images and bright , basic colors . flag design also follows a historical process , where later flag designs are based on earlier flag designs . this means that many flags in an area may look similar because they are all based on one historical flag . examples include the pan-african colors , pan-arab colors , and the nordic cross . the `` flag identification system '' was created by whitney smith and adopted by fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques ( fiav ) . the first row is for use on land and the second row is for use on water , each divided into private ( civil ) , government ( state ) , and military ( war ) use .
