Chorale     a chorale ( pronounce : `` ko-rahl '' ) is a hymn which is sung in a lutheran church by all the people . chorales developed during the late renaissance and early baroque period . most of them were written at that time . martin luther thought that the congregation ( people worshipping in church ) should have music to sing that was not too difficult . he thought that the words should be in german instead of latin so that everybody would understand what they were singing about . luther wrote the words of many chorales himself . he even composed some of melodies himself , such as `` ein ' feste burg '' ( `` a mighty fortress '' ) . sometimes he used the traditional gregorian chant melodies from the catholic worship and added new german words to it , for example `` christ lag in todesbanden '' ( `` christ lay in death 's dark bonds '' ) . the words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern . most of the melodies have an aab shape ( the melody of the first part sung twice , then the second part ) . this shape is called `` bar form '' in german .
