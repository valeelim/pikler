Quicksand     quicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt . it has the characteristic of thixotropy : it looks solid , but when pressure is applied it liquifies ( acts like a liquid ) . if animals or people stand on it , they sink into it . however , a person does not drown in quicksand . a human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid . it can be difficult to get out : that is the real problem . quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid , and rotating the body so as to float on one 's back ( supine ) . water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay . the water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand , and the sand remains a generally solid mass . this lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight , since they move around with very little friction . they behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress . since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand , the sand above does not appear to move at all , and can support leaves and other small debris . this makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment .
