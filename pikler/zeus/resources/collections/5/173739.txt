Seismology     seismology is the study of what is under the surface of the earth by measuring vibrations on the earth 's surface . a person who does this is called a seismologist . it is part of the science of geophysics , which studies the physics of the processes that formed the earth and other planets . seismology is done by seismologists and geophysicists using devices to pick up the vibrations called geophones , hydrophones or seismometers . seismology can either be passive , just listening to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity , or active , using small explosive charges to send vibrations into the ground . seismic detectors come in two types , one which measures up and down vibrations , and one which measures side to side vibrations . both types use and arrangement of a magnet and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an electrical signal which can be stored in a computer for analysis . seismologists can find the location of earthquakes by plotting received vibrations on a map . they can also pick up underground nuclear tests , and this is what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for .
