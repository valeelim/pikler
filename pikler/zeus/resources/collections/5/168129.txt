MOSFET     mosfet stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor . transistors are small electrical devices that are used in , amongst other things , alarm clocks , calculators , and , perhaps most famously , computers ; they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics . a few mosfets amplify or process analog signals . most are used in digital electronics . mosfets act like valves for electricity . they have one input connection ( the `` gate '' ) which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections ( the `` source '' and `` drain '' ) . said another way , the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs . think of a dimmable light switch : the knob itself selects 'on ' , 'off ' , or somewhere in between , controlling the brightness of the light . think of a mosfet in place of the light switch : the switch itself is the `` gate '' , the `` source '' is the power coming into the house , and the `` drain '' is the light bulb . the name mosfet describes the structure and the function of the transistor . mos refers to the fact that a mosfet is built by layering metal ( the `` gate '' ) on oxide ( an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity ) on semiconductor ( the `` source '' and `` drain '' ) . fet describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor . an electric signal is sent to the gate , which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the `` source '' and `` drain '' .
