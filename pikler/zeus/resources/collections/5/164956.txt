Dowry     a dowry ( also known as trousseau or tocher ) is the money , goods , or estate that is given to a woman at the time of her marriage . a dowry creates a fund for her support in case her husband dies . the dowry eventually goes to her sons and daughters of this marriage . at times a dowry was required to validate a marriage . dowry started as gifts that were handed out to the bride at the time of marriage to make her stay at in-laws place more comfortable . it has hence taken an ugly turn , many parts of india still have a high incidence of dowry demands . some states with a very poor reputation with regards to dowry are - andhra pradesh , bihar , tamil nadu . this is a sad reality in indian marriages and has gone unchecked .
