Taifa     a taifa ( from `` ṭā'ifa '' , plural طوائف `` ṭawā'if '' ) was an independent muslim-ruled principality . `` taifa '' s developed during the history of iberia . they were usually emirates or little kingdoms , but there was one oligarchy as well , seville . a number were formed in the al-andalus ( moorish iberia ) after the end of the umayyad caliphate of cordóba in 1031. they developed because of an administrative division of the umayyad caliphate of córdoba and an ethnic division of its elite . it was divided among arabs ( a powerful but tiny minority ) , berbers , eastern european former slaves and iberian muslims ( known as `` muladíes '' ( the great majority ) . there was a second period when `` taifa '' s developed : the middle of the 12th century , when the almoravid dynasty was in decline . in the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century , the emirs ( rulers ) of the `` taifa '' s kept fighting among themselves , not only militarily but also for cultural . they tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans . after the end of the caliphate , the rival muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the christian ones and so they had to submit and to pay tribute .
