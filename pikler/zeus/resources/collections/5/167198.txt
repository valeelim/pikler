Mud volcano     a mud volcano or mud dome is a kind of volcano that is made by liquids and gases from the earth . there are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made . temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano . the biggest mud volcanoes are 10 kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700 meters . most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane . other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane . they usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids . an example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water . a mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the earth or on the ocean bottom . temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point . mud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction . they can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt . they are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well . however , instead of spitting out magma , mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide .
