Digraph (orthography)    digraph ( orthography ) a digraph , bigraph , or digram ( from the , `` dís '' , `` double '' and γράφω , `` gráphō '' , `` write '' ) is a string of two letters where the number of written characters does not match the number of sounds that are spoken . in other words , two graphemes ( units of writing , or letters ) are used to represent one phoneme ( distinct sound ) . for example , since there are no single letters in english alphabet to represent the sounds /ʃ/ , /tʃ/ , and /θ/ , english uses a string of two letters to represent the sounds in the same order `` sh '' , `` ch '' , and `` th . '' while other sounds such as /f/ and /w/ already have letters that correspond to the sounds , `` f '' and `` w '' , digraphs `` ph '' and `` wh '' are used in some words to show their etymologies ( origins of words ) rather than their current pronunciation . this is different from a trigraph since digraphs are made up of only two letters , while trigraphs are made up of only three . list of english digraphs . - `` ch '' corresponds to /tʃ/ in english - `` sh '' corresponds to /ʃ/ in english
