Microsleep     microsleep is a very short sleep that occurs when people are awake . it can last from under a second to about 30 seconds . it may happen as a result of sleep deprivation , fatigue , sleep apnea , narcolepsy , or hypersomnia . microsleeps can occur at any time . most of the time , they do so without warning . when people have a microsleep during conversation , they may lose track of the subject that was talked about . microsleep can be extremely dangerous in situations when people drive a car , work on a machine or otherwise need to stay alert . people with microsleeps usually are not aware of them . they instead believe that they were awake all the time . one example is called `` gap driving '' : a person is driving a car and suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed . the driver does not feel that she or he has been asleep during those missing seconds , although this is in fact what happened . the sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during microsleep .
