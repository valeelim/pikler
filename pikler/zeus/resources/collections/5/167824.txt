Miocene     the miocene is the first epoch of the neogene period of the cainozoic . it started about 23 million years ago and ended about 5.33 million years ago . the rock beds that mark the start and end are well known , but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain . the biota becomes 'modern ' . the miocene was named by sir charles lyell . its name comes from the greek words ( ' , “ less ” ) and ( ' , “ new ” ) and means `` less recent '' , because it has 18 % fewer modern sea invertebrates than the pliocene . as the earth cooled , it went from the oligocene epoch , through the miocene , and into the pliocene . the miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event . they are set at regional boundaries between the warmer oligocene and the cooler pliocene epochs . the plants and animals of the miocene were fairly modern . modern families of mammals and birds existed . whales , seals , and kelp spread . modern sharks appeared , including the huge `` megalodon '' . grasslands became more common . mammalian browsers became less common , and grazer species became more common . about 100 species of ape lived at that time , and cetaceans were very common in the seas . the giganic shark `` carcharodon megalodon '' may have preyed on them .
