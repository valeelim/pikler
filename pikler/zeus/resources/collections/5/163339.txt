Barrel organ     a barrel organ plays music by using turning a barrel , with notes decided by an arrangement of pins . it is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp . with a barrel organ , the pins in the barrel lift `` keys '' that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes . the barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy , which is a string instrument . barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer . usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it , and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position . even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes . stationary barrel organs , built into large houses or churches , were larger pipe organs , and could play longer , and more serious music . some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers , which meant they did not need an organist to play them , and had a larger selection of music . organs built in a church , allowed people to sing , accompanied by organ . some of the only organ music composed by mozart , was supposedly written for a barrel organ built into a clock .
