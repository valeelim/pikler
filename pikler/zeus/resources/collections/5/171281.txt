Orders of magnitude (time)    orders of magnitude ( time ) an order of magnitude describes the link between two amounts . the difference between each step is usually 10 , with each order being either 10 times greater or 10 times smaller than the next amount . this makes the scale easy to manipulate using logarithms . for time , the difference between the smallest limit of time , the planck time , and the next order of magnitude is larger than 10 .
