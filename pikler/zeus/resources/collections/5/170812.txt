Egbert of Wessex     egbert ( also spelt ecgberht ) ( â€“839 ) was king of wessex from 802 until 839. in the 780s egbert was forced into exile by offa of mercia and beorhtric of wessex , but on beorhtric 's death in 802 egbert returned and took the throne . he was the father of athelwulf of wessex . egbert was the son of ealhmund , king of kent . he was descended from ingeld , brother of ine of wessex . in 786 he made a bid for the throne of wessex after the death of cynewulf . offa of mercia however , made beorhtric king instead . as a youth egbert was seen as a problem for beorhtric . he did n't want egbert in england . while beorhtric was negotiating to marry offa 's daughter he asked that egbert be handed over to him . while offa was considering doing just that , egbert fled mercia and at some point left england . he appears to have been welcomed at the court of charlemagne for at least three years . this is at the time frankish ports were closed to english ships and trading . offa had offended charlemagne by his son marry one of charlemagne 's daughters . while at the frankish court egbert married a noblewoman , redburga . she was possibly a close relative of charlemagne . egbert and redburga had a son born in francia , athelwulf , about 795. in 802 beorhtric died . egbert returned to become king of wessex , probably with military aid from charlemagne .
