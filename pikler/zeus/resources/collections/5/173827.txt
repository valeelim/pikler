'' the law was in response to a judge 's ruling that gay marriage was legal under the california state constitution . the campaign to pass proposition 8 was mostly paid for by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints . proposition 8 is controversial and is being debated in court . on august 4 , 2010 , judge vaughn walker in the united states district court made a ruling that proposition 8 was unconstitutional and should be overturned . this would make same-sex marriage legal again in california , however , judge walker issued a stay of execution , so that those in favor of proposition 8 could legal appeal . the appeal of the case went to the ninth circuit court of appeals . on february 7 , 2012 , the judges in this court agreed with judge walker that proposition 8 was unconstitutional . however they also issued a stay of execution , so that their ruling could be appealed to the united states supreme court .
