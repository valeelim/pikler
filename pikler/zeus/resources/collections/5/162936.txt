Giant magnetoresistance     giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) is a very small magnetic effect found in thin layers of iron and other materials . it is used to read and write information in hard drives . the gmr effect can be measured when a magnet is used to change the flow of electricity . the 2007 nobel prize in physics was awarded to albert fert and peter grünberg for the discovery of gmr . gmr was discovered in layers iron , chrome and ferrite by peter grünbergs research team of the jülich research centre ( germany ) in 1988. peter grünberg owns a patent for the technology . it was also discovered by albert ferts research group of the university of paris-sud ( france ) in layers ferrite and chrome . the fert group were first to see what they thought of as a `` large '' effect which is why they gave the name `` giant '' . the fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of gmr . the discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics . grünberg and fert have been given prizes and awards , including the 2007 nobel prize in physics , for this discovery and other spintronics work .
