Isomorphism     to say that two things are isomorphic is to say that they are the same in some sense . more specifically , in abstract algebra , an isomorphism is a function between two things that preserves the relationships between the parts ( see https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isomorphism # examples ) . using the language of category theory , morphisms map to morphisms without breaking composition . or consider the operation of adding integers z. the doubling function φ ( x ) = 2x maps elements of z to elements of the even integers 2z . since φ ( a+b ) = 2 ( a+b ) = 2a+2b = φ ( a ) +φ ( b ) , this is an example of an isomorphism .
