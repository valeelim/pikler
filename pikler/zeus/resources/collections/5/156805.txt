Mimicry     in biology , mimicry is when a species evolves features similar to another . either one or both are protected when a third species can not tell them apart . often , these features are visual ; one species looks like another ; but similarities of sound , smell and behaviour may also make the fraud seem more real . mimicry is related to camouflage , and to warning signals , in which species manipulate or deceive other species which might do them harm . although mimicry is mainly a defence against predators , sometimes predators also use mimicry , and fool their prey into feeling safe . mimicry happens in both animal and plant species . the `` mimic '' is the species which looks like the `` model '' . the model may be living , or not . whole groups of animals go in for mimicry as a life style , such as mantids , leaf insects or stick insects . camouflage , in which a species looks similar to its surroundings , is a form of visual mimicry . there are far more insect mimics than any other class of animal , but then there are far more insects than other types of animals . indeed , 75 % of all animals which have been described and named , are insects . many other kinds of animal mimics are known , including fish , plants and even fungi , though less research has been done on these .
