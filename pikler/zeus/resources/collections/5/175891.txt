Miacis     miacis is a small extinct carnivore of the family miacidae . they were small mammals which lived in forests and climbed trees . they had the ancestral mammalian 44 teeth . `` miacis '' had brains that were relatively larger than those of the creodonts , and the larger brain size compared to body size suggests their behaviour was more flexible and possibly more intelligent . miacids are either early members of the order carnivora or in a larger group called the carnivoramorpha . they may not be monophyletic . one professional opinion is that most `` miacis '' species belong to the ancestors of the modern order , the crown-group carnivora . the miacids lived 50 to 60 million years ago and was a small omnivorous predator that preyed on smaller animals , such as small mammals , reptiles , and birds , and might have also have eaten eggs and fruits .
