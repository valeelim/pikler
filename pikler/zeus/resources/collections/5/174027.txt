Durand Line     the durand line is a frontier boundary between afghanistan and pakistan . it was established after an 1893 memorandum of understanding ( mou ) between mortimer durand of british india and afghan amir abdur rahman khan . referred to as a frontier line , it is named after mortimer durand who was the foreign secretary of colonial british india at the time . the 1893 mou is a one page document , signed by durand and khan in which the two men agreed that afghanistan and british india would remain friends , and not start war with each other . it also mentions that the military of khan may import weapons into afghanistan through the afghan tribal areas and that british india would pay money to khan every year . in 1947 , british india ended and the new state of pakistan was created . in 1949 , afghanistan announced that the 1893 mou became void ( no longer valid ) and has never accepted it since then . the durand line cuts through the afghan tribal areas , politically dividing ethnic pashtuns and baloch people who live on both sides . although shown on maps as the western international border of pakistan , it remains unrecognized by afghanistan and leaders of the pashtun people in pakistan . the local people of the region have always refused to recognize the durand line , they cross it back and forth without documents . afghan pashtun leaders claim pakistani territories and say that the durand line is `` an issue of historical importance for afghanistan . the afghan people , not the government , can take a final decision on it .
