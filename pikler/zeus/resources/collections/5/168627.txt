Lorentz factor     the lorentz factor is the factor by which time , length , and mass changes in for an object moving at speeds close to the speed of light ( relativistic speeds ) . the equation is : where v is the speed of the object and c is the speed of light . the quantity ( v/c ) is often labeled formula_2 ( beta ) and so the above equation can be rewritten : classical relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50 mph while running at 5 mph , the ball travels 55 mph . of course , the ball still moves away from you at 50 mph , so if one were to ask you , you `` saw '' the ball traveling 50 mph . meanwhile , your friend , rory saw that you happened to be running at 5 mph . he would say that the ball was traveling 55 mph . both of you are right , you just happened to be moving `` with '' the ball . the speed of light , c , is 670,616,629 mph . so if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light ( 0.5c ) and you turn on your headlights , the light moves away from you at 1 c ... or is it 1.5 c ? it ends up that c is c no matter what . the next section explains why it 's not c - 0.5c .
