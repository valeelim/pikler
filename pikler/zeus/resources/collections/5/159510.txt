Roman Dacia     the roman province of dacia on the balkans included the modern romanian regions of transylvania , banat and oltenia , and temporarily muntenia and southern moldova , but not the nearby regions of moesia . it was added to the roman empire in its earliest days under the war of conquest by the emperor trajan , and was ironically—considering its wealth— the first of the roman provinces from which rome withdrew .
