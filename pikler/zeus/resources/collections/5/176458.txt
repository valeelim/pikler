Hyperbolic geometry     in mathematics , hyperbolic geometry is a non-euclidean geometry , meaning that the parallel postulate of euclidean geometry is replaced . the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space , for any given line `` l '' and point `` p '' not on `` l '' , there is exactly one line through `` p '' that does not intersect `` l '' . this line is called `` parallel '' to `` l '' . in hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through `` p '' . as they do not intersect `` l '' , the parallel postulate is false . models have been constructed within euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry . these models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of euclid . because there is no hyperbolic analogue to euclidean parallel lines , the hyperbolic use of `` parallel '' and related terms varies among writers . in this article , the two limiting lines are called `` asymptotic '' and lines that have a common perpendicular are called `` ultraparallel '' ; the simple word `` parallel '' may apply to both .
