Planetary nebula     a planetary nebula is a nebula that is made up of gas and plasma . they are made by certain types of stars when they die . they are named this because they look like planets through small optical telescopes . they do not last for very long compared to a star , only tens of thousands of years . at the end of a normal-sized star 's life , in the red giant phase , the outside layers of a star are disposed of . because the outside is gone , the star shines brightly and is very hot . the ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star . this is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does . planetary nebulae are very special objects because they can help make more stars . when a star dies , the metals that were in the core of the star are sent to other places in the universe . the only place that these metals form are in stars . this is called nucleosynthesis . the pictures of these nebulae show that they have very weird shapes . scientists are not sure why they are not all spheres . there are many theories about why they are not . they think that binary stars , stellar winds and magnetic fields might be part of the reason they look so special .
