Gödel's incompleteness theorems    gödel 's incompleteness theorems gödel 's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems , proved by kurt gödel in 1931. they are theorems in mathematical logic . in a formal system , there are axioms . all axioms are assumed to be true , at any rate for the purpose of the logic . a theorem then comes up with `` other true statements from the axioms '' , using certain rules . a sequence of such statements is called a `` proof '' of a statement , because it shows that the statement is true , given the axioms . ideally , it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner . a system that has this property is called `` complete '' ; one that does not is called `` incomplete '' . another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions . this means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time . a system that does not include theories that allow this is called `` consistent '' . gödel said that `` every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent '' :
