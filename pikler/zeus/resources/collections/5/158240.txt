Candiru     candiru ( candirú ( spanish , also known as canero or toothpick fish ) are parasitic freshwater catfish and a member of the trichomycteridae family . they can be found in the amazon river and to the people who live there , they are the most feared fish in its waters , even over the piranha . they are eel-shaped and translucent , making them very difficult to see in the water . some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 inches ( ~15 cm ) in length . the area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the amazon river and the rio negro , near brazil 's inland city of manaus . candiru are parasites . their ability to find breath currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species , where they feed on their prey 's blood . while the fish in the subfamily vandelliinae feed on blood , fish in stegophilinae may feed on scales , mucus , or carrion . to hunt for its prey , the candirú lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals , such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish . once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines . then , it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes , which usually causes the victim to die . it will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal .
