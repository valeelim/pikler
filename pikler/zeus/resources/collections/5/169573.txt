Stellar precession     stellar precession is the name for one of the ways the stars slowly move across the sky when seen from the earth . the best-known thing this causes is making the north star 's place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years . it is caused by the sun 's gravity pulling the earth 's poles toward itself . because the earth 's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit , this causes the north pole to seem to point at different places in the sky . although it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky ( almost 26,000 years ) , even over the time period that humans have had writing , this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star . when the ancient egyptians built the pyramids about 4,000 years ago , they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south . however , they did not use the same north star that we do because earth 's north pole pointed at a different star than it does today .
