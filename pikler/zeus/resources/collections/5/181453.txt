P versus NP     p versus np is the following question of interest to people working with computers and in mathematics : can every solved problem whose answer can be checked quickly by a computer also be quickly solved by a computer ? p and np are the two types of maths problems referred to : p problems are fast for computers to solve , and so are considered `` easy '' . np problems are fast ( and so `` easy '' ) for a computer to check , but are not necessarily easy to solve . in 1956 , kurt gödel wrote a letter to john von neumann . in this letter , gödel asked whether a certain np complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time . in 1971 , stephen cook introduced the precise statement of the p versus np problem in his article `` the complexity of theorem proving procedures '' . today , many people consider this problem to be the most important open problem in computer science . it is one of the seven selected by the clay mathematics institute to carry a us $ 1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution .
