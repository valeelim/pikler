ISO 8601     iso 8601 is an international standard to describe dates and times in the easiest way possible for computers to understand . this standard is based on putting the biggest types of numbers first and the smallest numbers last . because years are bigger than months , and months are bigger than days , they are put in the order of year-month-day . a basic iso date for today looks like 2017-09-. the basic iso time is 15 : . another very important principle is that when a computer or human puts iso 8601 dates into alphabetical order , they are also in chronological order . people can also use these dates , but it is currently not common for people in any country to write dates using this standard in their day-to-day lives .
