Henri Poincaré     jules henri poincaré ( 29 april 1854 – 17 july 1912 ) was a french mathematician and scientist . he was described as a `` monster of mathematics `` when still a child . many people think he was the last person to understand all branches of mathematics before the subject became too big for anyone to do this . he came from a clever family , his father was a professor of medicine and his cousin , raymond poincaré became president of france . he was sick as a child and for many years he had to be taught at home by his mother . he used his mathematical skills to look at some of the biggest problems in science in his day . he was the first person to describe in mathematical terms how three planets in orbit affect each others paths as they pass near by one another . this was called the three body problem . he also tried to understand why the speed of light seems to be the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe . in some ways he beat the famous scientist albert einstein to solving this question , but einstein gave a more complete answer . he gained fame for the discovery of the theory of relativity instead of poincaré .
