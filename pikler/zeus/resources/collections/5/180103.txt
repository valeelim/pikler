Mouthpiece (woodwind)    mouthpiece ( woodwind ) the mouthpiece of a woodwind instrument is the part which the player blows into . on single-reed instruments like a clarinet or saxophone the mouthpiece is shaped like a wedge . the reed is placed near the player 's bottom lip . this area is called the `` table '' . when the player blows , the reed vibrates . this is then made louder by the instrument . the shape of the inside of the mouthpiece can change the sound very much . the sound made by a mouthpiece that is large and round will be very different from the sound made by a mouthpiece that is small and square . the space between the end of the reed and the end of the mouthpiece is called the `` tip opening '' . the `` facing '' ( or `` lay '' ) is the part of the reed that starts to curve around the end of the mouthpiece . the length of the facing can change the response of the instrument . the ligature is what holds the reed onto the mouthpiece . anything that can hold the reed onto the mouthpiece can be called a ligature . most ligatures are made from metal or plastic . some people like to use ordinary string to hold the reed onto the mouthpiece .
