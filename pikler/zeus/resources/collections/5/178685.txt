Stagflation     in economics , the term stagflation is used when there is almost no growth in production , yet there is high inflation , and unemployment is high . this was suppposed to be impossible under the kind of economics described by keynes ( keynesian economics ) . stagflation is a portmanteau word of `` stagnation '' and `` inflation '' . it is used economics when the inflation rate is high , the growth rate slows down , and unemployment stays high . it raises a dilemma for economic policy since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment , and vice versa . the term is generally attributed to a british politician who became chancellor of the exchequer in 1970 , iain macleod , who coined the phrase in his speech to parliament in 1965. keynes did n't use the term , but some of his work refers to the conditions most would recognise as stagflation . in the version of keynesian macroeconomic theory which was dominant between the end of wwii and the late-1970s , inflation and recession were regarded as mutually exclusive , the relationship between the two being described by the phillips curve . stagflation is very costly and difficult to stop once it starts .
