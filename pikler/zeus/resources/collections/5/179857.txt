Trial by ordeal     trial by ordeal was a way to decide if someone was guilty or innocent of a crime . this was usually done by causing the accused person to do a painful task . if that task was completed without injury or if the injuries healed fast , this taken as a `` sign of god '' , which meant that the accused was innocent . people believed that god would not allow innocent people to be harmed . he would therefore help them by doing a miracle . there were three common types of trial by ordeal : ordeals had to be watched over by a religious person , such as a priest , because each ordeal was supposed to show the judgement of god . in england , ordeals were common up to and including the reign of henry ii , who introduced trials by jury . in pre-modern society , the ordeal typically was done together with the oath and witness accounts as the central means by which to reach a verdict . the term `` ordeal '' itself , old english `` ord«£l '' , has the meaning of `` judgment , verdict '' ( german `` urteil '' , dutch `` oordeel '' ) , from proto-germanic `` *uzdailjam '' `` that which is dealt out '' .
