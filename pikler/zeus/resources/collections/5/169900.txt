Mutual information     mutual information measures how much more is known about one random value when given another . for example , knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is , but it will give some `` hint '' . in the same way , knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature , but will make certain temperatures `` more or less likely '' . these `` hints '' or `` changes in likelihood '' are explained and measured with mutual information . to calculate mutual information , the probability ( chance ) of all possible events , and the probability of them happening at the same time , is needed . for example , to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees celsius , how many days out of the year are march and finally how many days are 10 degrees celsius in march . the formula requires the summation , or adding up , of many terms or numbers . every possible outcome has its own term . from the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature , we will use the following variables :
