Atmospheric convection     atmospheric convection is caused by one of two possibilities . one is instable state of atmosphere . the second is different ability of earth 's surface to get warmer . the first type ( unstable state of atmosphere ) can be called spontaneous . the second type ( convection caused by unequal soaking ) can be called contact convection . spontaneous convection starts at any level . contact convection starts near the terrain . the most frequent is contact convection . the sun is shining on the surface . it gets warmer and warmer . this leads to vertical draft , that is spontaneous rising and downward motions . this warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood . warmer air has lower density than cold air . warm air rises . through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction . this trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air . next rising continues due to inertia these thermal motions are used for example in gliding . the thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude .
