Topological space     a topological space is a space studied in topology , the mathematics of the structure of shapes . roughly , it is a set of things ( called points ) along with a way to know which things are close together . more precisely , a topological space has a certain kind of set , called `` open sets '' . open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points `` near '' another point , called a neighbourhood of the point . a neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point . if one did not have the concept of open sets , one can not define neighbourhoods in a good way . if one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as `` any '' set containing that point , it might just include that point and that point only , not any points near it , or points far away . we also have the concept of `` closed sets '' , which are complements of open sets . that is , all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set . open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness . the union of any number of open sets must be open , and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed . ( the second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets . that is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed . any set is made of points . if the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets , then `` every '' set would be closed . ) as a special case , the set containing every point is both open and closed . the set containing no points is also both open and closed .
