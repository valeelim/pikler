Longshore drift     longshore drift is the process of the ocean currents forcing sand and other material down a beach . the material is first pulled into the currents by the backwash ( the water going out to sea ) and is then pushed back up the beach by the swash ( the water going onto the beach ) . longshore drift always moves in the direction of the main wind . if longshore drift continues for a long time , beaches can be changed quite a bit . the changes depend on the details , and vary from place to place . - the waves carry the rock material up the beach at an angle . ( waves move at an angle â€“ wind ) - the backwash carries the material directly down ( gravity ) into the sea or it stays there . - this process goes again . there are many inexpensive and effective ways of controlling longshore drift . the most common method is groynes ( wooden walls that the sand builds up against ) . some people dislike the groynes because they are not very nice to look at . longshore drift is the net ( average ) movement of sand grains across a beach in a zig-zag motion .
