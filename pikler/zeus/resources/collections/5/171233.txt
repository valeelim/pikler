Nanosecond     a nanosecond ( ns ) is one billionth of a second . it is equal to 10 seconds . one nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds . 1000 nanoseconds is equal to one microsecond . ten nanoseconds are sometimes called a shake . some things that take between one nanosecond and ten nanoseconds are listed below - light travels about 29.9 centimeters in 1 nanosecond . that is 3.33564095 nanoseconds to move 1 meter . - it takes a fusion reaction between 20 and 40 nanoseconds to finish in a hydrogen bomb . - it takes a nuclear reaction 10 nanoseconds to finish one generation with fast neutrons . - the half-life of a k meson is 12 nanoseconds .
