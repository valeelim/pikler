Ideal gas     an ideal gas is a gas with particular characteristics . - the particles have no volume - all collisions between particles are elastic collisions and lose no kinetic energy - the particles neither attracted each other nor repel - they have random movement ideal gases are hypothetical which means that they do not exist in their true form . the ideal gas equation to work out the volume , pressure , temperature or amount of particles in an ideal gas is : formula_1 where : - n = number of moles of gas - t = temperature in kelvin ( k ) - r = 8.31 which is the universal gas constant - v = volume in litres ( l ) - p = pressure in pascals ( pa )
