Riemann zeta function     in mathematics , the riemann zeta function , is a prominent function of great significance in number theory . it is named after german mathematician bernhard riemann . it is so important because of its relation to the distribution of prime numbers . it also has applications in other areas such as physics , probability theory , and applied statistics . it is named after bernhard riemann , who wrote about it in the memoir `` on the number of primes less than a given quantity '' , published in 1859. the riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the riemann zeta function . many mathematicians consider the riemann hypothesis to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics . when using mathematical symbols to describe the riemann zeta function , instead of explaining it using english , it is written like this , as an infinite series : where formula_2 is the real part of the complex number formula_3 . for example , if formula_4 , then formula_5 . ( where formula_6 )
