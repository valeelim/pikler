Meritocracy     a meritocracy is the condition where people who deserve to can go up in rank , as opposed to a system like nepotism . it applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed . it is often reinforced by laws , such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment . the philosopher plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy . in democracy , there is no guarantee that you will get the best person , the most qualified person , ruling the state . his criticisms were really of athenian ( or direct ) democracy , where anyone could be selected to rule . in a meritocracy , the people are chosen who are thought to be the best . some have accused it of being elitist , saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern , creating in effect a ruling class . it is worth pointing out that plato did not see it this way . he believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were `` disinterested '' , meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind , not their own interest . plato 's point was this : if you want to rule , then it will go wrong , because power will corrupt you . if you are a philosopher , you do n't care about power all you care about is truth , so you will rule well , without being interested in your power or status .
