Pareto efficiency     multi-criteria optimization , or multiobjective optimization is a way of solving a mathematical or economic problem where many different parameters need to be changed to get one of the best possible solutions to the problem . the result of this is called pareto efficiency , named after vilfredo pareto , who first used it in his studies . in economics , the idea of pareto efficiency is very simple : if there is no way of improving the situation of one person , without making that of another person worse , the solution found is pareto-efficient . if we look at what the economy produces , we might say it is on its pareto frontier or production possibility frontier , meaning that it is making ( or `` producing '' ) all it can with the things it has ( such as machines , labour , land and ideas -- all called resources or factors of production ) . if this is the case , making more of one thing would mean making less of another ; the resources are already being used to full capacity , so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another .
