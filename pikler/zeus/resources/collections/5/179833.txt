Cross product     the cross product is a mathematical operation which can be done between two vectors . after performing the cross product , a new vector is formed . the cross product of two vectors is always perpendicular to both of the vectors which were `` crossed '' . this means that the cross product must always be used in 3-dimensional space . being a vector operation , the cross product is extremely important in all sorts of sciences ( particularly physics ) , engineering , and mathematics . one important example of the cross product is in torque or moment . like any mathematical operation , the cross product can be done in a straightforward way . if formula_1 and formula_2 then formula_3 or formula_4 and formula_5 formula_6 is just a symbol which says that our new vector is pointing up ( in the z-direction ) . if you `` cross '' two vectors which are both in the x-y plane , the product will always be perpendicular to both vectors , and if both vectors are in the x-y plane , the only way for it to be perpendicular to both is to be in the z direction . if the value of formula_7 is positive , then it points out of the page ; if its value is negative , then it points into the page .
