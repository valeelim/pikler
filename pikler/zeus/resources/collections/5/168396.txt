Higgs boson     the higgs boson ( or higgs particle ) is a particle in the standard model of physics . in the 1960s peter higgs was the first person to express the idea . on 14 march 2013 , scientists at cern tentatively confirm that they have found the particle . it is one of the 17 particles in the standard model . the higgs particle is a boson . bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces . other known bosons are the photon , the w and z bosons , and the gluon . scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the standard model . the higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory . unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field , the higgs field takes a non-zero constant value almost everywhere . the question of the higgs field 's existence has been the last unverified part of the standard model of particle physics and , according to some , `` the central problem in particle physics '' . it is difficult to detect the higgs boson . due to their massive size ( compared with other particles ) it needs vast amounts of energy to create them . the large hadron collider at cern was built mainly for this . it accelerates two sets of particles to almost light speed ( travelling in opposite directions ) , before setting them on a path to collide with each other .
