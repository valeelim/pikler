Great Rift Valley     the great rift valley is a name given to the continuous geographical trench , about 6,000 kilometres ( 3,700 mi ) in length , that runs from northern syria in southwest asia to central mozambique in east africa . the rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes . it is a site of faults and earthquakes . basically , the western part of africa is rifting away from the eastern part body . this causes all the geological activity at the valley . far in the future , a sea will run between these two parts of africa . the arabian peninsula is already almost separated . the whole process is part of plate tectonics . in eastern africa , the valley divides into two , the western rift valley and the eastern rift valley . there are about 20 unesco world heritage sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the great rift valley . the western rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in africa . it contains the rift valley lakes , which include some of the deepest lakes in the world ( up to 1,470 metres deep at lake tanganyika ) . much of this area is inside national parks .
