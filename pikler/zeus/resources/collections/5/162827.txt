Ciliate     the ciliates are a group of protists characterized by the presence of hair-like organelles called cilia , which are identical in structure to flagella but typically shorter and present in much larger numbers with a different undulating pattern than flagella . cilia occur in all members of the group ( although the peculiar suctoria only have them for part of the life-cycle ) and are variously used in swimming , crawling , attachment , feeding , and sensation .
