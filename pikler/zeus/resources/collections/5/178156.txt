GNU GRUB     gnu grub ( `` grub '' for short ) is a boot loader package from the gnu project . grub is the main example of the multiboot specification , which allows a user to have more than one operating systems on their computer at once , and to choose which one to run when the computer starts . grub can be used to select from different kernel images available on a particular operating system 's partitions , as well as to pass boot-time parameters to such kernels . when a computer is turned on , the computer 's bios finds the primary bootable device ( usually the computer 's hard disk ) and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record ( mbr ) , the first 512 bytes of the hard disk , and then transfers control to this code . the mbr contains grub stage 1. because of the small size of the mbr , stage 1 just loads the next stage of grub ( which may be physically elsewhere on the disk ) . stage 1 can either load stage 2 directly , or it can load stage 1.5 : grub stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the mbr . stage 1.5 loads stage 2 .
