Viscosity     viscosity is a physical property of fluids . it shows resistance to flow . in a simple example , water has a low viscosity , as it is `` thin '' . syrup and tar , on the other hand , have a high viscosity , as they are `` thick '' . so next time you drink something think about the viscosity ! a way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope . syrup would reach the bottom very slowly , whereas water would be a lot quicker . there are two types of viscosity : `` dynamic viscosity '' , measured in pascal seconds , and `` kinematic viscosity '' , measured in metres per second squared . viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt . when the lava comes out very thickly ( viscous ) , there is more chance that it will erupt violently . this is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can . if the lava is thin ( low viscosity ) , then it just flows out like water . the word `` viscous '' comes from the latin `` viscum '' , meaning sticky .
