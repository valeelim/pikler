Dirac delta function     the dirac delta function is a made-up concept by mathematician paul dirac . it is a really pointy and skinny function that pokes out a point along a wave . the delta function is used a lot in sampling theory where its pointiness is useful for getting clean samples . the integral of the dirac delta function is the heaviside function .
