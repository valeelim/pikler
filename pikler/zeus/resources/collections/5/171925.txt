Luminosity     luminosity is the amount of power given off by an astronomical object . stars , galaxies and other objects emit energy in the form of radiation . it is measured in joules per second , which are equal to watts . a watt is one unit of power . just as a light bulb is measured in watts , the sun can also be measured in watts . the sun gives off . this amount of power is known as 1 sol , the symbol for which is formula_1 . there are other ways to describe luminosity . the most common is apparent magnitude , which is how bright an object looks to an observer on earth . it only applies to light , that is , visible wavelengths . apparent magnitude is contrasted with absolute magnitude , which is an object 's `` intrinsic brightness '' at visible wavelengths , irrespective of distance . the apparent magnitude is the less , for objects more than 32.6 light years away . when talking about the total power output across all wavelengths , that is called bolometric magnitude .
