Travelcard     a travelcard is a ticket used for most transport in london , including buses and the underground . the ticket is issued by transport for london and national rail and can be used on the services of either . before travelcards were used , travellers in greater london had to pay every time they changed between london transport 's bus and underground services . this was a problem as it led to delays while purchasing the next ticket . one ticket for all transport in london was one of the key promises made in 1981 by the newly-elected labour greater london council , headed by council leader ken livingstone . the policy , with the slogan `` just the ticket '' , meant that only one ticket was needed for london transport bus and underground services . they also reduced the price of transport . the price cut was then ruled illegal , but the one pricing scheme was mostly a success and was extended during the 1980s and 1990s as new transport routes were opened in london . by 1985 , there were two travelcards : the travelcard itself , which covered only london buses and the underground , and the capitalcard , which covered most bus , underground and local british rail ( br ) services . the travelcard replaced the original capitalcard , while including its greater availability , around 1989 .
