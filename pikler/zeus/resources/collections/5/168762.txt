Capillary action     capillary action means either of two things : 1. when liquid moves through thin tubes . 1. when liquid moves through something that is full of little holes ( like a sponge ) . capillary action is a result of the surface tension of liquids . an example of capillary action is what happens inside a drinking straw left in a cup of water . the force of adhesion which holds the water together and to the straw is a little stronger than gravity , so the water will rise inside the straw a little higher than the rest of the water . another example is what happens when putting a sponge in a puddle of water . the little bubbles in the sponge work like many straws gathered together . when the sponge is dipped in water , the water starts to go into the holes , and the bubbles that are inside the sponge pull on the water that they touch . capillary action also takes place inside the human body . for example , it removes tears from the eyes . other pages . - capillaries
