Alois Alzheimer     alois alzheimer ( 14 june 1864 â€“ 19 december 1915 ) was a german psychiatrist . he is credited with the first published case of `` presenile dementia '' , which emil kraepelin would later identify as alzheimer 's disease . on 25th of november 1901 , alzheimer started treating a new patient , called auguste deter . auguste was married , and her husband brought her to the clinic , because within a year she had changed very much . she had started to become jealous , and was unable to perform simple household tasks . alzheimer found out that the patient had little knowledge of where she was or about the time of day or the week . she also remembered few things about her life . when she was asked a question , the answer often had little to do with the question . auguste deter 's mood changed rapidly . alzheimer had seen similar symptoms with other patients he treated , but generally these were over 70 years old ; auguste deter was only 51. several times , auguste deter stated that she knew that she `` had lost herself '' and that she `` was helpless '' . for this reason , alzheimer originally said that this was the `` disease of forgetting '' . deter died in 1906 .
