Dean (education)    dean ( education ) in academic administration , a dean is a person with important authority over a specific academic unit , or over a specific area of concern , or both . the term comes from the latin `` decanus '' , a leader of `` ten , '' taken from the medieval monasteries ( particularly those following the cluniac reforms ) which were often extremely large , with hundreds of monks ( the size of a small college campus ) . the monks were organized into groups of ten for administrative purposes , along the lines of military platoons , headed by a senior monk , the decanus . the term was later used to describe the head of a community of priests , as the chapter of a cathedral , or a section of a diocese ( a `` deanery '' ) . when the universities grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools , the title of dean was used for officials with various administrative duties .
