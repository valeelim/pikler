Web services     a web service is defined as `` a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network '' . web services are frequently just web apis that can be accessed over a network , such as the internet , and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services . the w3c web service definition encompasses many different systems , but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the http protocol used on the web . such services tend to fall into one of two camps : big web services and restful web services . `` big web services '' use xml messages that follow the soap standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise . in such systems , there is often a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the web services description language ( wsdl ) . the latter is not a requirement of a soap endpoint , but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in many java and .net soap frameworks ( frameworks such as spring , apache axis2 and apache cxf being notable exceptions ) . some industry organizations , such as the ws-i , mandate both soap and wsdl in their definition of a web service .
