Ardipithecus     ardipithecus is a very early hominid genus , which lived during the late neogene . two species are known : `` a. kadabba '' , dated to about 5.6 million years ago ( late miocene ) , and `` a. ramidus '' , which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early pliocene . because this genus shares several traits with the african great ape genera ( `` pan '' and `` gorilla '' ) , some place it on the that branch rather than human branch . most consider it a proto-human because of a likeness in teeth with `` australopithecus '' . `` ardipithecus '' had bipedalism and reduced canines , like the australopithecines .
