Fire-stick farming     fire-stick farming are words used by australian archaeologist rhys jones in 1969. they describe the way that indigenous australians used fire regularly to burn the land . this helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas , and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals . over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area . fire-stick farming had turned scrub into grassland , which increased the numbers of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo . scientists say that the changes caused by fire-stick farming caused the extinction of the australian megafauna . in the forests , fire-stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level . this increased the number of animals that could feed on these plants , such as the herbivore marsupials . references . - jones , r. 1969. fire-stick farming . `` australian natural history '' , 16:224 - miller , g. h. 2005. ecosystem collapse in pleistocene australia and a human role in megafaunal extinction . `` science '' , 309:287-290
