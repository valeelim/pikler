90377 Sedna     90377 sedna ( or simply just sedna ) is a large trans-neptunian object . it was discovered on november 14 , 2003 by mike brown , chad trujillo and david rabinowitz . around 1250-1800 km in diameter , sedna takes roughly 10,500 years to orbit the sun , much higher than most known trans-neptunian objects . it is one of the most distant known objects in the solar system . therefore , sedna 's surface temperature never rises above -240Â°c . the name `` sedna '' comes from the inuit goddess of the sea , thought to live at the bottom of the arctic ocean . nasa is not currently planning any space missions to explore sedna , but there is some talk of missions to happen when sedna reaches perihelion again . it is considered to be a likely candidate as a dwarf planet . no pictures can be taken of sedna because very little light from the sun reaches it . for this reason , sedna is known as `` cobian '' , meaning shadows in ancient greek . due to its orbit , the chances of sedna being found were 0.017 % . 40-120 more objects this size should exist without us knowing , but , as they are so small and far away , they may not be discovered for a while .
