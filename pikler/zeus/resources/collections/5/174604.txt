Regular polytope     in mathematics , a regular polytope is the generalisation of the regular polygon . like other polytopes it may have any natural number of dimensions . for example , a two-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polygon , and a three-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polyhedron . like with the regular polygon , there are certain kinds of symmetries . regular polytopes have regular facets ( faces to speak from the 3d viewpoint ) , and their vertex figures are regular . the simplest of the six convex regular 4-polytopes are the pentachoron and tesseract .
