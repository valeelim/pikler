Peppered moth evolution     the evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last 150 years . at first , almost all of the moths were light coloured . this gave them camouflage against the light-coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day . as pollution increased during the industrial revolution in england , many of the lichens died out . the trees became blackened by soot , and most of the light-coloured moths , or typica , became rare . at the same time , the dark-coloured , or `` melanic '' , moths , carbonaria , flourished . this change took place because it was the best camouflaged moths which survived better . the term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutants . since then , with an improved environment , light-coloured peppered moths have again become common . as a result of the relatively simple and easy-to-understand circumstances of the adaptation , the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection .
