Lobotomy     lobotomy , also known as leucotomy , is a type of brain surgery . it was invented in 1935 by ant√≥nio egas moniz , a portuguese neurologist . he won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1949 `` for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses '' . the operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex ( front part of the frontal lobes ) to the rest of the brain . at first it seemed a great success , but the operation is now rarely done . he used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment . he first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour , which they repeated time and again . it was also used to treat other mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia and clinical depression . the problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person 's personality and behaviour . sometimes , the results were beneficial : patients which had been violent became calm . but long-term studies , which were not done by moniz , show some had severely damaged personalities . they often had very little 'drive ' and motivation .
