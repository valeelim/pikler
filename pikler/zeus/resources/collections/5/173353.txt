HammerFall     hammerfall is a heavy metal/power metal band from gothenburg , sweden . the band was started in 1993 by the former guitarist of ceremonial oath , oscar dronjak . hammerfall began when guitarist oscar dronjak quit ceremonial oath and invited jesper strömblad from in flames to join him as a drummer on a new band he had been thinking about for a long time . dronjak had already made the song `` steel meets steel '' , which was included on hammerfall 's first album . they were later joined by guitarist niklas sundin , bassist johann larsson and vocalist mikael stanne . when niklas sundin and johann larsson left hammerfall the next year , glenn ljungström and fredrik larsson replaced them . both dronjak and strömblad were in other bands : dronjak was in `` crystal age '' , strömblad was in in flames . because of this , hammerfall was not very active during this time . the only concert they played was a local music contest called `` rockslaget '' . the band had n't written many songs yet , and usually only played covers of bands like pretty maids , judas priest and alice cooper .
