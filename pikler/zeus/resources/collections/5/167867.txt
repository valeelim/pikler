Spiral     a spiral is a special curve in mathematics . this curve starts at a point , and then goes around the point , but gets farther and farther away from it . this is different from a circle ( which is always at the same distance or an ellipse . a spiral is an `` open '' curve , unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves . a two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates . there the radius `` r '' is a continuous monotonic function of angle θ ( `` theta '' ) . the circle would be regarded as a degenerate case . with the circle , the function would not be strictly monotonic , but constant . some of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include : - the archimedean spiral : `` r '' = `` a '' + `` b '' θ - the euler spiral , cornu spiral or `` clothoid '' - fermat 's spiral : `` r '' = θ - the hyperbolic spiral : `` r '' = `` a '' /θ - the lituus : `` r '' = θ - the logarithmic spiral : `` r '' = `` ab '' ; approximations of this are found in nature - the fibonacci spiral and golden spiral : special cases of the logarithmic spiral
