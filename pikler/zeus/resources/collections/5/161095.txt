Joule's laws    joule 's laws joule 's laws are two : first about heat produced by an electric current , and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure , volume and temperature . joule 's first law shows the relation between heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor . it is named after james prescott joule and shown as : where `` q '' is the amount of heat , `` i '' is the electric current flowing through a conductor , `` r '' is the amount of electric resistance present in the conductor , and `` t '' is the amount of time that this happens for . joule 's second law says that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if volume and pressure change , but does change if temperature changes .
