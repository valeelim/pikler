Daguerreotype     a daguerreotype is a method of creating photographs that is no longer in general use . a man called louis-jacques-mand√© daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in france in 1839. the new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a `` truthful likeness . '' by 1850 , there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in new york alone . however the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented . by the late 1850s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype , became available . a drawback of the daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images . each picture was therefore unique , the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image .
