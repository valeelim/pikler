Hubble's law    hubble 's law hubble 's law or lemaître 's law is the name for the observation that : 1. all objects observed in deep space have a doppler shift-measured velocity relative to earth , and to each other ; 1. the doppler-shift-measured velocity of galaxies moving away from earth , is proportional to their distance from the earth and all other interstellar bodies . in effect , the space-time volume of the observable universe is expanding and hubble 's law is the direct physical observation of this . it is the basis for believing in the expansion of the universe and is evidence often cited in support of the big bang model . although widely attributed to edwin hubble , the law was first derived from the general relativity equations by georges lemaître in a 1927 article . there he proposed that the universe is expanding , and suggested a value for the rate of expansion , now called the hubble constant . two years later edwin hubble confirmed the existence of that law and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name . the recession velocity of the objects was inferred from their redshifts , many measured earlier by vesto slipher in 1917 and related to velocity by him .
