Mucus     mucus ( mucous ) , or slime , is a slippery liquid . it is made by many living things as a kind of biological lubricant . it plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines . mucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides , which are long-chain carbohydrates . these molecules are stiff when dry , and sticky and slippery when wet . they are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to man . in vertebrates mucus is made by mucous membranes . mucus may have antiseptic enzymes ( such as lysozymes ) and immunoglobulins ( antigens ) . a major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by fungi , bacteria and viruses . mucus protects epithelial cells in the lungs , gut , genital , visual , and auditory systems in mammals ; the epidermis in amphibians ; and the gills in fish . snails , slugs , hagfish , and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus . as well as a protective function , slime helps movement and plays a role in communication . mucus is produced in many parts of the body . all the alimentary canal , nose , and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces . the surfaces are mostly internal surfaces , though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal . slugs are an example of this . mucus glands are exocrine glands , so they pass their mucus to the surface along ducts .
