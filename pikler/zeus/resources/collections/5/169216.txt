Megafauna     the term is most used for the pleistocene megafauna the large land animals of the last ice age , such as mammoths . it is also used for the largest living wild land animals , especially elephants , giraffes , hippopotamus , rhinoceros , elk , condors , etc . its use is connected with the discussion about the holocene extinctions after the ice age . most of the large land animals which were alive 12,000 years ago are now extinct , and there is much discussion as to what has caused this . the two main theories are hunting by humans , and climate change . together , these reasons are enough to explain why these previously successful animals are now extinct . elephant birds on madagascar were certainly hunted to extinction , as were the moas in new zealand . archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over new zealand . the moas became extinct about five hundred years ago . the moas had survived being hunted by haast 's eagle , but they did not survive being hunted for food by the maoris .
