Forestle     forestle is a website for finding all kinds of information on the internet ; forestle helps to save the rain forest and reduces the total carbon dioxide ( co ) production . it also offers special features , for example a preview of the websites found during a search . it was invented in 2008. forestle saves 0.1 square meters ( about 0.1 square yards ) of rain forest per search . it earns money from showing advertisements along with the websites found , and forestle guarantees to donate 90 % of this money to buy areas of rain forest through its partner organization the nature conservancy . as of october 2009 , about 1,991,055 square meters of rain forest have been saved . for searching the web using forestle is also essentially co-neutral : of course the server computers used by forestle , the connection network , and the computer of the searching users need electric energy and thus create emissions of carbon-dioxide ; but forestle purchases an equivalent amount of renewable energy certificates . the certificates are purchased from a part of the 10 % of money left after buying rain forest . this makes forestle one of the few web search sites that are `` green certified '' .
