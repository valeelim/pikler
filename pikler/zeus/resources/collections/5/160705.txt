British Rail Class 99     the british rail class 99 was a fleet of 14 ferries , mostly owned by sealink , which carried rail vehicles between britain and mainland europe . when british rail implemented the tops system for managing their operating stock , these ships were incorporated into the system in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software . this allowed them to be counted as locomotives while carrying railway vehicles in the same way as a normal locomotive would haul a train .
