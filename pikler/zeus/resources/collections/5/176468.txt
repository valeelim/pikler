Parallel postulate     in geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axioms of euclidean geometry . sometimes it is also called euclid 's fifth postulate , because it is the fifth postulate in euclid 's elements . the postulate says that : `` if you cut a line segment with two lines , and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than two right angles , then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough . '' the field of geometry which follows all of euclid 's axioms is called euclidean geometry . geometries which do not follow all of euclid 's axioms are called non-euclidean geometry . some mathematicians thought that euclid 's fifth postulate was much longer and more complicated than the other four postulates . many of them thought that it could be proven from the other simpler axioms . some mathematicians announced they had proven the proposition from the simpler propositions , but they all turned out to be mistaken . euclid is also known as euclid of alexandria . another more recent proposition known as `` playfair 's axiom '' is similar to euclid 's fifth postulate . it says that :
