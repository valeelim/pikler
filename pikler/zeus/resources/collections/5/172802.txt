Dyson sphere     a dyson sphere is an idea about a structure that surrounds a star , first thought up by physicist freeman dyson , and then used in some science fiction works . there are at least three types of dyson spheres : 1. a `` dyson shell '' that is a solid structure and the inside could even become habitable if the sphere produces artificial gravity by spinning on itself . it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible to build ( particularly because of the enormous quantity of material needed , the instability of the sphere and the strong gravity of the star affecting the whole structure ) . 1. a `` dyson swarm '' , which is not exactly a sphere , but millions of smaller bodies orbiting the star and thus forming a more or less spherical structure around it . the most physically realistic structure to built . 1. a `` dyson bubble '' that is made up of small bodies ( like a dyson swarm ) , but linked together with an extremely light and thin ( but very large ) structure such as a light sail around a star that keeps it centered because of stellar winds .
