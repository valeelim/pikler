Psalm 151     psalm 151 is a short psalm that is controversial because it is in some versions of the bible but not others . in particular , it is in several very old greek translations of the bible but is not in the hebrew bible . there has been a lot of debate over whether or not the psalm should be considered part of the bible . the psalm has been known about for a long time and the greek version was used for study for hundreds of years . when the dead sea scrolls ( which are in hebrew ) were found and translated , part of psalm 151 was in them . this surprised the researchers very much , but not as much as what they would find later on . after studying the scrolls , they noticed that the greek translator had actually made a mistake . two different pieces of two different psalms were treated like they were one big psalm when they were not . there is a big change in the greek version after the fifth line ( where the second psalm fragment would begin ) and is a lot more like a story than most of the other psalms , which are more like poems .
