Sidecarcross     sidecar-cross racing , also known as sidecar motocross , is a race that uses a different motorcycle chassis than regular motocross . it also uses a team of two people riding together , a `` driver '' and a `` passenger '' . sidecarcross is done on the same race track as normal motocross , but the driver has to ride differently then when riding solo . the driver can not lean over in the turns . to make sure the sidecar does not flip over , the passenger leans out of the sidecar when they are in the corners . the passenger does much more work than the driver because he moves his whole body around all the time . one of the most important things in sidecar racing is teamwork ; the best teams race together for many years . other websites . - the sidecar-cross racing homepage - the australian sidecar-cross association inc - the british sidecar enduro association
