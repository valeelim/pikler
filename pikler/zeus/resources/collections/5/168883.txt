Symbolism (art)    symbolism ( art ) symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of french , russian and belgian origin . the movement rejected realism and naturalism , and included poetry and other arts . symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly . thus a symbolist painting may `` look '' realistic , but actually it represents a non-visual idea . in literature , the style started with the publication `` les fleurs du mal '' ( `` the flowers of evil '' , 1857 ) by charles baudelaire . the works of edgar allan poe , which baudelaire admired greatly and translated into french , were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images . the name `` symbolist '' itself was first used by the critic jean moréas , who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art . symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of romanticism . there were several groups of symbolist painters and visual artists , including gustave moreau , gustav klimt , odilon redon , henri fantin-latour , gaston bussière , edvard munch , félicien rops , and jan toorop . symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry . its ideas affected mikhail vrubel , nicholas roerich , martiros saryan , mikhail nesterov , léon bakst , elena gorokhova in russia , as well as frida kahlo in mexico and david chetlahe paladin in the united states . auguste rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor .
