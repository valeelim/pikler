Blank slate     blank slate , or tabula rasa ( which means the same thing ) was a philosophical idea of john locke . it had , like much of philosophy , a history which went as far back as aristotle , but it was locke who made it known to our modern world : humans , when born , are thought not have mental experience or knowledge , and that everything is learned after they grow . in particular , locke thought all knowledge came from sense data , and the mind is empty at the beginning . by 'sense data ' is meant the process of hearing , seeing , touching etc . locke 's idea was immediately picked up by others : many have held similar views . the founder of behaviourism , john b. watson ( 1878â€“1938 ) : throughout the 20th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas . ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited , instinctual , ( innate and permanent ) . konrad lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past . the field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life . if humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals , it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution . the human ability to learn a language is inherited , and is of huge practical importance . very important also ( though less obvious ) is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life . the apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited . these are some reasons why a number of recent publications have rejected locke 's idea .
