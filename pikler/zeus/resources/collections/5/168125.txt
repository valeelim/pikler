Stack (data structure)    stack ( data structure ) the stack is one of the most important data structures in computer science . to understand how a stack works , think of a deck of playing cards that is face down . we can only easily access the card that is on top . when we want to look at the top card , there are two things we can do : we can peek at it , but leave it on the stack , or we can pop it off . when we pop off the top object , we are taking it off the stack . if we want to add another card to the top of the stack , we push . a stack is called a last-in-first-out ( lifo ) collection . this means that the last thing we added ( pushed ) is the first thing that gets pulled ( popped ) off . if the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace , then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace . the stack was first proposed in 1955 , and then patented in 1957 , by the german friedrich l. bauer . the same concept was developed independently , at around the same time , by the australian charles leonard hamblin . in modern computer languages , the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just `` push '' and `` pop '' . some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack . another typical helper operation is `` top '' ( also known as `` peek '' ) , which can return the current top element of the stack without removing it . another common operation is `` dup , '' which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack .
