Bose–Einstein condensate     bose–einstein condensate ( bec ) is what happens to a dilute gas when it is made very cold , near absolute zero ( in kelvin ) . it forms when the particles that make it up have very low energy . only bosons can make a bose–einstein condensate , when they are close to 0 °k ( or −273 °c , or −459.67 °f ) . the gas has extremely low density , about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air . a bose–einstein condensate is a change of state . when matter is in the bec state it has zero viscosity . superfluidity and superconductivity are both closely connected with the bec state of matter . particles can only have a set amount of energy . they either have the energy to bounce around in gases or just the energy to flow like a liquid or be fixed like a solid . if you take enough of the particle 's energy away you get to the tiniest or the smallest amount of energy possible . this is a bose–einstein condensate . this makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions , they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way , forming something called a 'giant matter wave'.fifth state of matter on the basic of chemical properties
