Sustainable biofuels     biofuels are fuels from plant materials . they offer the prospect of oil price moderation . but the use of biofuels needs to be sustainable . responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in africa , latin america and asia . there are many biofuel options which are available . biofuels , such as ethanol and biodiesel , are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch , sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat , maize , sugar cane , palm oil and oilseed rape . any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed , and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition . second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops ( perennial grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus giganteus ) , forestry materials , the co-products from food production , and domestic vegetable waste . advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels , through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels , from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources .
