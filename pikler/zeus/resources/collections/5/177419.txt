New Age     the new age , also called the new age movement is a kind of spiritual belief and way of life held by some westerners . it is not an organized religion . they believe in religious pluralism- that people are free to decide what they believe and how they use it in their lives . they pick and mix what they believe with bits taken from both eastern and western culture and religions . they make their own decisions about what god is and how they worship god , if they even believe in god at all . new age people often meditate , sometimes to seek their own contact with god . there are many authors who describe how they see the new age in books . there is also new age music which tends to be calm and relaxing . new age people do all believe that a new future time is coming in which people will be more aware of their own special spiritual nature and this will make the world a different and better place .
