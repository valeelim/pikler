Los Angeles River     the los angeles river ( also called : el rio de nuestra senora la reina de los angeles de porciuncula or porciuncula river ; spanish : `` river of the angels '' ; informally la river ) is a river flowing through los angeles county , california , in the united states . about long , it flows from canoga park south and west to its end at the long beach harbor , in san pedro bay , part of the pacific ocean . the basin is rimmed by the san gabriel mountains , santa monica mountains and santa susana mountains , as well as several smaller mountain ranges . much of the water that flows in the los angeles river flows in from tributaries that come from the mountains . the river was once free-flowing , winding across a floodplain that occupied much of the los angeles basin . with its frequent floods , it often changed course , causing erosion and depositing silt in other places . when the city of los angeles had its first settlers around the 1850s , the river was its main water source . with the opening of the los angeles aqueduct in 1913 , the los angeles river was no longer needed as a water source . today , the los angeles river runs in a fixed course through a concrete channel for nearly its whole length . it is heavily polluted . the primary source of water during summer and fall is the donald c. tillman water reclamation plant in van nuys . plans for restoration of the river are being discussed .
