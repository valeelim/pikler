Ratite     the ratites are a group of medium to large birds , most of which are flightless . most of them , including the largest ( moas and elephant birds ) are now extinct . unlike other flightless birds , the ratites have no keel on their sternum . in a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles . most parts of the former super-continent gondwana have ratites , or did have until the fairly recent past . their closest living relatives are the tinamous of south america . the classification used here includes all ratites in the order struthioniformes , but not the tinamous . this may change in future . it was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group , which evolved together in gondwana in the upper cretaceous . then they evolved in their separate ways as gondwana split up , and the parts drifted apart . the parts became the modern southern continents , plus africa and the indian subcontinent . however , modern gene analysis conflicts with this . dna analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common gondwanian ancestor . however , all analyses show that rheas ( south america ) and the living australasian/oceanian ratites `` are '' monophyletic .
