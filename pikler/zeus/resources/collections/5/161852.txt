Jet lag     jet lag is a physiological condition , often occurring when humans travel from one time zone to another . it happens because of the time difference between two places . some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do . if the departure time ( the original body clock ) is not the same as the destination time , jet lag can occur . traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west . that is because a cycle of the human 's biological time is usually more than 24 hours , and going east makes the day shorter , which is a more difficult adjustment . jet lag can have several symptoms . it usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia . also , headache , depression , even nausea may strike people . sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment . using caffeine ( such as in tea or coffee ) is helpful , either in the morning when going westward or in the afternoon when going eastward . the hormone melatonin is said to help people sleep . also , doing things like changing sleeping patterns several days before departure may help people adjust to the new time zone .
