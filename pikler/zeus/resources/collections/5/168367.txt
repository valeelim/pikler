Thermal conductivity     thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat . metals are good at heat conduction . they are good conductors of heat . gasses are also good conductors of heat . thermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity . this means not conducting heat much . materials with high resistivity are called `` thermal insulators '' and are used in clothing , thermoses , home insulation , and cars to keep people warm or in refrigerators , freezers , and thermoses to keep things cold . thermal conductivity is often represented by the greek letter `` kappa '' , formula_1 . the units of thermal conductivity are watts per meter-kelvin . watts are a measure of power , meters are a measure of length , and kelvins are a measure of temperature . from the units , we can see that thermal conductivity is a measure of how much power moves through a distance due to a temperature difference . some great thermal insulators are : vacuum , aerogel , polyurethane some great thermal conductors are :
