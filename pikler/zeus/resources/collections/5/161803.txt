Fire drill     a fire drill is a sudden practice event , where people leave a building . they are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building . the event is started when a fire alarm sounder or bell keeps on sounding . the entire building is evacuated and everybody leaves the building using the nearest fire exit . at a school , college or university , the teacher or the lecturer counts the people outside to find out if anyone is missing . sometimes people are evacuated for no reason . this is called a false alarm . in the united kingdom , the law says that all schools must do a fire drill at the start of the academic year in september , and suggests that one should occur every term . also , regular health and safety checks such as testing fire alarm systems and fire extinguishers must be done weekly . in the united states , different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills . for example , in many states , schools must have one fire drill per month . fire drills commonly take place in schools , colleges and public companies . in public transport such as cruise ships , it is called a muster drill . fire drills are n't done on airplanes , but a safety demonstration that shows the emergency procedures of the aircraft is done instead . if an aircraft is about to perform an emergency landing , the passangers on the aircraft are told to take the safety brace position on hearing the `` brace '' command .
