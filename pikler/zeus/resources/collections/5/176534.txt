Gravitational wave     gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime which are created whenever objects with mass move . they were predicted by albert einstein in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity . as gravitational waves are not created from stationary objects , they must be detected from moving systems . sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes . on february 11 , 2016 , the advanced ligo team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging . in june the virgo team announced that they too had detected the waves . in physics , gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that travel outward from the source . albert einstein predicted them in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity . in theory , gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation . in general relativity , gravitational waves can not travel faster than the speed of light . they do not exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation , in which physical interactions propagate at infinite speed . however , the detection of gravitational waves proves the last prediction of einstein â€™ s general theory of relativity .
