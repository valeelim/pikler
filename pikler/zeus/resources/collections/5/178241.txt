Minbar     a minbar ( also called mimbar sometimes , ) is a special place in a mosque . it is used by the imam to speak to the congregation , to deliver sermons . usually , minbars are raised ( to be higher than the crowd , much like pulpits ) ; these sermons are usually called `` khutbah '' ( خطبه ) . in a minbar , the speaker is standing while he is giving the lecture . an alternative to this is to have a hussainia where the speaker can sit down while giving the lecture . very often , the minbar is shaped like a small tower . the minbar is located to the right of the mihrab , the niche that indicates the direction of prayer ( i.e . towards mecca ) .
