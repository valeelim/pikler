SS-Verfügungstruppe     the ss-verfügungstruppe ( the combat support force ) ( short : ss-vt ) were combat divisions of the ss , trained to the same way as the normal german armed forces ( wehrmacht ) . they were the precursor of the later-developed waffen-ss . on 24 september 1934 , a special ss military unit was made up by a group of a few other nazi and paramilitary units like units known as ss special detachments ( ss-sonderkommandos ) and the guard known as the ( ss-stabswache ) units . the new group was to be trained as combat ready infantry . the unit was called ss-special purpose troops ( ss-verfügungstruppe ) and was not the police or the armed forces but military trained men for the use by the führer in war or peace . the ss-verfügungstruppe ( known as ss-vt ) was told to the public on 16 march 1935. the ss-vt trained with hitler ’ s body guards some of which later joined the ss-vt prior to the invasion of russia in 1941 some units of the ss-vt worked with the wehrmacht during the take over of the sudetenland , austria , and czechoslovakia , and took part in the invasion of poland along with the campaign against the allies in the west . from the regiments that made up the ss-vt came the waffen-ss ( or `` armed '' -ss ) divisions that fought in all german theaters in world war ii . units making up the ss-vt were not known as the `` waffen-ss '' until a speech by adolf hitler in july 1940 .
