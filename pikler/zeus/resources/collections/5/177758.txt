Acryl     acryl is a name for a number of chemical compounds that have an acrylic group , or of polymers of these compounds . especially esters of acrylic acid are used to help make certain dyes and paints or as adhesives . in organic chemistry , the acryloyl group is the functional group with structure hc=ch–c ( =o ) – ; it is the acyl group derived from acrylic acid . the preferred iupac name for the group is prop-2-enoyl . it is also ( less correctly ) known as acrylyl or simply acryl . compounds containing an acryloyl group can be referred to as `` acrylic compounds '' . an acrylic compound is typically an α , β-unsaturated carbonyl compound : it contains a carbon–carbon double bond and a carbon–oxygen double bond , separated by a carbon–carbon single bond . it has therefore the properties characteristic for both functional groups : - at the c=c bond : electrophilic addition of acids and halogens , hydrogenation , hydroxylation and cleavage of the bond - at the c=o bond : nucleophilic substitution ( such as in esters ) or nucleophilic addition ( such as in ketones ) . the carboxyl group of acrylic acid can react with ammonia to form acrylamide , or with an alcohol to form an acrylate ester .
