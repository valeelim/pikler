BDSM     bdsm is an initialism for bondage/discipline ( `` bd '' ) , dominance/submission ( `` ds '' ) , and sadism/masochism ( `` sm '' ) . it means some kinds of sex play , sometimes these are called kink or fetish . they all have to do with trying to get sexual happiness out of things that are often painful or upsetting . people try to do this in a safe way by agreeing on a `` safe word '' . if someone says this word the whole play stops . this is to stop the play from going too far and causing real physical or emotional hurt . bdsm is thought about as a safe thing to do if it does some things . these things are often said in one of two different ways . the first way they are said is to say `` safe , sane , and consentual '' ( ssc ) . the second way they are said is `` risk aware consentual kink '' ( rack ) . what those sayings mean is that both people have to agree on what to do . they also have to be safe , which means that they have to know the risks and be careful . people who do bdsm play are very careful to follow those rules because they can hurt or kill their partner if they do not .
