Crossbow     the crossbow , or arbalest , is a weapon which consists of a bow-like arc called `` prod '' and cross-wise body called `` stock '' and trigger mechanism . the crossbow is an invention in which the stock , a piece of wood is mounted on two other crossing pieces . crossbows shoot short arrows called `` bolts '' which are similar to arrows . the crossbow was first created by the chinese people in circa 6 b.c . the greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century b.c . the romans called the weapon `` arcuballista '' . crossbow was a very popular weapon in the middle ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon . the arabs call crossbow `` qaws ferengi '' , `` european bow '' , for this reason as the crusaders used crossbow a lot . a good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour . against unarmoured light opponents , even a single bolt may be lethal . compared to the ordinary bow , the crossbows have good and bad sides to them . they fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows , and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow . on the other hand , because the prod is short and therefore very stiff , a crossbow will take much longer time to load , and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than an ordinary bow . many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position . also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot .
