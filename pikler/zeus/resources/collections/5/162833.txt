Apicomplexa     the apicomplexa are a large group of protists ( protozoa ) which are parasitic . they have developed some extraordinary adaptations which fit them in their parasitic life . they are all single-celled , they are all parasites of animals , and they all form spores . they have a unique organelle , a plastid called an apicoplast , and an apical complex structure which gets them into a host 's cell . they do not have structures such as flagella or pseudopods except in certain gamete stages . body movement is by flexing or gliding . the group were once called the sporozoa , but this name is now discouraged . apicomplexans have complex life cycles , and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups . both asexual and sexual reproduction occur . cell nuclei are haploid . this is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia , gregarines , piroplasms , haemogregarines , and malarias . diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include : - babesiosis ( `` babesia '' ) - malaria ( `` plasmodium '' ) - coccidian diseases including :
