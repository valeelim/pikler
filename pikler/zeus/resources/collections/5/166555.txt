Habitable zone     a habitable zone ( hz ) in astronomy is a region of space where conditions are best for life to form as on earth . planets in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life . the habitable zone may also be called the `` life zone '' , `` comfort zone '' , `` green belt '' or `` goldilocks zone '' . one in five stars has an earth-sized planet in the habitable zone . however , it is not known what proportion would have conditions suitable for life . the goldilocks principle or 'goldilocks effect ' is that something must be within limits : `` not too hot , not too cold , but just right '' . it is taken from a children 's story `` the three bears '' in which a little girl named goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears . each bear has their own preference of food , beds , etc . after testing each of the three items , goldilocks determines that one of them is always too much in one extreme ( too hot , too large , etc . ) , one is too much in the opposite extreme ( too cold , too small , etc . ) , and one is `` just right '' .
