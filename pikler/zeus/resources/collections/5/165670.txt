Plant sap     plant sap , or just sap , is fluid transported in xylem tubes or phloem cells of a plant . xylem cells transport water and inorganic nutrients through the plant ; phloem cells transport sugary fluids and other biological molecules . latex or resin is not plant sap . they are separately produced , with different components and functions . xylem sap is mainly water , with plant hormones , mineral elements and other nutrients in a dilute solution . sap in xylem moves from roots towards the leaves . phloem sap is water , with manufactured sugars , other biological molecules and mineral elements dissolved in it . it flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored to where they are used . a large number of animals , all of the single insect order hemiptera , feed directly on phloem sap , and make it the primary component of their diet . phloem sap is `` nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents , [ but ] it is consumed as the sole diet by a very restricted range of animals '' . phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion : it is thought that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack adaptations to this diet .
