Astronomical spectroscopy     astronomical spectroscopy is the science of using spectroscopy to figure out what elements astronomical bodies , such as stars , planets and nebulae , are made of . it can also be used to work out how those objects are moving , using doppler shift . the study of spectroscopy and spectra is used in astronomy to help scientists study the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , which radiates from stars and other hot celestial objects . spectroscopy can be used to find properties of distant stars and galaxies . it can find out their chemical composition , temperature , density , mass , distance , luminosity , and relative motion using doppler effect measurements . newton used a prism to split white light into a spectrum of color , and fraunhofer 's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin . it was not until the 1850s that gustav kirchoff and robert bunsen explained the dark lines . hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum , and hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths . however , hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses show a near-continuous spectrum with `` dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses '' . by comparing the absorption lines of the
