Mathematical induction     mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth . it can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers ( all the positive whole numbers ) . the idea is that - something is true for the first case - that same thing is always true for the next case then - that same thing is true for every case in the careful language of mathematics : - state that the proof will be `` by induction over formula_1 '' . ( formula_1 is the `` induction variable '' . ) - show that the statement is true when formula_1 is 1 . - assume that the statement is true for any natural number formula_1 . ( this is called the `` induction step '' . ) - show then that the statement is true for the next number , formula_5 . because it 's true for 1 , then it is true for 1+1 ( =2 , by the induction step ) , then it is true for 2+1 ( =3 ) , then it is true for 3+1 ( =4 ) , and so on . an example of proof by induction : prove that for all natural numbers `` n '' : proof : first , the statement can be written : for all natural numbers `` n ''
