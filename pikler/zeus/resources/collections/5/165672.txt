Threatened species     threatened species are any species ( including animals , plants , and fungi ) which might soon become extinct . the world conservation union ( iucn ) are the experts on threatened species . they put threatened species into three groups , each group in more danger than the next : - vulnerable - endangered - critically endangered one way scientists can work out how threatened a species is , is to measure the birth and death rates . if a species becomes small in numbers , it can get to a critical point . this happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species ( critical depensation ) . species that are not a threatened species , but are still a concern , can be put into groups of near threatened , least concern , and conservation dependent . conservation dependent is no longer used a group . when the species has not been studied , not evaluated , or there is not enough information , data deficient , the iucn does not put them on the threatened species list . threatened species are also called `` red listed '' species , because they are in the iucn red list of threatened species .
