Desiro     desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by siemens of germany . the desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit ( dmu or emu ) . it is normally made as two and three-car trainsets . although there are many differences between single trains , the basic body design is the same . these trains are mostly used for regional services , and belong to a new generation of light , modular trains which have become common in many europen countries . they are sometimes thought as light regional railcars . they are mostly cheap to make and work . their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations . however , they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort . in austria , the öbb ( austrian federal railways ) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered desiro trains called `` öbb 5022 '' . these are based on the class 642 used by deutsche bahn , but have added more safety stuff . in 2005 and 2006 , in bulgaria , the bulgarian state railways begin working desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with siemens ag for a total of 25 diesel multiple units . as of 22 march 2006 , 16 trains had been delivered , with many of them working on the sofia-kyustendil-sofia line . another €117-million deal for 25 emus has also been signed with siemens ag . the emus were fitted out in varna , where bdz and siemens ag are thinking about making a joint venture company . the emus are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the sofia and plovdiv areas .
