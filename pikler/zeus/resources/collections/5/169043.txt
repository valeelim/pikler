Riemann hypothesis     the riemann hypothesis is a mathematical conjecture . many people think that finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics . the hypothesis is named after bernhard riemann . it is about a special function , the riemann zeta function . this function inputs and outputs complex number values . the inputs that give the output zero are called zeros of the zeta function . many zeros have been found . the `` obvious '' ones to find are the negative even integers . this follows from riemann 's functional equation . more have been computed and have real part 1/2 . the hypothesis states all the undiscovered zeros must have real part 1/2 . the functional equation also says all zeros ( except the `` obvious '' ones ) must be in the critical strip : real part is between 0 and 1. the riemann hypothesis says more : they are on the line given , in the image on the right ( the white dots ) . if the hypothesis is false , this would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given .
