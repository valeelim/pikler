Epiphyte     an epiphyte is a plant which grows on another plant , without being a parasite . the term is also be used for bacteria , fungi , lichens and mosses which grow on plants . however , most epiphytes ( 89 % ) are flowering plants ; and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes . an epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain , and sometimes from debris accumulating around it . the ones in the temperate zone are often mosses , liverworts , lichens and algae , and in the tropics ferns , cacti , orchids , and bromeliads . sometimes such plants are called air plants , because they do not root in soil . this is misleading though , as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well . epiphytic organisms only take support from the host ; they are usually not parasites . parasitic and semi-parasitic plants , like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes . epiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy ; often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater ( and moisture from the air ) if they are not aquatic .
