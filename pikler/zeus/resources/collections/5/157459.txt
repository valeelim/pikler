ICD     the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ( also known as icd ) is a list of codes that classify diseases and medical problems . a special , unique code is given to : - every medical condition ( including mental health problems ) - specific symptoms , if it is not clear what condition is causing the symptom . ( for example , if a person has a cough , but his doctor does not know why , he would just use the icd code for `` cough '' . ) - changes in the body , or test results that are not normal ( if it is not clear what condition is causing these changes ) . - injuries or illnesses that are caused by things outside of the body ( for example , broken bones , burns , and poisonings ) - social issues that may cause health problems ( for example , if a person 's job causes health risks , or if the person 's health is at risk because of poverty ) icd is published by the world health organization . one of the icd 's goals is to make sure that different doctors - and different countries - are using the same diagnoses . this makes it easier to compare how diseases affect different countries .
