SHA hash functions     the sha hash functions are cryptographic hash functions made by the national security agency ( nsa ) and the nist . sha stands for secure hash algorithm . the three sha algorithms are different and are called `` sha-0 '' , sha-1 , and sha-2 . `` sha-2 '' uses one algorithm with different sized digests . the number of bits in the digest are put after 'sha ' in their names , like `` sha-224 '' , `` sha-256 '' , `` sha-384 '' , and `` sha-512 '' .
