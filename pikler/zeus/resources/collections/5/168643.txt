ATLAS experiment     atlas ( a toroidal lhc apparatus ) is the biggest experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . it is one of the six particle detector experiments ( alice , atlas , cms , totem , lhcb , and lhcf ) built at the lhc . lhc is a new particle accelerator at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) in switzerland . atlas is 44 metres long and 25 metres in diameter , weighing about 7,000 tonnes . the project is led by fabiola gianotti . the project has 2,000 scientists and engineers at 165 institutions in 35 countries . the project began operation on 10 september 2008. atlas studies highly massive particles which could not be studied using earlier lower-energy accelerators . atlas may start new theories of particle physics beyond the standard model .
