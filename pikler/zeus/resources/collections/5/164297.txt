Dolly (sheep)    dolly ( sheep ) dolly ( 5 july 1996 â€“ 14 february 2003 ) was a sheep , remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell . a somatic cell is a regular body cell , not an egg cell . the nucleus of the somatic cell was removed and put into an unfertilised egg cell . the process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer . she was cloned at the roslin institute in edinburgh , scotland . it took 277 attempts to create dolly . the success rate when cloning animals is very low . the cell used as the donor for the cloning of nam was taken from a mammary gland . the production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual . she was cloned so she did not need any male cells to fertilize the egg and mature it . she only has one parent . dolly lived the rest of her life at the roslin institute in edinburgh untill she died . there she was bred with a welsh mountain ram and had six lambs in total called ; bonnie , rosie , lucy , sally , darcy and cotton .
