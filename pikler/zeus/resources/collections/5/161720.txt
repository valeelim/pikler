Tapestry     tapestry is art made with threads . it is woven by hand on a vertical loom . it is weft-faced weaving . this means all the warp threads ( the ones that go up and down ) are hidden in the completed work . in normal cloth weaving both the warp and the weft threads can be seen . in this way , a colourful pattern or image is made . most weavers use a natural warp thread such as linen or cotton . the weft threads , which will be seen , are usually wool or cotton . they can also be made of silk , gold , silver , or other things . both craftsmen and artists have made tapestries . the 'blueprints ' on cardboard ( also known as 'tapestry cartoons ' ) were made by artists , while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by craftsmen . the success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability ( le corbusier once called tapestries `` nomadic murals '' ) . kings and noblemen could roll up and transport tapestries from one residence to another . in churches , they were displayed on special occasions . tapestries were also draped on the walls of castles for insulation during winter , as well as for decorative display .
