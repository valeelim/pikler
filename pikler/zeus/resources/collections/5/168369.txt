Hydride     a hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements . except for a few of the noble gases , all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides . the properties of hydrides can be very different , but some of the hydrides have similar properties . `` ionic hydrides '' : compounds with ionic bonding . they are very reactive , making them difficult to dissolve . most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides . `` metallic '' or `` interstitial hydrides '' : these have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity . they are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice ( framework of metal atoms ) . metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table . some of these are used in the nickel metal-hydride battery . `` covalent hydrides '' : these have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element . most of the p-block elements form covalent hydrides . many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated . hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon , ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen , and water is a hydride of oxygen .
