Parallax     parallax is the perceived change in position of an object seen from two different places . in astronomy , annual parallax is the only direct way to measure distance to stars outside the solar system . in essence , parallax is the phenomenon which occurs when an object is viewed from different positions . it is measured by the angle between two lines of observation . nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from identical positions , so parallax can be used to determine distances . astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to celestial objects including to the moon , the sun , and to stars beyond the solar system . here , the term `` parallax '' is the angle between two sight-lines to the star . astronomical measurement of position are taken at different times of the year . since the earth 's orbit is known exactly , the distance from position 1 to position 2 can be worked out . then , the angle from the horizon to the object can be measured precisely . this gives a triangle whose baseline and angles are known accurately . from the triangle , the distance is calculated by trigonometry .
