Glow fuel     glow fuel is a term used to tell about fuel used for model airplanes , helicopters , cars and boats . glow fuel can be burned by very simple two stroke engines or by four stroke engines . engines like this provide lots of power in a small size . sometimes , glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel . some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro , but some fuel has none at all . it is called `` fai fuel . '' `` fai '' stands for fédération aéronautique internationale . they say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix . glow fuel is mostly made of methanol , nitromethane and oil . methanol is the main ingredient . it provides most of the fuel 's ability to burn . in order to burn the glow fuel , a glow engine must have a glow plug . the glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol . since the engines turn very fast , a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs . a small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started . once the engine is running , the electricity is disconnected .
