Diapause     diapause is a delay in development which has evolved in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions . it is a physiological state with very specific conditions . diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable , unfavourable environmental conditions , such as temperature extremes , drought or reduced food availability . it is most often observed in arthropods , especially insects , and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order cyprinodontiformes . not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions , but once it is started , only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause . this distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation . activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species . diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage , such as the pupae and eggs , or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations , such as the adult monarch butterfly , `` danaus plexippus '' . in cases where the insect remains active , feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted .
