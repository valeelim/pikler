Seal (device)    seal ( device ) a seal is something such as a piece of wax which has an official mark on it , and which is attached to an important letter or document to make it official . it can also mean the device ( e.g . a metal stamp or ring ) which is used to make the official mark . the word comes from the latin “ sigillum ” . the study of seals is called sigillography . seals are used on documents to prove that they really did come from the person who signed it ( they “ authenticate ” the document ) . a seal could be put on the letter itself , or on the envelope where it is stuck down . the writer would pour some wax over the joint of the letter , then press a ring or metal stamp ( called a matrix ) which has his official mark on . this meant that no one would be able to open the letter and then close it again , because the seal will break when the letter is opened . most governments still put seals on important documents . letters do not normally have seals any more , even important letters . sometimes lead , pewter or ivory were used instead of wax .
