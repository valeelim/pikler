Susanna (Book of Daniel)    susanna ( book of daniel ) the story of susanna and the elders is found in some bibles inside chapter three of the book of daniel . these sections are sometimes called additions to daniel . modern jewish and protestant bibles do not have this story but catholic and orthodox ones have it . this story is found before daniel 1:1 as a prologue in very old greek texts . it is found as chapter 13 in the vulgate and modern catholic bibles . in the story , two bad judges secretly want to have sexual intercourse with susanna , a beautiful and virtuous wife . one hot day , she takes a bath inside her walled garden but she does not know that the judges are hiding inside the garden . the judges tell her to have sex with them but she does n't want to . when she refuses , they tell the people of the village that they saw her having sex with a man who was not her husband . this is called adultery , which was against the law at that time . the people of the village believe the judges and want to kill susanna . a boy named daniel does not believe the judges , so he asks one of the judges to go away and the other one to say what he saw . daniel does this again with the other judge . the judges tell different stories , showing that they lied . the people get mad and kill the judges instead .
