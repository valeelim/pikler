Group center     in abstract algebra the center of a group g denoted by z ( g ) is the set of elements which commute with every element of g , meaning that for any element x of a group g , and an element y of z ( g ) , xy = yx . the center is equal to the intersection of the centralizers of the group elements . the notation z ( g ) comes from the fact that in german the word for center is `` zentrum '' .
