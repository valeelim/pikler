Musket     a musket is a muzzleloading , smoothbore firearm , which is meant to be fired from the shoulder . the musket is the weapon that replaced the arquebus , and was then replaced by the rifle . but the word `` musket '' is also used to describe a number of different weapons including : - a long , heavy weapon with a matchlock or wheellock and loose powder fired with the gun barrel resting on a stand - a lighter weapon with a flintlock or percussion cap firing mechanism , with a bayonet . muskets were made for use by infantry . a soldier armed with a musket was called a musketman or musketeer . in the 1500 's , soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus , called a musket , supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen . by the start of 1700 's , a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus . when the bayonet was added , there was no longer a need for pikemen , and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers . the first musket made in the united states was the springfield model 1795 musket . in the 1800 's , better ammunition and ways of firing the gun , meant that rifling was practical for military use , and the rifled musket became common . a few years later , the use of cartridges , breechloading , and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the `` rifled musket '' gave way to the rifle , and `` muskets '' were no longer used .
