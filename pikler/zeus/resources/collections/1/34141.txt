Castrato     a castrato ( plural `` castrati '' ) was a type of male singer with a very high voice . the effect was produced either through castration , or because of some hormonal problems . the word `` castrato '' literally means castrated . such singers were very sought after in the early days of the opera . most of the main soprano roles in operas by handel and other composers of that time were written for castrati . nowadays they are almost always sung by female sopranos , since there are no castrati left . the practice of castrating young boys who had good singing voices was quite common in italy in the 17th century . when castration is done before puberty , the usual effects of puberty will not happen . these include the vocal cords enlarging and growing bigger , and the voice getting deeper as a consequence . even though castration was illegal in many parts of italy , it was often performed . many families who were poor had their children castrated because it might give them a better future . once a boy was castrated he would go to a special music school where children learned singing and musical instruments . the castrati pupils were given special treatment . they were fussed over and kept warm to stop them from getting colds . when they grew up they hoped to become famous opera singers . a few of them had very successful careers in opera . they were the great stars of their day , and audiences came to the opera to cheer on their favourite singers . those who were not good enough to make a career in opera joined church choirs instead .
