Hierarchy     a hierarchy ( in ; this comes from '-hieros , sacred , and '-arkho , rule ) is a way of ranking and organizing things or people . beneath the top of the hierarchy , each part of it is below some other part . this turns out to be like a pyramid . it is a system to decide who can make decisions , and who is forced to comply with those decisions . an example with people would be the structure of a company . there is the top manager , and there are a few levels of middle and lower management . at the bottom are the common workers . another example would be an army that might have a general , followed by colonels , corporals , and sergeants , then privates . in democracy this is done by educating people in the issues and then voting - in an election to choose leaders , or a referendum to actually choose one option from several . competing power networks each form a political party and each offers only one leader or one option to the public , to simplify the issues to make decisions possible . after the decision , they typically do not fight it to the point of civil war , but wait for the next election .
