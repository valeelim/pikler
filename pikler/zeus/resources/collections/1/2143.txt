Light year     a light year ( symbol : ly ) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year . since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second ( about 186,000 miles per second ) , then a light year is about 10 trillion kilometers ( about 6 trillion miles ) . a light year is not a length of time . the light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge . space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds , thousands or millions of light years away . think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on earth . light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us . when we see the star 's light , we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago . similar distance measurements . - `` light minute '' - the distance that light travels in one minutes ( about 18,000,000 km per minute , or 11,160,000 miles per minute ) . - `` light second '' - the distance that light travels in one second ( about 300,000 km per second , or 186,000 miles per second )
