Lake Vostok     lake vostok is the biggest of the seventy lakes in antarctica that are under the ice . it is at 77° s 105° e. it is under russia 's vostok station . it is 4000 meters ( 13,000 feet ) under antarctica 's surface . the lake was found by russian and british scientists . they used radar to find it . the lake consists of fresh water . the temperature of the water is about -3°c . the freezing point of water is at 0 c , but the water in the lake remains liquid because of the high pressure of the ice . there are two separate basins in the lake . these are separated by a ridge . it has been suggested that the ecosystems of the two basins are different . lake vostok is an oligotrophic extreme environment . it is supersaturated with oxygen . the levels of oxygen are fifty times higher than those typically found in ordinary freshwater lakes on earth . the weight of the ice on top of lake vostok is believed to add to the high concentration of oxygen . oxygen from the ice gets dissolved into the water of the lake . deposits of oxygen and other gases are trapped in the lake as well . the structure that traps them is called a clathrate . gases trapped in clathrates are enclosed in ice , they look like packed snow . these structures form at the high-pressure depths of lake vostok ; they would become unstable if brought to the surface .
