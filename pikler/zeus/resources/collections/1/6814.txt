Exponent     an exponent tells you how many times a number ( known as the base ) is multiplied by itself for example : if you see formula_1 , 5 is the base and 7 is the exponent . therefore , in this example , 5 is multiplied by itself 7 times e.g . formula_2 . the exponent in formula_3 is 3. this can also be written as formula_4 bases raised to the second power or formula_5 are known as squared values bases raised to the third power or formula_6 are known as cubed values exponents are used in algebra . exponentiation is a way of shortening the process/equation of repeatedly multiplying a number by itself . an exponent is a number or symbol , placed above and to the right of the expression to which it applies , that indicates the number of times the expression is used as a factor.the exponent `` x '' in formula_7 indicates formula_8 multiplied by itself `` x '' times . there are some basic rules used in exponentiation 1. product rule : proof - when you are multiplying a base term by two different exponents formula_10 there are `` m '' number of `` a ' '' s and `` n '' number of `` a '' 's
