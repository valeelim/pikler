Ship     a ship is a large vehicle used to travel on water . it is bigger than a boat . ships are used for travel , trade and war . the first ships used oars or the wind ( or both ) to make them move . from about 4000bc the ancient egyptians were making wooden sail boats . by 1200bc the phoenicians and greeks had begun to make bigger sailing ships which were about 30 metres ( 100 feet ) long and could carry 90-180 tonnes of cargo . the romans made even bigger ships which could carry up to 1,000 people and 1,000 tonnes of cargo . the 8th century saw the rise of the vikings , who were famous for their `` longships '' and which were mainly used for raiding other countries , but also for trading . the longships had flat bottoms so they could move in shallow ( not deep ) rivers . sailing ships were used for thousands of years , but they were very important in wars and trade from the 1500 's to the 1800 's . the chinese admiral zheng he commanded a fleet of 'treasure ships ' on seven voyages all over asia up to east-africa in the early fifteenth century . these ships probably were about 130 m ( 450 ft ) long and up to 50 m ( 180 ft ) wide . that makes them about twice the size of the largest european ships in the sixteenth century . the most successful and largest fleet in the 17th century was the dutch fleet ( see the netherlands ) . for trade and transport the dutch often used a particular kind of trading ship , called a flute ( `` fluit '' in dutch ) . transport of people and cargo on sailing ships continued until the 1920 's .
