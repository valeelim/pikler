Thunder     thunder is a very loud sound that is made sometimes during a very big rain storm . thunder is so loud , it can be heard from a very far distance . it can sound like a boom , a crash , or a rumble . thunder is made when lightning strikes . the energy from the lightning heats up the air so much that it makes a kind of explosion . when lightning is very near , thunder will be heard soon after the lightning flash , and the sound will be very loud . if the lightning is farther away , the thunder will be a few seconds or many seconds after the lightning . people can guess how far away the lightning is by counting the number of seconds between the time they see the lightning and hear the thunder .
