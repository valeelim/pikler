Lung     the lung is an organ in many vertebrates ( animals having a `` spine '' , or backbone ) . it gives blood oxygen from the air , and takes away carbon dioxide . most vertebrates that have lungs have two of them . in animals , the lungs are the area where gas exchange takes place . without gas exchange , oxygen would not pass into the blood from the lungs so the body cells would not be able to receive the oxygen needed for respiration . the alveoli are moist to allow oxygen to move from the lung through the alveoli into blood vessels and red blood cells . carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli . the oxygen-filled blood goes back to the heart and the carbon dioxide in the alveoli is pushed out of the lungs and into the air we breathe out . birds lungs do not have alveoli , instead they have millions of para-bronchi . these para-bronchi end up in tiny capillaries or very small blood vessels and they pass close to the body 's blood vessels , so diffusion can occur and the oxygen and carbon dioxide is exchanged . the oxygen and carbon dioxide in birds lungs are continuously diffused into and out of the blood , not like in mammals where diffusion can only happen in the alveoli . air does not go into and back out of the lungs as in mammals . instead , muscular air sacs push the air forward through bird lungs .
