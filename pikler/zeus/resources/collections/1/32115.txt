Article (grammar)    article ( grammar ) an article is a word that comes before a noun . there are two kinds of articles : definite articles and indefinite articles . in english there is just one definite article : `` the '' . there are two indefinite articles : `` a '' and `` an '' . the word `` an '' is used before a word starting with a vowel sound : we say `` a horse '' , `` a child '' , `` a european '' ( euro has a `` y '' sound ) , `` a university '' , but `` an orange '' , `` an elephant '' . some languages have more than one word for `` the '' . in some languages , this is because each noun is either masculine or feminine or , in some languages it can be masculine , feminine or neuter . for example : in french `` le '' is used for masculine nouns ( `` le jardin '' - `` the garden '' ) and `` la '' for feminine nouns ( `` la table '' - `` the table '' ) . `` the '' becomes `` les '' in front of plural nouns . the indefinite articles in french are `` un '' ( masculine ) and `` une '' ( feminine ) . german , dutch and ancient greek have masculine , feminine and neuter nouns , but in the case of dutch the word for `` the '' is the same for masculine and feminine ( `` de '' ) so you do not need to know which it is . the mƒÅori language uses one word for `` the '' for when the subject or object to which the `` the '' refers is one in number , and uses another word for `` the '' when the subject or object to which the `` the '' refers numbers more than one .
