Neuron     a neuron ( also known as a neurone or nerve cell ) is a cell that carries electrical impulses . neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part is the brain . every neuron is made of a cell body ( also called a soma ) , dendrites and an axon . dendrites and axons are nerve fibres . there are about 100 billion neurons in the human brain , which comprises roughly 10 % of all brain cells . the neurons are supported by glial cells and astrocytes . neurons are connected to one another and tissues . they do not touch and instead form tiny gaps called synapses . these gaps can be chemical synapses or electrical synapses and pass the signal from one neuron to the next . there are three classes of neurons : afferent neurons , efferent neurons , and interneurons . - afferent neurons carry information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system . - efferent neurons transport signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells . - interneurons connect neurons within the central nervous system .
