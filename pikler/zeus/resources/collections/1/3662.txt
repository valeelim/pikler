Vector     a vector is a mathematical object that has a size , called the `` magnitude '' , and a direction . for example , a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in . if you ask for directions , and a person says `` walk one kilometer towards north '' , that 's a vector . if he 'd say `` walk one kilometer '' , without showing a direction , it would be a scalar . we usually draw vectors as arrows . the length of the arrow is proportional to the vector 's magnitude . the direction in which the arrow points is the vector 's direction . examples of vectors . - john walks north 20 meters . the direction `` north '' together with the distance `` 20 meters '' is a vector . - an apple falls down at 10 meters per second . the direction `` down '' combined with the speed `` 10 meters per second '' is a vector . this kind of vector is also called `` velocity '' . examples of things that are not vectors ( scalars ) . - the distance between the two places is 10 kilometers . this distance is not a vector because it does not contain a direction .
