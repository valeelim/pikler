Mathematical analysis     mathematical analysis is a part of mathematics . it is often shortened to analysis . it looks at functions , sequences and series . these have useful properties and characteristics that can be used in engineering . the mathematical analysis is about continuous functions , differential calculus and integration . gottfried wilhelm leibniz and isaac newton developed most of the basis of mathematical analysis . an example for mathematical analysis is limits . limits are used to see what happens very close to things . limits can also be used to see what happens when things get very big . for example , formula_1 is never zero , but as n gets bigger formula_1 gets close to zero . the limit of formula_1 as n gets bigger is zero . it is usually said `` the limit of formula_1 as n goes to infinity is zero '' . it is written as formula_5 . the counterpart would be formula_6 . when the formula_7 gets bigger , the limit goes to infinity . it is written as formula_8 . the fundamental theorem of algebra can be proven from some basic results in complex analysis . it says that every polynomial formula_9 with real or complex coefficients has a complex root . a root is a number `` x '' which gives a solution formula_10 . some of these roots may be the same .
