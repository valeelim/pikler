Photography     photography is a way of making a picture using a camera . a person who makes pictures using a camera is called a `` photographer '' . a picture made using a camera is called a photograph or photo . a `` camera '' is , in its simplest form , like a box with a hole in front of it . there is a special piece of glass in front of the hole called a lens . to take a photograph of something , the lens makes a small picture of the object inside the camera . the lens does this by focusing light . a lens in a camera works like a lens in glasses ( spectacles ) or a magnifying glass . one type of camera called the pinhole camera has no lens but uses a very small hole to focus light . to make a photograph with a camera the `` shutter release '' button is pressed . pressing the button opens the `` shutter '' . the shutter is like a door . it covers the hole in the camera box . the shutter is behind the lens . when the shutter is closed no light can enter the camera box . when the shutter is open light can enter the camera . when the button is pressed the shutter opens and then closes . this happens very fast . the amount of time the shutter stays open for is called the `` shutter speed '' . the shutter speed can change between 1/1000th of a second ( 0.001 s ) to a few seconds . normally the time taken for the shutter to open and close is far less than 1 second .
