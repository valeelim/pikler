Bali tiger     the bali tiger , or balinese tiger ( `` panthera tigris balica '' ) is one of the three extinct sub-species of the tiger . they became extinct in 1937. they lived on bali . this was the first sub-species of tiger to become extinct . the bali was also the smallest tiger sub-species . there is no record of a balinese tiger ever being held in a zoo collection . the balinese tiger 's close sub-species were the javan tiger and the caspian tiger , which are now also extinct . the balinese and javan tigers were once the same , but during the ice age , bali became isolated from java by the bali strait . this split the tigers into two groups which then went onto develop alone . the killing of the very last wild balinese tiger is usually thought to have been at sumbar kima , west bali on 27 september , 1937. it was an adult tigress.so the government of bali made a strict law on killing tigers .
