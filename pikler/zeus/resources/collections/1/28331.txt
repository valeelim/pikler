Electromagnetic induction     electromagnetic induction is where a voltage or current is produced in a conductor by a changing magnetic flux . it may happen when a magnet is moved in a solenoid , thus changing the magnetic flux . when a coiled wire is introduced near a magnet , the magnetic lines of force pass through the coil . this causes the magnetic flux to change . magnetic flux is represented by the symbol formula_1 , therefore we can say that formula_1 = bacos ( a ) and the resulting unit will be formula_3 , where t is the unit for magnetic field and formula_4 is the unit for area . the changing magnetic flux generates an electromotive force ( emf ) . this force moves free electrons in a certain way , which constitute a current . michael faraday found that an electromotive force is generated when there is a change in magnetic flux in a conductor . his laws state that : formula_5 where , formula_6 is the electromotive force , measured in volts ; formula_7 is the change in magnetic flux , measured in webers ;
