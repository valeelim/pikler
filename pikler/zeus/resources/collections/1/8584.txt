Radio     radio is a way to send electromagnetic signals over a long distance , to deliver information from one place to another . a machine that sends radio signals is called a transmitter , while a machine that `` picks up '' the signals is called a receiver . a machine that does both jobs is a `` transceiver '' . when radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time , it is called a broadcast . television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound . radio signals can start engines moving so that gates open on their own from a distance . ( `` see : radio control. '' ) . radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance . sound can be sent by radio , sometimes through frequency modulation ( fm ) or amplitude modulation ( am ) . many people worked to make radio possible . after james clerk maxwell predicted them , heinrich rudolf hertz in germany first showed that radio waves exist . guglielmo marconi in italy made radio into a practical tool of telegraphy , used mainly by ships at sea . he is sometimes said to have invented radio . later inventors learned to transmit voices , which led to broadcasting of news , music and entertainment .
