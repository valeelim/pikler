Diphthong     a diphthong ( pronounced `` dif-thong '' or `` dip-thong '' ) is a vowel that the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make . it is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard . examples are : waist , die , noise , road , house , fierce , bear , sure . each of these is a different vowel sound . a monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make , like the `` oo '' sound in `` book . '' in a diphthong , the person combines two different monophthongs , as with the `` oi '' sound in the word `` oil '' . the speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an `` o '' sound , then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard `` e '' sound . another example is the `` ou '' sound in the word `` house '' . the mouth starts out making a sound like the soft `` a '' sound in `` flat '' , then moves to make the a hard `` oo '' sound like the one in `` caboose '' . just like with every other part of language , the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents .
