Babylon     babylon was a city-state of ancient mesopotamia , the remains of which are found in present-day iraq , about 85 kilometers ( 55 mi ) south of baghdad . all that remains of the original ancient famed city of babylon today is a mound of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile mesopotamian plain between the tigris and euphrates rivers . babylon was at first a small town which sprung up at the beginning of the 3rd millennium bc . the town flourished and attained prominence and political repute . babylon eclipsed nippur as the 'holy city ' of mesopotamia around the time hammurabi first unified the babylonian empire , and became the capital city of the neo-babylonian empire from 612 to 539 bc . the hanging gardens of babylon were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world , and the walls of babylon were also famous . during the reign of sennacherib of assyria , babylonia was in a constant state of revolt , and was suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of babylon . in 689 bc , its walls , temples and palaces were razed , and the rubble was thrown into the arakhtu , the sea bordering the earlier babylon on the south . this act shocked the religious conscience of mesopotamia . after the murder of sennacherib by two of his sons , his successor esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city . he was crowned there , and made it his residence for part of the year .
