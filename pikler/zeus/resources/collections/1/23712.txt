Nationalism     nationalism is a way of thinking that says that some groups of humans , such as ethnic groups , should be free to rule themselves . nationalists think that the best way to make this happen and avoid control or oppression by others is for each group to have their own nation . some nationalists think this is the best way to save small and weak groups threatened by the mixing of ethnic groups . the opposite of nationalism is internationalism and anti-nationalism . many early socialists were also nationalists . the earliest forms of nationalism had lots of socialist features . in this period , political thinkers who thought that ethnic groups should not be oppressed by other ethnic groups thought also that 'normal folk ' , the backbone of society , like workers and peasants , should not be oppressed by higher social classes like rich people . they thought that it is wrong for somebody to live in great welfare that is made of the hard work of others , or the oppression of others . all the social classes should work together and have a common goal that aims for the good of everyone . these goals can be called `` national interest '' . national interest is ideal and not always easy to find . there are different ways to reach national interest , for example politics .
