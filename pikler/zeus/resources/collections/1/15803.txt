Fair use     fair use is the idea that it should be okay for a person to reuse something that another person has created , in certain amounts and for certain purposes , without breaking the law . in most countries , art and other made-up things , like stories , books , tv shows , and pictures , are owned by the person that first made them . this person can let someone else own the things they make , sometimes for money . the person that owns these things has a `` copyright '' for them , which means that person can decide who can copy their work . if someone else copies that work without asking the owner first , that person is breaking the law . the owner can take the person to court and try to get money from them because of what they did . since a lot of creative work is popular , people want to talk about them , and they may want to talk about them on tv or in a book . this might mean that they want to use a little bit of it when they talk about it . the idea of `` fair use '' was added to most copyright laws to make sure that it would be ok do to this , as long as only a little bit of someone 's work is used .
