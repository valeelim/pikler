Screw     a screw is a sharp piece of threaded metal similar to a nail . unlike a nail , a screw has spiral grooves down its spike . a screw is pressed down against wood and turned with a screwdriver . the grooves cut into the wood . this prevents the screw from falling out , as a nail might . screws can be made of steel , iron , brass , bronze , plastic , etc . there are also machine screws and self-tapping screws . machine screws are bolts which have screw threads . the threads matched with nuts with female threads . screw threads are measured either in millimeters or in numbers . they are used in furniture , doors , appliances , etc . screwing is the neatest way of holding together two materials . if no glue is involved , then the screwing can be dismantled . these are three different types of screw . 1. countersunk : first you drill a pilot hole into the wood . then you can widen out the top by using a countersink drill bit . the head is flat on the top . 1. raised head : has a slightly domed head , raised above the surface .
