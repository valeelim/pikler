Chemistry     chemistry is a branch of science that deals with chemical elements and compounds , and how these things work together . it is the study of the materials ( things ) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us . before 1600 , people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold , but no one managed to do that . this was called alchemy . alchemis separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it . they also processed special minerals from a mine in sweden to get rare earth metals . radioactivity was also discovered . today chemists have discovered 118 different elements . some are very common , like oxygen . many are very rare and expensive , like platinum . some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs , like rutherfordium . since the 1920s , the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists ' theories about chemical reactions . with smaller and faster computers , chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances . these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars . police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes .
