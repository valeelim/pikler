Continental shelf     a continental shelf is the part of the continent that is under water . the shelf was part of the land during the ice ages in the glacial periods , but under water in the interglacial periods . we are at present in an interglacial period . every continent is in the sea , like an island . most of the island is above the water line , and we see it as a continent . some of it though , is below the water line . beyond the continental shelf , the bottom goes down to much greater depths . the continental shelf is a shallow ocean . it varies in depth , up to 140 metres deep . it varies greatly in its width . at the leading edge of a moving continental plate there will be little or no shelf . the western edge of the americas are an example . the shelf on a passive edge of a plate will be wide and shallow . the widest shelf is the siberian shelf in the arctic ocean : it is 1500 km ( 930 miles ) in width . there have been , at some periods , shallow seas `` inside '' continents . these are called epicontinental seas . much of present-day north america was covered by an epicontinental sea called the sundance sea during the jurassic period . in the cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the western interior seaway .
