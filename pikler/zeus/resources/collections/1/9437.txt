Supply     in economics , supply is the amount of something that firms are willing to provide in a market . the law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold . there are various factors that can make a seller more or less willing to produce and sell a good . the more common ones are : - price of variable inputs : variable inputs refers to the factors of production used to produce a good . when the cost of using these factors increases , the overall cost of producing the good increases as the marginal cost of producing the good increases . firms thus produce lesser for the same amount of resources used and supply becomes lesser . - productivity : when factors of production becomes more productive , it is able to produce a greater output for the same amount of resources used . productivity improvements include improvements in technology , increased training for labor , better usage of resources , etc . - government policies : when the government intervenes in the market , it can do so by subsidizing or taxing the production of the good . when a subsidy is provided , it lowers the marginal cost of producing the good , thus allowing firms to produce more for the same amount of resources used , thereby increasing supply . when a tax is used , the marginal cost of producing the good increases . firms now produce lesser for the same amount of resources used and supply becomes lesser .
