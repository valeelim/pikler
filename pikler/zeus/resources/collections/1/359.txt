Hair     humans and some other animals have lost much of their hair through evolution , and some other mammals , such as the elephant and the whale , have almost none at all . hair can have different functions : - it can protect against losing body heat . this is thought to be the basic , original function of hair . - it protects against uv radiation , which damages the skin . - it can protect against rain or water . air can be trapped in the fur , or oil can be secreted by the skin . both these methods prevent the rain or water from making the body too cold . aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber ( fat ) under the skin , and almost no hair . - defence : hair is modified in mammals like porcupines , for protection . - hair colouring can perform different functions . it helps to camouflage in some animals , and to signal to others of the same species in some other animals . examples are : signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control . signalling danger to other species ( aposematic colouring ) is also done by , for example , skunks .
