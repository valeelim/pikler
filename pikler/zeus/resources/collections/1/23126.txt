Space probe     a space probe is an unmanned space mission , usually a small spacecraft sent out to find out information about a planet or other far away thing . as a tool of space exploration a planetary probe may land on the planet , or orbit around it , or merely fly by closely . probes use radio waves to send information back to earth or sometimes to a manned spacecraft . a space observatory leaves the earth to look at distant objects , but does not go near the objects , so it is not called a `` probe '' . related pages . - exploration of mars
