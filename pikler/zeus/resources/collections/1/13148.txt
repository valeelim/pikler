The Republic     the republic is a book by plato . it was finished in 390 bc . it asks the question 'why should people do good things ? ' and also the question 'are people punished for doing bad things ? ' . plato said that people should not do bad things because people who do bad things end up unhappy . however , people who do good things end up happy . he also said that if people who do bad things get power in a society then that society will become an unhappy one . plato believed that philosophers are best able to do good things and so they should be given power in a society . he thought that non-philosophers should allow themselves to be ruled by philosophers and that if they do this then they will be happy , because the rule of peoples ( democracy ) often fall because of unreasonable confusion . however , in order not to be tempted to do bad things , the philosophers who have power must not be able to have things or feel love . plato also talked about many other things while discussing these questions including metaphysics , psychology , religion and most branches of philosophy .
