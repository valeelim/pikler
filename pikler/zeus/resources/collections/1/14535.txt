Political status of Taiwan     the political status of taiwan is a difficult situation that many people disagree about . there are two countries in the world that call themselves china . the people 's republic of china ( prc ) is the country most people think of when they hear the name china . the republic of china ( roc ) also calls itself china . it is better known in most of the world as taiwan . taiwan was a part of china from the late 1600s . after the first sino-japanese war , taiwan and penghu were given to japan by china . after world war ii , the japanese on taiwan surrendered to the chinese . this gave taiwan back to the chinese . after losing a civil war in 1949 , the roc government fled to the island of taiwan . it took control of taiwan and several nearby islands . the prc controlled mainland china . it also said it owns the island of taiwan ( which is also known as taiwan province ) and the other islands . the roc said that it was the rightful government of china and it included all of china , including taiwan and mongolia . in 1971 , the roc lost its united nations seat as china . the seat was given to the prc instead . this made the prc the rightful government of china internationally . most countries have accepted the prc as the leaders of china . several countries , including the united states , have been careful to not say officially which parts of the original china are part of the prc . 23 countries have official diplomatic relations with taiwan . nearly all of the other countries still have some diplomatic relations with them . the major problems are about whether taiwan is a still part of the prc or should be an independent country .
