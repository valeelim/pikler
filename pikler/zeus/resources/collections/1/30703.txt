Basso continuo     basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the baroque period . it means `` continuous bass '' . basso continuo , sometimes just called `` continuo '' , was played by a keyboard instrument and another bass instrument such as cello , violone ( an old form of double bass ) or bassoon . the keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord , or , if it was being played in a church , an organ . it was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player . the composer normally just wrote the bottom line which would be played by the left hand ( usually with a lower 8th doubling ) , and by the cello or whatever the instrument being used . the composer would indicate what the harmony should be ( which chords should be played ) by writing figures underneath the music . this is why it is called figured bass or sometimes thoroughbass . the continuo player will `` realize '' the figured bass , i.e . he will improvise the chords which are shown . in 19th and early 20th century editions of old music the figured bass part was normally realized ( written out ) by the editor , while starting from the mid 20th century editions of ancient music print the figured bass .
