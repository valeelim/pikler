East-West Schism     the east-west schism ( sometimes also called great schism ) describes how christianity developed into two big branches in the middle ages . the western part later became the roman catholic church . the eastern part is known as the eastern orthodox church . during the centuries views on politics and theology developed differently in several ways . it is distinct from the earlier schism that separated oriental orthodoxy from the church that split in half later . during the 5th and 6th centuries the east and west became isolated from each other due to the invasions of the balkan peninsula . they also had different languages . latin was the most important language in the west . the east mainly spoke the greek language . because of this , talking to each other was difficult . the west came under frankish influence ( as opposed to byzantine ) in the 700s . these were just some of the issues plaguing the eastern and western christians that led to the great schism . it seems that even after 1054 relations between the east and west were not completely unfriendly , and the common peasant was probably not immediately affected by the schism .
