Word order     word order is a part of grammar . it is the part of syntax that has to do with the order words are in a sentence . the word order is often different between languages . for example , in english , people say `` i only play tennis sometimes . '' in german , they would say `` ich spiele nur manchmal tennis , '' which if they translate only the words says `` i play only sometimes tennis . '' in norwegian that same sentence would be `` jeg spiller bare tennis noen ganger '' , directly translated to `` i play only tennis some times '' in english . in portuguese this sentence could be `` eu só jogo tênis algumas vezes '' ; translating each word to english : `` i only play tennis some times '' . or even in portuguese people can change the word order to `` eu jogo tênis só algumas vezes '' ( `` i play tennis only some times '' ) , but they can not say `` eu jogo só tênis algumas vezes '' , because this means `` i play only tennis sometimes '' . in english , a simple sentence with a verb ( an action ) , subject ( who or what is doing the action ) , and an object ( whom or what the action is done to ) is written in a subject-verb-object word order ( svo ) . for example , in the sentence `` robert opens the door '' , robert is the subject , opens is the verb and door is the object . this word order is only the second-most common word order among all languages , in which 42 % are svo languages . other examples of svo languages include mandarin chinese , bahasa melayu , bahasa indonesia , spanish , french , italian , thai , vietnamese , and several others . while some of these languages have grammar features that allow them to have different word orders such as sov and vso , these languages use svo for the simplest sentences .
