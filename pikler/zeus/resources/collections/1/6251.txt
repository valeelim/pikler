Orbit     an orbit is the path that an object takes in space when it goes around a star , a planet , or a moon . it can also be used as a verb . for instance : “ the earth `` orbits '' around the sun. ” the word ‘ revolves ’ has the same meaning , but 'rotates ' is the spin of the object . many years ago , people thought that the sun orbits in a circle around the earth . every morning the sun came up in the east and went down in the west . it just seemed to make sense that it was going around the earth . but now , thanks to people like copernicus and galileo galilei , we know that the sun is the center of the solar system , and the earth orbits around it . isaac newton discovered that gravity controls the orbit of the planets and moons . since a satellite is an object in space that revolves around another object , the earth is a satellite of the sun , just like the moon is a satellite of the earth ! the sun has lots of satellites orbiting around it , like the planets , and thousands of asteroids , comets , and meteoroids . the earth just has one natural satellite ( the moon ) , but there are many artificial satellites orbiting the earth .
