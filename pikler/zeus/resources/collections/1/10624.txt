Marsupial     marsupials are the main part of an infraclass of mammals called the metatheria . this consists of the marsupials and their extinct ancestors . marsupials give birth to living babies . the babies are called `` joeys '' . the babies feed on milk . their babies are born very small . marsupials have a special pouch where they carry their babies . after the birth the baby goes into its mother 's pouch , where it can drink milk and is kept warm and safe . when the babies are young they stay in the pouch all the time , but when they are older they can leave it for short times . when they are old enough and too big for the pouch they do not go into their mother 's pouch anymore . marsupials evolved before the southern supercontinent gondwana broke off from pangaea 100 million years ago . early marsupial fossils have been found in asia , from 125 million years ago . they were outcompeted on laurasia by placental mammals , but the placentals did not get into the australasian part of gondwana before it broke away into a separate supercontinent . that is why marsupials now found native only on the southern continents of australasia and south and central america , with the single exception of the `` virginia opossum '' .
