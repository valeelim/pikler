Spamming     spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person . spam emails are the computer version of unwanted `` junk mail '' that arrives in a mailbox , such as advertising pamphlets and brochures . spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender . the emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam . the person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer . both of these words came from a brand of canned meat called `` spam '' , but it was a short sketch created by the british comedy group monty python in 1970 that led to the word `` spam '' being widely used to mean unwanted email messages . spam emails are usually sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service . the people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email , and do not want to receive it . one of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once . spam messages can easily be sent , sometimes even by a special computer program .
