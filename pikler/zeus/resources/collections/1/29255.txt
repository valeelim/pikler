Eugenics     eugenics is a social and political philosophy . it tries to influence the way people choose to mate and raise children , with the aim of improving the human species . eugenics rests on some basic ideas . the first is that , in genetics , what is true of animals is also true of man . the characteristics of animals are passed on from one generation to the next in heredity , including mental characteristics . for example , the behaviour and mental characteristics of different breeds of dog differ , and all modern breeds are greatly changed from wolves . the breeding and genetics of farm animals show that if the parents of the next generation are chosen , then that affects what offspring are born . `` negative eugenics '' aims to cut out traits that lead to suffering , by limiting people with the traits from reproducing . `` positive eugenics '' aims to produce more healthy and intelligent humans , by persuading people with those traits to have more children . in the past , many ways were proposed for doing this , and even today eugenics means different things to different people . the idea of eugenics is controversial , because in the past it was sometimes used to justify discrimination and injustice against people who were thought to be genetically unhealthy or inferior .
