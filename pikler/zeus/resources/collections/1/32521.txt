Standard     a standard is a basis for comparison . standards are made either by many people that agree on something , or if some organisation makes it so . there are many different standards in many fields of daily life . standards are important so that correct comparisons can be produced . other standards make things work together . for example , rail cars with a standard gauge can run on tracks that follow the same standard . communication protocols such as morse code and usb are standards that allow different machines and people to communicate . the international system of units is a standard that is agreed on by most countries . in it there is metre ( or meter ) . it measures length . a rod ( made from a special material ) is in paris . the length of the rod said , years ago , how long a meter is . when people wanted to measure something , they compared it to the length of the rod . for practical purposes , the length of the rod was divided by 10 ( to get dezimeter ) , by 10 ( to get centimeter ) , and so on . the iridium rod as it is called is the original measure of meter . now new ways of measuring the meter have been utilized such as the measuring the wavelength of radiation from a certain chemical element to determine an exact meter .
