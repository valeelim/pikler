Atlantis     atlantis is a name for a fictional large island or small continent that supposedly had been in the atlantic ocean many years before it sank into the depth of the sea and vanished within a day and a night . the story of atlantis first appears in the stories timaeus and critias by the greek philosopher plato . in all of his books , plato used many interesting stories to help explain his ideas about government and philosophy . no other ancient writer gave specific details about atlantis until after plato wrote , so most people today think that plato just made up this story . after plato , the idea of atlantis was mostly forgotten until 1882 , when a writer named ignatius donnelly wrote a book saying that atlantis was real and that the culture of atlantis had started many other ancient cultures , such as the egyptian and mayan . after donnelly 's book , many people became interested in atlantis and began to say that it had aircraft , submarines , powerful energy crystals , and other things that are not known from ancient times .
