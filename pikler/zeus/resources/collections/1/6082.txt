Candle     a candle is a stick made of wax with a string ( a thin piece of rope ) straight in the middle . if someone puts the string on fire , the flame burns slowly but for a long time . fire can burn string very fast . but in a candle , the string does not burn fast , because the fire melts the wax instead . the wax sometimes drips down the side of the candle . when the melted wax is far from the flame , it gets hard again , and can be used again in a new candle . the flame is very hot , since it is a very small , real fire . the light blue part of the flame can be as hot as . it can still burn people and things . if the fire spreads , it can grow into a very big fire and even burn down a house or building . if the flame is kept on the candle long enough , the candle will slowly get shorter and shorter until it is gone . the fire on a candle can be put out by blowing air on it . there is also a special tool called a `` candle snuffer '' that covers the fire with a small metal cup and puts it out . today , candle snuffers are usually only used in churches or in places where candles are up very high . stopping the fire stops the candle from burning until it is all gone .
