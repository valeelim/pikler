Actor     an actor is a person who acts , or has a role ( a part ) in a movie , television show , play , or radio show . sometimes actors only sing or dance , or sometimes they only work on radio . a woman actor is also an actress , but today most people use the word `` actor '' for both men and women . the first time we know an actor worked was in 534 b.c. , probably on november 23. the changes in calendar between then and now means that we are not sure it was november 23. this actor was called thespis and he was greek . the place where the play happened was called the `` theatre dionysus '' . he was the first person to speak words as a character . this was a big change in storytelling . before then , people sang and danced stories , but no one had been a person in the story . today we call actors `` thespians '' because of thespis . in the past , the name `` actor '' was only for men . women only began performing often in the 17th century . people called them the `` actresses '' . in the ancient world and in the middle ages , people thought it was bad ( shameful ) for a woman to act . people thought this until the 17th century . in the time of william shakespeare , men and boys played women 's roles , but women may have acted secretly .
