Slang     slang are words that are informal . usually each generation or social group has its own slang - for example , older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people . on the other hand , younger people often understand , but find silly or old-fashioned , the slang of older people . over time , language tends to get more complex , since new words enter much faster than old words leave . over time , slang almost always becomes part of the language , and approved for use by all . it has also happened that some words used in anglo-saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by latinate words like `` urinate '' , `` defecate '' and `` copulate '' - which polite people were supposed to use after the norman conquest of england in 1066. this was in part a way of making poor people ( who spoke anglo-saxon ) all appear to be rude , while more powerful people ( who spoke norman ) appeared to be polite - one way that etiquette can develop , and reinforce power structure . this is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group 's language as 'slang ' and another as 'correct ' .
