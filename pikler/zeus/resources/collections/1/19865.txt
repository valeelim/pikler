Catalysis     catalysis is the change in speed ( rate ) of a chemical reaction due to the help of a catalyst . unlike other chemicals which take part in the reaction , a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself . a catalyst may participate in many chemical reactions . catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts . catalysts that slow the reaction are called negative catalysts , or inhibitors . substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters , and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons . a catalyst is something which changes the rate of a chemical reaction . an example is when manganese oxide ( mno ) is added to hydrogen peroxide ( ho ) , and the hydrogen peroxide starts to break up into water and oxygen . catalysts are either of natural or synthetic origin . catalysts are useful because they leave no in the solution they have speeded up . a catalyst can also be used in a reaction again and again as it is not used up . there are many catalysts in our body which play an important part in many biochemical reactions . these are called enzymes . most catalysts work by lowering the 'activation energy ' of a reaction . this allows less energy to be used , thus speeding up the reaction . the opposite of a catalyst is an `` inhibitor '' . inhibitors slow down reactions . some of them are found in snake venom and are dangerous for our nervous system or heart .
