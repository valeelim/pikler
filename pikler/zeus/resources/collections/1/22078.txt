Computability theory     computability theory is part of computer science . scientists want to know what can be computed , and what can not . there is a model of a computer that is used for this . it is called the turing machine . a turing machine basically is a special typewriter with an endless ribbon . the machine is named after the mathematician alan turing . a problem is `` computable '' if it can be expressed in such a way that a turing machine can solve it . one of the best known examples is the halting problem . the task is to write a program which says for all programs whether they will finally stop . this is impossible to decide . mathematicians say the problem is undecidable .
