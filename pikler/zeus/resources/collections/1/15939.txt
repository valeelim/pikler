Rwanda     rwanda is a country in africa . it is near burundi , congo-kinshasa , uganda , and tanzania . the official language is kinyarwanda . it is now known mostly because it is the place where the most efficient genocide in history happened . during the scramble for africa , belgium conquered rwanda . the belgians then began to divide rwandans into groups : bahutu , and batutsi . the belgians picked people that they thought looked more european to be abatutsi . the rest became abahutu . the belgians told rwandans that batutsi were superior to bahutu . they allowed batutsi to rule over bahutu . on july 1 , 1962 , rwanda became independent and bahutu were given power . thus , anti-tutsi purges occurred frequently . many abatutsi fled to uganda , where they formed the rwandan patriotic front , or rpf , which tried to invade rwanda in 1990. on the night of april 6 , 1994 , dictator juv√©nal habyarimana 's plane was shot down , but it is still not clear who did it . within half an hour , roadblocks manned by the interahamwe militia were seen all over the capital , kigali . the rwandan genocide had begun . it lasted for about 100 days , and it left over one million , ( 1,000,000 ) , tutsi and moderate hutu dead . the main weapon used was the machete , or `` umupanga '' . other countries paid little attention to the killing . on july 2 , 1994 , the rpf captured kigali . the other countries let the rwandans sort out their own problems because they did n't care .
