Magnet     a magnet is a very special metal . when a magnet goes near a special kind of metal or other magnets , and the poles ( sides ) touching are opposite , it will pull , or `` attract '' the other metal or magnet closer . also , if the two poles are the same , the two magnets will push away , or `` repel '' , from each other . this is called `` magnetism '' . magnets can make some other metals into magnets when they are rubbed together . soft magnets ( or impermanent magnets ) are often used in electromagnets . these enhance ( often hundreds or thousands of times ) the magnetic field of a wire that carries an electrical current and is wrapped around the magnet . the field of the `` soft '' magnet increases with the current . permanent magnets have ferromagnetism . they occur naturally in some rocks , particularly lodestone , but are now commonly manufactured . a magnet 's magnetism decreases when it is heated and increases when it is cooled . it has to be heated at around 1000 degrees celsius . like poles ( s-pole and s-pole/n-pole and n-pole ) will repel each other while unlike poles ( n-pole and s-pole ) will attract each other .
