Fermat's primality test    fermat 's primality test fermat 's primality test is an algorithm . it can test if a given number `` p '' is probably prime . there is a flaw however : there are numbers that pass the test , and that are not prime . these numbers are called carmichael numbers . fermat 's little theorem states that if `` p '' is prime and formula_1 , then if we want to test if `` n '' is prime , then we can pick random `` a '' 's in the interval and see if the equation above holds . if the equality does not hold for a value of `` a '' , then `` n '' is composite ( not prime ) . if the equality does hold for many values of `` a '' , then we can say that `` n '' is probably prime , or a pseudoprime . it may be in our tests that we do not pick any value for `` a '' such that the equality fails . any `` a '' such that when `` n '' is composite is known as a `` fermat liar '' . if we do pick an `` a '' such that then `` a '' is known as a `` fermat witness '' for the compositeness of `` n '' . `` formula_5 '' is the modulo operation . its result is what remains , if p is divided by n. as an example ,
