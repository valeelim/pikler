Fluid dynamics     fluid dynamics talks about how fluids ( liquids and gases ) work . it is one of the oldest parts of the study of physics , and is studied by physicists , mathematicians , and engineers . mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations . the fluid dynamics of gases are called aerodynamics . understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents . for example , fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather , because clouds and air are both fluids . fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water . computer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids . computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much , and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer . studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics ( or cfd for short ) .
