Olfaction     olfaction is the sense of smell . the sense of smell is how a human or animal notices a smell ( or odour or odor ) by using the nose . many animals have better noses than people . some animals can detect small particles in the air or sometimes water that people can not . people have special cells in the nose that can detect some chemicals . these are special nerve cells attached to the olfactory epithelium . all vertebrates have these cells . the smell is first processed by the olfactory system . the information is given to the olfactory bulb in the front of the forebrain . in insects , smells are sensed by sensilia on the antennae and first processed by the antennal lobe . the olfactory reception ( or ) cells are neurons ( nerve cells ) . many tiny hair-like cilia stick out of these cells into the mucus covering the surface of the epithelium . the surface of these cilia is covered with olfactory receptors , a kind of protein . there are about 1000 different genes which code for the ors , though only about a third are functional . the rest are pseudogenes . the or genes are the largest gene family . an odor molecule dissolves into the mucus of the olfactory epithelium and then binds to an or . various odor molecules bind to various ors . the basis of the sense of smell is that different groups of scent molecules bind to different receptor cells and so fire different groups of neurons . inside the olfactory region of the brain , the firing of neurons produces the perceived smell .
