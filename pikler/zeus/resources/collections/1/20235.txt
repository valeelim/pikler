Methane     methane is a hydrocarbon that is a gas at room temperature ( 20Â°c ) . its molecular formula is ch , so it has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms per molecule . it is often found as the main part of natural gas . methane is a greenhouse gas 23 times more effective than carbon dioxide . it is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water . methane is used in gas taps in places such as chemistry classrooms , laboratories , etc . as it burns very easily because of its simple molecular structure . methane 's molecular structure is very simple . it is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms . methane can be produced by many chemical methods , but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation , after it is become liquid .
