Radioactive decay     most chemical elements are `` stable '' : if they are not part of a chemical reaction , they do not change . chemical elements are made of atoms . in stable elements , the atom stays the same . in a chemical reaction , the atoms will form chemical bonds , with other atoms . even if the bonds change during a reaction , the atoms themselves do not . in the 19th century , henri becquerel discovered that some chemical elements have atoms that change : during their change they send out a particle . in 1898 , marie and pierre curie called this phenomenon radioactive decay . becquerel and the curies were awarded the nobel prize in physics for this discovery , in 1903. most carbon atoms have six protons and six neutrons in their nucleus . this carbon is called carbon-12 , because 12 is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons in the carbon-12 nucleus ( six protons + six neutrons = 12 ) . its atomic weight is 12. if a carbon atom has two more neutrons it is carbon-14 . carbon-14 acts chemically like other carbon , because the six protons and six electrons are what govern its chemical properties . in fact , carbon-14 exists in all living things ; all plants and animals contain carbon-14 . however , carbon-14 is radioactive . it decays by beta decay . it can be detected and measured . carbon-14 , in the small amounts found about us in nature , is harmless . in archeology , this kind of carbon is used to determine the age of wood and other formerly living things . the method is called radiocarbon dating which is one kind of radiometric dating .
