Donald Bradman     sir donald 'don ' bradman ac ( 27 august 1908 – 25 february 2001 ) , often called the don , was an australian cricketer . he was a batsman . when he played his last test match , he only needed to score four runs to have a batting average of 100 runs over the whole of his test match career . but he was `` out for a duck '' ( out before he scored any runs ) after facing only two balls so his average was 99.94 , which was still much higher than any other batsman 's average . most cricket experts think he was the best batsman of all time . he was a great hero in australia , and he was voted the greatest australian of the 20th century . the don 's command over the game showed as a batsman , as a captain , as a selector , as a writer and as an administrator . jeff thomson remarked that bowling to don was one of his `` greatest moments '' . this happened in 1977–78 in adelaide during india 's tour to australia . in thomson 's words before the first match of the tour , england had not told australia what they were going to do , but when england named 5 fast bowlers ( including harold larwood and bill voce ) . it was not usual to have so many fast bowlers in one team , so bradman knew that england were about to try something new . the new way of bowling was first tried in a warm-up match which bradman played in , and as expected bradman struggled . bradman did not play in the first test match of the tour , which led some people to think this was because his had suffered a nervous breakdown . england still tried their new way of bowling , and won the match but the australian team were not happy .
