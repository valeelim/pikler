Wave     a wave is a disturbance in the medium which causes the particles of the medium to undergo vibratory motion about their mean position . the motion repeats in equal intervals of time and can be described by a periodic function . waves play an important role in our daily life . this is because waves are a carrier of energy and information over large distances . waves require some oscillating or vibrating source . ocean surface waves were the first known waves . later , other kinds were discovered . types of waves . - in physics and technology , a wave ( physics ) carries energy that creates visible light , sound , and many other things there are two categories of waves . - mechanical waves - electromagnetic waves waves which require any medium for their propagation are called mechanical waves . for example : water waves , sound waves , and waves produced on the string and spring . - earthquakes produce seismic waves - a wave in the water , such as an ocean surface wave , is a disturbance on the surface ( top ) of water ,
