Nuclear war     a nuclear war is a war in which countries fight with nuclear weapons . because nuclear weapons are extremely powerful and could cause destruction throughout the world , the possibility of nuclear war has had a great effect on international politics . so far , two nuclear weapons have been used during warfare . they were used in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people . thousands of much more powerful bombs were made in later years . they have not yet been used in war . nuclear bombs were invented by the united states with british help during world war ii to help make that war stop . the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki and the soviet invasion of manchuria caused japan to surrender . they are still the only nuclear weapons that have ever been used in fighting a war . at that time only the united states had the technology needed to make the bomb , but within a few years the soviet union had developed it too . in the new cold war , the united states and the soviet union were enemies and each had many nuclear weapons , but they did not dare to use them against each other , either directly or by attacking the other country 's allies . since either country could be completely destroyed by the other 's weapons , nuclear war could no longer be limited to the use of only one or two bombs ; if they were used anywhere by one side , the other would attack with its own nuclear weapons , and the fighting would almost certainly become greater . this situation came to be known as the `` balance of terror , '' or mutually assured destruction , and stopped conflicts between the two superpowers from leading to a third world war .
