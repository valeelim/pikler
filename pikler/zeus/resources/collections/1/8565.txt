Power station     a power station ( or power plant ) is a place where electricity is produced . most do this by a big spinning electrical generator . in big powers stations the spinning is usually driven by a steam turbine . the steam may come from : - burning fossil fuels - nuclear power , using radioactive sources - using the earth 's heat , called geothermal energy - using the sun 's heat some do not use steam engines to spin the generator . rather they use : - hydropower , which uses the power of moving water to drive turbines - using the wind to drive wind turbines - internal combustion engine power a few power stations use the sun 's rays to generate solar power without motion . there are many power stations around the world , because many things need electricity to work . stations may be operated as load following power plant , peaking power plant , or base load power plant . energy sources . renewable energy resources . - renewable heat energy - solar thermal power - geothermal energy - renewable flow energy
