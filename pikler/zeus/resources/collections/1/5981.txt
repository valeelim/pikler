Commensurability     commensurability is a concept in the philosophy of science . scientific theories are described as `` commensurable '' if one can compare them to find out which is more accurate . if there is no way one can compare them to determine which is more accurate , they are `` incommensurable '' . behind this is the idea that it is possible to see the world in multiple ways , and that there is not one fair method to see which way is right . some think that scientific traditions ( or `` paradigms '' ) can be incommensurable : it is not really possible to say which one is right . this idea has been defended by thomas kuhn . he wrote : `` when paradigms change , the world changes with them '' . paul feyerabend was another philosopher who said that incommensurability was possible in scientific topics . he wrote that it is important to remember this , because it means that it is possible to say things that are not scientific , but also not wrong . these ideas were mainly aimed at karl popper and his ideas on falsification .
