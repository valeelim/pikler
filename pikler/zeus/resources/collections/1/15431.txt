Spectroscopy     spectroscopy is the study of light as a function of length of the wave that has been emitted , reflected or shone through a solid , liquid , or gas . to be analyzed the chemical is heated because it makes a special color of flame all chemicals make a different color spectrum than other chemicals . this can be used to see what chemicals are in a substance . spectroscopy allows scientists to investigate and explore things that are too small to be seen through a microscope , such as molecules , and the even smaller subatomic particles like protons , neutrons and electrons . there are special instruments to measure and analyze these light waves . infrared spectroscopy measures light in the infrared electromagnetic spectrum . the highlight of ir spectroscopy is that it is very useful in identifying functional groups of organic molecules . the absorption of infrared light by organic molecules causes molecular vibrations . the vibrational frequencies are unique to the individual functional groups . ir spectra is given graphically by transmittance ( % ) vs. wavenumber ( cm-1 )
