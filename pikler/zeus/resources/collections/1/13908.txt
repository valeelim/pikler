Derivative works     derivative work is a phrase used in copyright law . it is a piece of work ( for example : a novel , a song or a painting ) that is based on what someone else created . copyright law says that if someone writes a book , draws a picture , or writes a song , then it belongs to them . other people are not allowed to copy it unless the person who created it says that they can . this is important because it means the person who created the work can sell what they created and get money . a derivative work is one that is based on something else . if a person watches a movie , and then writes a story about the people in the movie , that story is a derivative work . if after hearing a song , someone sings the same tune with different words , the song they sung is a derivative work . in the law , if someone else has a copyright on something , no one is allowed to create a derivative work unless they say it is allowed . so if someone watches a movie , they are not allowed to write a story about the people in the movie unless the people who made the movie give them permission .
