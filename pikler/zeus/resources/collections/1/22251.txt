Rabies     rabies is a neurotropic virus , viral zoonotic disease that causes acute encephalitis . usually , people ( and animals ) die from it ( it is fatal ) . there is no cure for it . people who are treated soon after becoming infected have a chance to survive . the disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood . the usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal . pets , like dogs need to be vaccinated against it , in most countries . there is no cure for rabies . there is a vaccine against it . the vaccine was first developed by louis pasteur and pierre paul Ã©mile roux in 1885. this vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits , and weakened ( through drying it ) . the first person to be vaccinated was joseph meister ( a 9 year old boy who had been bitten by a dog ) . vaccines similar to this are still used today , but other vaccines ( growing the virus using cell cultures ) are more used . there is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten . it needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten . there is no way to know whether someone is infected , until it 's too late . treatment starts with washing the wound . this is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body . often patients are given one dose of immunoglobulin and a certain number of vaccines , over a determined period of time , usually a month .
