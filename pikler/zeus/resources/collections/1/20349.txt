Affenpinscher     affenpinscher is a small breed ( type ) of dog in the toy group . these dogs originally came from germany and are known to have existed since the 1600s . their name comes from the german word `` affe , '' which means `` monkey , '' because their faces remind people of monkeys . originally , the dog was bred to be a `` ratter , '' a type of dog that kills rats and mice in homes , farms , and stables . now that mice are not so commonly found in the home , affenpinschers are usually just kept as pets . the affenpinscher is a very small kind of dog , weighing between 3kg and 6kg ( 6lbs to 13lbs ) and standing between 23cm and 30cm ( 9 and 12 inches ) at the shoulder . their face is flat and `` monkey-like . '' the most common and preferred colour of fur for this breed is black , but they can also come in grey , beige , and other colours . in the american kennel club , a good example of these dogs could be any colour ; in the french and british kennel clubs they must only be black . affenpinschers are not terriers , but they do look and act a lot like terriers . even though they were bred to hunt mice , they do not like to chase other animals , so they can happily live with other pets . they are playful but very stubborn . these dogs can be difficult to train , because they do not like to listen to instructions and often become bored . affenpinschers are somewhat territorial ( protective ) when it comes to their toys and food , so they are not recommended for homes with very small children .
