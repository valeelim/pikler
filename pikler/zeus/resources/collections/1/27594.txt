Goaltender     the goaltender ( also known colloquially as goalie or netminder ) in ice hockey is the player who defends his team 's goal net by stopping shots of the puck from entering his team 's net , thus stopping the other team from scoring . they usually stay close to the net . at the very end of a game , if a team is losing by one goal , teams may take their goaltender out of the game and replace him with another player . this makes it more likely that they will score a goal , however , it is also much easier for the other team to score without anybody defending the goal .
