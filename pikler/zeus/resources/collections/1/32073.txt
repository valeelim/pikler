Unification of Germany     the process of the unification of germany occurred in the nineteenth century ( 1800â€“1900 ) . prior to unification , there were many states in central europe . some of them were very small , possibly no more than from one border to the other . many germans wanted a nation that was united , powerful , and influential . unification took place on 18 january 1871. at the conclusion of the franco-prussian war , the german princes proclaimed the german nation in versailles , france , at the hall of mirrors . unification joined together the many independent german states . these states became the german empire . the unification of germany began many years earlier , during the napoleonic wars . at the battle of leipzig in 1813 , which is also called the battle of nations , many of the german states joined with russia , sweden , and austria to defeat napoleon 's army . in the subsequent peace of vienna in 1815 , which ended the napoleonic wars , austria remained the most powerful of the german states , in terms of political power . prussia emerged as austria 's political and diplomatic rival .
