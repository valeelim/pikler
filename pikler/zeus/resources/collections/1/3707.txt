Bird     birds ( aves ) , a subgroup of reptiles , are the last living examples of dinosaurs . they are a group of endothermic vertebrates , characterised by feathers , toothless beaked jaws , the laying of hard-shelled eggs , a high metabolic rate , a four-chambered heart , and a strong yet lightweight skeleton . birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm ( 2 in ) bee hummingbird to the 2.70m ( 9 ft ) ostrich . they rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species , at approximately ten thousand , with more than half of these being passerines , sometimes known as perching birds . birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians . the fossil record indicates that birds evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs . true birds first appeared during the cretaceous period , around 100 million years ago . [ 3 ] dna-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceousâ€“palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago , which reduced the pterosaurs , and killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lineages . birds , especially those in the southern continents , survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling . [ 4 ] primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class aves proper , in the broader group avialae , have been found dating back to the mid-jurassic period , around 170 million years ago . [ 1 ] many of these early `` stem-birds '' , such as archaeopteryx , were not yet capable of fully powered flight , and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks , and long bony tails .
