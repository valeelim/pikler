Diesel engine     the name diesel is given to an engine invented by a german named rudolf diesel in the late 19th century . it is one of the most used kinds of internal combustion engine . most other engines need a system called an ignition system – one that uses an electric spark – in order to burn the mix of fuel and air and make power . other types of ignition systems use compressed air from an outside source , such as an air compressor . a diesel does not . it burns a diesel fuel ( similar to heating oil ) through very high compression or pressing together of the mix . a tiny bit of fuel is injected , or forced , into the engine 's cylinders at just the right moment . since gases heat when they are pressed together , the compression of the air and fuel mix cause the mix to explode within the cylinder . diesel engines make very good use of the fuel they burn . they also make lots of torque ( pronounced `` tork '' ) , or twisting power . an engine with a lot of torque will be able to spin its shaft even if it is very hard to do so . this makes a diesel engine a good choice in heavy equipment like trucks , trains and construction machines . the very big trucks on the road have diesel engines in them . so do train locomotives , unless they are electric or the old steam-powered kind .
