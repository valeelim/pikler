Briefs     briefs are a type of short underwear for males or females . they provide a close fit , and come in either white , or in other colors like blue , pink , or red . for male briefs , before 2000s , briefs often came with hard elastic waistband . this would cause stretch marks , and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband . however , hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear ( that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being fashion forward ) . female briefs are also called knickers or panties .
