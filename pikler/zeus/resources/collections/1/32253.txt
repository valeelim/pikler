Lie     a lie is something that someone says that is not true . people that are lying often want others to believe that the lie is the truth . people can have many reasons for lying , such as if they are hiding something , if they want something from you , or white lies . some people are pathological liars . different kinds of lies : - deception : tricking someone into believing something with a lot of lies over a longer period . `` the cult members were deceived by their leader . '' - distortion : getting rid of or adding details to a fact . if a scientist says that `` the medicine is safe in small amounts '' , a drug company can distort it and say `` the scientist says the medicine is safe '' . - white lies : telling a small lie make people feel better or for other reasons which do not harm anybody or anything . saying that a person likes what another person is wearing , even though they do not , is a white lie . white lies should not be confused with sarcasm . - exaggeration : saying that something is more or less than it really is , like saying `` i am starving to death '' when you are hungry but not close to dying . also used in tall tales ; `` our hero was three meters tall and strong as an elephant ! '' ( making a story more fantastic ) .
