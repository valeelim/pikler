Analysis     analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it . the technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before aristotle ( 384–322 b.c . ) , though `` analysis '' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development . the word comes from the ancient greek ἀνάλυσις ( `` analusis '' , `` a breaking up '' , from `` ana- '' `` up , throughout '' and `` lysis '' `` a loosening '' ) . in this context , analysis is the opposite of synthesis , which is to bring ideas together . the following concepts are closely related to this basic idea : - mathematical analysis is the name given to any branch of mathematics that looks at what functions are , how they behave , and what things can be done with them . - analytical chemistry looks at the qualities of substances , and their composition . some definitions . 1. the process of breaking up a concept , proposition , or fact into its simple or ultimate constituents . `` cambridge dictionary of philosophy '' . 2nd ed , 1999 , ed . robert audi .
