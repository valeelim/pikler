Hebrew language     the hebrew language is a semitic language . it is the language of the jews . the academy of the hebrew language is the main institution of the hebrew language . the language was spoken by israelites a long time ago - during the time of the bible . after judah was conquered by babylonia , the jews were taken captive to babylon and started speaking aramaic . hebrew was no longer used as much in day-to-day life , but it was still known by jews who studied religious books . in the 20th century , many jews decided to make hebrew into a spoken language again . it became the language of the new country of israel in 1948. people in israel came from many places , and decided to learn hebrew , the language of their common ancestors , so they could all speak one language . however , modern hebrew is quite different from biblical hebrew , with a lot of simplified grammar and loanwords from other languages , especially english . in order to read the bible in its original language , one must learn biblical hebrew , biblical aramaic and koine greek .
