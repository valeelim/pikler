British Empire     the british empire was made up of the colonies , protectorates , mandates and other territories which were controlled by the united kingdom . it began with the overseas colonies and trading posts set up by england between the late 16th and early 18th centuries . at its height , it was the largest empire in history , and the world 's most powerful superpower for more than a century . by 1922 , more than 458 million people lived in the british empire , which was more than one fifth of the world 's population at that time . the empire was larger than , almost a quarter of the earth 's total land area . since it was so large , the british empire has left a large legal , linguistic and cultural legacy . like the spanish empire before it , the british empire was often said to be `` the empire on which the sun never sets '' because it was so large that the sun was always shining somewhere in the empire . during the age of discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , portugal and spain were the first countries to begin exploring . this allowed them to create large and rich colonial empires . jealous of how rich spain and portugal became because of their empires , england , france , and the netherlands began to make colonies and trade networks of their own in the americas and asia . england fought and won some wars in the 17th and 18th centuries against the netherlands and france . after these wars , england ( and then , after the union between england and scotland in 1707 , great britain ) became the main colonial power in north america and india .
