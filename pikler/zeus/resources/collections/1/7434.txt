Suburb     a suburb is an area of a town or city , a little away from the main part , where there are fewer big buildings and mainly houses , schools and shops . these are called suburbs or 'the suburbs ' . sometimes , the suburbs cover a very large area . the suburbs are part of the metropolitan area and may be legally part of the main city , or not . since the beginning of the twentieth century , urbanization has spread very quickly and spread farther . transport in the form of trams , buses and cars allows commuting from distant homes to work in the inner city . this led to the growth of the suburbs . housing commonly includes detached and semi-detached houses and flats . houses are built farther apart than in the inner city and there is often space for gardens and parks . as cities grow outwards , they begin to take over the surrounding countryside . authorities have created green belts on the undeveloped land around a city to prevent urban sprawl and to prevent the towns and cities merging into one . they also encourages development within the town , and protect the countryside . the need for new houses , particularly large detached and semi-detached houses in pleasant surroundings , means that some areas of green belt land have been built on and others are threatened . that 's because it is cheaper to build on empty land than to redevelop brownfield sites in older parts of the town or city .
