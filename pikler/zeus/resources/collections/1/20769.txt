Acid rain     acid rain is rain that is unusually acidic . it is rain with high levels of hydrogen ions ( low ph ) . acid rain can have harmful effects on plants , animals and humans . it is caused when gaseous compounds of ammonium , carbon , nitrogen , and sulphur are released into the atmosphere . the wind carries the gases high into the sky . there the compounds react with the water in the atmosphere and acids are made . in 1852 , robert angus smith showed the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in manchester . he coined the term `` acid rain '' in 1872. acid rain is caused by acids mixing with air . the largest source of acid is sulfur dioxide . carbon dioxide and various oxides of nitrogen also make acid in the atmosphere . these chemicals are both natural and artificial . there are various natural causes , such as gases from volcanoes . however , it is thought that air pollution by people now causes most acid rain . people started producing more acidic gases when they started building factories and power stations . these buildings as well as houses and vehicles burn coal or oil that have sulfur in them . this releases gases into the air that produce acid rain . governments have tried since the 1970s to reduce the amount of sulfur being released into the earth 's atmosphere , and have had good results so far . however , it is expensive to clean the smoke from factories and power stations . in 2001 great britain still produced about five million tonnes of these gases every year ; and china produced 18 million tonnes . the united states produced more than 20 million tonnes then , which declined to 8.1 million in 2010 .
