Vaccination     a vaccination is a treatment which makes the body stronger against a particular infection . the body fights infections using the immune system , which is made up of millions upon millions of cells including t cells and b cells . an important feature of the immune system is that it is much stronger when fighting a disease which it has already fought against before . vaccination involves showing the immune system something which looks very similar to a particular virus or bacteria , which helps the immune system be stronger when it is fighting against the real infection . another word used for using vaccines is immunization . these words mean things that are a little different . vaccination is when a person is `` given '' something to make the immune system learn to fight an infectious disease . immunization is when a persons immune system learns to fight an infection . immunization can happen from vaccination . but immunization can also happen from getting the `` infection '' . for example , a person can be immune to hepatitis b if he gets sick with hepatitis b. after a person gets hepatitis b and then gets well , he is immunized from getting it again . a person can also be immunized from to hepatitis b by taking the hepatitis b vaccination .
