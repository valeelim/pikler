Salt     in chemistry , a salt is any neutral chemical compound made of cations ( positive ions ) attached to anions ( negative ions ) . the main kind of salt is sodium chloride . mixtures of salts in water are called electrolytes . electricity is able to pass through electrolytes , as well as molten salts . salts can melt ice , because salts lower the temperature needed for liquid to freeze . because of that , streets are treated with salt in winter . a salt can also be explained as an ionic compound which dissociates , forming a positive ion other than hydrogen ion , and a negative ion other than hydroxyl ion . the word `` salt '' in english often means 'table salt ' or 'edible salt ' ( which is salt that can be eaten ) . this kind of salt is made up mostly of `` sodium chloride '' ( nacl ) . it is one of the few minerals that are eaten a lot by humans , but it can be used for other things besides giving food its flavor . there are different kinds of edible salt : unrefined salt ( for example sea salt ) , refined salt ( table salt ) , and iodized salt . it is a crystalline solid that has the color white , pale pink , or light gray . it is usually taken from sea water or rock deposits . natural sea salt has little parts and pieces of other minerals besides sodium chloride . rock salts that can be eaten are sometimes a little grayish in color because of these other minerals .
