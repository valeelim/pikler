Hard disk     a hard disk drive ( hdd ) , hard disk or hard drive , is something used by computers to store information . the capacity of a hard drive is usually measured in gigabytes ( gb ) , however hard disc capacity can also be measured in terabytes when the capacity is over 1000 gigabytes . a gigabyte is one thousand megabytes and a megabyte is one million bytes , which means that a gigabyte is one billion bytes . some hard drives are so large that their capacity is measured in terabytes , ( tb ) where one terabyte is a thousand gigabytes ( 1 tb = 1000 gb ) . over the years there have been many disk interface types , though all used the same rotating platter recording technology . differences were in how the data was encoded to binary , data integrity , data transfer speeds , cabling requirements , and cost . as there are different kinds of hard disks , there are also different kinds of interfaces . in 2009 , it was common to attach a hard disk using a serial ata connection . the connection that came before that was called `` ide '' and is called parallel ata today . in large data centers , fibre channel is often used .
