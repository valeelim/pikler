Explosive material     explosives are chemical compounds that cause explosions ; they flare up and burst with a loud sound . explosive material has many special characteristics : it is a chemically unstable material , it changes its form very fast and , while changing its form , it explodes by bursting and making loud sounds . there are two types of explosives : low explosives and high explosives . this classification depends on their rate of explosion . low explosives `` conflagrate '' ( = burn very fast ) . high explosives `` detonate '' ( = explode with bursts ) . a low explosive is a material , which burns very fast , but does not explode generally . for exploding them , people mix them with high explosives . sometimes , even a low explosive may detonate . a high explosive bursts and explodes very fast . high explosives produce more pressure than low explosives but low explosives are more safe to use . people use low explosives in fuses , rocket engines and fireworks , and high explosives in mining and demolition ( destroying old bridges and buildings ) . military weapons use high explosives .
