Abortion     an abortion is when a pregnancy ends early without the birth of any live children . a developing human takes about thirty-eight weeks to grow and be born . normally , this occurs about forty weeks after the mother 's last menstrual period . this developing human is called an `` embryo '' for the first eight weeks of the pregnancy , and `` fetus '' for the rest of the pregnancy . an abortion takes place when the embryo/fetus is too young and small to survive without its mother . when an abortion occurs naturally , it is often called a miscarriage . humans can also chose to end the pregnancy before birth takes place . this is called an `` induced abortion '' . often , the term `` abortion '' often refers only to an induced abortion . in both types of abortion , the embryo or fetus usually comes out of the womb . this is called a `` complete '' abortion . in some cases , the embryo or fetus remains inside the womb . this is called a `` missed '' abortion . surgery is needed to remove the embryo or fetus from the womb so the woman does not get an infection .
