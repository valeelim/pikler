Diamond     a diamond ( from the ancient greek αδάμας – adámas `` unbreakable '' ) is a re-arrangement of carbon atoms ( those are called allotropes ) . diamonds have the highest hardness of any bulk ( all one type ) material . because of this , many important industries use diamonds as tools for cutting and polishing things . many of them are clear , but some of them have colors , like yellow , red , blue , green and pink . diamonds of a different color are called `` fancies '' . big diamonds are very rare , and are worth a lot of money . only 20 % of diamonds are fit for jewellery . the other 80 % are not pretty enough . they are industrial diamonds , used to make things like drill bits and diamond saws . this is because even a diamond that is not beautiful is useful because it is very hard . because many diamonds are beautiful , people make jewellery using them . diamonds are very effective electrical insulators , but also very good conductors of heat . on mohs scale of mineral hardness , diamonds are scored as 10 ( the highest score possible ) .
