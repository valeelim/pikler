Michael Johnson     michael duane johnson ( born in september 13 , 1967 ) , dallas , texas is an american retired sprinter . he is widely considered the greatest long sprinter of all time . during his time on the track , he established world records for the 400 m ( 43.18 seville , spain ) , indoor 400 m , indoor 300 m , 200 m , and 4 x 400 m relay . due to these achievements , and due to the vast difference between the 200 m and 400 m , johnson left little doubt that he is the greatest sprinter of all time . he won four olympic gold medals and eight world championships gold medals . a fifth olympic gold medal was taken back when it was learned that johnson 's teammates had cheated by using drugs . johnson had a unique upright posture when he ran so that he looked like a duck walk , which gave him the nickname `` the duck '' . his running gait did not make sense for running fast , but somehow worked . he won almost every race that he ever ran . he was the first athlete to win both the 200m and 400m sprints in the same olympic games ( atlanta , georgia ) .
