Krill     krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans about an inch or so long , found in all the oceans of the world . in areas with nutrients , they occur in huge swarms , with more than 10,000 krill per cubic meter . they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton . krill are ecologically very important , because they are near the bottom of the food chain . they make up the largest part of the diet of many animals . in the southern ocean , one species , the antarctic krill , `` euphausia superba '' , makes up an estimated biomass of over , roughly twice that of the human race . they are eaten by many animals , including whales , seals , penguins , birds , fish , squid , and whale sharks . of this , over half is eaten by each year , and is replaced by growth and reproduction . most krill species make large vertical migrations . they are distinguished from other crustaceans such as true shrimp by their externally visible gills . the order euphausiacea is divided into two families , bentheuphausiidae and euphausiidae . the first has one species , the second has 85 species . well known species are the antarctic krill ( `` euphausia superba '' ) , pacific krill ( `` euphausia pacifica '' ) and northern krill ( `` meganyctiphanes norvegica '' ) .
