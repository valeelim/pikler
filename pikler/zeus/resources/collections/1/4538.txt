Sahel     the sahel is a narrow belt of land in west africa . it is a strip of dry land about 5500 kilometers long and 450 kilometers wide . it lies at the southern edge of the sahara desert and is located between the dry desert land to the north and the forest areas to the south . the sahel has a tropical semi-arid climate . the temperature is high throughout the year . there is little rainfall in the sahel ( between 100-150 mm and 600mm ) . it is concentrated during summer months and can be unreliable . it may be very dry in some years , especially if a large area of low pressure , which brings rain , is not carried north over the sahel by strong winds . the sahel is the arabic word for 'edge ' or 'shore ' . the sahel is facing a big problem , desertification . as the climate of sahel was mainly dry and hot and leads to a high evaporation rate and also little rainfalls . the distribution of rainfall in the sahel region is uneven . the rainfall in the region has been below average since 1970. the sahel is becoming drier on the whole . the problem of drought affects most of the countries . as a result , crops and animals die . there is no vegetation to protect the soil , which is then removed by flash floods and strong wind . this leads to soil erosion . finally the desert spreads towards the surrounding areas .
