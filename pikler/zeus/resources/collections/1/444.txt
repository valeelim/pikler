License     a license ( or licence ) allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do . a person usually has to pay some money , and maybe pass a test to get a license . a license is usually written but it does not have to be . most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to . licenses may be temporary or permanent . some licenses can not be taken away once they are given . a person with a license is called a licensee . for example , john has a license to sell vegetables in the market for 10 years from 2010 to 2020. john grants an exclusive license to jane to sell vegetables for 4 years from 2012 to 2016. here , john will be referred as `` licensor '' and jane will be referred as `` licensee '' . in many countries , if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it , he might have to pay a fine or go to prison . there are many different types of licenses . the laws of most countries say that people are only allowed to drive cars if they have a driver 's license . if a person does not have a license , they may have to pay a fine if they are caught by the police . in many countries , a person must take a test and pay money to get a license . the test would check that they know the road rules , and have the skill to drive a car .
