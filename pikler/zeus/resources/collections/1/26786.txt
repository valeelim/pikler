Mobile phone     a mobile phone ( also known as a wireless phone , cell phone , or cellular telephone ) is a small portable radio telephone . the mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires . it works by communicating with a nearby base station ( also called a `` cell site '' ) which connects it to the main phone network . when moving , if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to , that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call . this is called a `` hand off , '' and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to . the hand-off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell . as mobile phones became more popular , they began to cost less money , and more people could afford them . monthly plans became available for rates as low as us $ 30 or us $ 40 a month . cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones and phone booths except for urban areas with many people .
