Line dance     line dancing is a form of group dancing that is done to either country or hip-hop music . the term line dance is derived from the idea that the group of people participating in the dance are all facing the same direct when conducting the series of moves in the line dance . a line dance can go from 32 beats upwards of up to 92 beats per minutes , and can also be either a 4 or 2 wall dance . when the dance starts off everyone is facing the front wall , after all of the counts of the dance are complete ( let 's say we were doing a 32 count dance ) then everyone would finish the dance facing either the back wall or the left or right wall . one example of a line dance is the `` men in black '' line dance . this dance is usually done to a hip-hop song , such as `` yeah 3x '' , by chris brown . once the first 32 counts of the dance are completed everyone will finish the dance facing the left wall , and would have turned one quarter to their left counter clockwise . once the series of moves is completed 4 times the group will end up facing the front wall again .
