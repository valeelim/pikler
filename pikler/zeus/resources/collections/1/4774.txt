Clause     a clause is a part of a sentence . each clause has only one main verb . `` i love you '' is a sentence which has only one clause . `` i love you and i will always love you '' is a sentence which has two clauses . the two clauses are `` i love you '' and `` i will always love you '' . these clauses are joined together by the word `` and '' , which is a conjunction ) . clauses may be independent or dependent . two clauses can be joined with a pronoun . for example : `` i live in london , which is in england '' . here , `` i live in london '' is the first clause , and `` which is in england '' is the second clause . the word `` which '' is a pronoun which takes the place of `` london '' . it joins the two clauses . a sentence can contain many clauses . but sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand . a simple sentence may also be called an independent clause . it may be a part of a compound or complex sentence , but it can also stand on its own as a simple sentence ( or independent clause ) . a subordinate clause also called a dependent clause is one which can not stand by itself . this is because it does not express a complete thought . it contains both a subject and a verb . a subordinate clause always depends on a main clause . the main clause makes sense and can stand on its own . however , the subordinating clause does not . for example , `` i love you '' makes perfect sense left on its own . however , `` and always will '' , does not .
