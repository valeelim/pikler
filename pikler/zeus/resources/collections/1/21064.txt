Vedas     the vedas are the four holiest books of the hindu religion ( but the word `` hindu religion '' is very recent , hindu is a word given by western world . there is no mention of hindu in any vedas . vedas are not confined to religion , they are not religious book . literal meaning of the word veda is `` knowledge '' or gyan ) . they are believed to be one of the oldest books ever made by mankind . they are written in an earlier indian language called sanskrit . they have phrases ( called `` mantras '' ) which are chanted at the religious ceremonies . although they were finally written down around 1,500 bc , they are actually much much older . they were passed down orally from one generation to the next , perhaps over thousands of years . the vedas have stories about the hindu gods , instructions for rituals , hymns , poetry , and prayers . the word `` vedic '' means something about the vedas . the language of the vedas is called `` vedic sanskrit '' . later types of hinduism that are very different from the types of hinduism that follow the vedas respect them .
