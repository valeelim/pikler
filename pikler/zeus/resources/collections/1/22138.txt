Schrödinger equation     the schrödinger equation is a differential equation ( a type of equation that involves an unknown function rather than an unknown number ) that forms the basis of quantum mechanics , one of the most accurate theory of how subatomic particles behave . it is a mathematical equation that was thought of by erwin schrödinger in 1925. it defines a wave function of a particle or system ( group of particles ) which has a certain value at every point in space for every given time . these values have no physical meaning ( in fact , they are mathematically complex ) , yet the wave function contains all information that can be known about a particle or system . this information can be found by mathematically manipulating the wave function to return real values relating to physical properties such as position , momentum , energy , etc . the wave function can be thought of as a picture of how this particle or system acts with time and describes it as fully as possible . the wave function can be in a number of different states at once , and so a particle may have many different positions , energies , velocities or other physical properties at the same time ( i.e . `` be in two places at once '' ) . however , when one of these properties is measured it has only one specific value ( which can not be definitely predicted ) , and the wave function is therefore in just one specific state . this is called wave function collapse and seems to be caused by the act of observation or measurement . the exact cause and interpretation of wave function collapse is still widely debated in the scientific community .
