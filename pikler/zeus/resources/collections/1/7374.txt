Alkali     in chemistry , an alkali is an aqueous ( from water ) solution with a ph value of more than seven . the word 'alkali ' comes from the arabic 'qali ' meaning 'from the ashes ' since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products ( such as soaps ) are made of alkali materials an alkali is where a base is dissolved in water . often it is the salt of an alkali metal an alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised ( brought down to ph 7 ) by adding acid . characteristics . - it feels soapy - it is corrosive ( it can burn your skin away ) - the higher the number is over 7 on the ph scale the stronger the alkali is . - highly soluble ( can be dissolved ) in water - they have a bitter taste - turns red litmus paper blue - can conduct electricity due to the presence of mobile ions - is blue or purple on universal indicator like acids , alkalis can be weak or strong , depending on the nature and the concentration of the ionic salt composing it . the strength of an alkali can be found using universal indicator . also like acids , the strength of an alkali is rated using the ph scale .
