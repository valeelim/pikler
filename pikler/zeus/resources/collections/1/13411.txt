Moai     moai are stone statues on easter island . each moai is made out of one large stone but some have an extra stone on top of the head . most were made from the volcanic rock in the rano raraku area of the island . moai are sometimes called `` heads '' but they do have shoulders , arms , and a body but these are usually too small for the head , also some of the best known ones had been partly buried over the years and only the heads were showing . most moai are between 2.5 and 10 metres high and , usually , weigh 14 tonnes . there are about 1000 moai placed mainly around the coast of the island plus nearly 400 more which were left not yet finished at rano raraku . when , why , and how they were made is still a mystery today . it is believed that they were made almost 1000 years ago by polynesians , who lived there at the time and were made to honour their ancestors ( older family members long dead ) and bring good luck . making the statues would have needed a lot of time and effort . to move them , they may have used wooden sledges or rollers or even `` walked '' them by rocking the moai along . the youngest moai found was built around 1350. it is believed that , around that time , there began a time of cold weather , little food , and war between the peoples . by the 19th century , all the moai had been pushed over . today , some have been restored .
