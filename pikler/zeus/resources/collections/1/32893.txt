Freud Museum     the freud museum , is at 20 maresfield gardens in hampstead , london . it was the home of sigmund freud and his family after they escaped the nazi takeover of austria in 1938. after the death of anna freud , the youngest daughter , in 1982 , the home became a museum . the centrepiece of the museum is freud 's study , preserved just as it was during his lifetime . there are two other freud museums , one in vienna , and another in příbor , the czech republic , in the house where freud was born . the study and library were preserved by anna freud after her father 's death . the bookshelf behind freud 's desk contains some of his favourite authors : not only goethe and shakespeare but also heine , multatuli and anatole france . freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically . the room contains the original analytic couch brought from berggasse 19. on this patients would recline comfortably while freud , out of sight in the green tub chair , listened to their 'free association ' . they were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information . this method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built .
