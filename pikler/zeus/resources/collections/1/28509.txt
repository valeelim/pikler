Serialism     serialism is a way of composing music using a series of notes in a particular order and using this to build up a whole piece of music . these series and patterns can also be applied to other parts of music ( like how loud or soft it is ) . to show how serialism works we can take a very simple example . let us use just five notes from the white notes of a keyboard . we can use the notes a , b , c , d and e. we are going to make a “ tune ” using all these five notes , but not repeating any until all five have been used ( although we are allowed to repeat the note we have just had ) . for example : we might have d , c , a , a , a , a , b , e. this is what we call our “ row ” or “ series ” , although usually one would expect a row of twelve different notes . it is the one we start off with , so we can call it our tone row . we can change the tone row by playing it backwards . this is called retrograde . so we now get e , b , a , a , a , a , c , d. we can also change it by playing it upside down . this means that instead of going up one step we go down one step , or instead of going up two steps we go down two steps etc . if we start on the same note d we now get : d , e , g , g , g , g , f , c. this is called inversion .
