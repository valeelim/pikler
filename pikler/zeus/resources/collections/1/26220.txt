Adam and Eve     adam and eve are the parents of all humans in the abrahamic religions . in the book of genesis in the bible , as well as the qu'ran and the aqdas , they are the first two people made by god . the second chapter of genesis says that god made adam from the dust of the ground . then , god breathed life into him . god made a garden , called the garden of eden , for him to live in and take care of . adam named the animals that god made . god knew that the animals were not good enough friends for adam , who needed a partner like him . so god made eve ( meaning `` life '' ) from a rib of adam 's . chapter three of genesis says that adam and eve had everything they needed in the garden . there was only one thing that god told them that they should `` not '' do : eat from the tree of knowledge ; only from the tree of life . a serpent said them that god doesnt wants you both to be as intelligent as he is so this forced eve to disobey god 's orders . and they ate the forbidden fruit . so they were forced to leave the garden . not only that but god said that women will have pain in childbirth , and that man will have to work hard to grow food , and would return at death to the soil from where he once came .
