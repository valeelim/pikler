Coin     a coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as currency , or money . coins have been made for about 2600 years ; the first place to make coins was lydia ( modern turkey ) . most people use coins as currency . they usually have lower value than banknotes . many coins have unique or complicated decorations ; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person 's head on it . the different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly . this is called `` tossing a coin '' . a person can throw the coin into the air and catch it . you then look at which side is facing up . if the head is facing up it is called `` heads '' , if the other side is facing up it is called `` tails '' . before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means . tossing a coin can be a type of gambling , which is illegal ( against the law ) in some countries . some people see coins as a sign of greed , such as some communists and puritans , who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins , and ascetics , who often keep little in the ways of money ( coins ) , leading a `` poor '' -lifestyle .
