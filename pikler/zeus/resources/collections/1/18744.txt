Spore     spores are the way fungi and some non-seed plants ( ferns and mosses ) reproduce . they are also made by bacteria for long-term survival . some protozoa also make long-term survival spores . the spores of seed plants are single cells that grow into a pollen grain or the gametophyte inside the ovule . the structure of seeds in higher plants is more complicated than spores . the main 'innovation ' of seeds is their nutrition for the developing embryo , which spores do not have . fungi ( for example , mushrooms ) produce spores , which may be asexual or sexual . the asexual spores have inside them the genetic material to make a whole new organism identical to its parent . conidia are asexual , non-motile spores of a fungus ; they are also called mitospores due to the way they are generated through the cellular process of mitosis . they are haploid cells genetically identical to the haploid parent , can develop into a new organism if conditions are favorable , and serve in dispersal . asexual reproduction in ascomycetes ( the phylum ascomycota ) is by the formation of conidia , which are borne on specialized stalks called conidiophores . the morphology of these specialized conidiophores is often distinctive of a specific species and can therefore be used in identification of the species .
