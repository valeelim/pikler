Speed     speed is the distance that an object moves in a given amount of time . speed is a measure of how fast something is moving . the average speed of an object in a certain time is the distance the object travelled divided by the time . to find speed formula_1 , formula_2formula_3 where formula_4 is the distance and formula_5 is the time that has gone by . there are many units of measurement for speed . for example , an object 's speed can be measured in - miles per hour ( mph ) , - kilometers per hour ( km/h ) - meters per second ( m/s ) , which is the si-unit for speed . when an object changes speed , it gets faster or slower . if the speed of the object increases , it is called acceleration . if the object gets slower , and the speed decreases , it is called deceleration , or negative acceleration . related pages . - velocity - momentum - quantum mechanics - metric system
