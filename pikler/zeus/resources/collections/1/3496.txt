Buddhism     buddhism is a religion found by siddhartha gautama . buddhism teaches people how to end their suffering by cutting out greed , hatred and ignorance . when people do bad things , they will get bad consequences . when people do good things , they will get good consequences . good and bad things do not cancel out . this cause-and-effect chain is reflected in the endless cycles of life , death and rebirth . buddhism believes in reincarnation ( rebirth ) . the ultimate goal of a buddhist is to reach the state of enlightenment ( nirvana ) and liberate oneself from endless reincarnation and suffering . some see buddhism as a religion , others see it is a philosophy , and others think it is a way of finding reality . some think that it is unnecessary to label buddhism . buddhism was started by gautama buddha ( 563483 bc ) in lumbini , nepal , while he was a rich prince . he gave up everything to find a way to end suffering . his teachings spread , after his death , to central asia , tibet , sri lanka , southeast asia , and the east asian countries of china , mongolia , korea , and japan and have now spread to the west .
