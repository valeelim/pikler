Frequency     frequency is how often an event repeats itself over a set amount of time . in physics , the frequency of a wave is the number of wave crests that pass a point in one second ( a wave crest is the peak of the wave ) . hertz ( symbol hz ) is the unit of frequency . the relationship between frequency and wavelength is expressed by the formula : formula_1 where v is speed and formula_2 ( lambda ) is wavelength . the formula for the frequency of light waves is formula_3 where the c is the speed of light . all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum but they travel at slower speeds when they travel through a medium that is not a vacuum . other waves , such as sound waves , travel at much much lower speeds and can not travel through a vacuum . examples of electromagnetic waves are ; light waves , radio waves , infrared radiation , microwaves , and gamma waves . different types of electromagnetic waves have different frequencies . one way to visualize this is if there were two trains traveling at the same speed , but the size of the train cars was smaller on one train than the other . if someone picked something that was not moving , like a signpost , and then counted how many train cars passed the sign post in one second for each train , they would know the frequency of cars passing in each train . the number and frequency of train cars passing the sign post would be different , because the train with smaller train cars would have more train cars passing the sign post in a second than the train with larger train cars . knowing how many cars passed the sign post in one second , and knowing the speed of the train , one could figure out mathematically the size of each train car for each train .
