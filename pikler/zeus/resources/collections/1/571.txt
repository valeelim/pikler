1 (number)    1 ( number ) one ( 1 ) is a natural number after zero and before two . it represents a single item . a human typically has one { head , nose , mouth , and navel ( belly-button ) } . the roman numeral is i. in mathematics , one is also the only number with this special fact : any number multiplied by 1 equals that number . then , the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any except itself . the number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it can not be divided by any other number to give one as the answer . let `` n '' be any number . then `` n '' /1 = `` n '' but 1/ '' n '' is never 1 ( when n is not 1 ) . example : 7/1 = 7 , but 1/7 is not 1 ( it is 0.142857 ... ) . any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer . `` n '' / '' n '' = 1 ( when n is not 0 ) . example : 7/7 = 1 . 0.999 ... is a repeating decimal that is mathematically equal to 1. many proofs have been made to show this is correct . the number one is important for computer science because it is , together with zero , a part of the binary numeral system . in machine code and in many programming languages , one means true and zero means false .
