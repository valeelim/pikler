Nature     the words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans . things like weather , organisms , landforms , celestial bodies and much more are part of nature . scientists study the way the parts of nature work . things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts . there are natural sciences that study different parts of nature , for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole , while biology studies every type of living thing . from one point of view , humans are a prime example of nature , and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth . humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a constant basis . every part of nature everything from the air to the dirt on the ground is interdependent . medicine studies humans in health and sickness . from another point of view , humans and nature can be said to be in conflict . nature is often seen by humans as natural resources . people cut down trees , mine ores , and grow crops . fires , cars , and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places . people who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do . in the modern world , with many more people and many big cities , these problems are becoming more serious .
