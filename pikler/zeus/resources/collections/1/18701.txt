Prime number     a composite number is a natural number of a particular kind . any natural number is equal to 1 times itself . if the number is equal to any other numbers multiplied , then the number is a composite number . the smallest composite number is 4 , because 2 x 2 = 4 . 1 is not a composite number . every other number is a prime number . the prime numbers are the numbers other than 1 which are not equal to `` m '' x `` n '' ( except 1 x itself ) . the smallest prime number is 2. there is no largest prime number . the next smallest prime numbers are 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , and so on . the way that the prime numbers occur is a difficult problem for mathematicians . when a number is larger , it is more difficult to know if it is a prime number . one of the answers is the prime number theorem . one of the unsolved problems is goldbach 's conjecture . there is a simple method to find a list of prime numbers . eratosthenes created it . it has the name sieve of eratosthenes . it catches numbers that are not prime ( like a sieve ) and lets the prime numbers pass through .
