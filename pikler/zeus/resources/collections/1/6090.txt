Amphibian     amphibians are members of the class amphibia . the living ones are frogs ( including toads ) , salamanders ( including newts ) and caecilians . they are four-legged vertebrates which are cold blooded . amphibians lay their eggs in water , usually in a foam nest . after hatching they are tadpoles , which live in the water and have gills . the tadpoles change into adults in a process called metamorphosis . when they are adult , they have lungs to breathe instead of gills , and legs . adult amphibians also use their skin to take in oxygen , and some species of salamanders do not have lungs . the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian from lobe-finned fish which had jointed leg-like fins with digits . they could crawl along the sea bottom . some had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen . they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if necessary . for quite a while , during the carboniferous and early permian , amphibia were top predators on land , especially in the low-lying tropical river systems . in drier conditions , they were less effective , and the ancestors of mammals and reptiles ( the synapsids and sauropsids ) gradually took over the land . they laid cleidoic eggs , which had hard shells , and could be laid out of water . most of the large , early , amphibians went extinct in the triassic period ; a few survived to the lower cretaceous .
