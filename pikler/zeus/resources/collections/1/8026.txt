Compact disc     compact disc ( cd ) is an optical disc that is used to store data . these are actually made to replace floppy disks that were used to store files and programs from the computer . the cds eventually caused the floppy disks to become obsolete . cds were invented by philips and sony independently , but they did collaborate to create a standard format and related player technology ( cd player ) in 1982. cds can hold up to 700 mb worth of data , which is approximately 80 minutes of audio . mini cds have also been crated that can store approximately 24 minutes of audio or program drivers . later , compact discs were made that could be used to store computer files in the same way as audio compact discs . these are called cd-roms ( compact disc read-only memory ) . the computer reads the disc using a cd-rom drive . another use is to store mpeg videos cheaply ; these cds are called vcds ( video cds ) . they are especially popular in asia . in indonesia they are used instead of the more expensive dvd . the quality of a vcd is about the same as a vhs tape .
