Lemur     lemurs are primates and prosimians ( not monkeys ) . the word `` lemur '' comes from the latin word `` lemures '' , which means `` ghosts '' . this name refers to many of the nocturnal lemur species and their large eyes . lemur may be any member of the four lemuriform families , but it is also the genus of one of the lemuriform species . there are two so-called `` flying lemurs '' , but they are not real lemurs . lemurs live `` only '' on the island of madagascar and some smaller islands next to it , for example the comoros . they weigh from 30g to the 10kg . larger species have all become extinct since human groups moved to madagascar . usually , the smaller lemurs are active at night ( nocturnal ) , and the larger ones are active during the day ( diurnal ) . lemurs are white and black with a ring tail . they are about 1.5 meters tall and weigh about 2 to 3.5 kilograms . they move quietly , usually at night , sometimes letting out eerie wailing cries , which some people think is the reason why they got their names . lemurs mostly eat fruit , leaves , and other plant parts . they live in family groups of 5 to 42 members which is called a troop . females are dominant and remain in the same troop for life . males move between troops . the female 's gestation period lasts four to five months , and they usually have between one and two babies . lemur mothers nurse their babies until they are about four months old . then they begin to feed the babies solid food such as fruit . lemurs spend most of their time in the trees . some are fantastic leapers , flinging themselves from tree to tree . lemurs live for about 27 years .
