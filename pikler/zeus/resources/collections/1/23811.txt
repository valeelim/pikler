Byzantine Empire     the byzantine empire ( or eastern roman empire ) was the name of the eastern remnant of the roman empire which survived into the middle ages . its capital was constantinople , which today is in turkey and is now called istanbul . unlike the western roman empire , its people spoke greek , not latin . they were influenced by greek culture and identity . in 324 , the roman emperor constantine i moved the capital of the roman empire to the city of `` byzantium '' , and he renamed the city constantinople . 150 years later , after the city of rome was slowly taken over by germanic people , the only remaining capital of the empire became constantinople . the remaining eastern empire had a smaller territory than the original roman empire . the byzantine empire tried to take back rome and italy from the germans . between 530â€“555 ad , the byzantines won many battles and took back rome . these gains did not last however . more germans came and eventually italy and rome was lost again . worse was to come when avar and slavic peoples came to take modern bulgaria and greece from the byzantines . gradually , after the 560s the invaders won much of the balkans . these invaders were later followed by the bulgarians . the avars and bulgarians were both turkish peoples at first . they ruled over slavic people called `` sklavinai '' and slowly absorbed slavic language and customs .
