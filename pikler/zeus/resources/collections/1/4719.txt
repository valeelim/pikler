Silk     silk is a natural fibre made by the silk worm larvae . silk is often used to make cloth . the cloth can be made into clothes , rugs , bedding , or can be used to write or paint on . silk fibres are very strong . in the past , silk was used to make parachutes . in history , silk came from china and was very expensive . the practice of growing silkworms for silk production is called sericulture . most spiders make a natural fibre that is also called silk . silk that is made by the silk worm is made up of two main proteins , sericin and fibroin . fibroin is the structural center of the silk . serecin is the sticky material surrounding it . fibroin is made up of the amino acids gly-ser-gly-ala-gly-ala and forms beta pleated sheets . hydrogen bonds form between chains , and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network . the high proportion ( 50 % ) of glycine ( which is a small amino acid ) allows tight packing . tight packing makes the fibers strong and resistant to breaking . the tensile strength is due to the many interseeded hydrogen bonds . when silk is stretched , the force is applied to these many bonds , and they do not break .
