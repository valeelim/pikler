Halogen     the halogens are chemical elements under the second-to-right column in the periodic table , also known as group 17. the elements in the group are fluorine , chlorine , bromine , iodine , astatine , and ununseptium . halogen literally means `` salt becomer '' , but it is often cited to mean `` salt producer '' . they are very reactive , so they are likely to join with other elements on the left side of the periodic table to make compounds . this is due to the fact that they are missing one electron . they are rarely found alone in nature , except astatine , which is not found in nature . fluorine is the most reactive , while iodine is the least reactive . astatine is very radioactive and hard to get .
