Sperm     sperm are the male reproductive cells . most animals and plants use sperm to reproduce . they have different ways of making and releasing the sperm . in all cases the sperm meets with the egg of the female and grow into a new organism . the name sperm is taken from the greek word `` sperma '' meaning `` seed '' . an animal sperm cell is capable of movement , as it has to get to the uterus to meet with the ovum . animal sperm cells ( including humans ) have small 'head ' and a long tail called a `` flagellum '' . the flagellum acts like a motor to propel the sperm cell through the female reproductive system . human sperm is made in the testicles of a man . human sperm contains 23 chromosomes . a human needs 46 chromosomes , so a sperm cell is called a `` haploid '' as it only has half . the other half is contained within the ovum or egg of a female . during sex , semen is shot out of the man 's penis during ejaculation . semen carries the sperm into the woman 's vagina and down to the ovum in the uterus . during ejaculation millions of sperm cells are released , but only one hundred or so reach the egg .
