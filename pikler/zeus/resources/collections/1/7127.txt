Humidity     humidity ( adjective : humid ) refers to water vapor in the air , but not to liquid droplets in fog , clouds , or rain . deserts usually have low humidity , and tropical regions have high humidity . the word `` humid '' often means that the humidity is high , which gives the feeling of being very damp ( wet air ) , stuffy , or even sweltering when the temperature is also high . when the humidity is low , the air can be said to be `` not humid '' or `` dry . '' higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin . the term `` relative humidity '' is used to note the amount of humidity as a percent , from 0-100 % . meteorologists have special devices to measure the humidity , such as hygrometers . humidity affects the rate of evaporation . with a higher humidity , the rate of evaporation is less . related pages . - dew point
