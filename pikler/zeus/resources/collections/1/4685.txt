San Andreas Fault     the san andreas fault is a right-moving ( 'dextral ' ) strike-slip fault . it marks the boundary between the north american plate on the east and the pacific plate on the west . the fault was the cause of the 1906 san francisco earthquake . it first appeared about 20 million years ago . the san andreas fault is a zone several miles wide with multiple strands . the main active strand runs both on and off-shore between cape mendocino and the sea of cortez . from cape mendocino , it runs offshore to tomales bay . then it goes southward through bolinas lagoon , just west of the san francisco peninsula , to come onshore again at daly city , through the hills of the peninsula . crystal springs reservoir is formed by the fault itself . in the santa cruz mountains , it bends slightly eastward . this is the site of the 1989 loma prieta earthquake . the fault continues south through the historic mission at san juan bautista and through the town of hollister ( where active creep can be seen to offset sidewalks and even houses ) . the transverse ranges north of santa barbara are formed by compression . strands of the fault snake under the los angeles basin . from there it connects into the active spreading under the sea of cortez .
