Local area network     a local area network ( lan ) is a computer network in a small area like a home , office , or school . many computers can be connected to share information and internet connections . most lans use ethernet to connect together . lan topologies tell you how network devices are organised . five common lan topologies exist : bus , ring , star , tree , and mesh . these topologies are logical architectures . this means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices , but that the actual cables that connect the devices might not be connected the same way . for example , logical bus and ring topologies are commonly organized physically as a star . - a bus topology means that the signal is put onto the medium and every device on the bus receives the signal . if more than one device tries to send a signal at the same time , they can interfere with each other . a long copper wire with other wires tapped into it is an example of a bus topology . - a ring topology means that each device talks to two other devices in the network and the devices all talk in a circle . if a computer sends data out one of its interfaces , it could get an answer back on the other one . some rings send traffic in only one direction , other ring networks send traffic in both directions . token ring and fddi are examples of ring topologies .
