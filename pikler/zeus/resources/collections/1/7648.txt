Globe     a globe is a picture of a planet drawn on a sphere . it is like a scale model of the planet . the word `` globe '' comes from the latin word `` globus '' , meaning round mass or sphere . most globes are maps of the earth . the most common types are political and physical . political globes show countries . physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers . global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place . it is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system , as distinguished from its individual little parts . the fact that the earth is a sphere was established by hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century bce . the earliest globe of the earth appeared in that period . the earliest known example is the one made by crates of mallus in cilicia ( now Ã§ukurova in modern-day turkey ) , in the mid-2nd century bce . no globes of the earth from antiquity or the middle ages have survived . an example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a hellenistic sculpture , called the farnese atlas . it survives in a 2nd century ad roman copy in the naples museum , naples , italy .
