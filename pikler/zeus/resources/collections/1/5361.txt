Apocrypha     the apocrypha are religious texts that are in some versions of the bible . other versions omit them . the word comes from ancient greek `` '' ( apokrypha ) . apocrypha means `` those that were hidden '' . generally , the term is applied to writings that were not part of the canon . there are several reasons why these texts were not included in the canon . the texts might only have been known to few people , or they might have been left out because their content does not fit well into that of the other books of the bible . some of the apocrypha were written at a later date , and were therefore not included . the authorized king james version called these books ‘ apocrypha ’ . it separated them , because the bible said so in 2 esdras 14:46 , `` but keep the seventy last , that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people : for in them is the spring of understanding , the fountain of wisdom , and the stream of knowledge . '' roman catholic bibles have these books in the old testament . they do not call them apocrypha . they call them deuterocanonical , which means that they belong to the second canon . canon just means an official list of literary works accepted as representing a field . the first list is of books first written in hebrew . this second list is of books first written in greek .
