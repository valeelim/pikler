Flint     flint , or flintstone , is a kind of sedimentary rock , made of silica . bands of flint are found in chalk , which is an upper cretaceous rock laid down in the continental shelves of a tropical sea . when the chalk is eroded , the hard flint nodules survive as pebbles on a shingle beach . it may happen that the pebbles later get cemented into another rock , such as a puddingstone . in this way , they make up a sedimentary rock for the second time . flint is a cryptocrystalline ( means you ca n't see the crystals ) form of the mineral quartz . it is a variety of chert . it occurs as a line of knobbly masses in chalk and some limestones . inside the nodule , flint is usually translucent , and can be various colours . a thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . flintstones often have a rough lumpy surface but when they are broken , they look like dark glass . it has been one of the most useful types of stone to humankind . flint was often used in prehistoric times to make stone tools . flint handaxes were used by early man for about two million years . when flintstones are broken , they have a sharp edge which could be used as a knife , or a scraper .
