Potassium     potassium is a chemical element in the periodic table . it has the symbol k. this symbol is taken from the latin word `` kalium '' . potassium 's atomic number is 19. it has 19 protons and electrons . potassium is not found as an element in nature , because it is so reactive . potassium has two stable isotopes , with 20 or 22 neutrons . its atomic mass is 39.098. the unstable isotope with 21 neutrons is one of the most common radioactive materials . potassium is a soft gray metal . it can be cut easily with a knife . its melting point is 63 degrees celsius ( 145.4 degrees fahrenheit ) . it melts at a very low temperature . it is an alkali metal . it is the second lightest metal , after lithium . potassium reacts in many chemical reactions similar to sodium and other alkali metals . it tarnishes in air to produce a whitish oxidized layer on the surface . this is why it is stored in oil . it also reacts very fast with water , which is another reason for its storage in oil . the hydrogen produced during its reaction with water can burst into flames when a large amount of potassium is added to water . potassium hydroxide is also produced . potassium also burns in air easily , to make the peroxide or the superoxide .
