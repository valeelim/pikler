Chicken     a chicken ( `` gallus gallus domesticus '' ) is a kind of domesticated bird . it is raised widely for its meat and eggs . they are usually kept by humans as livestock , which means it is kept for its meat and eggs . most breeds of chickens can fly for short distances and some roost in trees if these are provided . a male chicken is called a `` rooster '' or a `` cock '' ( short for cockerel ) . a female chicken is called a `` hen '' . a young chicken is called a `` chick '' . like other female birds , hens lay eggs which can hatch into chicks . when raising chickens , a farmer needs to build a chicken coop ( like a little house ) for the chickens to roost ( sleep ) in . they also need a run or yard where they can exercise , take dust baths , eat , and drink . the chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes , which is often done with fences . chickens can also be farmed intensively . this lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs , but this is not as good for the chickens . chickenpox has nothing to do with chickens . when chicken pox was first described , it was noted that the pox spots looked like the vegetable called chickpeas placed upon the skin . the latin word for chick peas is `` cicer '' , and that is the original word that chicken pox got its name from .
