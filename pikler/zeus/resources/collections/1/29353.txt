Cathode ray tube     the cathode ray tube or crt was invented by karl ferdinand braun . it was the most common type of display for many years . it was used in almost all computer monitors and televisions until lcd and plasma screens started being used . a cathode ray tube is an electron gun . the cathode is an electrode ( a metal that can send out electrons when heated ) . the cathode is inside a glass tube . also inside the glass tube is an anode that attracts electrons . this is used to pull the electrons toward the front of the glass tube , so the electrons shoot out in one direction , like a ray gun . to better control the direction of the electrons , the air is taken out of the tube , making a vacuum . the electrons hit the front of the tube , where a phosphor screen is . the electrons make the phosphor light up . the electrons can be aimed by creating a magnetic field . by carefully controlling which bits of phosphor light up , a bright picture can be made on the front of the vacuum tube . changing this picture 30 times every second will make it look like the picture is moving . because there is a vacuum inside the tube ( which has to be strong enough to hold out the air ) , and the tube must be glass for the phosphor to be visible , the tube must be made of thick glass . for a large television , this vacuum tube can be quite heavy .
