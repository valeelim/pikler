Black Death     the black death was a pandemic ( an epidemic spreading over a large area ) that killed millions of people . it started in europe in 1347 , and lasted until 1351. almost one out of every three people in europe died from the disease , so about 25 million . the disease started in asia . most people think that the disease was the bubonic plague . this disease is carried and spread by fleas living on rats . traders from the silk road may have brought the infected fleas to europe . another disease that could have been the black death is anthrax . anthrax could have been spread by cattle . looking at the quick spread of the disease , viral hemorrhagic fevers are other ideas for what specific disease the black death might have been . fleas started the problem ; the infected fleas were carried by black rats . rats that were carrying the fleas would go into cities . when the fleas bit somebody , they would inject a little bit of the bacteria into the wound . this would cause the person to be infected . rats were often on ships . this meant the disease spread extremely quickly , all over europe .
