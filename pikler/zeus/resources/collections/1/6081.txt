Building     building may be a noun or a verb . building is one of the most ancient human skills . it is part of how we have survived and it is the clearest symbol of every civilization . although some other animals build simple structures , e.g . birds , ants and bees , humans have learned to build in a great many different ways , to suit different needs and local conditions . we build mostly for shelter . buildings can shelter people , or animals , or machinery , or anything . the simplest building is just a roof , to keep the space beneath dry , or shady . adding walls gives more shelter , from the wind or rain . it also gives security . by putting a window in a wall , with or without glass , we let light inside the building . we leave a hole somewhere big enough to go in and out , with a door which can be opened and closed . often the door will have a lock , so the building can be left secure . if a building is to last for a long time , it must have a solid foundation . this foundation is like the root of a tree , which is sunk a bit deep into the ground and supports the walls . if the ground is soft , the foundation must be very deep and strong so that the building might be having a strong contact with the ground .
