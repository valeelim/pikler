Humpback whale     a humpback whale ( `` megaptera novaeangliae '' ) is a large baleen whale with long flippers and a knobbly head . they can be found in every ocean . they can grow to 15–16 m ( 49–52 ft ) long and weigh up to 40 metric tons . humpback whales can live up to 45 years . they migrate between the places they feed in the winter and the places they give birth in the summer . they usually live alone . humpback whales eat krill and small fish , for example herring , capelin , and sand lance . they scoop up their food in their large mouths . sometimes they round up their prey by swimming in tight circles and blowing curtains of bubbles around them . they often hunt in small groups , called pods . the male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time . because whales do not have vocal chords , they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages . every male has a different song . we do n't yet know why they sing , it might be to call a female or scare away other males . the songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days . the whales slowly change their songs over a period of years .
