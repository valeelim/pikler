Brown v. Board of Education     brown versus board of education ( 1954 ) ( full name oliver brown , et al . v. board of education of topeka , kansas ) was a landmark decision by the supreme court of the united states . in 1950 in topeka , kansas , a black third-grade girl named linda brown had to walk more than a mile through a railroad switchyard to get to her segregated school for black children . however , there was an elementary school for white children less than seven blocks away . at that time , many schools in the united states were segregated . black children and white children were not allowed to go to the same schools . her father , oliver brown , tried to get linda into the white school , but the principal of the school refused . twelve more black parents joined oliver brown in trying to get their children into the white elementary school . the two schools were supposed to be `` separate but equal . '' however , they were not . in 1951 , the national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) helped the parents file a class action lawsuit . in 1896 , the supreme court had ruled in `` plessy v. ferguson '' that segregation was legal , as long as separate places for blacks and whites were `` separate but equal . '' the naacp 's lawyers argued that the white and black schools in topeka were not `` separate but equal . ''
