Coast     the coast is where land meets the sea . the coast also means the land next to the sea , which can also be called the shore , or sea-shore . however , coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land - it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land . if a house is near to the coast we say it is `` on the coast '' . when we talk about a long part of the coast we call it `` the coast-line '' . sometimes , 'coast ' can be part of a place name or the description of a large area . for instance , the east coast of the united states describes the all of the eastern side of the united states that is next to the atlantic ocean . in some countries like england or australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast . coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants . an example of a coast in great britain is the holderness coast near bridlington . this is one of europe 's fast eroding coasts . related pages . - shore
