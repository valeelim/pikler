Power network     a power network is a type of contact network where its members can tell other people what to do . it must be large enough to literally scare or force people to go along with its requests , which makes them orders . this typically requires thousands of people in constant touch with each other . a political party is the most obvious example . it is typically much larger than a social network but is not one , since people can only call on each other for a small number of reasons , and perhaps at specific times . also not every member of the network has the same role or right to help . a corporation may also be a power network if it relies on many power relations to maintain itself - for instance , the right to draw oil from the ground or dump waste without being held responsible for it . when a power network achieves some stable grasp of political power and daily working control of some important infrastructure , it becomes a power structure . in a democracy the visible power networks represented by the parties compete regularly in an election - but much of the power structure , typically the bureaucracy , does not change , and is typically ignored as a power network in itself .
