Point (geometry)    point ( geometry ) a point is a position in space . imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen , without making any sideways movement . we know where the point is , but it has no size to speak of . in geometry a point has no size , but has a position . this means it has no volume , area or length . we usually represent a point by a small cross 'x ' or by a small dot ( a small , round shape ) . in geometry , points are always labelled by capital letters ( a , b , c ... x , y , z ) . mathematicians say two points can be : - coincident = they are one and the same - not coincident = they are not one and the same and are always : - coplanar = on the same plane - colinear = on the same line - concyclic = on the same circle three points can be : - colinear - coincident - not coincident - not colinear and are always : - coplanar - concyclic four points can be : - coplanar - colinear - coincident - not coincident - not colinear - not coplanar `` compare : '' line , plane
