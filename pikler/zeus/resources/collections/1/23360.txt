Sino-Soviet split     the sino-soviet split ( 1960â€“1989 ) was a time when the relations between the people 's republic of china and the soviet union weakened during the cold war . eventually , china 's leader , mao zedong , decided to break the alliance with the soviet union . the soviet leader , stalin , wanted to help spread communism , especially in china . during the chinese civil war , the soviets gave weapons and supplies to the kuomintang , but once the communists were about to win , stalin and the soviet union decided to help the communists . this is one of the main reasons for the sino-soviet split since the soviets did n't help mao and the communists from the start . suddenly , in 1953 , stalin died . mao saw stalin as the leader of communism , but also had a bad relationship with the soviet union throughout his time as leader . the new soviet leader , nikita khrushchev , was not like stalin . he did not want capitalism to collapse like stalin did . mao got angry about this , and he wanted nikita khrushchev to help him fight the imperialists . khrushchev said no , and then mao decided that if khrushchev was not going to cooperate , they would not work with each other anymore .
