Vacuum     a vacuum is a place where there is no matter . sound can not move in a vacuum . outer space is not a perfect vacuum , because there is a very small number of particles there . vacuum is needed for some kinds of industrial production . vacuum pumps are used to pump air out of the vacuum chamber . in the real world it is not possible to create 100 % vacuum , but some vacuum pumps are able to create 99.9999 % vacuum . this is called `` hard vacuum '' . most industrial purposes do n't need hard vacuum ; 0.001 % is good enough . industrial vacuums are mainly used in : 1. food industry 1. electronics industry 1. packaging 1. manipulation 1. coating and degasing vacuum chambers are also used in many experiments in laboratories . some experiments in physics and chemistry need hard vacuum . a vacuum cleaner uses a strong vacuum force to suck in dirt , cleaning the floor . references . - industrial vacuum information
