Verb     a verb is a kind of word ( part of speech ) that tells about an action or a state . it is the main part of a sentence : every sentence has a verb . in english , verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense . every language in the world has verbs , but they are not always used in the same ways . they also can have different properties in different languages . for example , in some other languages ( e.g. , chinese & indonesian ) verbs do not change for past and present tense . this means the definition above only works well for english verbs . there are sixteen verbs used in . they are : `` be , , , , go , see , , , , , , , , , , . '' the word `` verb '' originally comes from `` *were- '' , a proto-indo-european word meaning `` a word '' . it comes to english through the latin `` verbum '' and the old french `` verbe '' . in simple sentences , the verb may be one word : `` the cat `` sat '' on the mat '' . however , the verb may be a phrase : `` the cat `` will sit '' on the mat '' . verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse : `` i 'm afraid i will need to be going soon '' . there seem to be three verbal phrases here , which mean something like `` sorry , i must go soon '' .
