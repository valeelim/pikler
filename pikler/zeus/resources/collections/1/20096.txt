Wild turkey     the wild turkey ( `` meleagris gallopavo '' ) is the name of the more common of the two species of turkey . this large bird is found across much of the united states and southern canada . wild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures , fields , orchards and seasonal marshes . they can adapt to any dense plant community so long as there is cover and openings to fly out . open , mature forests with a variety of tree species seem to be best . the `` domesticated turkey '' has been tamed and bred from wild turkeys , by people , to raise on farms .
