Painting     painting is using colours to make art . it is also the word for a painted work of art . many kinds of paints are used to create art . they include watercolors , acrylics and oils . other artists like working with pencil or chalk . sometimes charcoal can be used . famous paintings are often kept in art galleries , like the national gallery in london and the louvre ( paris ) where one of the most famous paintings in the world hangs , the `` mona lisa '' , painted by leonardo davinci . people do not have to go to a famous gallery to view art . there are private art galleries in many cities around the world . there is a basic difference between drawing and painting . in drawing , a single layer is the entire image . in painting , one layer is painted over another to get the final image . as a result , most of the time the image will not be clear until it gets to the final stage . there are four basic stages in painting : preparation , divide , layer , and touchup . 1. preparation : most artists prepare a canvas or other surface . a thin uniform cover or `` wash '' of white or other colour is laid on the whole surface . this may help the later layers to get the same fix all over the surface . also , the unseen wash may help the refection of light from the surface , thus improving the effect for the viewer . for really uneven or coloured surfaces , such as wood or rough canvas , a more substantial covering is needed . that is called gesso , traditionally a mixture of chalk and gelatin , but nowadays available as a thick white acrylic . painting on some surfaces requires a special technique . painting on plaster uses the fresco method .
