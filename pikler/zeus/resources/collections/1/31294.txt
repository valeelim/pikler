Fowl     fowl usually refers to birds belonging to one of two biological orders , namely the gamefowl or landfowl ( galliformes ) and the waterfowl ( anseriformes ) . it happens that birds in these groups are good to eat , and often hunted by gun . so the word 'fowl ' may be used for a game bird . the group is mostly of birds we hunt or farm , and which we eat . studies of anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives . together , they form the fowl clade , the galloanserae . this clade is also supported by morphological and dna sequence data , as well as retrotransposon data .
