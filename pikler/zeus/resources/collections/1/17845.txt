Fourier transform     the fourier transform is a mathematical function that can be used to show the different parts of a continuous signal . it is most used to convert from time domain to frequency domain . fourier transforms are often used to calculate the frequency spectrum of a signal that changes over time . this kind of signal processing has many uses such as cryptography , oceanography , speech recognition , or handwriting recognition . fourier transforms can also be used to solve differential equations . the fourier transform of a function formula_1 is given by formula_2 the inverse fourier transform is given by formula_3 a fourier transform shows what frequencies are in a signal . for example , consider a sound wave which contains three different musical notes : a , b , and c. making a graph of the fourier transform of this sound wave ( with the frequency on the x-axis and the intensity on the y-axis ) will show a peak at each frequency which corresponds with one of the musical notes . many signals can be created by adding together cosines and sines with varying amplitudes and frequencies . the fourier transform plots the amplitudes and phases of these cosines and sines against their respective frequencies .
