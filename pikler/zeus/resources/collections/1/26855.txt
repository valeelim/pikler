Anna Kavan     anna kavan ( born 10 april 1901 as helen emily woods , died 1968 ) was an english writer . her early work , comprising six novels , gave little indication of the style and content of her writing after 1939. the change of her name to anna kavan in 1940 signalled an experimental form , focussed on the 'nocturnal language ' of dreams and addiction . `` i am lazarus '' is a collection of short stories that address the disturbing unreality of mental illness , particularly as a result of [ war-related ] post traumatic stress disorder . kavan travelled extensively during the second world war , spending 22 months in new zealand . that country 's proximity to antarctica informed her writing of `` ice '' . kavan 's biographical details have until recently been vague and sketchy , but recent discoveries of letters and unpublished manuscripts have shed revealing light on her life and times . dr jennifer sturm of auckland university has made a recent study of kavan 's writing , and has unearthed significant validation of her biographical details . kavan is currently enjoying something of a belated interest . london publishers peter owen publishers have for many years flown the kavan flag and continue to do so , with the recent re-release of `` ice '' and a forthcoming publication of `` guilty '' , a new posthumous release of kavan 's work .
