Quantity     quantity or amount is how much of something there is that can be counted or measured . whole numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 ... ) are used to count things . this can be done by pointing to each one . as things are pointed to , a number is said . start with the number one . each time another thing is pointed to , the next whole number is used . when the last thing in a group it pointed to , that number is the quantity of the group . measuring is done with a ruler or a machine . we put a ruler next to a thing to measure how long it is . we put things on a scale to measure their mass . other machines are used to measure other quantities such as temperature , speed , electric current , and so on . when measuring things , a whole number might not be the best answer . a distance might be longer than 5 meters , but less than 6 meters . meter sticks are marked off in parts of a meter . decimals are formed by marking off a ruler in ten equal parts . each part is a tenth . 5.2 meters is a little bit longer than 5 meters . 5.7 meters is a little bit shorter than 6 meters . each of these tenths can be marked with ten smaller parts . the one hundred centimeters on a meter stick are done this way ; by marking ten equal parts , then marking ten equal parts of each of those parts .
