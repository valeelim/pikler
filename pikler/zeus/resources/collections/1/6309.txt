Letter     in some languages , for example english , we write a letter for each member of the alphabet . letters symbolise different sounds when the language is spoken . some languages do not use letters for writing : chinese , for example , uses `` ideograms '' . in english and many other languages , the smallest part of writing is the letter . we use letters to make words . in some languages , for example spanish , there is usually one letter for one sound ( or better : for one `` phoneme '' , the smallest part of speech ) . this is easy to read . in other languages , for example english , we can use several letters for one sound , or one letter for several sounds . this is difficult for learners to read . here are some examples : english , french , spanish and many other languages use the latin alphabet for writing . in this alphabet there are often two different letters for a sound . for example , `` a '' and `` a '' . in other alphabets , for example the cyrillic alphabet , there is only one letter for a sound ( except for handwritten cyrillic , in which the shape of the capital letter is much different - and usually unrecognisable - from its lowercase counterpart ) . the letters are : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
