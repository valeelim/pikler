Mollusc     molluscs ( or mollusks ) are an important phylum of invertebrate animals . most of them are marine . they have huge numbers in-shore , that is , in shallow wahe largest marine phylum , with about 85,000 living species , 23 % of all named marine organisms . they also occur in freshwater and on land . molluscs are extremely varied : they have great diversity . that may be why there is no word in english for the phylum as a whole . `` in an evolutionary sense , molluscs are plastic material '' . they have much more variety than their ancient rivals , the brachiopods . most molluscs have shells , but some groups do not : octopods , slugs , and the gastropods known as sea slugs . many molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats . they are highly diverse , not just in size and in anatomical structure , but also in behaviour and in habitat . the phylum is usually divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes , of which two are entirely extinct . cephalopod molluscs , such as squid , cuttlefish and octopus , are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates : they have good brains and complex behaviours . either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species . the gastropods ( snails and slugs ) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species , and account for 80 % of the total . the scientific study of molluscs is called malacology .
