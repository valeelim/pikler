Electromagnetism     electromagnetism is the study of the electromagnetic field . the electromagnetic field pushes or pulls anything that has an electric charge . the electromagnetic field affects all of space . an electric field is an area where charged particles will feel an electric force . the units used to measure electric fields are newtons per coulomb . electromagnetism is closely related to both electricity and magnetism because both involve the movement of electrons . electric fields can be drawn as arrows . the arrows point which way a positive particle , like a proton , will be pushed if it 's in the field . negative particles , like electrons , will go in the opposite direction as the arrows . in an electric field , arrows will point away from positive particles , and towards negative ones . so , a proton in an electric field would move away from another proton , or towards an electron . a magnetic field is a part of the electric field that only exerts a force on moving charges . through electromagnetic induction , a changing magnetic field can produce an electric field . this concept is used to make electric generators , induction motors , and transformers work . since the two types of fields were dependent on each other , the two are thought to be one . together they are called the electromagnetic field .
