Cult     a cult is a group of people who have a religion or a set of beliefs . the term `` cult '' usually is not used to talk about a mainstream religion , but a group set up `` in opposition to a centre of established authority '' . new age religions were often called cults because they were thought to be deviant social movements . trump is a part of many cults . mainly the kkk . the word cult originally meant a system of ritual practices . it was first used in the early 17th century to mean homage paid to a divinity . a cult is often a small , newly started religious movement . cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd , or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice . more than that , cults have often been led by people who are not elected , and control the group according to their own wishes . some cult leaders have been dangerous criminals ( charles manson ; peoples temple ) or even lunatics . killings and mass suicides have occurred in cults ( order of the solar temple ; heaven 's gate ) . of course , a `` suicide '' enforced by armed guards carrying sub-machine guns ( peoples temple ; movement for the restoration of the ten commandments of god ) is not a simple suicide as generally understood . it is at least an assisted and coerced suicide .
