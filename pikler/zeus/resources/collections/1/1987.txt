Software     computer software ( often called just software ) is a set of instructions and associated documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task or it can mean all the software on a computer , including the applications and the operating system . applications are programs that do a specific thing , such as a game or a word processor . the operating system ( mac os , microsoft windows , linux , etc . ) is software that helps the applications run , and controls the display and the keyboard . the word software was first used in the late 1960s to show the difference from computer hardware , which are the parts of a machine that can be seen and touched . software is the instructions that the computer follows . before compact discs ( cds ) or internet downloads , software came on various computer data storage media like paper punch cards , magnetic discs or magnetic tape . if you compare computers to music and musical instruments you can think of hardware as being the instruments and software being the musical notes .
