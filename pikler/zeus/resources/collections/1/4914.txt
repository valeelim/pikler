Flood     a flood is an overflow of water on land which is usually dry . sometimes a water resource ( river , lake or pond ) gets flushed too much with water . unusually heavy rain sometimes causes floods . when there is too much water , it may overflow beyond its normal limits . this water then spreads over land , flooding it . extreme flooding can also be caused by a tsunami or a large storm that causes a storm surge . floods that happen quickly are called flash floods . the most deadly flooding was in 1931 in china and killed about 2,500,000 people . during a flood , people try to move themselves and their most precious belongings to higher ground quickly . the process of leaving homes in search of a safe place is called `` evacuation '' . during a flood there is plenty of water , but it is mostly polluted and not safe to drink . if people drink the dirty water , they may suffer from diseases such as typhoid and cholera . people can get ready to survive a flood by filling many containers with fresh and clean drinking water and storing other emergency supplies .
