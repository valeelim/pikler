Adult     an adult is a person who is grown up completely , or is not a child anymore . it is the phase after being a teenager . once someone reaches adulthood , that person typically no longer has to take directions from a parent or guardian , but rather can make decisions for themselves . in biology , a person is considered an adult physically when they are sexually mature . this means that they have begun or passed through the physical puberty , and are able to sexually reproduce . mentally and emotionally , a person is considered a full grown adult in the early or mid twenties . a person can be at legal age at 18 , yet they 're still in adolescence , their minds are still developing . this is one of the reasons why a person under the age of 23 can be seen as a `` kid '' by people over 25. in most countries , someone is legally considered an adult when he or she is older than a certain age . this is called the age of majority . hitting the age of majority means that you are considered old enough to make your own decisions , and not having to be taken care of by your parents or other adults . in most countries , this age is 18 years . however , it varies from ages as low as 16 to as high as 21. there are many additional laws that determine from what age a person is allowed to do something ; for example , vote , drink alcohol , and have sexual intercourse .
