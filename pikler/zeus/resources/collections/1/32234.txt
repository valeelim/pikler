De facto     de facto is a phrase from the latin language that means `` in fact '' or `` in practice '' . it is often used in contrast to `` de jure '' ( which means `` by law '' ) when talking about law , governance , or technique . when talking about law , `` '' de jure '' is used to describe what the law says , and `` de facto '' '' is used to describe what actually happens . `` de facto '' is sometimes also used when there is no appropriate law or standard , but a common practice , that may not necessarily be widely accepted , exists . for example , the `` de jure '' name of bill clinton is william jefferson clinton . this is his name according to official records . his `` de facto '' name is bill clinton because this is what he is usually called .
