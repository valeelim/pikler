Game Boy line     the game boys are a group of handheld video game consoles made by nintendo . the first game boy was released in 1989. it had a small screen , a d-pad , and an a and b button . to play games , there were small objects called cartridges that you put into the game boy to play the game in the cartridge . the game that made it popular was tetris . the game boy had a link cable and a link port which let it connect with other game boys . after the game boy , nintendo released the game boy pocket . it only needed two batteries instead of four . the link port was smaller than the game boy 's , so the game boy and game boy pocket could not connect . the game boy light was only released in japan and had a front-light so people could see better . it is very rare - only about 12,000 of them were manufactured . because it is rare , it sells for more money than other game boys . the game boy color was the first game boy in color . it was also able to play game boy cartridges , which helped it sell better . this also helped other game boy models after the game boy color . it is sometimes called gbc .
