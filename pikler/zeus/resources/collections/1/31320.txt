Metatheria     metatheria is a group in the class mammalia which contains the marsupials and the sparassodonts . first proposed by thomas henry huxley in 1880 , it is nearly synonymous with the earlier taxon marsupialia , but it also contains the nearest fossil relatives of marsupial mammals . the earliest known representative , `` sinodelphys '' , is from the lower cretaceous of china . the closest relatives of the metatheres are the eutheria ( also erected by huxley in 1880 ) . both are conventionally united as infraclasses within the subclass theria , which contains all living mammals except monotremes . during development , metatherians produce a yolk sac placenta and give birth to 'larval-like ' offspring . these offspring have underdeveloped rear limbs , and after birth they migrate to the marsupium where they attach to a nipple . the mouth of newly born metatherians forms an `` o '' shape into which the mother 's nipple fits . then it swells to secure the offspring into place . the greek words `` meta- '' and `` theria '' roughly means the `` other beasts '' , in contrast with `` eutheria '' ( `` true beasts '' ) .
