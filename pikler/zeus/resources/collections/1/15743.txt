Momentum     momentum can be considered the `` power '' when an object is moving , meaning how much force it can have on another object . for example , a bowling ball ( large mass ) pushed very slowly ( low velocity ) can hit a glass door and not break it , while a baseball ( small mass ) can be thrown fast ( high velocity ) and break the same window . the baseball has a larger momentum than the bowling ball . because momentum is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object , that both mass and velocity affect the momentum of an object . as shown , an object with a large mass and low velocity can have the same momentum as an object with a small mass and large velocity . a bullet is another example where the momentum is very-very high , due to the extraordinary velocity . another beautiful example where very low-velocities cause greater momentum is the push of indian subcontinent towards the rest of asia , causing serious damages , such as earth quakes in the portions of himalayas . in this example , the subcontinent is moving as slow as few inches per year but the mass ( imagine weight of india ) of indian-subcontinent is very high .
