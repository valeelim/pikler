Scone     a scone is a kind of bread that is usually shaped into triangles and baked on a griddle or sheet . scones are very small , and are in the same group as the crumpet or muffin . it is made of wheat , barley , or oatmeal and baking powder to make it rise . the scone is shaped closely like the north american biscuit , and its recipe is almost the same with it as well . sometimes scones may have raisins , currants , cheese , or dates in them . in the united states , however , scones include more sweet kind of fillings like cranberries , chocolate chips , or nuts . they can often be found in coffee shops and in a great variety in the british isles . it is generally thought that scones are best eaten when they are very hot and freshly baked right from the oven , accompanied with melting warm butter . some people even enjoy buttering their scones for themselves . some think that scone comes from the gaelic `` sgonn '' , which meant a piece of dough that has been cooked for a couple of minutes , shapeless mass or large mouthful ; and the dutch `` schoonbrot '' , which meant `` fine white bread '' ; or , for last , the german `` sconbrot '' , which meant `` fine or beautiful bread '' . the oxford english dictionary believes the german and dutch is more accurate .
