Parliament     a parliament is a type of legislature . the most famous parliament is probably the one in the united kingdom , which is sometimes called the `` mother of all parliaments '' . the word `` parliament '' comes from the french word `` parler '' , which means a talk . the althing , the national parliament of iceland , was founded earlier ( 930 ad ) , so it is the oldest legislature in the world still existing . however , the althing did not function as a legislature for four centuries , and its role as a `` primary '' legislature is modern . the parliament of the united kingdom is split into three separate parts , the house of commons ( the lower house ) , the lords ( the upper house ) and the monarch . most legislative power is concentrated in the house of commons . it is made up of 650 members of parliament ( mps ) . these people are elected by the people of the united kingdom to represent them in the house of commons . the leader of the political party who commands a majority of mps is usually made the prime minister , but not the head of state , a position reserved for the sovereign . the house of commons starts most bills , the remainder originating in the house of lords , and decides rates of taxation as a result of election by the other hereditary peers and two other hereditary peers who have ceremonial jobs in the house of lords . they are the earl marshal who is always the duke of norfolk and the lord great chamberlain , the marquess of cholmondeley . the house of lords has the power to reject bills , except money bills ( tax bills ) , and make the house of commons reconsider them . if the house of lords vetoes a bill twice or delays a `` public '' bill for more than one year then the house of commons can force the bill through under the terms of the parliament acts , unless it originated in the house of lords .
