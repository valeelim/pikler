Igloo     an igloo ( or iglu ) is a shelter ( a place for people to stay warm and dry ) made from blocks of snow placed on top of each other , often in the shape of a dome ( like half of a hollow ball ) . they were used in winter as temporary shelters by hunters when they were away from their regular homes . they were most often built in places where a lot of snow covers the land for weeks or months at a time , such as the far north of canada and greenland . most igloos are built by native inuit people ( sometimes called `` eskimoes '' ) . as they learned to build them better , sometimes people would build larger igloos that would last longer and hold more people , even for dancing .
