Electromagnetic radiation     electromagnetic waves are waves that contain an electric field and a magnetic field and carry energy . they travel at the speed of light . quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves . this field includes the study of both visible and invisible light . visible light is the light one can see with normal eyesight in the colors of the rainbow . invisible light is light one ca n't see with normal eyesight and includes more energetic and higher frequency waves , such as ultraviolet , x-rays and gamma rays . waves with longer lengths , such as infrared , micro and radio waves , are also explored in the field of quantum mechanics . some types of electromagnetic radiation , such as x-rays , are ionizing radiation and can be harmful to your body . ultraviolet rays are near the violet end of the light spectrum and infrared are near the red end . infrared rays are heat rays and ultraviolet rays cause sunburn . the various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum differ in wavelength , frequency and quantum energy .
