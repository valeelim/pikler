Sandstone     sandstone is a sedimentary rock . it is a rock made of compacted sand . sand is small grains of rocks and minerals ( such as quartz and feldspar ) . these are the most common minerals in the earth 's crust . sandstone which is resistant to weathering is used for building in many countries . it can be a hard rock . for example , paving slabs can be made out of hard sandstone . sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure . this happens when rocks are squeezed and heated under a mountain chain . sandstone forms in two stages . first , layers of sand build up as sediment , either from water or from air ( as in a desert ) . then sand particles are compacted by pressure of overlying deposits , and cemented ( 'glued ' together ) . the 'cement ' is either calcite ( calcium carbonate ) , quartz ( silica ) , or clay . iron oxide often makes sandstone a reddish colour . related pages . - old red sandstone , laid down in marine conditions - new red sandstone , laid down in desert conditions
