Jehovah's Witnesses    jehovah 's witnesses jehovah 's witnesses are a religious group with more than eight million members throughout the world . they believe god will end the present system of things , which belongs to satan , with its crime , violence , sickness and death ; they believe it will be replaced with his kingdom which will restore his original purpose for the earth , bringing about peace for all humans who live by the bible's standards . most of the religion 's beliefs are based on the bible . these beliefs were taught by charles taze russell , a preacher who started a bible study group in pennsylvania in 1876 , and later started publishing a religious magazine called '' the watchtower '' . many of those beliefs , especially about who god is and what his plans are for humans and the earth , are different to what is taught in mainstream christian churches . jehovah 's witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heaven and that the remaining people who obey god will live forever on a paradise earth . they do not believe that god is a trinity . they teach that when people die , they remain in their graves until jesus christ resurrects them after god 's kingdom , or government , is ruling over earth .
