Calculus     calculus is a branch of mathematics which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function . for example , if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day , calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total , and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to . all these formulas are functions of time , and so that is one way to think of calculusâ€”studying functions of time . there are two different types of calculus . differential calculus divides things into small ( `` different '' ) pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next , while integral calculus joins ( `` integrates '' ) the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made , overall , by a series of changes . calculus is used in many different areas of study such as physics , astronomy , biology , engineering , economics , medicine and sociology . in the 1670s and 1680s , sir isaac newton in england and gottfried leibniz in germany figured out calculus at the same time , working separately from each other . newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planets in the sky , because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science , and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships . leibniz wanted to measure the space ( area ) under a curve ( a line which is not straight ) . many years later , the two men argued over who discovered it first . scientists from england supported newton , but scientists from the rest of europe supported leibniz . most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally . some parts of modern calculus come from newton , such as its uses in physics . other parts come from leibniz , such as the symbols used to write it .
