Symbiosis     symbiosis ( pl . symbioses ) means living together . it describes close and long-term relationships between different species . the term was used by albert bernhard frank to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens . and by anton de bary in 1879 , as `` the living together of unlike organisms '' . a symbiont is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits . when one species lives inside another species , or a microscopic symbiont lives inside the cells of a host , it is called an endosymbiont . the relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its evolutionary significance . there appear to be no higher plants or animals without symbionts . those symbionts are of great importance to the larger organisms , who in most cases would be unable to live as they do without their symbionts . mycorrhiza in higher plants , and gut flora in insects and vertebrates are examples . humans are no exception . furthermore , most of these associations are between organisms not just from different species , but from different kingdoms . and lastly , the cells of all eukaryotes contain organelles which are descendants of symbiotic relationships which began at least a billion years ago . mitochondria and plastids are examples . the conclusion must be that symbiosis has been highly significant in the evolution of life .
