Earth     earth is the planet we live on . it is the third planet from the sun . it is the only planet known to have life on it . lots of scientists think the earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago . it is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the solar system . the other three are mercury , venus and mars . the large mass of the sun makes earth move around it , just as the mass of earth makes the moon move around it . earth also turns around in space , so that different parts face the sun at different times . earth goes around the sun once ( one `` year '' ) for every 365Â¼ times it turns all the way around ( one `` day '' ) . earth is the only planet in our solar system that has a large amount of liquid water . about 71 % of the surface of earth is covered by oceans . because of this , people some times called it `` blue planet '' . because of its water , earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals . the things that live on earth have changed its surface greatly . for example , early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen . the living part of earth 's surface is called the `` biosphere '' .
