Pearl     pearls are made of a kind of material made by mollusks , like oysters . pearls are small and often white but sometimes in pale colors or even black . they are often round , but sometimes half-round , oval , or in different shapes . pearls are often used for jewelry . the pearl is the birthstone for the month june . a natural pearl is formed when nacre-producing cells are displaced from the mantle tissue of an oyster . these cells are genetically programmed to produce nacre , the substance that lines the inner sides of an oyster 's shell . when the cells become displaced , often by a boring parasite or damage to the outer shell , they continue to do what they are programmed to do -- produce nacre and form a pearl . they can be very tiny ( as tiny as a peppercorn ) or quite big ( as big as a human 's fist ) . the world 's largest pearl , found in 1934 and called the pearl of lao-tze , is about the size of a basketball . there are two kinds of pearls : saltwater pearls and freshwater pearls . saltwater pearls come from oysters that live in the oceans . freshwater pearls are found in mussels that live in rivers , lakes , or ponds .
