Bauxite     bauxite is the main ore of aluminium . it is mostly aluminium oxide . bauxite is the most important aluminium ore. it is largely made up of the minerals gibbsite al ( oh ) , boehmite γ-alo ( oh ) , and diaspore α-alo ( oh ) , together with the iron oxides goethite and hematite , the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase tio . it was named after the village les baux-de-provence in southern france , where it was first discovered in 1821 by geologist pierre berthier . today the four biggest producers are australia , brazil , china and india . there are two main kinds of bauxite ores : carbonate bauxites ( karst bauxites ) , and silicate bauxites ( lateritic bauxites ) . carbonate bauxites were discovered earlier , and occur mainly in europe and jamaica above carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite . lateritic bauxites occur in many countries of the tropical belt . they were formed from various silicate rocks such as granite , gneiss , basalt , syenite , and shale . for bauxite to be created there must be intense weathering conditions and very good drainage . bauxite deposits with highest aluminium content are frequently located below an iron-bearing surface layer . in lateritic bauxite , the aluminum hydroxide contained in laterite deposits is almost entirely a form called gibbsite .
