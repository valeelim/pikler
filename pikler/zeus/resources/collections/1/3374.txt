BBC     the british broadcasting corporation ( bbc ) , is an organisation in the uk . it broadcasts in the united kingdom and other countries on television , radio and the internet . the bbc also sells its programmes to other broadcasting companies around world . the organisation is run by a group of twelve governors who have been given the job by the queen , on the advice of government ministers . the governors appoint a board of management to take care of running the business of the bbc . the head of the board of management is called the director general . the bbc is established under a royal charter , which allows the bbc to broadcast . in 2006 , the british government looked at the charter to see if it needed changing . another agreement , which goes with the charter , recognises that the bbc should be independent from any other organisation . it also says what the bbc should do for the people in britain ( the public ) . every household in the uk that watches or records `` live '' programmes , ( as they â€™ re being broadcast , or distributed to the public in any other way ) are required , by law , to pay for a tv licence . as the bbc gets its money from tv licences , it does not take money from companies or shareholders , so it does not have to do what they want . also , it is not allowed to broadcast commercials .
