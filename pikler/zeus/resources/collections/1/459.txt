Linear algebra     linear algebra is a branch of mathematics . it came from mathematicians trying to solve systems of linear equations . vectors and matrices are used to solve these systems . the main objects of study currently are vector spaces and linear mappings between vector spaces . linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics ( e.g . differential equations and analytic geometry ) . it can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering , physics and economics . linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate ( rearrange ) systems of linear equations . for example , consider the following equations : these two equations form a system of linear equations . it is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power . the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line . the solution to this system is : since it makes all of the original equations valid , that is , the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations .
