Value (personal and cultural)    value ( personal and cultural ) a value ( or principle ) usually means an abstract rule , one that can be seen to apply in many experiences , or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations . it can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently , for example , some buddhists avoid eating meat as a matter of principle . many groups of people agree on lists of principles . they may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply , that is , which principles should be violated before which other ones . they might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order , and provide more practical ( less abstract ) instruction .
