Constitution     the constitution of a country ( or a state ) is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work . it tells how the country 's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office , how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law , what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed , and how the constitution can be changed . limits are put on the government in how much power they have within the constitution `` ( see rule of law ) '' . on the other hand , countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions , or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others . this can be known as dictatorship or simply `` bending the rules '' . a constitution is often a way of uniting within a federation . the uk 's constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries ' are . in fact , the uk 's constitution is not completely written down at all . some of it can be found in writing , starting with the magna carta of 1215 and the bill of rights act 1689 and including more modern acts of parliament . other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence . because of this , some people say that the united kingdom has a `` de facto '' or `` unwritten '' constitution .
