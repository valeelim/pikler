Larva     many animals develop in separate stages . a larva ( plural : `` larvae '' ) develops from the egg in those animals . it is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage . a larva does not look like the adult animal , and changes shape ( known as metamorphosis ) as it grows up . there may be several larval stages before the adult form . tadpoles , maggots and caterpillars are larvae . marine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column . after fertilisation , the eggs develop into tiny larvae . the larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults . most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs . these live in the plankton , and may be transported long distances . probably the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of larval stages is the need for `` dispersal '' . sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates , and sea-floor groups like mussels and crabs , need some way to move their young into new territory , since they can not move long distances as adults . many species have relatively long pelagic larval stages ( how long a larva is in the water column ) . during this time , larvae feed and grow , and many species move through several stages of development . for example , most barnacles moult through six `` nauplius '' larva stages before moulting to a `` cipris '' , when they look to settle . the larvae eat different food from the adults , and disperse .
