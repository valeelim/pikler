Neutron     neutrons , with protons and electrons , make up an atom . neutrons and protons are found in the nucleus of an atom . unlike protons , which have a positive charge , or electrons , which have a negative charge , neutrons have zero charge which means they are neutral particles . neutrons bind with protons with the residual strong force . neutrons were predicted by ernest rutherford , and discovered by james chadwick , in 1932. atoms were fired at a thin pane of beryllium . particles emerged which had no charge , and he called these 'neutrons ' . they were later added to the modern image of the atom . neutrons have a mass of 1.675 Ã— 10g , which is a little heavier than the proton . neutrons are 1839 times heavier than electrons . like all hadrons , neutrons are made of quarks . a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark . one up quark has a charge of +2/3 , and the two down quarks each have a charge of -1/3 . the fact that these charges cancel out is why neutrons have a neutral ( 0 ) charge . quarks are held together by gluons .
