Light microscope     a light microscope works like a refracting telescope except that the object is very close to the objective lens . an object to be studied , for example a tiny organism so small it looks like just a dot , is put on a slide , which is usually a flat piece of glass . the clips on the microscope 's flat stage hold the slide in place . the stage can be adjusted to add more light . it also moves to allow different layers of the object to be in focus . the user looks through the microscope eyepiece . a mirror at the bottom of the microscope reflects light rays up to the object through a hole in the stage . objective lenses magnify the image which is made even larger when it is seen through the eyepiece lenses . some light microscopes are actually digital cameras , made to photograph small things but having no eyepiece . many microscopes , often used in colleges and high schools , normally have a top magnification of 40x with the option of having 4x and 8x . this lets the microscope show basic cells and other items . others can magnify hundreds of times , or thousands .
