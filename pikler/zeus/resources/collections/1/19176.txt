Battle of Waterloo     the battle of waterloo was a battle that was fought mostly between french and british forces . napoleon was crowned as emperor of france in 1804 , then he launched the successful napoleonic wars . france soon had an empire that stretched from spain to the russian border . the nearest country that was still not captured was great britain . the royal navy had many ships , so invasion by france was not possible . however , great britain was not strong enough to stop napoleon and his army from taking most of mainland europe . napoleon seemed unstoppable until two separate campaigns caused his empire to fall apart . he gathered a huge army to invade and conquer russia once and for all in 1812. however , he did not think that he would have very many difficulties and it turned out he did . his army was caught by the russian winter and destroyed by the weather and lack of food . now that napoleon was much weaker , the countries of eastern europe , led by austria and prussia , began to ally against him , forcing his troops back towards france . meanwhile , a small british army in portugal and spain , led by arthur wellesley ( later to become duke of wellington ) began to win victories over the french armies and to push napoleon â€™ s troops out of spain .
