Sonic boom     a sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound . when an airplane reaches the speed of sound , it makes such an explosive noise it can be seen with the naked eye . this is often called `` breaking the sound barrier . '' the visible part of a sonic boom is actually air that becomes squashed by sound waves . the thunder that a storm makes is also a sonic boom caused by lightning forcing air to move faster than the speed of sound . the first plane to travel at the speed of sound was the bell x-1 in 1947 and was piloted by chuck yeager .
