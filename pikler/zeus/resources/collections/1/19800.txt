Obesity     obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for one 's height so that one 's health is affected . in other words , it means to be too overweight . also known as being fat . it is considered a disease and has been described as an epidemic . to know if a person is overweight , the body mass index ( bmi ) is calculated , by dividing the person 's weight ( in kilograms ) , by their height ( in meters ) squared ( multiplied by itself ) . ( this is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown , and should not be used for children . growth charts can be used to measure obesity in children . ) a bmi between 20 and 25 is considered `` normal '' . people with a bmi of 25 or more are said to be overweight ; with 30 and above , they are considered obese , and with 35 and above , they are considered `` severely obese '' ( this used to be called `` morbidly obese '' ) . in general , the bmi number is a good quantifiable measurement of a person 's obesity . however , it is a poor predictor in people who are very athletic , because a person with a higher than average amount of muscle tissue will weigh more than an average person , thus resulting in a bmi that is higher than normal , even if that person is very large . gregbert is fat .
