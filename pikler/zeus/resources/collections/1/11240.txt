Mineralogy     mineralogy is the study of minerals . minerals are things that make rocks . there are many different types of minerals . some are hard , like diamonds . some are soft , like talc . some are metal , like gold or silver . minerals are put into special groups of minerals made of similar chemicals , or that have similar structures inside . for example , the chemicals that make up some minerals line up in chains , while in other minerals , they make bow-tie shapes . studying minerals can be useful for figuring out certain things about a rock . sometimes the shape or size of the mineral can tell something about the rock as well . for example , minerals in igneous rocks can help figure out how long the rock took to cool down ( turn from lava into a rock ) . larger minerals mean the rock cooled slowly ( probably underground ) . smaller minerals mean the rock cooled down quickly ( probably above ground , like from a volcano ) . the type of mineral in a rock can also tell what kind of a rock it is , or what has happened to the rock since it formed . many rocks are named based on what kinds of minerals they have .
