Slavic peoples     slavs are the people who live in central europe , eastern europe , southeast europe , central asia and north asia . present-day slavic peoples are classified into west slavs ( mainly poles , czechs and slovaks ) , east slavs ( mainly russians , belarusians , and ukrainians ) , and south slavs ( mainly serbs , bulgarians , croats , bosniaks , macedonians , slovenes , and montenegrins ) albanians , austrians , , hungarians , romanians , estonians , lithuanians , and latvians live near the slavic nations , but they are not slavs themselves . there are more slavic peoples than any other ethnic group in europe . russians make up the most slavs , followed by poles and ukrainians . there are many small historic slavic nations like lusatia , rusin , kashubia and others . russia is now the most powerful and populated slavic country , but in the 10th century serbs and czechs were powerful , and in the 16th century poland was the strongest nation in the area . the slavic languages are closely related . the largest similarities can be found within the same group ( e.g . polish and slovak , both west slavic languages ) , but similarities exist even between slavic languages from other different subgroups ( e.g . bulgarian and russian ) . however , the greatest similarities exist between serbian , bosnian and croatian - these south slavic languages are considered separate by the bosnian and croatian governments , but most linguists say they are one language called serbo-croatian . slavic languages are spoken natively by 300 million people , and as second or third languages by many more people in countries as far apart as germany and china .
