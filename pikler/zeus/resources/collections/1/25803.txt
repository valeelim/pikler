Ratio     a ratio between two or more quantities is a way of measuring their sizes compared to each other . for example , if a school has 20 teachers and 500 pupils then the ratio of teachers to students is written as 20:500 ( read as `` 20 to 500 '' ) also you can simplify it and divide them by 20 which equals to 1:25. for another example , if a cake mix asks for 100 grams of flour , 300 grams of butter and 25 grams of sugar then the ratio of flour to butter to sugar is written as 100:300:25 ( read as `` 100 to 300 to 25 '' ) . ratios can be simplified . in the school example , there were 20 teachers to 500 pupils . if we divided the children up into equally sized classes then each teacher 's class would have 25 pupils . that means that for each teacher there are 25 pupils , i.e . the teacher to pupil ratio is 1:25. another way to go from the ratio 20:500 to the ratio 1:25 is to simply divide both numbers in 20:500 by 20. note : the ratio 20:500 is the same as 1:25. they are just two ways of writing the same thing . just like there are different ways of writing a fraction ( for example ) , there are many ways of writing a ratio . the first term is called antecedent and the second term is called consequent.ratio has no units
