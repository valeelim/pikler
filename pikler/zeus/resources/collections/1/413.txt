Kahoolawe     kahoolawe is the smallest of the 8 main volcanic islands in the hawaiian islands , in the united states . it is west of maui and south of lanai and is 11 miles long by across ( ) . the highest point , lua makika , is above sea level . the island is rather dry because its low height does not cause much rain ( orographic precipitation ) to fall from the northeastern trade winds . kahoolawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the united states military because of world war ii , and a defense training area by the united states navy from around 1941 until may 1994. popular feeling in hawaii against this practice finally won , and the navy has been trying to finish a cleanup of unexploded ordnance ( bombs and explosive shells ) from the island . ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground . other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore . in 1981 , the entire island was included on the national register of historic places . the island is planned to be given back to the hawaiian people . in 1993 , the u.s. congress passed a law that `` recognized the cultural importance of the island , required the navy to return the island to the state , and directed the navy to do an unexploded ordnance ( uxo ) cleanup and environmental restoration '' . the turnover officially occurred on november 11 , 2003 , but the cleanup has not yet been completed . the u.s. navy was given $ 400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task , but this work has gone much slower than planned .
