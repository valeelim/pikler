Zeno's paradoxes    zeno 's paradoxes zeno 's paradoxes are a famous set of thought-provoking stories or puzzles . they were created by zeno of elea in the mid-5th century bc . philosophers , physicists , and mathematicians have argued over how to answer the questions raised by zeno 's paradoxes for 25 centuries . nine paradoxes have been attributed to him . zeno constructed them to answer those who thought the idea of parmenides that `` all is one and unchanging '' was absurd . three of zeno 's paradoxes are the most famous and most problematic ; two are presented below . although the specifics of each paradox differ from one another , they all deal with the tension between the apparent continuous nature of space and time and the discrete or incremental nature of physics . in the paradox of achilles and the tortoise , achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise . achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 metres , for example . suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed ( one very fast and one very slow ) . after some finite time , achilles will have run 100 metres , bringing him to the tortoise 's starting point . during this time , the slower tortoise has run a much shorter distance , say , 10 metres . it will then take achilles some further time to run that 10 metre distance , by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther . it will then take still more time for achilles to reach this third point , while the tortoise again moves ahead . thus , whenever achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been , he still has farther to go . therefore , because there are an infinite number of points achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been , he can never overtake the tortoise .
