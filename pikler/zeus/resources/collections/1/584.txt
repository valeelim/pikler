Oxymoron     an oxymoron is a term for a figure of speech . it is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other , or actually are opposite . for example , the words `` wise fool '' , `` warm freezer '' , `` legal murder '' all have two words . in each one , the one word looks like the opposite of the other word . you can have words that look opposite , but are right . for example , a `` warm freezer '' could be right . a freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open . the word oxymoron is an oxymoron ; 'oxy ' comes from the greek word that means 'sharp ' , while 'moron ' comes from the greek word that means 'dull ' . words that really are opposite to each other , would be words that just can not be put together . for example , a `` round square '' could not happen because squares are not round . oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes . sometimes , the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron . for example , a joke that says that `` honest politician '' is an oxymoron . this means that politicians are dishonest , if the word 'politician ' is opposite to 'honest ' .
