Dichlorphenolindophenol     dcpip ( its full name is `` 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol '' ) is a blue chemical used as a dye because when it is rusted , it is blue . once dcpip is reduced ( by addition of electrons ) it does not have a color anymore . this reaction can be reversed , and the colourless dcpip will turn blue again , when it is oxidized . dcpip is often used to measure the electron transport chain in plants . it has a higher redox potential ( electron affinity ) than the fe-s complex in cytochrome b and will therefore `` steal '' electrons from it . this means that cytochrome c does not receive them . the process cuts off the electron supply of photosystem i. a common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of vitamin c solution . this reduces the 'jelly ' by transforming it to a colourless mass . this experiment can be carried out to illustrate the effect of changing cell sizes on sa/v ( surface area : volume ratio ) . this is known as titration . references . - mathews , ahern , van holde , `` biochemistry '' , addison wesley longman inc. , 2000 pp534â€“5
