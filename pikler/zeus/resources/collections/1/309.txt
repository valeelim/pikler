God's eye view    god 's eye view god 's eye view is a name for a point of view where the speaker or writer assumes they have knowledge only god would have . it appears several ways : - in religion , when an institution claims to speak for a divine being . - in writing , when an author leaves the point of view of the main actor to start writing about things they could not know if the story were in real life . - in science , when a scientist ignores the way a subject-object problem affects statistics or an observer effect affects experiment . - in medicine when the doctor makes a claim that the gaze he uses on a patient , actually sees the problem , rather than making a guess at a problem . - in ethics when a statement is made about who or what is right , without an honest attempt to make the process of deciding this consider all points of view . a special case of the last is in a wiki with a godking . often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right , without making any special effort to be fair to other views .
