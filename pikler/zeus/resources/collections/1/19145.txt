Debt     debt is what someone owes to someone else . usually , debt is in the form of money , but it can also be items , services , favors , or other things . thus if you make an agreement to give or do something for someone else , you now owe a debt . goods , services or money borrowed with the intent of repayment ( in kind or not ) creates a debt . debt can be secured or unsecured in nature . a secured debt uses `` collateral '' , which is an asset that is promised to the debt-holder until the debt has been repaid . if the repayment is not made in full , the lender gets the collateral asset . for instance , a car loan typically creates a secured debt . if you still owe money on the car loan and do not make timely payments , the note-holder can take back ( or repossess ) the car and sell it to get the money still due . a home mortgage is similar . an unsecured debt is more risky to the debt-holder ( the lender , also called creditor ) . in the event of non-payment of the debt , the lender can not take assets . credit card debt is typically unsecured . if you charge items to a credit card and do not make the monthly payments , the credit card issuer can report the non-payment to the credit-reporting agencies . that will reduce your credit score so others will not lend you money . but usually they can not take back whatever you bought with the card .
