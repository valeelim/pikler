Microeconomics     microeconomics is the science of how people make decisions at the small scale . it is different from macroeconomics which looks at how the economy works as a whole ( `` on aggregate '' ) . in microeconomics , we might look at how a person chooses what to buy at the store , or how many things a company will make . some parts of microeconomics include `` consumer theory '' and `` theory of the firm '' , which study how people and businesses make decisions . game theory looks at how people make decisions when the outcome ( how something ends ) depends on what decision another person makes ; when agents are said to act `` strategically '' . related pages . - macroeconomics __noeditsection__
