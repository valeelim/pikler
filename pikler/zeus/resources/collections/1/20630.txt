Glider     gliders are aircraft which do not have a motor . gliders are controlled by their pilots by using control-sticks . some gliders can only carry one person ; others can carry two . in gliders with two seats , each pilot has a control-stick . gliders always have seats for the pilots . 'sailplanes ' are gliders with long wings so that they will only lose height slowly . in some places a vertical draft makes the air go up faster than the glider is going down . the pilot of a glider can make it climb by flying to these places . this is called soaring . good pilots can travel long distances by always finding rising air . some pilots race each other over hundreds of kilometres each day . other pilots just fly for fun . gliders can not get into the air by themselves . they are pulled into the air by an aircraft with a motor or they are pulled up by motor on the ground . there are two other types of gliders . hang-gliders have frames to give the wings their shape , but do not have seats for their pilots and do not have control-sticks . the wings of paragliders are like parachutes and so do not have frames to give them their shape . these other two types of glider are often launched from the tops of hills or cliffs .
