Sport utility vehicle     a sport utility vehicle ( suv ) is a type of vehicle . it is built to be a rugged vehicle that combines cargo and passenger carrying capacity . originally suvs were not designed to be fuel efficient but modern designs are getting much better fuel mileage . in 2014 us sales of suvs were over five million vehicles . the typical suv is a two-box design . unlike a pickup truck that has an open cargo box the suv has an enclosed cargo/passenger compartment . it has upright seating for five to seven passengers . it has an open interior with no trunk . it is often built on a pickup truck chassis for towing capacity , and usually has four wheel drive . only about 15 % of suv owners ever go off road . according to jeep wrangler brand manager kevin metz , 60 % of jeep wrangler owners go off road while around 80 % of rubicon owners do . a similar class of vehicle is the crossover ( cuv ) , but it is built on a car chassis . often it uses a unibody chassis instead of the heavier body-on-frame design of suvs . crossover vehicles often have all-wheel-drive instead of four-wheel drive . crossovers are usually lighter than suvs and get better fuel mileage . in general , when referring to an suv , many include crossovers . however it is incorrect to refer to an suv on a truck frame as a crossover .
