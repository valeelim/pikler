Fungus     a fungus ( plural : fungi ) is a kind of living organism : yeasts , moulds and mushrooms are types of fungi . the fungi are a separate kingdom of living things , different from animals and plants . fungi have cells with nuclei . their cell walls contain chitin , unlike the cell walls of plants , which contain cellulose . these and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms , called the eumycota or eumycetes . they share a common ancestor and are monophyletic group . their basic mode of life is `` saprophytic '' : a fungus breaks down dead organic matter around it , and uses it as food . fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually . some fungi grow mushrooms : these are fruiting bodies . under the cap there are gills ; the gills bear spores that will disperse , and may develop into new fungi . otherwise , fungi use a sporangium to bear asexual spores by mitosis , or sexual spores by meiosis . the spores are haploid . fungi may be single celled or multicellular . yeast is single-celled , and reproduces either sexually or asexually . asexual reproduction occurs by simple budding ( binary fission ) .
