Antenna     an antenna or aerial is a metal device made to send or receive radio waves . many electronic devices like radio , television , radar , wireless lan , cell phone , and gps need antennas to do their job . antennas work both in air and outer space . the word 'antenna ' is from guglielmo marconi 's test with wireless equipment in 1895. for the test , he used a 2.5 meter long pole antenna with a tent pole called ' `` l'antenna centrale '' ' in italian . so his antenna was simply called ' `` l'antenna '' ' . after that , the word 'antenna ' became popular among people and had the meaning it has today . the plural of antenna is either `` antennas '' or `` antennae '' ( u.s. and canada tends to use `` antennas '' more than other places ) . each one is made to work for a specific frequency range . the antenna 's length or size usually depends on the wavelength ( 1/frequency ) it uses . different kinds of antenna have different purposes . for example , the isotropic radiator is an imaginary antenna that sends signals equally in all directions . the dipole antenna is simply two wires with one end of each wire connected to the radio and the other end standing free in space . it sends or receives signals in all directions except where the wires are pointing . some antennas are more directional . horn is used where high gain is needed , the wavelength is short . satellite television and radio telescopes mostly use dish antennas .
