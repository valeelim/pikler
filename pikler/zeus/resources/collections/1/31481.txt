M6 motorway     the m6 motorway is the longest motorway in the united kingdom . it is also one of the busiest motorways in the country . it is often referred to as `` the backbone of britain '' . the m6 is part of the unsigned e-road e24 from the m1 to the m6 toll near birmingham . the e5 joins the m6 toll from the m42 and then uses the m6 to its north end at carlisle . then it continues along the m74 . the motorway is 230 miles ( 370km ) long . this is 37 miles longer than the m1 motorway . the first section of the motorway was the preston by-pass , opened on 5 december 1958. it was built by a company called tarmac construction . it was the first motorway in the united kingdom . it was opened by prime minister harold macmillan . the motorway was later extended in both directions . junction 6 in birmingham has the name spaghetti junction . this is because it looks very complex from the sky . on the high ground between shap and tebay , the north and south-bound carriages split apart . strangely , at this point a local road runs between the two carriageways without a link to the motorway .
