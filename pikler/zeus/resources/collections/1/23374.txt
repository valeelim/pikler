Liu Bei     liu bei ( 161-223 ) was the founder of the chinese shu han dynasty and its first emperor . he went into battle against the yellow scarves rebellion in 184 , along with his sworn brothers guan yu and zhang fei . later ( in 190 ) he joined gongsun zan against the evil dong zhuo who had seized the han emperor xian . after dong lost , the emperor was in the clutches of his followersâ€”until cao cao saved him and seized control over him . cao cao tried to conquer all of china for the emperor but in fact wanted to conquer it for himself . he defeated liu bei once at the battle of changban in 207 but was not able to win the battle of red cliffs against the united forces of liu bei and sun quan , a warlord in the south . sun quan granted liu bei some land in the west of his domain , and the two agreed to fight cao cao again if necessary . from 211 to 214 , liu bei conquered the country ba shu in the west . because he had now an empire of his own , sun quan demanded his western regions back but liu bei declined . this made sun quan quite angry .
