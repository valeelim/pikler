Soy sauce     soy sauce ( us ) or soya sauce is a fermented sauce made from soy beans ( soya beans ) , roasted grain , water and salt . it is commonly used in chinese , japanese and korean cuisine . it appears in some western cuisine dishes , especially as an ingredient in worcestershire sauce . real soy sauces are fermented with kōji ( 麹 , the mold aspergillus oryzae or `` a. sojae '' ) and other related microorganisms . almost all soy sauce has some alcohol added during bottling . this acts as a preservative to protect it from going bad . for this reason , soy sauce should always be kept in the fridge . it should also not be put in direct light . an opened bottle of soy sauce that has been left unrefrigerated could become slightly bitter . although there are many types of soy sauce , all are salty and earthy-tasting brownish liquids used to season food while cooking or at the table . what some westerners can only describe as a flavorful , kind of sweet taste is a distinct basic taste called `` umami '' by the japanese and `` xian-wei '' ( 鲜味 , `` lit . '' fresh taste ) by the chinese .
