Audiolingual method     the audiolingual method is a method for teaching foreign languages . linguists at the university of michigan invented this method in the late 1950s . in the audiolingual method , students first hear a language . later , they speak the language , and after that , they read and write in it . this way of language teaching is similar to the direct method . like the direct method , the audiolingual method does not use the students â€™ native language . for example , if you are in an english class in turkey , the teacher only speaks english , and no turkish . however , unlike the direct method , the audiolingual method does not teach vocabulary . rather , the teacher drills grammar . in the audiolingual method , grammar is most important for the student . in other words , the student must repeat grammar patterns after the teacher . the students do not learn lots of vocabulary . this method also uses psychology . the students get a reward for speaking correctly . they get punishment if they speak incorrectly ; because it is based on habit formation , which is establishesd by stimulus , response and reinforcement . it gives priority to speaking the target language , and using the native language is not allowed .
