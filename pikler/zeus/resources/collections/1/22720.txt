Mebibyte     a mebibyte is a unit of measure . it represents 1024 * 1024 bytes . a mebibyte ( a contraction of mega binary byte ) is a unit of information or computer storage , symbol mib . the mebibyte is closely related to the megabyte ( mb ) . this can either be a synonym for mebibyte , or refer to 10 bytes = 1,000,000 bytes , depending on context ( see binary prefix for background ) . the two numbers are relatively close together , but mistaking the two has nevertheless led to problems . the unit mib was defined by the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) in december 1998. use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by ieee and cipm and is becoming more common . one mebibyte equals 1024 ( = 2 ) kibibytes , and 1024 mebibytes equal one gibibyte . mibibyte is a common misspelling , presumably from the `` i '' in the abbreviation or confusion about how the surrounding prefixes ( i.e . `` kibi '' and `` gibi '' ) were actually formed . the `` i '' is actually from the end of the prefix . tebi- and pebi- are similarly abbreviated ti- and pi- , but they are not usually misspelled , as storage sizes ( and corresponding terms ) currently are only this large in specialized situations .
