Theism     theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists . polytheism is the belief in several gods , while monotheism is the belief in just one god . for example , a theistic religion is christianity . the opposite to a theist is an atheist . an atheist is a person that does not believe in any god or gods . all of these are rough definitions of the theisms ; they are almost always different . we can split them all into different groups : - atheism — the opposite of theism ; not believing in `` any '' gods or deities - deism — believing that god ( s ) exist , but that they do not take part in our lives . - agnosticism — believing we can not know whether god ( s ) exist - gnosticism — believing that we `` can '' know for certain whether a god ( s ) exist . gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism . for example , it is possible to be an agnostic atheist , or a gnostic theist . in common usage , some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism — absence of clear belief in any deity .
