Neutron star     a neutron star is a very small and dense star made almost completely of neutrons . they are small stars with a radius of about 1111.5 kilometres . they have a mass of about twice that of the sun . they are the smallest and densest stars known to exist in the universe . they are what is left of a huge star which exploded as a supernova . the density of the star is like that of the nucleus of an atom . they have strong magnetic fields , between 10 and 10 times as strong as that of earth . the gravitational field at the neutron star 's surface is about 2Ã—10 times stronger than on earth . to imagine how dense a neutron star is , take all of the mass of our sun ( which has a diameter of ) and push it down into a size that would fit into a ball with a diameter . another way to understand the density is this : one teaspoon of matter from the neutron star would weigh 6 billion tons . neutron stars spin very fast , from 0.001 second up to 30 seconds to turn . they come in different types . they may emit beams of electromagnetic radiation as pulsars . other types are magnetars and binary pulsars .
