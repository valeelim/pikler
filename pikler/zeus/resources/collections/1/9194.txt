Diameter     in geometry , the diameter of a circle is a line from one side directly to the opposite side through the centre . it can also be defined as the longest chord of a circle . these are both explanations to describe the diameter in a sphere too . the letter `` d '' or the symbol âŒ€ are often used as a symbol for the diameter . the diameter 's length is often called the diameter itself . the diameter 's length is twice the radius , and therefore the relationship between the diameter 's length and radius can be shown with the equations : formula_1 and formula_2
