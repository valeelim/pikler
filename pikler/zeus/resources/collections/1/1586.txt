Copyright     the copyright law is a law that gives the owner of a written document , musical composition , book , picture , or other creative work , the right to decide what other people can do with it . copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works . because of copyright , a work can only be copied if the owner of the copyright gives permission . when someone copies or edits a work that is protected under copyright without permission , the owner may sue for the value of the violation . most such cases are handled by civil law . in more serious cases , a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested , fined or even go to prison . in most countries , authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create , as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else . in most countries , there is no need to register the copyright , and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights . but , where registration is available , many authors register anyway , especially for works that are sold for money . that is because registration helps to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author .
