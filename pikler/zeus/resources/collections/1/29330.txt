Zip drive     the zip drive is a data storage device . the company iomega published it in late 1994. originally it only supported 100 mb disks , but later versions began to support 250 mb and 750 mb disks . now capacities have reached 1gb and 2gb disks . higher capacity zip disks must be used in a drive with at least the same capacity ability . generally , higher capacity drives also handle all lower capacity media . however , it is slower to write data on a 100 mb disk with a 250 mb zip drive than with a 100 mb zip drive . zip drives can transmit data to the computer in various ways . internal drives have been made with ide and scsi interfaces . external drives can use scsi , parallel port or usb interface . zip disks are thicker than 3.5 '' ( 9 cm ) floppy disks . nevertheless , zip disks are quite similar in appearance to regular floppy disks . this means the zip drive slot is large enough to accept such a floppy disk .
