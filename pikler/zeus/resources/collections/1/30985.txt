Plesiosaur     the plesiosaurs were an order of large , carnivorous marine reptiles . they flourished from 245 million years ago ( mya ) to 65 mya . in 1719 , william stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur . the great-grandfather of charles darwin , robert darwin of elston told him about it . mary anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur . she found it on the 'jurassic coast ' of dorset , england in the winter of 1820/21 . the fossil was missing its skull , but in 1823 she found another one , this time complete with its skull . the name `` plesiosaurus '' was given to it by the rev . william conybeare . the earliest plesiosaur remains are from the middle triassic period , and the group was important through the jurassic and cretaceous . they had two large pairs of paddles , short tails , short or long necks , and broad bodies . they died out at the k/t extinction event , 65 million years ago . plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers , making them flexible . no modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy : modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming . they were mainly piscivorous ( fish-eaters ) .
