Evolution     evolution is a scientific theory used by biologists . it explains how living things change over a long time , and how they have come to be the way they are . earth is very old . by studying the layers of rock that make up earth 's crust , we can find out about its past . this kind of research is called historical geology . we know that living things have changed over time , because we can see their remains in the rocks . these remains are called 'fossils ' . so , we know that the animals and plants of today are different from those of long ago . and the further we go back , the more different the fossils are . how has this come about ? evolution has taken place . that evolution has taken place is a fact , because it is overwhelmingly supported by many lines of evidence . at the same time , evolutionary questions are still being actively researched by biologists . comparison of dna sequences allows organisms to be grouped by how similar their sequences are . in 2010 an analysis compared sequences to phylogenetic trees , and supported the idea of common descent . there is now `` strong quantitative support , by a formal test '' , for the unity of life .
