Mark Twain     samuel langhorne clemens ( november 30 , 1835 â€“ april 21 , 1910 ) , more widely known as mark twain , was a well known american writer born in florida , missouri . he worked mainly for newspapers and as a steamboat pilot on the mississippi river before he became a writer . he married in 1870 , and raised his family in hartford , connecticut . in later life he invested and lost the money that his writing had made , and toured the world giving lectures that brought him enough money to pay his debt and recover his fortune . clemens was best known for his works in fiction , and especially for his use of humour . his first published story , in 1865 , was `` the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county . '' `` adventures of huckleberry finn '' is considered by many to be clemens ' best work . this story of a white boy who helps a black man escape slavery in the southern united states is known for its humanity . clemens 's style was usually informal and humorous . this made him different from many important 19th century writers whose books he disliked . for example , he greatly disliked jane austen 's works , such as `` sense and sensibility '' and `` pride and prejudice '' , and famously remarked , `` she makes me detest ( hate ) all her people , without reserve .
