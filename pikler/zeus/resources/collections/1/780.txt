Sabbath in Christianity     sabbath in christianity is the day of rest and service to god . the idea of the sabbath in christianity comes directly from the idea of the sabbath ( or shabbat ) in judaism . in fact , the word sabbath itself comes from the hebrew word `` shabbat . '' like the jewish sabbath ( shabbat ) , the sabbath in christianity comes from the genesis story of creation . but unlike jews , most christians have sabbath on sunday , not saturday . they also rest , but not the same way as jews . the exact way depends on the church denomination . most christians honor the sabbath on sunday to remember the resurrection of jesus on the first day of the week on the jewish calendar . they say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the christian day of worship and the sabbath-day ordinance . these two rules are not literally identical though . they say that this ordinance is no longer valid , because god has replaced his old creation by a new one . for this reason , the obligation to keep the sabbath is not the same for christians as for jews . they say there are examples in the new testament , and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries .
