Diesel-electric     a diesel-electric engine is a diesel generator , a diesel engine that drives an electric generator . the generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft . its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears . most locomotives and many ships use diesel-electric drive . many diesel-electric drives , especially small ones , store the electricity in a battery . some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel , which can also charge a battery . however , these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle , so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving . because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design , diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today 's internal combustion engine . when properly tuned , they have low emissions and they use only about one-third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles .
