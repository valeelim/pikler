Walpurgis Night     walpurgis night ( `` valborgsmässoafton '' in swedish , `` vappu '' in finnish , `` volbriöö '' in estonian , `` valpurģu nakts '' or `` valpurģi '' in latvian , `` walpurgisnacht '' in german ) , `` čarodějnice '' in czech is a holiday celebrated on april 30 or may 1 , in finland , sweden , bohemia ( czech republic ) , estonia , latvia and germany . the festival is named after saint walburga ( known in scandinavia as `` valborg '' ; alternative forms are `` walpurgis '' , `` wealdburg '' , or `` valderburger '' ) , born in wessex in 710 a niece of saint boniface . according to legend , she was a daughter to the saxon prince st. richard . together with her brothers she travelled to württemberg , germany where she became a nun and lived in the convent of heidenheim , which was founded by her brother wunibald . walburga died on 25 february 779 and that day still carries her name in the catholic calendar . however she was not made a saint until 1 may in the same year , and that day carries her name in the swedish calendar . historically the walpurgisnacht is derived from pagan spring customs , where the arrival of spring was celebrated with bonfires at night . viking fertility celebrations took place around april 30 and due to walburga being declared a saint at that time of year , her name became associated with the celebrations . walburga was worshipped in the same way that vikings had celebrated spring and as they spread throughout europe , the two dates became mixed together and created the walpurgis night celebration .
