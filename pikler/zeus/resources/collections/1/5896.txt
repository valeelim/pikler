Bee     bees are flying insects of the hymenoptera , which also includes ants , wasps and sawflies . there are about 20,000 species of bees . bees collect pollen from flowers . bees can be found on all continents except antarctica . bees fall into four groups : - honeybees , including the africanized honeybee and cornish bee . - bumblebees - stingless bees - solitary bees the european honey bee ( called `` apis mellifera '' by biologists ) , is kept by humans for honey . keeping bees to make honey is called beekeeping , or apiculture . the earliest animal-pollinated flowers were pollinated by insects such as beetles , long before bees first appeared . bees are different because they are `` specialized '' as pollination agents , with behavioral and physical modifications that make pollination easier . bees are generally better at the task than other pollinating insects such as beetles , flies , butterflies and pollen wasps . the appearance of such floral specialists is believed to have driven the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms , and , in turn , the bees themselves .
