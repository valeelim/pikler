Nuclear fission     nuclear fission is a nuclear process . it is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms . the process gives off a lot of energy , and is used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors . nuclear fission was discovered in december 1938 by the german nuclear chemist otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann in berlin . an atom is the smallest particle which makes up a chemical element ( e.g . hydrogen , oxygen , magnesium ) . all atoms are very small . a small ball called a nucleus is at the center of every atom . elements which have large nuclei , such as uranium and plutonium , can be made to fission . if a ( relatively ) very large nucleus is hit by a slow-moving neutron , it will sometimes become unstable and break into two nuclei . when the nucleus breaks apart ( or fissions ) it releases a lot of energy and it also causes some neutrons to be released . for a few isotopes one such fission can release many neutrons . if those neutrons then hit other atoms , they will make the other atoms split . this can happen again and again . this is called a nuclear chain-reaction , and it can release huge amounts of energy very quickly . the amount of energy released by a nuclear chain reaction is measured in kilotons . one kiloton is the same as the energy of one thousand tons of tnt ( trinitrotoluene ) .
