Comoving distance     in normal cosmology , 'comoving ' distance or 'proper distance ' is one of several distances measured by cosmologists to define distances between objects . to talk about the shape of the universe , scientists want to forget that the universe is expanding . so they separate the shape from time and pretend that the universe is not expanding . they remember that , really , the universe is expanding , but they write this in a variable called the scale factor . then , the distances they talk about , while putting the scale factor to the side , are called comoving distances . when they think about the universe using comoving distance , they think of the universe as not expanding . this way , some calculations are easier . when the part of the universe which we can see today started , it was very small . everything in this part of the universe was much closer together than today . it was also very hot and photons ( particles of light ) were moving in different directions . light moves very fast , but the light speed is limited and the universe was expanding very fast .
