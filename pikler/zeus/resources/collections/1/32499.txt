Hydra (animal)    hydra ( animal ) hydras are simple invertebrates , with two layers of body cells . they live in the fresh water . their body is radially symmetric . they have a central cavity that serves to both take in food and expel waste . being cnidarians they have stinging cells on their tentacles . they are hydrozoa , and belong to the same order as the polyps . most hydras are microscopic in size . hydras can be found in almost any unpolluted body of water . hydras reproduce in an agamete way called budding . in budding , the offspring forms as a lump on the parent and eventually becomes big enough to break off and live by itself . they can move if they need to by a kind of slow somersaulting motion . recent research has found they produce an antimicrobial protein `` hydramacin '' , which protects their outer layer from bacterial infection .
