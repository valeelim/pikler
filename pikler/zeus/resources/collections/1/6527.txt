Battery     a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy by a chemical reaction . usually the chemicals are kept inside the battery . it is used in a circuit to power other components . a battery produces direct current ( dc ) electricity ( electricity that flows in one direction , and does not switch back and forth ) . using the electricity from an outlet in a building is cheaper and more efficient , but a battery can provide electricity in areas that do not have electric power distribution . it is also useful for things that move , such as electric vehicles and mobile phones . a battery can be one `` cell '' or many `` cells '' . each cell has an anode , cathode and electrolyte . the electrolyte is the main material inside the battery . it is often a type of acid , and can be dangerous to touch . the anode reacts with the electrolyte to produce electrons ( this is the `` negative '' or `` - '' end ) . the cathode reacts with the electrolyte and takes electrons ( this is the `` positive '' or `` + '' end ) . an electric current happens when a wire connects the anode to the cathode , and the electrons move from one end to the other . ( but a battery can be damaged by just a wire connecting the two ends , so a `` load '' is also needed between the two ends . the load is something that slows the electrons down , and usually does something useful , like a lightbulb in a flashlight , or the electronics in a calculator ) .
