Echo (mythology)    echo ( mythology ) echo was a nymph in greek mythology , and an oread ( a mountain nymph ) . she was very beautiful , but loved her own voice . according to `` ovid '' , echo once had the job of distracting hera from zeus having relationships with other women . she did this by leading hera away and flattering her . when hera found out she was very angry with echo . she put a curse on her that meant that she could only speak the last words of other people after she had heard them . it is due to this story that we get the meaning behind the word `` echo '' . after she was cursed , echo fell in love with narcissus . narcissus was very handsome and anybody who saw him always fell in love with him . however , narcissus had no heart and could not fall in love with anybody . echo could not speak to narcissus but wanted to be able to see him . she therefore followed him everywhere , but made sure that he could not see her . narcissus got lost and called out `` '' is anyone here ? '' . echo said back `` here , here , here . '' '' narcissus then asked echo to come out of her hiding place . echo did so and then told narcissus that she loved him by hand movements . narcissus , who was angry that so many people loved him , told echo that he did not love her .
