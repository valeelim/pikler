International Criminal Court     the international criminal court ( icc ) was created on 1 july 2002. it investigates and punishes people for genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes . it is sometimes called the icc or the icct . the icc 's main office is in the hague in the netherlands . it has smaller offices in new york city , kampala , kinshasa , bunia , abéché and bangui . the icc is different from the international court of justice ( icj ) . the main difference is that icj settles arguments between countries , but the icc punishes people . on 1 january 2008 , 105 countries were members of the icc . these countries have a duty to help the icc . nearly all the countries in europe and south america are members , and about half the countries in africa are members . only a few countries in asia have joined . the icc can normally only investigate three kinds of crime : - crimes that were committed in member-countries - crimes that were committed by people from member-countries - crimes that the united nations security council wants the icc to investigate
