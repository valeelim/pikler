Electric motor     an electric motor changes electrical energy into mechanical movement . a dynamo or an electric generator does the reverse : it changes mechanical movement into electric energy . most of the electric motors work by using the force of magnetism . but , an electric motor may work using different types of forces . let 's start by looking at the overall plan of a simple two-pole dc electric motor . a simple motor has six parts : • armature or rotor • commutator • brushes • axle • field magnet • dc power supply of some sort an electric motor is all about magnets and magnetism : a motor uses magnets to create motion . if you have ever played with magnets you know about the fundamental law of all magnets : opposites attract and likes repel . so if you have two bar magnets with their ends marked `` north '' and `` south , '' then the north end of one magnet will attract the south end of the other . on the other hand , the north end of one magnet will repel the north end of the other ( and similarly , south will repel south ) . inside an electric motor , these attracting and repelling forces create rotational motion .
