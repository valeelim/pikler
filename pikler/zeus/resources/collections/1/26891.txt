Ancient history     ancient history is all the events we know about between the invention of writing and the start of the middle ages . writing is one of the greatest inventions of the human species . it was invented after the neolithic revolution in which people settled in small towns and started agriculture . writing dates from about 3,300 bc , which is over 5000 years ago , in the middle east . the first people to use writing were the sumerians and the ancient egyptians . before writing , the only things we have are the tools and monuments made by earlier people . this is studied by archaeology rather than history . the period of ancient history ends with the early middle ages . finding facts about ancient history is difficult because people wrote less in those times and much of what they did write has been lost . there were very few copies made because there was no printing . what people wrote they wrote by hand . more people could read and write in ancient rome than in other places but much of what they wrote is now lost . historians also look at things that were made and used in ancient history to learn more about it .
