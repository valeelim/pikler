Cacao tree     the cacao tree is a small tree originally grown in tropical south america . it is small , and only grows to 4 to 8 meters in height . its seeds are called cocoa and are used to produce cocoa butter , the chocolate drink , as well as chocolate . nowadays the trees are grown in plantations in many tropical countries . cacao is planted on over 70000 square kilometres worldwide with 40 % of production coming from c√¥te d'ivoire , ghana , and indonesia . each country produces about 15 % , with smaller amounts coming from brazil , nigeria , and cameroon . a tree begins to bear fruit when it is 4 or 5 years old . in one year , when mature , it may have 6,000 flowers , but only about 20 pods . about 300-600 seeds ( 10 pods ) are required to produce around 1 kg of cocoa paste . there are three main cultivar groups of cacao beans used to make cocoa and chocolate . the most prized , rare , and expensive is the criollo group , the cocoa bean used by the maya . only 10 % of chocolate is made from the criollo , which is less bitter and more aromatic than any other bean . the cacao bean in 80 % of chocolate is made using beans of the forastero group . forastero trees are significantly hardier than criollo trees , resulting in cheaper cacao beans . trinitario , a hybrid of criollo and forastero , is used in about 10 % of chocolate . for details of processing , see cocoa .
