Veganism     veganism is a philosophy that says people should not use animals . there are vegans who choose not to eat animals , and vegans who choose not to use them in any other way either . vegans avoid food that comes from animals , including meat , eggs and dairy products ( like milk , cheese , and yogurt ) . a vegan diet is sometimes called a strict vegetarian diet . some vegans also do not eat honey . many vegans try not to use any other animal products , such as leather , wool , feathers , bone , or pearl . they also try to avoid products that have been tested on animals . they may believe in animal rights , and may campaign for it . vegans eat fruits , vegetables , beans , grains , nuts , and seeds , and things made from them like vegan sweets , vegan cheese and vegan cakes . some people become vegan because they disagree with the treatment of animals in the modern animal farm industry . other reasons to become vegan are for health , religious reasons , to protect the environment , or because of world hunger . animals eat a lot and take up a lot of resources . by not producing meat , milk , or eggs , a lot of food , land ( as of 2006 , 30 % of the earth 's land mass is used raising animals for food ) and water can be saved . for instance , it takes about 16 pounds of grain to make 1 pound of grain-fed meat , so eating plants directly takes fewer resources .
