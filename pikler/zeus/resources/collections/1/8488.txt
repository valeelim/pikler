Pupil (eye)    pupil ( eye ) the pupil is the opening in the centre of the eye . light enters through the pupil and goes through the lens , which focuses the image on the retina . the size of the pupil is controlled by muscles . there is a circular group , which squeezes the iris smaller , and another group which pulls the iris wider . when more light is needed , the pupil is made larger . in brighter light , the pupil is made smaller . the pupil can be compared with the aperture of a camera . it is surrounded by the iris which is the colored part of the eye . the lens changes its shape depending on how far away the eye focuses . the focus point is where the eye is focusing on . the light makes the pupil change its size . when it is darker , the pupils will dilate ( get bigger ) because they need to allow more light into the eye to see . when it is bright , the pupil will constrict ( get smaller ) to restrict the amount of light there is getting into the eye so we can see . the pupil is normally black in most animals , but in some reptiles , it can be a different colour .
