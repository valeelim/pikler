Immunology     immunology is the study of the immune system . the immune system is the parts of the body which work against infection and parasitism by other living things . immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases , and with malfunctions of the immune system . an immune system is present in all plants and animals . we know this because biologists have found genes coding for toll-like receptors in many different metazoans . these toll-like receptors can recognise bacteria as 'foreign ' , and are the starting-point for immune reactions . the type of immunity which is triggered by the toll-like receptors is called innate immunity . this is because it is entirely inherited in our genome , and is fully working as soon as our tissues and organs are properly developed . vertebrates , `` and only vertebrates '' , have a second type of immunity . this is called adaptive immunity , because it 'remembers ' previous infections . then , if the same infection occurs again , the reaction is much stronger and faster . this immunological memory `` confers a tremendous survival advantage '' and with it vertebrates `` can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen-filled environment '' .
