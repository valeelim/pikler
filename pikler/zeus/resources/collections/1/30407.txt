Tort     tort law is the part of law for most harms that are not either criminal or based on a contract . tort law helps people to make claims for compensation ( repayment ) when someone hurts them or hurts their property . for example , a car accident where one driver hurts another driver because he or she was not paying attention might be a tort . if a person is hurt by someone else , he or she can sue in court . many torts are accidents , like car accidents or slippery floors that make people fall down and get hurt . but some torts are done on purpose . these are called `` intentional '' torts . for example , if one person punches another person in the nose , it might be an intentional tort called `` battery '' . many torts cause physical harm to people . some torts cause damage to property , like a broken window . some torts can harm other things , like someone 's reputation or a business . the kinds of torts this article talks about are a part of the common law . the common law is found in england and former british colonies , such as the united states of america . different laws are found in civil law countries such as france or germany . in those countries people usually use the word delict instead of tort , but they mean very similar things .
