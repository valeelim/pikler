Meteor     a meteor is what you see when a space rock falls to earth . it is often known as a shooting star or falling star and can be a bright light in the night sky , though most are faint . if it hits the ground , it is then called a meteorite , and a large one sometimes leaves a hole in the ground called a crater . a rock that has not yet hit the atmosphere is called a `` meteoroid '' . meteoroids may range in size from large pieces of rock to tiny dust particles floating in space that did not form planets . when the meteoroids enter earth 's atmosphere they are usually going faster than the earth 's escape velocity of 13 km/sec or mach 40. this makes them heat up and usually break apart . when the heat makes them glow , they are known as meteors . meteors are distinct from comets or asteroids , but some , especially those associated with meteor showers , are dust particles that came out of comets . there are several types of meteorites including : stony , carbonaceous chondrites , and iron-nickel . stony meteorites are named because they are largely made up of stone-like mineral material . carbonaceous chondrites have a high carbon content . iron-nickel meteorites are mostly iron often with significant nickel as well .
