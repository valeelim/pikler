Kyoto Protocol     the kyoto protocol is a plan created by the united nations for the `` united nations framework convention on climate change '' that tries to reduce the effects of climate change , such as global warming . the plan says that countries that adopt ( follow ) the kyoto protocol have to try to reduce how much carbon dioxide ( and other `` greenhouse gases '' that pollute the atmosphere ) they release into the air . the full name of the kyoto protocol is the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change . it is called the `` kyoto '' protocol because it was made in kyoto , japan . the kyoto protocol was officially put into `` full force '' on february 16 , 2005. on february 16 , russia began to follow ( ratify ) the kyoto protocol and it was decided to be put into `` full force '' . as of february 2009 , 183 countries have agreed to follow the kyoto protocol , who make up for more than 55 % of the greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere . there are still 29 countries which have not yet adopted it . croatia and kazakhstan have signed the treaty , but have not ratified it ( made it a law they have to follow ) . the united states of america has signed it but said that they will not ratify it . australia has only recently ratified the kyoto protocol under the previous prime minister , john howard . both of these countries have said that the fact that china and india are using exceptions to the treaty ( those countries believe parts of the treaty do not apply to them and they will not follow those parts ) in the name of industrialization is unfair and that they will not ratify because of this , although it is believed that the u.s. and australia are protecting their economic interests by not ratifying . the countries ' leaders say that changing their use of greenhouse gases will make their people lose jobs . the twenty four other countries have neither signed nor ratified the treaty .
