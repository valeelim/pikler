Coal     coal is a flammable black hard rock used as a solid fossil fuel . it is mainly made up of 65-95 % carbon and also contains hydrogen , sulphur , oxygen and nitrogen . it is a sedimentary rock formed from peat , by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top . the harder forms of coal , such as anthracite , are metamorphic rocks because they were changed by higher temperature and pressure . peat , and therefore coal , is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands , such as those of the late carboniferous period ( the pennsylvanian ) . a similar substance made from wood by heating it in an airless space is called charcoal . coal can be burned for energy or heat . about two-thirds of the coal mined today is burned in power stations to make electricity . coal is becoming less popular in new power plants as less expensive and less polluting technologies such as natural gas and hydroelectricity take over . coal can be roasted ( heated in high temperature in a place where there is no oxygen ) to produce coke . coke is even better fuel than coal , and can be used in smelting to reduce metals from their ores .
