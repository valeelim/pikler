Melting point     the melting point of a substance is the temperature at which this substance goes from the solid state to the liquid one , at a normal pressure . for water , this is 0째 celsius ( 32 fahrenheit , 273,15 kelvin ) . the chemical element with the highest melting point is tungsten . some chemical compounds have a higher melting point . when looking at when a liquid substance becomes solid , most people call this the freezing point . for most substances , like water , this is the same as the melting point . there are substances , where this is not the case ( they melt at one temperature , and freeze at another ) . agar seems to melt at 85째 celsius , but freeze at between 35째c and 40째c . this phenomenon is a kind of hysteresis . adding certain substances or impurities will change the melting point of the resulting mixture . for example , sugar or salt will lower the melting point , and alcohol will raise it .
