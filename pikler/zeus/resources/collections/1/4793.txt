Socialism     socialism is an economic system where the ways of making money ( factories , offices , etc . ) are owned by a society as a whole , meaning the value made belongs to everyone in that society , instead of a small group of private owners . people who agree with this type of system are called socialists . there are two ways socialists think that society can own the means of making wealth : either the state ( government of the country ) is used or worker-owned cooperatives are used . another important belief is that management and sharing are supposed to be based on public interests . socialists believe that everything in society is made by the cooperative efforts of the people . there are many kinds of socialism , so no one definition can apply to all of them ; however , in all types , the workers own the means of production . the major differences between the different varieties are the role of the free market or planning , how the means of production are controlled , the role of management of workers and the government 's role in the economy .
