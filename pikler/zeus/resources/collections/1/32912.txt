Dodo     the dodo `` ( raphus cucullatus ) '' is an extinct species of flightless bird . like many other island birds , they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived . dodos were in the same family as the pigeon , and were endemic ( only lived on ) the island of mauritius . the dodo is one of the first species known to have died because of humans , dodos have been extinct since the late 17th century . the history of the word 'dodo ' is not clear . the dutch captain wybrand van warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598. he called the bird 'walgvogel ' , meaning `` disgusting bird '' because the meat was unpleasant to eat . four years later , the dutch captain willem van westsanen used the word 'dodo ' for the first time . the `` encarta dictionary '' and the `` chambers dictionary of etymology '' say `` dodo '' is a portuguese word , coming from `` doido '' . it means `` fool '' or `` crazy '' . another idea is that 'dodo ' was a copy of the bird 's own call , a two-note pigeon like sound , `` doo-doo '' . in 1606 cornelis de jonge wrote a description of the dodo , and of other animal and plants on the island .
