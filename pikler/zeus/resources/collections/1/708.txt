Salami     salami is a sausage that first came from italy . the name comes from the italian salare meaning to make something salty . the original salami was made from a mix of chopped pork and salt which was dried using air in a casing . people who are muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork . now there are many types of salamis made in some countries . nearly all are seasoned with a combination of herbs and spices in addition to salt . salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying . some kinds are made of beef while others mix beef and pork . most , if not all italian salamis have garlic in them , but few german kinds do , for example . some , like a few salamis from spain , include paprika or chili . the difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped . some `` light '' salami might add turkey or chicken to reduce both fat and calories . many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from . some examples are arles , genoese , hungarian , and milano salamis .
