Holy Spirit     the holy spirit , or holy ghost , is a part of the triune godhead ( three in one god ) of christianity . the holy spirit was there from the beginning . genesis 1:2 says that the holy spirit helped create the earth . it was by the holy spirit that jesus was conceived in mary ( matthew 1:18,19 ) . when jesus had finished his ministry on earth , he told his followers that he would provide `` another comforter '' ( helper ) , who would lead them , into truth ( john 14:16 ) , and would be their teacher to tell them things that jesus had not told them , but that they needed to know to continue to live for god . the second chapter of the book of acts tells how on the 50th day after passover ( called pentecost ) , and 10 days after jesus ascended to heaven , jesus ' followers were gathered at the feast . while they were praying , the holy spirit came upon them . they began to speak in other languages ( tongues ) . while most christians believe that the holy spirit is in them from the time they become born again , in pentecostal denominations , such as the assemblies of god , it is believed that speaking in unknown languages can still be an expression of the holy spirit , and that it is proof that a person has received the baptism of the holy spirit .
