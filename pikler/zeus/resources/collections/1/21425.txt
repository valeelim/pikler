Price     there are different definitions of price . perhaps the simplest definition is to say `` price is the value of a product ( good ) or service '' . a price is expressed in other goods , services , or in money . here is an example about price : peter raises sheep for their wool . sally raises chickens for their eggs . winter is coming , so sally wants to make a warm wool coat . she first measures how much wool she needs for a coat . she thinks she needs the wool from 2 sheep for the coat . she then goes to peter and asks him what he wants for the wool she needs . peter then tells her the price he is asking for his wool . sally might trade some of her chicken eggs for the wool . sometimes trading eggs for wool is difficult . so people invented something they called `` money '' . this is cash or currency used for trading . if peter does not need eggs , he will not trade his wool for eggs . the price for his wool `` in eggs '' is zero , but peter does need something else . so sally goes to a market and sells some of her eggs for money . then she goes to peter and gives him money for the wool . how much money peter wants for his wool is the price .
