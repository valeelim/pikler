Capitalism     capitalism is an economic system . in it the government plays a secondary role . people and companies make most of the decisions , and own most of the property . goods are usually made by companies and sold for profit . the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned ( by individuals or companies ) and operated for profit . most property , for example , is owned by people or companies , not by the government . capitalism has a more or less free market economy . that means prices move up or down according to the availability of the products . people buy and sell things according to their own judgment . in most countries there is some regulation ( trade laws ) and some planning done by the government . they are sometimes called `` mixed economies '' to indicate this . some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea , or how much of capitalism is a good idea . the word comes from `` capital '' , meaning something of value . this can be money ( `` financial capital '' ) or any other goods that can be traded . the word `` capital '' originally comes from the latin word `` caput '' , meaning `` head . '' it was used to mean how many `` head '' of cattle a rich person owned , in days long ago when cattle were used as money . in fact , the words `` capital '' and `` cattle '' both come from `` caput '' .
