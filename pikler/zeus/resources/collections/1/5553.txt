Ant     ants are social insects of the family formicidae . like wasps and bees , ants are in the order hymenoptera . there are about 22,000 species of ants . more than 12,500 have been classified . they have a thin waist and elbowed antennae . ants form colonies that vary greatly in size . some species have a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities . some highly organised colonies may cover large territories and have millions of individuals . ants are usually small , but can carry the weight of twenty ants . worker ants carry food back to the colony so that other ants and the queen can eat . the following account is mainly about ants which live in large colonies . a colony has a female reproductive ant , called a queen , who lays eggs . those eggs will hatch into worker ants . larger colonies of ants having millions of ants mostly have female ants making groups of `` workers '' , `` soldiers '' , or other special `` castes '' . almost all ant colonies also have some fertile male ants called `` drones '' .
