Need     a need is a thing that a living being , plant or animal , `` must '' have to live . a thing that someone would like to have , but can live without , is called a want . every person has the same basic needs for the body . humans have boldily needs of water , food , clothing , and shelter to live . the need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly without drinking water . in a warm place food is the next most important need . in a cold place , the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die without these . other human needs are not so certain . they are mostly needs for the mind . it is often said that a person needs love , family , and friends . these needs are for personal relationships . they may also be wants . it is true that a life may be better with these things , but some friends can be bad , or bad sometimes . good relationships can make life very happy . thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy . some of the study of philosophy is about questions like `` what are the needs of a human ?
