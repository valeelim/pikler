Cavalry     historically , cavalry have been soldiers who fought while riding horses . in modern times , `` cavalry '' means the fast branch of the military , as opposed to the slower infantry ( soldiers on foot ) . soldiers have fought on horses ever since people have ridden horses . because horses are strong , cavalry members can wear more armour than infantry and carry heavier weapons . because horses are fast , cavalry members can ride into battle more quickly than infantry members .
