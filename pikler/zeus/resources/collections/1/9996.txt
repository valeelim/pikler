Spanish–American War     the spanish–american war was a war fought between spain and the united states of america in the year 1898. this war was fought in part because a lot of people wanted cuba to become independent and also because many americans wanted their country to get a colonial empire . spain lost the sea war and had to give up its colonies of cuba , the philippines , puerto rico , and part of guam . all of these colonies , except for cuba , would become u.s. colonies at the end of the war . following reports of spanish abuse and killing of cubans , the united states sent warships to cuba . spain was losing control of cuba and had been putting cubans into concentration camps . the united states sent ships to cuba to try to force spain to give up cuba . the u.s. battleship `` maine '' exploded in cuban waters , killing about 260 people on board . `` remember the maine '' became a common wartime saying . u.s. newspapers blamed spain for the explosion . spain tried to avoid going to war , but pressure from u.s. newspapers , called `` yellow journalism , '' and ordinary people , persuaded u.s. government to go to war . some of these people just wanted cuba to become independent , but others hoped that the united states could build a colonial empire overseas , like many european countries had done .
