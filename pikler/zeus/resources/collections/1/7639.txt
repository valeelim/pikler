Immunity     immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from 'foreign bodies ' . this means rejecting infections , clearing up dust which gets in the lungs , and killing cancer cells . vaccination builds on the natural immune system to make a person resist certain diseases . immunity is of two types . innate immunity protects the host against infection , but has no 'memory ' , and so gives no long-term immunity . the second type is adaptive immunity , which does have a kind of 'memory ' . it does give long-term protection against specific pathogens . all animals , plants and fungi have some innate immunity . vertebrates also have adaptive immunity . people can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination ( injection of some dead or weakened virus , or bacteria that causes the disease ) . by doing so , the body learns how the virus/bacteria harms the body , and will react more quickly to fight the virus/bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus/bacteria again . when your body has defended itself against the virus/bacteria it will trap the certain virus/bacteria in a `` net '' so when the virus/bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses/bacteria as well .
