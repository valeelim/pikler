Watt     the watt ( symbol : w ) is the si unit of power . it is named in honour of the physicist james watt ( 1736–1819 ) . the watt is a method of measuring the rate of energy transfer of an appliance . a one watt lightbulb , for example , will change one joule of electrical energy into light energy ( and some heat/sound ) every second . it is a measure of an appliance 's power . the watt is the rate a source of energy uses or produces one joule during one second , so the same quantity may be referred to as a joule per second , with the symbol j/s . it can also be written as kg·m·s . the more watts , the more energy used per second . that is why a higher-watt electrical appliance works faster than a lower-watt appliance . it is equivalent to one volt ampere ( 1 v·a ) or 1/746 of a horsepower . the power of a light bulb is measured in watts . leds have much smaller consumption of power . example small led can be used by 0.015 watts what can be also written 15 milliwatts . 1000 watts is called a kilowatt , written as kw . it is also known as ( 10 ) watts . in many countries , electric bills are based on how many kilowatt-hours are being used .
