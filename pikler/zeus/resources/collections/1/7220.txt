Formula     in mathematics or science a formula is a rule or statement written in algebraic symbols . the plural of formula can be written in two ways : formulae or formulas - the choice is based on personal preference . formulas use letters instead of words . a simple example of a formula is y = x. here , if x is , for example , 1 , then y = x so y = 1. possibly the most famous formula is e = m × c . albert einstein created this . in it , e is energy , m is mass and c is the speed of light . thus , energy = mass × ( multiplied by ) the speed of light ( squared ) . the multiplication sign is usually left out , giving e = mc . the `` formula '' e = mc is also an equation . every equation is a formula , but not every formula is an equation . for instance , the formula x≡y ( x `` is defined as '' y ) is not an equation because no `` = '' sign is used .
