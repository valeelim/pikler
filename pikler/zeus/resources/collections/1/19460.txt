Nucleotide     nucleotides are chemical compounds , the building blocks of the nucleic acids rna and dna . a nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase ( nitrogenous base ) , a five-carbon sugar ( either ribose or 2-deoxyribose ) , and one phosphate group . nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine base . ribonucleotides are nucleotides in which the sugar is ribose . deoxyribonucleotides are nucleotides in which the sugar is deoxyribose . in dna , the purine bases are adenine and guanine , while the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine . rna uses uracil in place of thymine . adenine always pairs with thymine by 2 hydrogen bonds , while guanine pairs with cytosine through 3 hydrogen bonds , each due to their unique structures .
