Sensory system     the sensory system is the way animals find out about their nearby environment and their bodies . to do this they have special devices for collecting data called sense organs . the sense organs act as transducers : they turn energy from the outside or inside of the body into nerve signals . the signals are then very rapidly processed by the brain . the whole arrangement is the sensory system . it is usual to say the sensory system has five senses : 1. hearing is the sense of sound . ears hear sounds . 1. sight is the sense of seeing . eyes see . 1. touch is the sense of feeling . sense organs feel . 1. taste is the sense of the flavor . tongues taste . 1. smell is the sense of scent or odor . noses smell . actually , there are other senses . we have a sense of proprioception which checks our balance . fishes have a sense system which no land animal has . it is called the lateral line system . this senses movement and vibration in the water pressure and other functions . some fish can sense patterns of electrical current in the water .
