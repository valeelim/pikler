Like     like can mean some different things : 1. we can use to like to say that we find a thing is good : 2. we can use like for `` the same as '' or `` nearly the same as '' : 3. we can also use like for `` the same way as '' : 4. in a question , we can use like to ask people to talk about a thing , or to say if they find it good or not : 5. we can also use like as `` for example '' : 6. in british and american english young people , when talking , have recently started using like as an extra word in the middle of sentences . sometimes they use it to report what someone said , especially when mimicking the way they said it . this should never be used in writing : as works in the same way as example 2 - comparing two things using either the word `` like '' or the word `` as '' is called making a simile ( `` as big as an elephant '' ) . it may be better to use the word `` as '' for this to stop confusion with example 1 .
