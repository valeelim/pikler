Random     random is a term used in mathematics ( and less formally ) to mean that there is no way to reliably predict an outcome ( to know what will happen `` before '' it happens ) or sense a pattern . something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any conscious reason , and therefore thought to be purely by chance . an example of a random event is winning a lottery . a computer can make lists of apparently random numbers . humans are unable to do this , because the brain works in patterns . if someone is asked to keep saying `` heads '' or `` tails '' at random , a smart human observer or properly programmed computer might eventually be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns . on a website such as english wikipedia the user can click on `` random page '' to get a random article . the chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page . sometimes the word `` random '' is used more loosely . there are websites of random jokes , which just means : a variety of jokes about all sorts of things .
