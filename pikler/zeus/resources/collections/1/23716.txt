Liver bird     the liver birds are two large and famous bronze metal birds on top of a building - the liver building - in the city of liverpool , england . the building has the offices of an insurance organization . the birds are symbol of the city , although no birds really look like this . the sound of the end of the word `` liver '' in the name of the bird is like `` driver '' not `` river '' . the start of the word liverpool ( `` liver '' ) sounds like the word `` river '' . this is a funny play on words . there is also a british television sitcom with the same name that is about two young women who share a flat in liverpool . the play on words is increased by a second british slang meaning of the word `` bird '' to mean young woman . many people in liverpool ( known as `` liverpudlians '' ) are proud of their city and of the liver birds . there is a story that the birds will come alive if a truly pure woman walks between them . this will never happen ! this is an example of the humor of the local people .
