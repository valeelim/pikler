Neoclassical economics     neoclassical economics is an economic theory that argues for markets to be free . this means governments should generally not make rules about types of businesses , businesses ' behaviour , who may make things , who may sell things , who may buy things , prices , quantities or types of things sold and bought . the theory argues that allowing individual actors ( people or businesses ) freedom creates better economic outcomes . these outcomes may be a higher average standard of living , higher wages , better average life-expectancies , and higher gdp . markets are an abstract idea : assumed to be all the 'actors ' ( businesses or people ) selling one thing , service or type of thing or service , and all the 'actors ' buying it . markets will 'reach equilibrium ' if all the sellers who want to sell at or below a given price have sold to all the buyers who are willing to buy at or above a given price . the price is worked out in the market . it may be easier to think about this in reverse : the market is not in equilibrium if people want to buy a haircut for ten ( or more ) dollars and someone is happy to sell the person a haircut for ten ( or less ) dollars , but for some reason this does not happen .
