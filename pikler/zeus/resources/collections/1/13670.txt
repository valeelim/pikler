Yogurt     yogurt , or yoghurt is a milk product made by bacterial fermentation of milk . the lactose in the milk becomes lactic acid when it is fermented . lactic acid acts on the protein in the milk to make yoghurt thick and sour . the milk is heated to about 80 °c to kill any bacteria present , and to change the milk proteins so that they set together instead of becoming curd . after it is cooled to about 45 °c , the bacteria culture is added , and the milk is kept at that temperature for 4 to 7 hours to ferment . soy yoghurt is made from soy milk . yogurt is one of the oldest produced foods in human history . no one knows for sure how long yogurt has been around . today , it is eaten all over the world . it is rich in protein , calcium , riboflavin , vitamin b and vitamin b. in english , the word can be spelled either 'yogurt ' or 'yoghurt ' . in canada 'yogourt ' is also common . it can be spoken with either a short or a long 'o ' . the earliest yogurts were probably made by wild bacteria ( yeast infections ) and happened by chance .
