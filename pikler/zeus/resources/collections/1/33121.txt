Crown-of-thorns starfish     the crown-of-thorns starfish ( `` acanthaster planci '' ) is a type of sea star . usually , they have orange-red to purplish skin , with yellow or pink spikes on their skin . the crown-of-thorns is also one of the largest starfish in the world , as it has a diameter of up to 3 feet . the crown-of-thorns lives in the warmer areas of the pacific ocean , indian ocean , and red sea . it only feeds on coral polyps , and usually at night . the crown-of-thorns climbs over its prey , releases digestive enzymes to break down its food , and then absorbs the coral polyp , which has now turned into a liquid . what 's left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton . they are usually of subdued colours , pale brown to grey-green , but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range . these bright colours warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous . the crown-of-thorns is well known for its destructive habits of eating coral , especially on the great barrier reef , which is a world heritage site . usually , when there are not too many of them , these sea stars help maintain the coral reef by preventing the faster-growing coral from taking over the coral reef . however , when there are too many crown-of-thorns , they can devastate the reef .
