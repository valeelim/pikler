Architecture     architecture is the science of the design of structures or buildings such as houses , places of worship , and office buildings . architecture is also the profession of an architect . a person must study at an institution of higher education ( university ) to become an architect . architecture can be about small designs , such as a garage , or large designs , such as a whole city . architecture often overlaps with civil engineering , and architects and civil engineers often work together . in the past , people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather . for safety , they were often close together . great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures , like the great pyramids of giza . the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call `` classical architecture '' . the romans , working over 2000 years ago , copied the arch from the etruscans , who copied it from the mesopotamians . the stone columns , which still hold up so many important buildings , like the parthenon in athens , were simply copied from the first wooden posts .
