Apple     the apple tree ( `` malus domestica '' ) is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet , pomaceous fruit , the apple . it is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree , and is the most widely grown species in the genus `` malus . '' the tree originated in central asia , where its wild ancestor , `` malus sieversii '' , is still found today . apples have been grown for thousands of years in asia and europe , and were brought to north america by european colonists . apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures , including norse , greek and european christian traditions . apple trees are large if grown from seed , but small if grafted onto roots ( rootstock ) . there are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples , resulting in a range of desired characteristics . different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses , including cooking , eating raw and cider production . apples are generally propagated by grafting , although wild apples grow readily from seed . trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal , bacterial and pest problems , which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means . in 2010 , the fruit 's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production .
