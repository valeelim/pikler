Seed     a seed is the part of a seed plant which can grow into a new plant . it is a reproductive structure which disperses , and can survive for some time . a typical seed includes three basic parts : ( 1 ) an embryo , ( 2 ) a supply of nutrients for the embryo , and ( 3 ) a seed coat . there are many different kinds of seeds . some plants make a lot of seeds , some make only a few . seeds are often hard and very small , but some are larger . the coconut is as big as a child 's head , but it contains more than just a seed . at the start , seeds are `` dormant '' ( resting inside their coat ) for a while . when the seed is ready to develop , it needs water , air and warmth `` but not sunlight '' to become a seedling . seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow . this food store is in the endosperm , and/or in the cotyledons . many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people . the many kinds of grain that people grow , such as rice , wheat , and maize , are all seeds . seeds are often inside fruits . a seed , though not active , is a tiny living thing . it contains the embryo of the future plant , which is not changing or developing : it is `` dormant '' . the common idea is that the seed `` sleeps '' until it gets what it needs to wake up . that is not correct . different seeds have different habits , no doubt adapted to their habitat . there are different kinds of resting stages in seeds :
