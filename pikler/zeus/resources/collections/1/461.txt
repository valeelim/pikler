Litre     a litre ( liter in the united states ) is one of the metric units of volume . it is not an si unit . one litre is the volume of one cubic decimetre , that is a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 centimetres . one litre of water has the mass of exactly one kilogram . this results from the definition given in 1795 , where the gram was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice . the symbol for litre is `` l '' or `` l '' . for smaller volumes the decilitre is used : 10 dl = one litre . for smaller volumes the centilitre is used : 100 cl = one litre . for smaller volumes the millilitre is used : 1000 ml = one litre . the capital letter `` l '' is preferred by some people as the small `` l '' can look like the number one `` 1 '' . - 1 litre = 0.2200 imperial gallons - 1 litre = 0.2642 us gallons - 1 imperial gallon = 4.5461 litres - 1 us gallon = 3.7854 litres - 1 litre = 1 dm the metric system was first introduced in france in 1791. that system did not have its own unit of capacity or volume because volume can be measured in cubic metres . in 1793 work to make the metric system compulsory in france was started by the temporary commission of republican weights and measures . due to public demand , the commission said that the cubic metre was too big for everyday use . they said that a new unit based on the old cadil should be used instead . one cadil was to be 0.001 cubic metres . this was equivalent to a cube with sides 10 cm . the `` cadil '' was also known as the `` pinte '' or the `` litron '' . the `` pinte '' had been an old french unit of measure of capacity . in 1795 the definition was revised . the `` cadil '' was given the name `` litre '' .
