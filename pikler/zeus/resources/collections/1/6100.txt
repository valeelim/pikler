Frog     frogs are amphibians of the order anura . there is not much difference between frogs and toads , and they are not classified separately . this is because the toad lifestyle , with its dry , rough , skin , is an adaptation to living in drier habitats . the toad form has evolved a number of times independently , an example of convergent evolution . frogs can live on land and in fresh water . they can not survive in salt water . their development is by metamorphosis . they usually hatch as tadpoles from eggs , which are laid by a female frog . the eggs are called frogspawn . tadpoles have tails and gills . when they grow up , they lose their tails and gills and grow four long legs . adult frogs can jump with their legs . they have long tongues that they use to catch bugs . they make a sound called a croak . some species live in trees , and some types of frog are protected by being poisonous . frogs live all over the world . if an overseas species of frogs is introduced to another country , the ecosystem might be affected .
