Overture     an overture is a piece of music for the orchestra to play at the beginning of an opera or ballet . the word comes from the french word for `` opening '' because it `` opens '' the show . overtures usually have tunes which are going to be heard during the opera or ballet . in this way it prepares the audience for what is to come . many overtures in the 18th century were simply background music to get the audience 's attention ( people used to chatter during performances ) . some composers like gioacchino rossini ( 1792-1868 ) used the same overture again and again for his next operas , or just changed bits of it . composers like christoph willibald gluck and later richard wagner ( 1813-1883 ) were very careful to make the overture a dramatic beginning which prepared the audience for the story . wagner often called his overtures `` vorspiel '' ( prelude ) . not all composers wrote overtures to their operas . giuseppe verdi ( 1813-1901 ) and giacomo puccini ( 1858-1924 ) often go straight into the first act or they just have a very short prelude .
