Atmosphere of Earth     earth 's atmosphere is the layer of gases around the earth . the atmosphere is held in place by earth 's gravity . it is made up of nitrogen ( 78.1 % ) and oxygen ( 20.9 % ) , with small amounts of argon ( 0.9 % ) , carbon dioxide ( ~ 0.035 % ) , water vapor , and other gases . the atmosphere protects life on earth by absorbing ( taking ) ultraviolet rays from the sun . it makes our days cooler and our nights warmer . solid particulates , including ash , dust , volcanic ash , etc . are small parts of atmosphere . they are important in making clouds and fog . the atmosphere does not end at a specific place . the higher above the earth something is , the thinner the atmosphere around it is . there is no clear border between the atmosphere and outer space . 75 % of the atmosphere is within of the earth 's surface . originally , the earth 's atmosphere had almost no free oxygen . it gradually changed to what it is today , over a very long time ( see great oxygenation event ) . the process began with cyanobacteria . they were the first organisms to make free oxygen by photosynthesis . most organisms today need oxygen for their metabolism ; only a few can use other sources for respiration .
