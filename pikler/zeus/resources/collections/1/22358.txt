Flash memory     flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics . it is most often used in devices like digital cameras , usb flash drives , and video games . it is quite similar to eeprom . flash memory is different from ram because ram is volatile ( not permanent ) . when power is turned off , ram loses all its data . flash can keep its data intact with no power at all . a hard drive also is permanent ( non-volatile ) storage , but it is bulky and fragile . flash memory is one kind of non-volatile random-access memory . it is slower than ram but faster than hard drives . it is much used in small electronics because it is small and has no moving parts . the main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage . another weakness of flash memory is the number of times that data can be written to it . data can be read from flash as many times as desired , but after a certain number of `` write '' operations , it will stop working . most flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write operations ( or `` write cycles '' ) .
