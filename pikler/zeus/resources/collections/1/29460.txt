Trinity     in the christian religion the trinity is an idea , used to explain that three different `` people '' are called god in the bible : god the father , god the son , and god the holy spirit ( who is sometimes called the `` holy ghost '' ) . trinity states that these three people all form the same god . the oxford dictionary of the christian church describes the trinity as `` the central dogma of christian theology '' . before the idea was made dogma , at the first council of nicaea , there were also other ideas on how to solve the problem . these included : - god adopted jesus during baptism ( known as adoptionism ) - jesus was all god , and only appeared to be human ( docetism ) - the three lived together like a family ( tritheism ) - only god the father is the true god , the son and the holy spirit are not . this position was popular with arius and his followers the english word `` trinity '' comes from latin `` trinitas '' , meaning `` the number three '' . this abstract noun is formed from the adjective `` trinus '' ( three each , threefold , triple ) , as the word `` unitas '' is the abstract noun formed from `` unus '' ( one ) .
