Adultery     adultery is a word used in religious texts like exodus 20:14. it applies to a married person sleeping with someone other than the person who they are married to . adultery usually comes with a heavy punishment for example , death by stoning in some muslim countries . in most countries adultery is no longer a crime , but most people still see it as a bad thing . ( see gospel of john 8 ) if a person who is married takes part in adultery , that person 's husband or wife would usually have the right to be able to go to court to divorce them . the word adultery originates not from “ adult ” , as is commonly thought in english-speaking countries , but from the late latin word for “ to alter , corrupt ” : “ adulterare ” . “ adulterare ” in turn is formed by the combination of “ ad ” ( towards ) , and “ alter ” ( other ) , together with the infinitive form “ are ” ( making it a verb ) . thus the meaning is literally “ to make other ” . in contrast , the word “ adult ” ( meaning a person of mature years ) comes from another latin root , “ adolescere ” , meaning to grow up or mature : a combination of “ ad ” ( towards ) , “ alere ” ( to nourish , to grow ) , and the inchoative infix “ sc ” ( meaning to enter into a state of ) .
