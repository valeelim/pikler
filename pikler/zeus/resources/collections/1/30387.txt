Amino acid     amino acids are the building blocks of proteins . in eukaryotes , there are 20 standard amino acids out of which almost all proteins are made . in biochemistry , an amino acid is any molecule that has both amine ( nh+r ) and carboxyl ( c=o ) functional groups . in biochemistry , this term refers to alpha-amino acids with the general formula hnchrcooh , where r is one of many side groups ( see diagram ) . about 500 amino acids are known . for animals , the most important thing that amino acids do is to make proteins , which are very long chains of amino acids . every protein has its own sequence of amino acids , and that sequence makes the protein take different shapes , and have different functions . amino acids are like the alphabet for proteins ; even though you only have a few letters , if you connect them , you can make many different sentences . nine of the 20 standard amino acids are `` essential '' amino acids for humans . they can not be built ( synthesised ) from other compounds by the human body , and so must be taken in as food . others may be essential for some ages or medical conditions . essential amino acids may also differ between species . herbivores have to get their essential amino acids from their diet , which for some is almost entirely grass . ruminants such as cows get some amino acids via microbes in the first two stomach chambers .
