Liquid     a liquid is a form of matter . it is settled between solid and gas . liquid has an almost-fixed volume , but no set shape . every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing . because of that , gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container . the molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves . fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity . some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid . it is difficult to compress a liquid . if a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature , it will become a solid . this temperature is called the melting point and is different for every different type of liquid . the freezing point of water is around 0°c , and it becomes ice . if a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas . the temperature this happens at is called the boiling point . the boiling point of water is 100°c , at this temperature it becomes steam . examples of liquid are water , oils and blood . in a liquid , the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath , so at the bottom the pressure , `` p '' , is bigger than at the top . the equation for working this out is :
