Acceleration     acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes . acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time . acceleration is a vector , and therefore includes both a size and a direction . examples . - an object was moving north at 10 meters per second . the object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 meters per second . the object has accelerated . - an apple is falling down . it starts falling at 0 meters per second . at the end of the first second , the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second . the apple has accelerated . at the end of the second second , the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second . the apple has accelerated again . - jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour . jane 's velocity does not change . jane 's acceleration is zero . - tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour . tom turns and walks south at 3 kilometers per hour . tom has had a nonzero acceleration . - sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour . sally slows down . after , sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour . sally has had a nonzero acceleration .
