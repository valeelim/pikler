Gravity     gravity , or gravitation is one of the fundamental forces of the universe . in this article , we discuss it in three parts : 1. everyday sense : the force which causes objects to fall onto the ground . 1. newton 's laws : how gravity keeps the solar system together . 1. einstein 's theory of general relativity : the role of gravity in the universe . some physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons , but they are still unsure . in everyday talk , we say things fall because the earth 's gravity pulls on them . we talk as if our weight was a `` given '' . actually , weight changes when the pull of gravity changes . the moon is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the moon is about 1/6th that of earth . so any object on the moon weighs 1/6th of its weight on earth . what does not change is the amount of matter in an object . that is called its mass . on earth , mass and weight are the same for practical purposes . the trip to the moon shows they are not really the same . from this we learn two things . 1. the weight < /u/l > of an object is variable ; its mass < /u/l > is constant .
