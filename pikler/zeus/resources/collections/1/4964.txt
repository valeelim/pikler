Homer     homer is the name of the greek poet who wrote the epic poems the `` iliad '' and the `` odyssey '' . these are the earliest works of greek literature which have survived to the present day , and are among the greatest treasures of the ancient world . they are a product of mycenaean culture . the iliad tells the story of the trojan war , which took place around 1190 bc . the manuscripts of homer were written much later , probably later than 800 bc . what makes the history of this period so difficult is that the mycenaean civilization was followed by several hundred years of decline , from which little or no writing has survived . this period , the greek dark age , ended around 800 bc , when once again we find greek writing , though this time in their newly developed alphabetic script . therefore , there is a distinct possibility that the homeric epics had a life , perhaps a long life , as oral literature , spoken by story-tellers . we know little about homer , and the later greeks also knew little about him . some have doubted he was a real person ; others think he was a woman .
