Monkey     monkeys are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) mammals . they are in the primate order . monkeys are intelligent , social animals . most monkeys have a tail , even if it is a short one . the word `` monkey '' is common language term which is not used in taxonomy . it includes two rather different groups of primates . the big distinction is between old world monkeys and new world monkeys . some examples of monkeys include macaques , baboons , guenons and marmosets . - old world monkeys : cercopithecidae . apes are the descendants of old world monkeys . - new world monkeys : platyrrhini or ceboidea ( same thing in effect ) both these groups are in the infraorder simiiformes . that infraorder also includes the great apes and man . some monkeys live almost entirely in trees . others live partly on the ground . monkeys are mainly vegetarian , with a strong preference for fruit . however , they may eat a wide range of other food , including insects . monkeys can live in forests and savannahs , but not in deserts . some can live in snowy mountains , but more live in rainforests . there are none in the rainforests of australia and new guinea . apparently they never reached those islands .
