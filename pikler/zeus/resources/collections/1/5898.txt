Wind     wind is the flow of gases . on earth , wind is mostly the movement of air . in outer space , solar wind is the movement of gases or particles from the sun through space . the strongest winds seen on a planet in our solar system are on neptune and saturn . short bursts of fast winds are called `` gusts '' . strong winds that go on for about one minute are called `` squalls '' . winds that go on for a long time are called many different things , such as `` breeze '' , `` gale '' , `` hurricane '' , and `` typhoon '' . wind can move land , especially in deserts . cold wind can sometimes have a bad effect on livestock . wind also affects animals ' food stores , their hunting and the way they protect themselves . sunlight drives the earth 's atmospheric circulation . the resulting winds blow over land and sea , producing weather . if there is a high pressure system ( that rotates clockwise in the northern hemisphere ) near a low pressure system ( that rotates counter-clockwise ) , the air will move from the high pressure to the low pressure to try and even out the pressures . a big difference in pressure can make high winds . in some storms , such as hurricanes , typhoons , cyclones , or tornadoes , the pressure differences can cause winds faster than 200 mph ( 320 kilometres per hour ) . this can damage houses and other buildings , and can also lead to death .
