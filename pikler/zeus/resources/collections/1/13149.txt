Aesthetics     aesthetics is a branch of philosophy . it is the study of art and beauty . together with ethics it is part of axiology which is the philosophy of what people like . aesthetic philosophers ask what people like to look at , hear , feel , smell or taste , and why they like these things . aesthetic philosophers also ask if art has any value . for example , they may ask if some art that nobody likes and that nobody wants is art at all , or if it is something else . plato , aristotle , and immanuel kant are some important philosophers of aesthetics . one theory in aesthetics is called subjectivism . subjectivism says that each person has their own sense of beauty . so , the only way of judging something 's beauty is if people say it is beautiful . a common way of describing this is `` beauty is in the eye of the beholder '' . subjectivism also says , for the same reason , that something is art simply because someone says it is art . this is backed up by the experience that , even though people feel they find something beautiful , they may not be able to explain why .
