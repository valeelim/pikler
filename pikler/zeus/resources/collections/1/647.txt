Product stewardship     product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution of an industrial product . that is , paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product , and relying on those who sold it to you , to dispose of it . the slightly more specific idea of product take-back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase . it is often applied to paint , tires , and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly . it is most familiar as the deposit bottle - where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it . the container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to `` buy '' the bottle , separately from the fee to buy what it contains . if one returns the bottle , the fee is returned , and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling . if not , one has paid the fee , and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle . also , since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle , it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving . this is quite common for instance among homeless people .
