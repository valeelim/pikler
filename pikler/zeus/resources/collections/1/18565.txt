Gluon     gluons are what hold quarks together to make bigger particles . gluons carry the strong force between other quarks , so it is considered a force carrying particle . photons do the same thing , but for the electromagnetic force . also , like photons , gluons are spin-1 particles , and when a particle has spin-1 it is considered a boson . gluons are hard to study because although they exist in nature all the time , they are so small and require so much energy to break them away from quarks ( about 2 trillion degrees ) that scientists have only been able to find more about them from particle colliders such as the large hadron collider at cern .
