Camera     a camera is a device that takes pictures ( photographs ) . it uses film or electronics to make a picture of something . a lens makes the image that the film or electronics `` sees '' . a camera that takes one picture at a time is sometimes called a `` still camera '' . a camera that can take pictures that seem to move is called a `` movie camera '' . if it can take videos it is called a `` video camera '' or a `` camcorder '' . a camera on a phone is called a `` camera phone '' all cameras are basically a box that light can not get into until a photo is taken . there is a hole on one side of the camera where the light can get in through the lens , and this is called the aperture . on the other side is a special material that can record the image that comes through the aperture . this material is the film in a film camera or electronic sensor in a digital camera . finally , there is also the shutter , which stops light from getting in until a photo is taken . when a photo is taken , the shutter moves out of the way . this lets light come in through the aperture and make a picture on the film or electronic sensor . in many cameras , the size of the aperture can be changed to let in more light or less light . the amount of time that the shutter lets light through can be changed as well . this also lets in more light or less light . most of the time , electronics inside the camera control these , but in some cameras the person taking the picture can change them as well .
