Cytology     cytology is the study of the cells , especially their appearance and structure . cells are the small parts that make up all living things , and their effects on each other and their environment . there are two types of cells . prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see nucleus , and do not have a membrane , or wall , around them . eukaryotic cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell 's functions take place , and a membrane around them . the main organelles of a cell and their uses are : - mitochondria : produces energy for the cell - endoplasmic reticulum : makes proteins and carbohydrates for the cell to use - golgi bodies : store and package products that the cell uses - plastid ( present in plant cells only ) : contains chemicals needed to photosynthesize ( create energy from sunlight ) ; in plants only . - nucleus : directs the actions of the cell - centrosomes : guides the cell in mitosis and meiosis , the processes for cell division . other pages . - cell biology is mostly about how cells work , and about cell division and molecular biology .
