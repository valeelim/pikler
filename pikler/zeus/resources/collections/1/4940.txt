Granite     granite is a kind of igneous rock , found on earth but nowhere else in the solar system . it is formed from hot , molten magma . its colour ranges from pink to grey , according to the proportions of its minerals . the magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the earth 's surface . the magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone . granite has many different types of minerals in it . these include quartz , feldspar , hornblende , and sometimes mica . as the magma cools , these minerals form crystals . the crystals can be seen easily if the granite is cut and polished . granite is a common stone on earth , and makes up a big part of the crust ( the earth 's outer layer ) . it is usually found in the continental plates of the earth 's crust . although it forms under the surface of the earth , there are many places where it has been forced upwards by tectonic movement . when plates in the earth 's crust move together , they get bent and pushed upwards . when this happens , granite mountains can be formed .
