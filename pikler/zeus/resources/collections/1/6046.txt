David Hume     david hume ( 7 may 1711 - 25 august 1776 ) was a philosopher and historian from scotland . when he was still alive , people thought of him as a historian . he wrote a series of large books called `` the history of england '' . but today , people think of hume as an important philosopher . in his books on philosophy , hume said that many of our beliefs do not come from reason . instead , they come from our instincts or feelings . for example , reason does not tell us that one thing causes another . instead , we see one thing and then we see another , and we `` feel '' a link between the two . similarly , reason does not tell us that someone is a good person . instead , we see that the person is kind and friendly , and we `` feel '' a special moral feeling . because hume thought that these beliefs do not come from reason , people call him a `` skeptical '' or `` anti-rationalist '' philosopher . hume is famous for his 'induction fallacy ' . this draws attention to a common mistake people make . people see something , and make claims that what they see will always be as they see it . for example , people see only white swans and claim that all swans are white . this is 'fallacious ' or mistaken , because it is always possible that they then will see a black swan .
