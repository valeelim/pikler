Platonic solid     a platonic solid is a kind of polyhedron . it has the following characteristics : - each face is built from the same type of polygons - there are the same number of polygons meeting at every corner of the shape . the following platonic solids exist ; there are only 5 : - tetrahedron , has 4 sides , is made of triangles , and looks like a pyramid . - cube , `` hexahedron '' , has 6 sides , and is made of squares . - octahedron , has 8 sides , and is made of triangles . - dodecahedron , has 12 sides , and is made of pentagons . - icosahedron , has 20 sides , and is made of triangles . the shapes are often used to make dice , because dice of these shapes can be made fair . 6-sided dice are very common , but the other numbers are commonly used in role-playing games . such dice are commonly referred to as d followed by the number of faces ( d8 , d20 etc. ) . the tetrahedron ( 4 sided ) , cube ( 6 sided ) , and octahedron ( 8 sided ) , are found naturally in crystal structures . the dodecahedron ( 12 sides ) is combinatorially identical to the pyritohedron ( in that both have twelve pentagonal faces ) , which is one of the possible crystal structures of pyrite . however , the pyritohedron is not a regular dodecahedron , but rather has the same symmetry as the cube .
