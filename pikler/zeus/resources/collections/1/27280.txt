Conservation law     a conservation law is a statement used in physics that says that the amount of something does not change in time . that thing could be as simple as mass or charge , or something that has to be calculated , like energy , or angular momentum . for example , the `` law of conservation of mass '' is the conservation law that says that the amount of mass is always conserved , even if it is changed into another form . this means that if the mass of the universe could be measured right now , its mass would be known tomorrow because it will not change . for a long time , people thought that these laws were true for the amount of mass and energy in the universe . later on , albert einstein said that they were not completely true . he said that mass could change into energy ( or the other way around ) . if this happened , it would be against the conservation laws because if mass was changed into energy , the total amount of mass goes down , and the total amount of energy goes up . einstein said that conservation laws could still be used if all the mass and all the energy were combined . he said that even though the mass changes or the energy changes , the sum when they are added together does not change . so now there is just one conservation law for mass and energy together .
