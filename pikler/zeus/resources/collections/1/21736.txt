Spacecraft     a spacecraft is a vehicle that can carry people and cargo beyond the earth 's atmosphere , through space to other planetary bodies , space stations , or orbits and back home again . spacecraft which are launched from the surface of a planet are called launch vehicles and usually take-off from launch pads at spaceports . most spacecraft today are propelled by rocket engines , which shoot hot gases opposite to the direction of travel . other forms of propulsion are used when appropriate . spacecraft which do not need to escape from strong gravity may use ion thrusters or other more efficient methods . because of the very large amount of energy needed to leave the earth 's gravity , spacecraft are usually very expensive to build , launch , and operate . plans for future spacecraft often focus on reducing these costs so more people can participate in space . but today , costs are still very high , and until recently all spacecraft were sponsored by national governments . most expensive of all is to send people in to space , due to their needs for food , water , air , living space , safety , and control . people participating in this way have special names : americans call themselves astronauts ; russians call themselves cosmonauts ; chinese call themselves taikonauts .
