Tank     a tank is an armoured combat vehicle , typically armed with a large cannon and a few machine guns . a tank is covered in thick armour to protect it from enemy weapons . tanks have tracks that wrap around its wheels to spread out its weight and let it cross rough ground . most tanks have a powerful gun and one or more machine guns . a tank 's crew is normally 3-5. a driver , commander and gunner are always present . there may also be a loader , who handles the ammunition for the main gun ( so the gunner does n't have to take eyes off the target ) . some wwii tanks also had a separate soldier responsible for the radio . the first tanks were made by the british royal navy and french car manufacturers during world war i as a way of attacking enemy trenches . they were called tanks to trick the germans into thinking they were water carriers for the middle eastern theatre of world war i. tanks became a main weapon during world war ii , where battles between great numbers of tanks were fought , especially between the germans and the soviet union . well-known world war ii tanks were the german panzer iv , panther and tigers , soviet t-34 ( produced in the largest numbers of any tank of the war and second most ever ) , british matilda , churchill and cromwell , and american m4 sherman ( second most produced tank of the war ) and stuart tanks . there had also been plans for much larger and more heavily armoured tanks , but these were determined to be of little use due to their huge weight , which would have made moving them very difficult , and the huge size , which would have made them easy targets for heavy artillery .
