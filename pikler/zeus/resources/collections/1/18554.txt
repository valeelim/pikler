Quantum entanglement     quantum entanglement is the name given to a special connection between pairs or groups of quantum systems , or any objects described by quantum mechanics . quantum entanglement is one of the biggest parts of quantum mechanics that makes it hard to understand in terms of the everyday world . when we look at particles , we usually say that each particle has its own quantum state . sometimes , two particles can act on one another and become an entangled system . when a pair or group of particles can only be described by the quantum state for the system , and not by individual quantum states , we say the particles are `` entangled '' . entanglement between particles happens because little particles can push and pull on each other , just like big objects do in terms of gravity . if nothing else is acting on those particles , then there are certain things before and after the particles act on each other that have to stay the same . for example , the total momentum of both particles put together would be ( roughly ) the same before and after they act on each other .
