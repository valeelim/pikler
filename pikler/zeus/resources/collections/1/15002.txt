Integrated circuit     an integrated circuit ( more often called an ic , microchip , silicon chip , computer chip , or chip ) is a piece of specially prepared silicon ( or another semiconductor ) into which a very complex electronic circuit is etched using photographic techniques . silicon chips can contain computer processors , memory and special devices . the chip is very fragile and so is normally surrounded by a tough plastic package , and electrical contact with the chip is provided through metal legs sticking out of the package . there are two main advantages of ics over discrete circuits : cost and performance . cost is low because millions of transistors are printed as a complete unit by photolithography and not constructed as one transistor at a time . performance is higher since the components switch quickly , consuming little power . ics are designed for different purposes . a chip may be designed as a calculator , which only works as a calculator . integrated circuits can be classified into analog , digital and mixed signal ( both analog and digital on the same chip ) .
