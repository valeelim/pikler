Creationism     creationism is the religious belief that the universe was created in the way described in religious books . according to genesis , god directly created life from the nothingness that was before , by fixing the chaos that was . other religions have different creation myths . the first approach is known as creatio ex nihilo , which is the latin name for `` creation from nothing '' . the idea that god created the world has been taught for thousands of years by writers such as augustine of hippo . creationism as it is known today started in the 19th century by fundamentalist protestants who were opposed to the theories that scientists began to put forward about geology and evolution . in the 20th century , creationist movements also started in islam and judaism . creationists usually do not believe that all of today 's living things came about from simple organisms changing or evolving slowly over time . they believe that life was created much as it is today , and that one form of life can not change into another . while biologists and paleontologists say that fossils ( the remains of living things that died long ago ) are different from the life we see today , and can be put into order to show changes over time . creationists argue that life was created during a short time in its current form . they point to the flood of noah to account for most rock formations and most fossils .
