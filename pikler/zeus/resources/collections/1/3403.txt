British Columbia     british columbia `` ( fr : colombie-britannique ) '' is the westernmost province in canada . it was originally two separate colonies of great britain , the colony of vancouver island , and the colony of british columbia . british columbia joined the canadian confederation in 1871. the capital of british columbia is victoria . the largest city is vancouver . prior to european contact , british columbia was home to large numbers of indigenous peoples . these people , for the large part , still remain in the province . because bc has a substantial amount of resources , the native people who dwelled here lived comfortably enough . the abundance of resources , in particular , resulted in the creation of highly complex hierarchical societies in british columbia , well preceding the government of the europeans . see also fort vancouver , oregon the oregon dispute was an important factor in determining the physical shape of british columbia , and as the political impetus for british investment in protecting her lands in british columbia . during the middle of the 19th century , the democratic party of the united states , appealing to the public attraction to the manifest destiny ( a philosophy preaching american supremacy and expansionism ) , declared that the united states had a claim over the entirety of columbia district/oregon territory . this attitude was reflected even further , as 54*-40 ' or fight , referring to the end of columbia district , and the start of russian territory of alaska . this alarming attitude , caused many in london to fear that yet another war , in less than a century , was brewing . ultimately , however , it was resolved , at the 49th parallel . british columbia lost fort vancouver ( now vancouver , washington ) , and lots of the gulf islands . to this day , the oregon treaty is criticized by historians , as being too lenient for the americans .
