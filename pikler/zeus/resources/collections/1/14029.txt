Menstruation     menstruation or `` menses '' is when a female has blood come out of her vagina for 2â€“7 days every month . a slang word for menses is a `` period '' . inside the thick part of the uterus are blood vessels and other nutrients that a baby will need to grow . if an ovum in the uterus gets fertilized , it sticks to the wall of the uterus and starts to grow . however , if the ovum is not fertilized , it does not stick . the uterus then gets rid of the ovum and the extra tissue by releasing it from the body . the tissue and blood flows out of the uterus through the vagina . this is called menstruation or having a period . the bleeding normally lasts about 3-5 days , though some girls may bleed longer or have a bit of bleeding between periods . the uterus then starts preparing for another ovum . for most girls , the time between their periods is about one month . for about 2 years after menstruation starts , the time between periods is not always the same . some girls may skip a month , or have 2 periods close to each other . it is also normal to have cramps ( rather painful squeezing feelings ) or to feel bloated ( swollen up ) in the abdomen at periods . when many girls start having periods , they begin using sanitary napkins or tampons to soak up the blood and tissue . a sanitary napkin is a piece of material that absorbs ( takes in ) liquids which is worn between the vulva and underpants . a tampon is a stick of absorbent material that is placed in the vagina .
