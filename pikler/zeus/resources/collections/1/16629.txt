Double bass     double bass is a widely-used name for a large stringed instrument . other terms , perhaps more correct , include contrabass and upright bass . it is used in orchestras , jazz bands , rockabilly bands , bluegrass music , and some country music bands . it plays low-pitched musical notes in musical ensembles and bands . in jazz bands , these low-pitched musical notes are called the `` bass line . '' the double bass looks like smaller instruments like the violin , viola , and cello . the double bass is usually made from wood . double basses have a hollow wooden body which helps to amplify the sounds of the instrument ( `` amplify '' means `` to make louder '' ) . a wooden neck is attached to the body , and a flat wooded fingerboard is glued onto the neck . it usually has four metal strings which are strung with tension on the neck . it has a peg at the bottom to stand it . in an orchestra , double bass players bow the strings with a wooden bow strung with horsehair , or pluck the strings with their fingers ( plucking the strings is called pizzicato ) . in jazz the double bass is played pizzicato most of the time . however some jazz players use the bow to play melodies on the double bass .
