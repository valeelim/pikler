Nintendo 64     nintendo 64 ( commonly abbreviated n64 ) was the third video game console released by nintendo . it was released in 1996 and was meant to compete against the sony playstation and the sega saturn . the nintendo 64 was nintendo 's first console made for 3d graphics . it uses plastic cartridges instead of cds or disks , making load times faster . because of this , the games cost more to make . the controller for the nintendo 64 was shaped like an `` m '' and had 10 buttons and a joystick . sony used the n64 joystick design to make their dualshock playstation controller . out of the box , the nintendo 64 had 4 mb of ram , and it could be upgraded to 8 mb with the expansion pak . because making games for the nintendo 64 was more expensive than making games for the playstation , many video game companies did not make games for the n64 . they made them for the playstation and playstation 2 instead . nintendo also did not like games that had a lot of blood or violence in them . companies who made these kinds of games made them for the playstation instead . however , some game makers did make some violent games for the nintendo 64 , such as rare 's first-person shooter `` perfect dark '' . nintendo lost its lead over sega and sony because of these two things .
