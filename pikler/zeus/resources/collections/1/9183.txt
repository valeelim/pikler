Kelvin     the kelvin ( symbol : k ) is the si unit of temperature . it is named in honour of the physicist william thomson , the first lord kelvin ( 1824–1907 ) . the kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature . this says that `` the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in kelvin '' . this means that kelvin is an absolute temperature scale , and scientists use this scale more than any other . the kelvin is a base si unit of measurement , defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water , which is the temperature at which water in solid , liquid , and gaseous state coexist in equilibrium . the temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree celsius above the freezing point , or 0.01 °c . the coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15 degrees celsius , or zero kelvin ( 0 k ) . by writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers .
