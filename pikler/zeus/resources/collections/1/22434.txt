X-ray     x-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation . x-rays are waves of x-radiation . x-rays have a shorter wavelength , and therefore more energy , than ultraviolet radiation . they have a much shorter wavelength than visible light ( the light that we can see ) . radiation with shorter wavelengths ( more energy ) than the x-ray is called gamma radiation ( γ-rays ) . these are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum . the wavelength of x-rays covers a wide range . most x-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres . this corresponds with frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz ( 3×10 hz to 3×10 hz ) and energies in the range 100 ev to 100 kev . x-rays can go through many solid materials . for this reason , taking photograms with x-rays is used in medicine in order to see bones and other things inside the body . sometimes the term `` x-ray '' means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them . what these images show will depend on three things : rayleigh scattering , compton scattering and photoabsorption . the images show bone because it is dense enough that x-rays are not able to pass through it . instead , the x-rays are either absorbed or scattered . the images do not show skin and muscle , however , because these tissues are transparent enough for the x-rays to pass through them without being absorbed too much . to detect tumors , other imaging devices are used ; such as magnetic resonance imaging . a computed tomography scanner combines an x-ray machine and computer to construct a three dimensional ( 3d ) picture . this has some ability to see other things besides bone .
