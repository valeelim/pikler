Ernest Rutherford     ernest rutherford , 1st baron rutherford of nelson , om , pc , frs ( 30 august 1871 – 19 october 1937 ) was a new zealand scientist , who won the nobel prize in chemistry in 1908 , for his work on nuclear physics , and for the theory of the structure of the atom . rutherford was one of the first researchers in nuclear physics , after the discovery of radiation by a french physicist by the name of antoine henri becquerel in 1896. rutherford discovered the three parts of radiation which he named alpha , beta , and gamma . he also discovered that alpha particles were the nuclei of helium . rutherford 's geiger–marsden experiment led to what we know today about the atomic structure , where the atom is a nucleus and electrons orbit around it . in 1919 , rutherford made the world 's first nuclear reaction , where he put alpha particles with nitrogen gas and created particles of oxygen isotopes and protons . the important thing about the experiment was the fact that he changed nitrogen gas into oxygen gas .
