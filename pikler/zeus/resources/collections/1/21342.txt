Density     density is a measurement that compares the amount of matter an object has to its volume . an object with a lot of matter in a certain amount of volume has high density . an object with a little matter in the same amount of volume has a low density . temperature has an effect on density . when the temperature of a substance increases , density decreases because the atoms are moving all around the place having less matter in one space . when the temperature of a substance decreases , the density increases because the atoms move slower making the atoms stay in one place . many substances follow this rule , but there are exceptions . water is one such exception . when water freezes , it makes ice that is less dense than liquid water . fresh water is often used as a standard of relative density . this is called specific gravity . the most common si units for density are g/cm and kg/m . when the numerator is much larger than the denominator , that means the substance has a higher density . when the denominator is much larger than the numerator , the substance has a lower density .
