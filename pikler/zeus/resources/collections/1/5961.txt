Hinduism     hinduism takes ideas from the vedas , the upanishads , as well as the teachings of many hindu gurus through the ages . many different types of thought come from six main vedic/hindu schools . bhakti sects , and tantric agamic schools are very common paths within hinduism . `` the eternal way '' ( in sanskrit सनातन धर्म , `` sanātana dharma '' ) , or the `` perennial philosophy/harmony/faith '' , is the one name that has represented hinduism for thousands of years . according to hindus , it speaks the idea that certain spiritual principles are true for all time , surpassing man-made beliefs , and representing a pure science of consciousness . this consciousness is not just that of the body or mind and intellect , but of a soul-state above the mind that exists within `` and '' beyond our existence , the pure self of all . religion to the hindu is the search for the divine within the self , the search to find the one truth that really never was lost . according to this belief , somebody looking for truth will find it , no matter who they are . everything that exists , from vegetables and animals to mankind , are subjects and objects of the eternal `` dharma '' . this inner faith , therefore , is also known as `` arya '' /noble dharma , `` veda '' /knowledge dharma , `` yoga '' /union dharma , `` hindu dharma '' or , simply , the `` dharma '' .
