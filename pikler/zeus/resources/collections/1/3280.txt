Scientific method     scientific method refers to ways to investigate phenomena , get new knowledge , correct errors and mistakes , and test theories . the oxford english dictionary says that scientific method is : `` a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century , consisting in systematic observation , measurement , and experiment , and the formulation , testing , and modification of hypotheses '' . a scientist gathers empirical and measurable evidence , and uses sound reasoning . new knowledge often needs adjusting , or fitting into , previous knowledge . what distinguishes a scientific method of inquiry is a question known as 'the criterion ' . it is an answer to the question : is there a way to tell whether a concept or theory is science , as opposed to some other kind of knowledge or belief ? there have been many ideas as to how it should be expressed . logical positivists thought a theory was scientific if it could be verified ; but karl popper thought this was a mistake . he thought a theory was not scientific unless there was some way it might be refuted . on the other hand , paul feyerabend thought there was no criterion . for him , `` anything goes '' , or whatever works , works .
