Triangle     a triangle is a shape , or a specific part of two dimensional space . it has three straight sides and three vertices . the three angles of a triangle always add up to 180째 ( 180 degrees ) . it is the polygon with the least possible number of sides . triangles can be grouped according to how long their sides are : - if all the three sides of a triangle have the same length , then we have an equilateral triangle ; - if a triangle has two sides with the same length , then we have an isosceles triangle ; - if all the three sides of a triangle have different lengths , then we have a scalene triangle . triangles can also be grouped by their angles : - if a triangle has a right angle , that is , if one of the angles of that triangle measures 90째 ( 90 degrees ) , then we have a right triangle . the opposite side to the right angle is the hypotenuse ; - if a triangle has an obtuse angle , that is , if one of the angles of that triangle is larger than 90째 , then we have an obtuse triangle ; - if a triangle has only acute angles , that is , if all the angles of that triangle are less than 90째 , then we have an acute triangle .
