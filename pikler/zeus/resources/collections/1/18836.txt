Time dilation     time dilation is a physics concept about changes in the passage of time , as related to relativity . it is a difference of elapsed time between two events `` as measured by observers '' . in albert einstein 's theories of relativity , there are two types of time dilation : case # 1 : in special relativity , clocks that are moving run slower according to a stationary observer 's clock . `` this effect does not come from workings of the clocks , but from the nature of spacetime '' . case # 2 : the observers may be in positions with different gravitational masses . in general relativity , clocks that are near a strong gravitational field run slower than clocks in a weaker gravitational field . experiments support both aspects of time dilation . the formula for determining time dilation in special relativity is : where it could also be written as : where a simple summary is that more time is measured on the clock at rest than the moving clock , therefore , the moving clock is `` running slow '' . when both clocks are not moving , relative to each other , the two times measured are the same . this can be proven mathematically by
