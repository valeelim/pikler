Grammar     grammar is the study of words , and the way they sound , and how they are used in a sentence . the ancient greeks used to call it `` grammatikē tékhnē '' , the craft of letters . it can have any of these meanings : 1. the study of a language : how it works , and everything about it . this is a '' background research on language '' . 1. the study of sentence structure . a set of rules and examples to show how the language should be used . this is a `` correct usage grammar '' , as in a textbook or manual/guide . 1. the system which people learn as they grow up . this is the `` native-speaker 's grammar '' . when we speak , we use the native-person 's grammar , or as near as we can . when we write , we try to write with correct grammar . so , speaking and writing a language each have their own style . all languages have their own grammar . most european languages are rather similar , but some , such as chinese and japanese , are very different from all european languages . english makes few changes to its word endings ( 'suffixes ' ) . in the italic or 'romance ' languages ( such as french , italian , and spanish ) , word endings carry a lot of meaning . in english we have just a few : plurals and possessives ( `` john 's '' ) are the most common . in our verbs we have dropped most endings except one : i love , you love , but `` she loves '' . that final 's ' is a remnant of anglo-saxon , which had more suffixes . verbs do have endings which show changes in tense : walked , walking .
