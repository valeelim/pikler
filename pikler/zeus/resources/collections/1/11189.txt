Surface area     surface area is the amount of space covering the outside of a three-dimensional ( 3d ) object . the surface area of a polyhedron is found by finding the sum of the area of all of the faces . the surface area is found between many three-dimensional shapes using formulas . the surface area is useful because it tells you how much material is required in order to cover the objectâ€”for example , how much paint is needed to paint a table.surface area is the sum of the faces , or surfaces , of a three dimensional shape . surface area increases rate of evaporation because there are more molecules touching the surface . there the surface molecules can draw heat energy from the surroundings , which makes the molecules heat up faster and escape faster . this process is also known as evaporation . for example a bowl filled with water will evaporate much faster than a flask filled with the same amount .
