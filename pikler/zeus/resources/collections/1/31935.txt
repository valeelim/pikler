Barter     barter is trading one thing for another without using money . usually the things that are traded are worth the same amount of money , but no money is used in the trade . barter is useful when two people each have something the other wants , so they agree on an amount of stuff and then swap it . this can also happen with services , for example a plumber can fix a tap in a winery and be given a crate of wine . the problem with barter is one person may not want what the other person has . for instance , bob needs a new pair of shoes and john has those shoes . but bob has eggs and john needs milk . this is where money becomes useful because anything can be traded for a set amount of money . bob could pay john for the shoes and john could go to the store and buy some milk .
