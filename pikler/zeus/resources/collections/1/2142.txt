Radio telescope     a radio telescope is like a huge satellite dish . an ordinary telescope allows people to see light from distant objects . stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope , but they also give off radio waves . scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars . other things like black holes also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too . the dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength . the information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined . this gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes , so even very faint signals can be received . scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes . the radio telescope at the parkes observatory , parkes , new south wales was used by nasa to receive messages from the apollo 11 moon landings . related pages .
