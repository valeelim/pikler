Rain     rain is when water falls from clouds in droplets that are bigger than 0.5 mm . droplets of water that are about 0.2mm to 0.45mm big are called drizzle . rain is a kind of precipitation . precipitation is any kind of water that falls from clouds in the sky , like rain , hail , sleet and snow . it is measured by a rain gauge . rain is part of the water cycle . a rainstorm is a sudden heavy fall of rain . it may cause flash floods in valleys . heavy rain for a long time may make floods on floodplains . rivers overflowing can destroy houses and drown people . also , landslides may happen . when the sun heats the earth 's surface , the ground heats the air above it . convection makes the air rise and cool . when it cools to the dew point , clouds form and rain follows.this usually occurs on flat land . this type of rainfall often causes summer showers and thunderstorms . relief rain usually occurs along coastal areas where a line of hills runs along the coast . when wet onshore wind from the sea meets a mountain , hill or any other sort of barrier , it is forced to rise along the slope and cools . when the air temperature falls to its dew point , water vapour condenses to form clouds . when the clouds can no longer hold the water droplets , relief rain begins to fall on the windward slope of the mountain . on the leeward slope , air sinks , it is warmed and further dried by compression . therefore , the leeward slope is known as rain shadow . moist winds blow in from the sea and are forced to rise over the land . the air cools and the water vapour condenses , forming rain drops . relief rain is also a very dense and cold mixture of precipitation it is called relief rainfall
