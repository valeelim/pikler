First aid     first aid is basic knowledge about how to help people who are suddenly sick ( illnesses ) or hurt ( injuries or body damage ) . for example , first aid is used at accidents to help an injured person until they receive medical treatment ( help by doctors , nurses or ambulances ) . first aid is also used to help people who suddenly become sick , until help arrives or they can be taken to medical care . a person does not need much equipment to give first aid . a package of things useful to give first aid is called a first aid kit . lives can be saved even without a first aid kit . first aid can be done just about anywhere that an emergency requires . in places far from hospitals , first aid may be the only help possible until the person can be taken to a hospital or clinic . emergency medical dispatchers are trained in first aid , so that if there is an emergency , they can give the caller some information on what to do until the ambulance arrives . this can include the `` c-a-b '' listed below . first aid skills are kept simple on purpose so that people can remember and use them in an emergency to save at least one life .
