Qur'an     the qur'an , sometimes spelled `` koran '' , ( ) is the holy book of islam . the qur'an is considered by muslims to be `` the word of allah ( god ) '' . this book is different from other religious texts in that it is believed to be written directly by god , through the prophet muhammad . some muslims call it the final testament . it has been written and read only in arabic for more than 1,400 years . but , because many muslims around the world do not understand arabic , the meaning of the qur'an is also given in other languages , so that readers can understand better what the arabic words in the qur'an mean . these books are like dictionaries to the qur'an - they are not read as part of the religion of islam , to replace the arabic qur'an . muslims believe that these translations are not the true qur'an ; only the arabic copy is the true qur'an . the quran is used with the hadith to interpret sharia law . muslims believe the qur'an was first revealed to muhammad by the archangel gabriel in a cave on the mountain of hira in mecca , and then over a period of twenty-three years until his death .
