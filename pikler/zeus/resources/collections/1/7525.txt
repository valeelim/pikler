Alabama Song     the `` alabama song '' comes from the 1930 operetta `` rise and fall of the city of mahagonny '' . the music is by kurt weill ; officially the lyrics are by bertolt brecht , but were probably actually written by elisabeth hauptmann . the lyrics for the `` alabama song '' are in english ( although a specific type of english ) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original german . the song has often been covered , perhaps most famously in 1967 by the doors ; unsurprisingly , jim morrison changed the lyric `` show us the way to the next pretty boy '' to `` show me the way to the next little girl .
