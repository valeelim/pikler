Jutland     jutland ( danish : `` jylland '' ; german : `` jütland '' ) is a peninsula in northern europe . it forms the mainland part of denmark and a northern part of germany . it separates the north sea from the baltic sea . its terrain is relatively flat , with low hills and peat bogs . it has an area of 29,775 km² ( 11,496 square miles ) , and a population of 2,491,852 ( 2004 ) . the northern two thirds of the peninsula are occupied by the westernmost portion of the kingdom of denmark . there is no separate name for the danish portion of the peninsula , so it is simply called the same name . the northernmost part of jutland became an island following a flood in 1825 ; the limfjord now separates it from the mainland . this island is called `` vendsyssel-thy or nørrejyske ø '' ( `` north jutlandic island '' ) and is still commonly reckoned as part of the peninsula ; it is also partly coterminous with the county and future region called north jutland . the southern third is made up of the german bundesland of schleswig-holstein , with the duchies of schleswig ( also sønderjylland/southern jutland ) and holstein . both duchies have passed back and forth between the danes and various german rulers . in the last border movement , denmark regained north schleswig ( `` nordslesvig '' in danish ) by plebiscite in 1920. southern schleswig remained german .
