Afrikaans     afrikaans is a west germanic language mainly spoken in south africa and namibia . it was originally the dialect that developed among the afrikaner protestant settlers , the unfree workers , and slaves brought to the cape area in southwestern south africa by the dutch east india company ( - voc ) between 1652 and 1705. most of these first settlers were from the united provinces ( now netherlands ) , though there were also many from germany , some from france , a few from scotland , and various other countries . the unfree workers and slaves were malays , and malagasy in addition to the native khoi and bushmen . research by j. a. heese says that until 1807 , 36.8 % of the ancestors of the white afrikaans speaking population were dutch , 35 % were german , 14.6 % were french and 7.2 % non-white ( of african and/or asian origins ) . heese 's figures are questioned by other researchers , however , and especially the non-white component quoted by heese is very much in doubt . a sizeable minority of those who spoke afrikaans as a first language were not white . the dialect became known as `` cape dutch '' . later , afrikaans was sometimes called `` african dutch '' or `` kitchen dutch '' . afrikaans was considered a dutch dialect until the early 20th century , when it began to be widely known as a different language . the name `` afrikaans '' is simply the dutch word for `` african '' , and the language is the african form of dutch .
