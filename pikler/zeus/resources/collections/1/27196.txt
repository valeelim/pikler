Master race     master race is an idea that one group of people is better than all other people . a group of people may believe themselves to be better because of their history , race , culture or some other reason . the idea first appeared in the 19th century . it was also used at different times in the 20th century , for example by the nazi party and during apartheid in south africa . this idea mostly began in the 19th century . it is not a theory liked by any scientists today . it claims there is a hierarchy of races ( or that some races are better than others ) . it was also claimed that at the bottom of the hierarchy were black-skinned people from africa and aborigines from australia , while pale-skinned nordic people were at the top of the hierarchy . arthur de gobineau ( 1816–1882 ) believed that cultures become bad when races mix . in his book `` moral and intellectual diversity of races '' ( , 1853–55 ) , de gobineau states that the mix of races has a bad influence on culture . in his view , the development of culture is linked to that of the race . when empires are created , this leads to a mixing of races . according to de gobineau , this would lead to degeneration , and the downfall of the respective empire .
