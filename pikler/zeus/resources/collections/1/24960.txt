Archaea     the archaea ( or `` archea '' ) are a group of single-celled organisms . the name comes from greek αρχαία , `` old ones '' . they are a major division of living organisms . archaea are tiny , simple organisms . they were originally discovered in extreme environments ( extremophiles ) , but are now thought to be common to more average conditions . many can survive at very high ( over 80 °c ) or very low temperatures , or highly salty , acidic or alkaline water . some have been found in geysers , black smokers , oil wells , and hot vents in the deep ocean . recent research has found ammonia-eating archaea in soil and seawater . in the past they had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes ( or kingdom monera ) and named archaebacteria , but this classification is a mistake . the archaea have an independent evolutionary history and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life . they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system . in this system , the three distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the archaea , bacteria and eukaryota .
