Aaron     aaron is a person described in the bible and the qu'ran . he was the older brother of moses . he helped moses lead the hebrews out of egypt . in the bible , he appeared very much in exodus . aaron spoke for moses , when he went to tell pharaoh the king of egypt everything god wanted moses to say . the lord said to moses ( exodus 7:1 to 3 ) , `` see , i have made you like god to pharaoh , and your brother aaron will be your prophet . you are to say everything i command you , and your brother aaron is to tell pharaoh to let the israelites go out of his country ... '' . aaron 's staff was used by the lord a few times when trying to persuade the pharaoh to let the israelites go . the lord ordered moses and aaron , `` when pharaoh says to you , 'perform a miracle , ' then say to aaron , take your staff and throw it down before pharaoh ' , and it will become a snake . '' so moses and aaron went to pharaoh and aaron did so . aaron 's staff , according to the bible , really became a snake and ate up all the other snakes that the pharaoh 's magicians had made . also , aaron 's staff was used to make the nile river all turn into blood . he `` stretched it out '' , and the fish in the nile died , and the river smelled ; and the egyptians could not drink the water , as it was recorded in the bible .
