Greenlandic language     greenlandic can be divided into three dialects : kalaallisut or , in english , greenlandic , is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of greenland . this standard national language is now taught to all greenlanders in school , regardless of their native dialect . it reflects almost exclusively the language of western greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from danish , while canadian and alaskan inuit languages have tended to take words from english or sometimes french and russian . it is written using the roman alphabet . the dialect of the upernavik area in northwest greenland is somewhat different in sound from the standard dialect . tunumiit oraasiat , ( or tunumiisut in kalaallisut , often east greenlandic in other languages ) , is the dialect of eastern greenland . it differs sharply from other inuit language variants and has roughly 3,000 speakers . avanersuaq is the dialect of the area around qaanaaq in northern greenland . it is sometimes called the thule dialect or north greenlandic . this area is the northernmost settlement area of the inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers . it is reputed to be fairly close to the north baffin dialect , since a group of inuit from baffin island settled in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries . it counts under 1,000 speakers .
