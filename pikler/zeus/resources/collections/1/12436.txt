Trigonometry     trigonometry ( from the greek `` trigonon '' = three angles and `` metron '' = measure ) is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles , triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine ( abbreviated sin ) , cosine ( abbreviated cos ) and tangent ( abbreviated tan ) . it has some connection to geometry , although there is disagreement on exactly what that connection is ; for some , trigonometry is just a section of geometry . trigonometry uses a large number of specific words to describe parts of a triangle . some of the definitions in trigonometry are : - right-angled triangle - a right-angled triangle is a triangle that has an angle that is equal to 90 degrees . ( a triangle can not have more than one right angle ) the standard trigonometric ratios can only be used on right-angled triangles . - hypotenuse - the hypotenuse of a triangle is the longest side , and the side that is opposite the right angle . for example , for the triangle on the right , the hypotenuse is side `` c '' . - opposite of an angle - the opposite side of an angle is the side that does not intersect with the vertex of the angle . for example , side `` a '' is the opposite of angle `` a '' in the triangle to the right .
