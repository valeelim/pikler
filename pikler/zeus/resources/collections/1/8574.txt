Sum     the sum of two numbers is what we get when we add the two numbers together . this operation is called summation . there are a number of ways of writing sums , with the most common being : - addition ( formula_1 ) - summation ( formula_2 ) - computerization : sigma notation is a mathematical notation to write long sums in a short way . sigma notation uses the greek letter sigma , ( ∑ ) , and takes upper and lower bounds which tell us where the sum begins and where it ends . the lower bound usually has a variable ( called the index ) given a value , such as `` i=2 '' . this tells us that the summation begins at 2 , and goes up by 1 until it reaches the number on the top . sums are used to represent series and sequences . for example , the geometric series of a repeating decimal can be represented in summation , the concept of an integral is a limit of sums . the area under a curve being defined as : further reading . - nicholas j. higham , `` the accuracy of floating point summation '' , `` siam j. scientific computing '' 14 ( 4 ) , 783–799 ( 1993 ) .
