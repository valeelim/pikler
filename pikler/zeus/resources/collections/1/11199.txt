Communist state     a communist state is a state whose constitution claims to follow the principles of communism . its form of government has only a single political party , the communist party . the governance of the state is guided by the principles of leninism , marxism , maoism , or any other form of communist ideology . technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictory term . in principle , a communist society is a stateless society . in practice , communist states do not actually refer to themselves as `` communist states '' . they do not consider themselves to be communist societies at present . instead , their constitutions call them `` socialist states '' or `` workers ' states '' . during the 20th century , a `` communist state '' came to be understood as any country ruled by a single party and guided by a marxist–leninist or maoist ideology . these countries would also have a planned economy . the ruling class is the working class ( the proletariat ) . currently , there are five countries that are called communist states . they are china , cuba , laos , vietnam and north korea . north korea does not follow marxism–leninism , but it is otherwise still considered to be in the same category .
