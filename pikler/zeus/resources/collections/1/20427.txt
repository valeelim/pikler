Goalkeeper     a goalkeeper is someone who protects a team 's goal . there are goalkeepers in sports like football ( soccer ) and ice hockey , for example . the goalkeeper 's mission is to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal . goalkeepers normally wear more protective gear than other players on the team but this is not always true . a goalkeeper 's kit ( or `` uniform '' ) consists of shin guards and gloves to protect his hands from the impact of the ball when he catches it . historically , however , until the 1960s goalkeepers would wear no hand protection . until the early 20th century , the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates , with the only different item of clothing being his cap . however , in 1909 , the scottish football association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players . this was to show his different role , as the only player allowed to handle the ball . the goalkeeper in ice hockey ( a `` goalie '' ) uses thicker padding than the other players on the team . this is to prevent damage caused by being hit by the puck . the hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players . the bottom edge is also longer and flatter . the goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand . this glove has a large area to help catch the puck . goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck .
