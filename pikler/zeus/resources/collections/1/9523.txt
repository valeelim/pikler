Welfare state     a welfare state is where the government has a duty to provide some level of basic support for welfare of its citizens , including social security . in politics , conservatives are against welfare states . schooling can be free , and it can be a duty of state to help ill people . the government may give money to people who do not have as much as most other people . the state may also give homes to people who do not have them . to make this happen there may have to be taxes , and usually rich people have to pay most taxes . the taxes vary , however , to ensure that the less rich people can afford to pay them . for example , in the uk , poorer people have to pay a smaller part of their income as income tax than the rich . there are also taxes put on things that people do not have to pay if they do not do certain things , such as buying as much . this is called vat ( value added tax ) , which typically deducts 20 % so that there is no fixed amount of tax to pay . a welfare state could also be paid for if the government borrows money from people , mainly by selling bonds .
