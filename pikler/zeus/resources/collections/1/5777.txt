Cryptography     cryptography , or cryptology , is the practice and study of hiding information . it is sometimes called code , but this is not really a correct name . it is the science used to try to keep information secret and safe . modern cryptography is a mix of mathematics , computer science , and electrical engineering . cryptography is used in atm ( bank ) cards , computer passwords , and shopping on the internet . when a message is sent using cryptography , it is changed ( or `` encrypted '' ) before it is sent . the method of changing text is called a `` code '' or , more precisely , a `` cipher '' . the changed text is called `` ciphertext '' . the change makes the message hard to read . someone who wants to read it must change it back ( or `` decrypt '' it ) . how to change it back is a secret . both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it , but other people should not be able to . studying the cyphertext to discover the secret is called `` cryptanalysis '' or `` cracking '' or sometimes `` code breaking '' .
