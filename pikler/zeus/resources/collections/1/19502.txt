Behavior     behaviour ( or behavior ) is what an animal or plant does or how it acts . behaviours may be conscious or unconscious . they may be inherited or learned . in experiments , behaviour is the observed reaction which occurs when an organism is given a stimulus . some organisms are more complicated than others and may be more aware of their surroundings . if their behaviour is conscious it means that they know what they are doing . if they are not aware of what they are doing this is unconscious behaviour . humans will pull their hand back without thinking if they accidentally touch something hot . this is done because we ( and other animals ) inherit nervous system reflexes which cause us to pull away from the thing that is causing the pain . behaviour is linked to the nervous system as well as the endocrine system . the nervous system reacts , and notices what happens . the hormone system is much slower . it makes some kinds of behaviour more , or less , likely . a simple example is the change from being a child to an adult . this involves a whole range of hormones which affect growth and behaviour .
