Multiplication     multiplication is an arithmetic operation for finding the `` product '' of two numbers . multiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first , subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication . with natural numbers , it tells you the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the other side . with real numbers , it tells you the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the other side . for example , three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together , or the total of three fives . this can be written down as 3 × 5 = 15 , or spoken as `` three times five equals fifteen . '' mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply `` coefficients '' together , or `` multiplicand '' and `` multiplicator '' separately . multiplicand × multiplicator = product . multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative- when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product . this is true for the integers ( whole numbers ) , e.g . 4 × 6 is the same as 6 × 4 , and also for the rational numbers ( fractions ) , and for all the other real numbers ( representable as a field in the continuous line ) , and also for complex numbers ( numbers representable as a field in the plane ) . it is not true for quaternions ( numbers representable as a ring in the four-dimensional space ) , vectors or matrices .
