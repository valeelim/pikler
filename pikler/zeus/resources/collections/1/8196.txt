Synesthesia     synesthesia , or synaesthesia , is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses . people who have synesthesia are called synesthetes . synesthesia is usually inherited ( called congenital synesthesia ) , but exactly how people inherit it is unknown . synesthesia is sometimes reported by people using psychedelic drugs , after a stroke , or during an epileptic seizure . it is also reported to be a result of blindness or deafness . synesthesia that comes from events unrelated to genes is called adventitious synesthesia . this synesthesia results from some drugs or a stroke but not blindness or deafness . it involves sound being linked to vision or touch being linked to hearing . synesthesia was investigated a lot in the 19th and early 20th centuries , but in the middle of the 20th century , it was less studied . only recently has it been studied again in much detail . some musicians and composers have a form of synesthesia that allows them to `` see '' music as colors or shapes . this is called chromethesia . mozart is said to have had this form of synesthesia . he said that the key of d major had a warm `` orangey '' sound to it , while b-flat minor was blackish . a major was a rainbow of colors to him . this may explain why he wrote some of his music using different colors for different music notes , and why much of his music is in major keys .
