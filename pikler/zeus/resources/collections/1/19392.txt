Fluorine     fluorine ( symbol f ) is a chemical element that is very poisonous . its atomic number ( which is the number of protons in it ) is 9 , and its atomic mass is 19. it is part of the group 7 ( halogens ) on the periodic table of elements . fluorine is a light yellow diatomic gas . it is very reactive gas , which exists as diatomic molecules . it is actually the most reactive element . fluorine has a very high attraction for electrons , because it is missing one . this makes it the most powerful oxidizing agent . it can rip electrons from water ( making oxygen ) and ignite propane on contact . it does not need a spark . metals can catch on fire when placed in a stream of fluorine . after it is reduced by reacting with other things , it forms the stable fluoride ion . fluorine is very poisonous . fluorine bonds very strongly with carbon . it can react with the unreactive noble gases . it explodes when mixed with hydrogen . the melting point of fluorine is -363.33째f ( -219.62째c ) , the boiling point is -306.62째f ( -188.12째c ) .
