Convection     convection is the movement of a physical quantity ( for example heat ) because of the movement of the matter . for example , the wind is the movement of the air and it can cool down a room if the window is open because the cold air comes inside of the room . the movement of the clouds , the sea waves and many types of heaters are examples of convection . convection can happen naturally ( `` natural convection '' ) or because of a moving device ( `` forced convection '' ) . the fan is a device that produces the movement of the air artificially . the air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan . this is an example of `` forced convection '' . natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold , so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part , the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward . for example , if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire , it moves from the bottom to the surface . at the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom .
