Piano     a piano ( also called a pianoforte ) is a musical instrument that is played by pressing keys on a keyboard . each key is a lever that makes a hammer inside the piano hit a string inside , producing a sound . each string has a different length and so produces a different note . the piano has been an extremely popular instrument in western classical music since the late 18th century . a person who plays the piano is called a pianist . the piano was invented by bartolomeo cristoffori of padua , italy . he made his first piano in 1709. it developed from the clavichord which looks like a piano but the strings of a clavichord are hit by a small blade of metal called a “ tangent ” . in the piano the strings are hit by a block of wood called a hammer . the early keyboarded instruments , such as the clavichords , harpsichords and organs that were used at that time , had a much shorter keyboard than they do today . gradually the keyboard became longer until it had the 88 notes ( 7 octaves plus three notes ) of the modern piano .
