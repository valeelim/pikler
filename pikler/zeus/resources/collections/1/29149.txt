Motet     the word motet is a piece of music for a church service sung by a choir without using any instruments . the words are usually in latin . if the words are written in english for the anglican church , it is called an anthem . motets have been written since the middle ages . medieval motets often had very complex rhythms . the tenor often had the tune , which might be a folk tune , and two voices would put quite complicated accompaniments on top . the most famous medieval composer who wrote motets was guillaume de machaut ( 1300-1377 ) in the renaissance , motets were usually polyphonic . that means that the different voices ( soprano , alto , tenor , bass ) would be singing different parts of the melody at the same time , making it very beautiful , but quite complicated to listen to . many composers of this time wrote motets . the most famous was giovanni da palestrina ( 1525-1594 ) . in the baroque period , one of the most famous composers was heinrich schütz ( 1585-1672 ) , who wrote motets which he called “ cantiones sacrae ” ( meaning : “ sacred songs ” ) . johann sebastian bach ( 1685-1750 ) wrote six wonderful motets with german texts . some people think that bach may have used a few instruments to accompany these motets . in three of them the choir divide into eight parts .
