Ray     the rays are a group of batoid cartilaginous fish containing more than 500 described species in thirteen families . the batoids include four orders . they are mostly flattened in shape , and usually demersal , living and eating at the bottom of the sea . the group first appears in the triassic period , after 95 % of marine species had been wiped out by the p/tr extinction event . taxonomy . - batoidea - rajiformes - rajidae : the skates , 200 species - rhinidae : the bowmouth guitarfish - rhinobatidae : the guitarfish - rhynchobatidae : the wedgefish - pristiformes : the sawfish - myelobatiformes : the stingrays - torpediniformes : the electric rays rays look like bats in the water , and this is probably why they are called batoids . they have pectoral fins that are attached to their bodies from back to front , similar to the way a bat 's wings attach from its shoulder to its feet . the fins of the ray create a disk shape that can be round , triangular , or diamond-shaped . rays use their pectoral fins to fly through the water . though a bony fish takes in water with its mouth , rays do not because they live at the bottom of the ocean . if they took in water through their mouths , they would probably just get a mouthful of sand . because of this , they have breathing holes on top of their bodies called `` spiracles '' . rays use spiracles to take in water that is then sent over the gills .
