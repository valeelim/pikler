Isotope     the atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types . these are called isotopes . they have the same number of protons ( and electrons ) , but different numbers of neutrons . different isotopes of the same element have different masses . mass is the word for how much substance ( or matter ) something has . things with different masses have different weights . because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons , they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass . different isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number . they have the same number of protons . the atomic number is decided by the number of protons . isotopes have different mass numbers , though , because they have different numbers of neutrons . the word isotope , meaning at the same place , comes from the fact that isotopes are at the same place on the periodic table . in a neutral atom , the number of electrons equals the number of protons . isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the electronic structure . because how an atom acts is decided by its electronic structure , isotopes are almost the same chemically , but different physically to their original atoms .
