Turtle     turtles are the reptile order testudines . they have a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield . the order testudines includes both living and extinct species . the earliest fossil turtles date from about 220 million years ago . so turtles are one of the oldest surviving reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards , snakes and crocodiles . turtle have been very successful , and have an almost world-wide distribution . but , of the many species alive today , some are highly endangered . although the word turtle is widely used to describe all members of the order testudines , it is also common to see certain members described as terrapins , tortoises or sea turtles , as well . how these names are used , if at all , depends on the type of english . - british english describes these reptiles as turtles if they live in the sea ; terrapins if they live in fresh or brackish water ; or tortoises if they live on land . - american english tends to use the word turtle as a general term for all species . `` tortoise '' is used for most land-dwelling species , and oceanic species are usually referred to as sea turtles . the name `` terrapin '' is typically reserved only for the brackish water diamondback terrapin , `` malaclemys terrapin '' .
