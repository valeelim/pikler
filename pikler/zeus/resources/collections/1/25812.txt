Mitochondria     mitochondria are organelles , or parts of a eukaryote cell . they are in the cytoplasm , not the nucleus . they make most of the cell 's supply of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , a molecule that cells use as a source of energy . their main job is this energy conversion . they oxidise glucose to provide energy for the cell . the process makes atp , and is called cellular respiration . in addition to supplying cellular energy , mitochondria are involved in a range of other processes , such as signalling , cellular differentiation , cell death , as well as the control of the cell division cycle and cell growth . a mitochondrion contains outer and inner membranes . these are made of phospholipid double layers and proteins . the two membranes have different properties . because of this double-membraned organization , there are five distinct compartments within the mitochondrion . they are : 1. the outer mitochondrial membrane , 1. the intermembrane space ( the space between the outer and inner membranes ) ,
