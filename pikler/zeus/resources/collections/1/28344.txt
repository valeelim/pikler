Electrical conductor     a conductor is a material which electricity , heat or sound can flow through . an electrical conductor conducts electricity . the ability to conduct electricity is called electrical conductivity . most metals , like iron and copper , are electrical conductors . these metals are used to make wires to carry electric current . plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity and is used for many purposes but metals are more used . some materials are `` semiconductors '' . this means that electricity `` can '' flow through them , but not very well . some materials are `` resistors '' . this means that they make it very hard for electricity to flow through them . a material that stops electric current is called an insulator ( electricity ) . wires are covered with insulators like plastic to stop the electricity from leaving the wire . some materials when really cold , are superconductors . they offer no resistance at all to the flow of electricity .
