Navigation     navigation is the methods used to learn where someone is and how to go to another place . since this is easy when landmarks are visible , the word is often limited to the methods ships or aircraft use . the word `` navigation '' was invented in the 15th century from the latin word `` navis '' which means `` ship '' and is found in other indo-european languages . navigation is literally `` art of ship mastery '' but is also used for 'finding one 's way ' . the global positioning system is the main tool for it . one type of navigation was made by the polynesians and is called polynesian navigation . polynesians used different things found all around them to find their way across large areas of open ocean . other early people also learned how to travel large distances using the natural world . for example : - a long time ago ( and still used by some people today ) people would watch the stars , the sun and the moon . from this they would know where north was . with charts they could find how far from the equator they were . this is called `` celestial navigation '' . until they had accurate clocks they did n't know their longitude ( how far east or west they were ) without seeing landmarks .
