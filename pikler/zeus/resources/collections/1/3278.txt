M-theory     m-theory is a new idea in small-particle physics that is part of superstring theory that was initially proposed by edward witten . the idea , or theory , often causes arguments among scientists , because there is no way to test it to see if it is true . if ever proven true , m-theory and string theory would mean big progress for science . to understand m-theory one must first have some knowledge of string theory . for hundreds of years , scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points , like dots . string theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are shaped like pieces of string . these strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look like points . each basic particle is created by the strings vibrating in different patterns . the reason scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than points . they seem to break such rules as causality and special relativity , which says that information can not travel faster than the speed of light .
