Exponentiation     exponentiation ( power ) is an arithmetic operation on numbers . it is repeated multiplication , just as multiplication is repeated addition . people write exponentiation with upper index . this looks like this : formula_1 . sometimes it is not possible . then people write powers using the ^ sign : 2^3 means formula_2 . the number formula_3 is called base , and the number formula_4 is called exponent . for example , in formula_2 , 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent . to calculate formula_2 a person must multiply the number 2 by itself 3 times . so formula_7 . the result is formula_8 . the equation could be read out loud in this way : 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8. examples : - formula_9 - formula_10 - formula_11 for every number `` x '' if the exponent is equal to 2 , then the power is called square because the area of a square is calculated using formula_12 . so if the exponent is equal to 3 , then the power is called cube because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_15 . so if the exponent is equal to -1 then the person must calculate the inverse of the base . so
