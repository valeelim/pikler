Daphne (mythology)    daphne ( mythology ) daphne ( greek : δάφνη , meaning `` laurel '' ) was a dryad in greek mythology , daughter of the river god peneus . once the god apollo made fun of eros , equivalent to cupid the god of love . eros was angry , and shot a golden arrow at apollo , making him fall in love with the nymph daphne the virgin . but eros shot daphne with a leaden arrow so she could never love apollo back . so apollo followed her while she ran away , until she came to the river of her father peneus . apollo is jealous and puts it into the girl 's mind to stop to bathe in the river ladon ; there , as all strip naked , the ruse is revealed , as in the myth of callisto . there she wanted help from peneus , who turned her into a laurel tree so she would be safe from apollo . apollo was sad , and made himself a laurel wreath ( a circle made of laurel that you put on your head ) from the tree , and the laurel tree became sacred to apollo and is used by emperors within the culture . after the crown was used for all the winners at his games and great heroes in the years to come would be crowned with laurel leaves . he also vowed that she , like him , would have eternal youth where her leaves would never turn brown or fall but would always stay lush and green . apollo loved that laurel with all his heart .
