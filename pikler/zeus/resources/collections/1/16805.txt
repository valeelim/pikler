Phosphorus     phosphorus has the chemical symbol p , and its atomic number is 15. its mass number is 30.97. it is not found in nature as an element but as compounds , such as phosphates . it can be a red or a white waxy solid . phosphorus comes in several forms . white and red phosphorus are the most common forms . white phosphorus is a waxy white solid . when pure , it is colourless . it is insoluble in water , but soluble in carbon disulphide , an organic solvent . it turns light yellow when in air . it glows in the dark because it `` burns '' very slowly in air . when exposed to sunlight , or when heated in its own vapour to 250 °c , it is converted to the red variety . this form does not ignite spontaneously and it is less toxic and less flammable than white phosphorus . the red modification is fairly stable and sublimes with a vapor pressure of 1 atmosphere at 417 °c . white phosphorus is more reactive than red phosphorus . white phosphorus catches fire spontaneously in air , burning to make smoke of phosphorus ( v ) oxide . if it burns in a little air , it produces poisonous phosphorus ( iii ) oxide . when white phosphorus is heated in an alkali , it disproportionates to produce hypophosphites and phosphine . red phosphorus can burn but needs to be ignited . phosphorus reacts with the halogens to make phosphorus halides . it reacts with some metals to make phosphides .
