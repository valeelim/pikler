Nicolaus Copernicus     nicolaus copernicus ( 19 february 1473 – 24 may 1543 ) was a polish astronomer . people know copernicus for his ideas about the sun and the earth . his main idea was that our world is `` heliocentric '' ( `` helios '' = sun ) . his theory was that the sun is in the middle of the solar system , and the planets go around it . this was published in his book , `` de revolutionibus orbium coelestium '' ( on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres ) . copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of thorn ( toruń ) , in royal prussia , a mainly german-speaking region that a few years earlier had become a part of the kingdom of poland . he was taught first in cracow and then in italy , where he graduated as a lawyer of the church . he also studied medicine to serve his fellow clerics . copernicus spent most of his life working and researching in frauenburg ( frombork ) , warmia , where he died in 1543. copernicus was one of the great polymaths of his age . he was a priest , mathematician , astronomer , doctor , jurist , physician , classical scholar , governor , administrator , diplomat , economist , and soldier . during all these jobs , he treated astronomy as a hobby . however , his formula of how the sun , rather than the earth , is at the center of the solar system , is still one of the most important scientific hypotheses in history . it was the beginning of modern astronomy .
