Lake     a lake ( from latin `` lacus '' ) is a large body of water ( larger and deeper than a pond ) within a body of land . as a lake is separated from the ocean , it is not a sea . some lakes are very big , and people in the past sometimes called them seas . lakes do not flow , like rivers , but many have rivers flowing into and out of them . most lakes on the surface of the earth are fresh water and most are in the northern hemisphere . more than 60 % of the lakes of the world are in canada . finland is known as `` the land of the thousand lakes '' ( there are 187,888 lakes in finland , of which 60,000 are large ) . many lakes are man-made reservoirs built to produce electricity , for recreation , or to use the water for irrigation or industry , or in houses . if there are not rivers flowing out of the lake ( see endorheic basin ) , or they are few and small , the lake loses water only by evaporation or because the water flows through the soil pores . where the water evaporates rapidly and the soil around the lake has a high salt level , as in very dry places , the water of the lake has a high concentration of salt and the lake is called a salt lake . examples of salt lakes are the great salt lake , the caspian sea , the aral sea , and the dead sea .
