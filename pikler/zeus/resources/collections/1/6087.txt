Poison     poisons are substances which cause death or injury when taken in by a living thing . it may be taken in as drink or food , or absorbed through the skin . the damage is usually done by a chemical reaction . the effect of the poison varies with the amount which is absorbed ( taken in ) . substances which are poisonous are called toxic . if poisoning causes death , it is `` lethal '' poison . legally , and in hazardous chemical labeling , poisons are especially toxic substances . less toxic substances are labeled `` harmful '' , `` irritant '' , or not labeled at all . in medicine and zoology , toxins and venoms are different from poisons . toxins are the result of a biological process . venoms are substances which the organism uses to harm other species . certain organisms use venoms for hunting , or as a defense . if an organism is `` poisonous '' , such as many mushrooms , it is harmful to eat . if it is `` venomous '' , like snakes or honeybees , it has a harmful bite or sting . for some very deadly bites humans have developed effective antivenoms .
