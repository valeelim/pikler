Welsh language     the welsh language is a celtic language and the national language of wales , a country that is part of the united kingdom . in welsh , it is known as `` cymraeg '' , or `` yr iaith gymraeg '' , which means `` the welsh language '' . welsh is still spoken throughout the region : around 21 % of the people of wales ( about 600,000 people ) , as well as some people outside wales , including those in nearby england , can speak welsh . many people in wales say they can understand some form of welsh , such as spoken , written , or can read welsh , even if they do not speak it all the time . even though almost all welsh people can understand and use the english language , the welsh language is still an important part of welsh culture and so children in all schools in wales have to study it . there are some schools that have almost all of their classes in welsh , but most schools teach mainly in english and welsh is taught as a second language in these schools . welsh has mutations . mutations are when a sound ( in speech ) or a letter ( in writing ) changes at the start of a word . an example is the welsh word `` gwneud '' , which in english means `` to do '' , and `` dod '' , which means `` to come '' `` dewch i mewn '' which means `` come in '' . sometimes the word changes from `` '' gwneud '' to `` wneud '' , and from `` dod '' to `` ddod '' '' . these sounds ( in speech ) or letters ( in writing ) changes also occur within , and at the end , of words , although the simplified classification found in ordinary books does not mention this .
