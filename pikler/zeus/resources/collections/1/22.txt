Addition     addition is the mathematical way of putting things together . in arithmetic , addition is finding the total of two or more numbers . the sign for addition is `` + '' . the name for the sign `` + '' is `` plus '' . another name for the total is the sum . for example , there are objects in two groups . the objects are small circles : `` o '' . one group has five of these objects . the other group has 3 of these objects . to find the total number of objects in both groups , the objects can be counted . another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group . another method is to add the numbers of objects in group a and group b , since they are already counted . in symbols : there are rules for adding numbers that people learn . there are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ( binary adder ) . the rule says that : in another counting example , sally and bill have 2 children . sally and bill get 3 more children . sally and bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children .
