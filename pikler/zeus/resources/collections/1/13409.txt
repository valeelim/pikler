Classical mechanics     mechanics is a part of physics . it says what happens when forces act on things . there are two parts of mechanics . the two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics . classical mechanics is used most of the time , for most of the things we can see . some of the time , for example when the things are too small , classical mechanics is not good . then we need to use quantum mechanics . newton 's three laws of motion are important to classical mechanics . isaac newton made them . the `` first law '' says that , if there is no external force ( meaning there is no pushing , gravity , or any sort of power ) , things that are stopped will stay stopped or un-moving , and things that are moving will keep moving . before , people thought that things stopped if there was no force present . often , people say , `` objects that are stopped tend to stay stopped , and objects that are moving tend to stay moving , unless acted upon by an outside force , such as gravity , friction , etc ... '' the `` second law '' says how a force moves a thing . the net force on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum .
