Atheism     atheism is rejecting belief that there is a god . they may instead believe in the theory of evolution . it is the opposite of theism , which is the belief that at least one god exists . a person who rejects belief in gods is called an atheist . atheism is not the same as agnosticism : agnostics say that there is no way to `` know '' whether gods exist or not . being an agnostic does not have to mean a person rejects or believes in god . some agnostics are theists , believing in god . the theologian kierkegaard is an example . other agnostics are atheists . atheists often give reasons why they do not believe in a god or gods . three of the reasons that they often give are the problem of evil , the argument from inconsistent revelations , and the argument from nonbelief . not all atheists think these reasons provide complete proof that gods can not exist , but these are the reasons given to support rejecting belief that gods exist . some atheists do not believe in any god because there is no evidence for any god nor gods and goddesses , so believing any type of theism means believing unproved assumptions . these atheists think a simpler explanation for everything is methodological naturalism which means that only natural things exist . occam 's razor shows simple explanations without many unproved guesses are more likely to be true .
