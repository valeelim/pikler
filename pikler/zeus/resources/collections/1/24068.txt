Set theory     set theory is the study of sets in mathematics . sets are collections of objects . we refer to these objects as `` elements '' or `` members '' of the set . to write a set , one wraps the numbers in { curly brackets } and separates them with commas : e.g. , holds 1 , 2 , and 3. there are three types of set theories : description method , roster method ( tabular form ) , rule method ( set builder form ) . set theory was made in 1874 by georg cantor . it had to be made better because collections of objects can cause problems if you work with them without explaining them better . russell 's paradox was one of the problems . think about the set of all sets that are not members of themselves . if it were inside itself , then the rule which defines it would mean that it is `` not '' inside itself . but , if it were not inside itself , then the rule which defines it would mean that it `` is '' inside itself . this was a serious problem , and it meant that the old set theory was broken . it was improved by people including zermelo and bertrand russell .
