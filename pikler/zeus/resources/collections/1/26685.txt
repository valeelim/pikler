Flight     flight or flying is a process of movement of the object in a gaseous environment or a vacuum without contact with the surface of another environment , as is possible with the use of jet thrust , or other means of propulsion , and without it ( by inertia ) . best adapted for long controlled powered flight are flying birds and insects , and mammals of the order chiroptera and extinct reptiles of the order pterosaurs . all of these animals use the aerodynamic principles of flight , using the load-bearing properties of the wing . there are also many animals that make gliding and parachute flight , such as spiders web , aeroplankton flying clams and flying fish , intending to use the ear or leather folds , mammals and reptiles . the fastest flying animal is the peregrine falcon . the speed of its dive is over . humans have managed to construct lighter than air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their floating in air and water . an aerostat is a system that remains in the air primarily through the use of floating to give an aircraft that has the same overall density as air . aerostats include free balloons , airships , and moored balloons . an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin containing a lifting gas to provide floating , to which other components are attached .
