Rocky Mountains     the rocky mountains ( often 'the rockies ' ) are a range of mountains in the western united states and canada . they stretch from the northernmost part of british columbia , in western canada , to new mexico , in the southwestern united states . the rocky mountains are more than 3,000 miles long ( 4,800 kilometers ) . the highest point in the rocky mountains is mt . elbert . mt . elbert is 14,433 ft tall . the rocky mountains were formed from 80 million to 55 million years ago ( mya ) during the laramide orogeny . north america began to move westwards as pangaea broke up . a number of tectonic plates began to slide under the north american plate . the angle of subduction was shallow , resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western north america . since then , further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers has sculpted the rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys . the rocks in the rocky mountains were formed before the mountains were raised by tectonic forces . the oldest rock is precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the north american continent . there is also precambrian sedimentary argillite , dating back to 1.7 billion years ago . during the paleozoic , western north america lay underneath a shallow sea , which deposited many kilometers of limestone and dolomite .
