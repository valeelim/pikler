Cleveland Indians     the cleveland indians are a major league baseball team . they are part of the american league central division . the indians won two world series championships in 1920 and 1948. currently , they hold the longest championship drought in baseball . in their early years , they were often called the cleveland naps , in honor of the player-manager nap lajoie . after he retired , the team looked for a new nickname . they settled on `` indians '' for the 1915 season , partly in honor of the boston braves who had won the 1914 world series . in more modern times , their nickname is often thought to be a poor choice . it is considered offensive to name a team for a race or ethnic group . however , there has been no serious effort to change the name . in the 1990s , the indians were in the postseason several times . they made it to the world series in 1995 and 1997 but lost to the atlanta braves and the florida marlins respectively . they returned to the world series again in 2016 , and again they lost , this time to the chicago cubs in seven games .
