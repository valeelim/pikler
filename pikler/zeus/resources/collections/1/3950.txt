Golf     golf is a game played in an open field where the golfer plays his golf ball into a hole by using different types of clubs ( golf instruments ) . the book `` rules of golf '' reads `` the game of golf consists in playing a ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the rules . '' in golf , a golfer plays a number of holes in a given order . 18 holes played in an order controlled by the golf course design , normally make up a game . on a nine-hole course , two nine-hole rounds make up a normal game . each hole starts from the teeing area . golfers put the ball on a small stand called a tee and swing a club at it to try and hit it as straight and far as possible . once each golfer in the group has done this , the person whose ball landed farthest from the hole hits his again , followed by everyone else , one person at a time , until everyone is on the green . the green is the area near the hole where the grass is cut very short . once on the green the players will try to `` put '' the ball into the hole . putting is similar to a regular swing except it is not as hard and the player does not want the ball to go in the air . once each player has put their ball into the hole , the group moves on to the next hole .
