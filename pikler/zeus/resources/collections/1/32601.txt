Rhythm     rhythm refers to the length of time between each major `` beat '' , or accent , such as in a piece of music . it is the sequence of sounds and silences which make up the rhythm . the first beat of a group of regular , evenly spaced beats usually feels stronger than the others . when we write music down , we put each group in bars ( or “ measures ” ) . rhythms can have different patterns which can be clapped or tapped . in western music , these patterns are common : - 1 2 , 1 2 - 1 2 3 , 1 2 3 - 1 2 3 4 , 1 2 3 4. a conductor will beat time . the rhythm will fit in to this regular beat . all musicians have to have a good sense of rhythm . to play or sing rhythmically they must keep a steady beat in their head ( if playing alone ) , listen to the others players ( if playing in groups ) or watch the conductor ( if there is one ) . people who are playing on their own can practise with a metronome to help them to play to a steady beat . however , musicians also use rubato ( rhythmic freedom ) , especially when playing music of a romantic nature . one has to learn to let the music “ breathe ” in the right way . this is not the same as playing unrhythmically ( badly ) . it is something one learns with experience .
