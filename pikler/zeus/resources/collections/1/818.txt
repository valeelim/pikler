Textual difficulty     textual difficulty means how easy or hard a text is to read . research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read . 1. how difficult the words are : this is `` lexical '' difficulty . rare words are less well known than common words . rare , difficult words are often longer than common , easy words . 1. how difficult the sentences are : this is `` syntactical '' difficulty . long , complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short , simple sentences . a readability test is a way to measure a text for how easy it is to read . readability tests give a prediction as to how difficult readers will find a particular text . they do this by measuring one or both of the two main causes , as follows : word difficulty is usually measured by vocabulary lists or word length . in 1923 , bertha a. lively and sidney l. pressey published the first reading ease formula . they had been concerned that science textbooks in junior high school had so many technical words . they felt that teachers spent all class time explaining their meaning . they argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the “ vocabulary burden ” of textbooks . their formula used the thorndike word list as a basis . manually , it took three hours to apply the formula to a book .
