Supernova     a supernova is when a huge star explodes . it usually happens when its nuclear fusion can not hold the core against its own gravity . the core collapses , and explodes . the biggest supernovae are called hypergiants and smaller ones are called supergiants . they are massive : because of gravity they use up their energy very quickly . normally they only live for a few million years . during the explosion , the total energy radiated by supernovae may briefly outshine the entire output of a galaxy . they emit energy equal to that of the whole lifetime of a solar-like star . the explosion blows off its stellar material away from the star , at velocities up to 30,000 km/s or 10 % of the speed of light . this drives a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium . this sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust , which we see as a supernova remnant . after exploding , what is left becomes a black hole or a neutron star . most stars are small and do not explode . they become colder and smaller , and they become white dwarf stars .
