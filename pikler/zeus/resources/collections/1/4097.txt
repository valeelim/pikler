Republic of Cyprus     cyprus is an island in the mediterranean sea off the south coast of turkey . at present it is divided `` de facto '' into two countries . the republic of cyprus is a member state of the european union . although it is situated in asia , cyprus is often associated with europe because of the culture and history of the people . the capital of the republic is nicosia . most of the population speaks greek , and a minority is turkish-speaking . in july 1974 turkey invaded cyprus and since then the northern part of the island is under turkish occupation ( illegally , according to the greek government ) . the turkish republic of northern cyprus is not recognised by any international organisation . when entering by aeroplane , a short stop is made to an airport in mainland turkey . the present situation came about because cyprus , historically greek , was conquered and became part of the ottoman empire from 15701914 , though `` de facto '' the british administered it from 1878 until 1960. likewise , greece had been part of the ottoman empire for several centuries . negotiations for a unified island have been held several times without success .
