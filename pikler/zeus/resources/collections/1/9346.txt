Silversword     the silversword plant grows only at high elevations on the island of maui in hawaii . the silversword is a noticeable , round-shaped rosette plant with rigid ( swordlike ) , succulent leaves densely covered by silver hairs . when a plant flowers at the end of its life , it produces a spectacular flowering stalk 0.5-2.0 m ( 1.6-6.4 ft ) tall , typically with hundreds of maroon sunflowerlike flower heads . this plant receives more attention from visitors to haleakala national park than any other plant or animal because of its striking appearance and restricted distribution . the strikingly beautiful haleakala silversword has always aroused the curiosity of human visitors to haleakala volcano . in pre-park days , plants were often removed by travelers to haleakala volcano as proof that the party had reached the summit , a practice that eventually seriously affected the silversword population . browsing by feral goats and domestic cattle was also a significant factor in the silversword decline , but it was not a species preferred by these animals . by the 1920s , silversword numbers were so depleted that the maui chamber of commerce sent a petition to washington , dc , requesting that a serious effort be made to save the species ( loope and crivellone 1986 ) .
