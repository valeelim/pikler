Moirai     the moirai ( the fates ) were the three goddesses of destiny in greek mythology . they were clotho , lachesis and atropos ( greek : άτροπος ) . they controlled the life and destiny of everyone . clotho spins the thread of life ( begins a person 's or creature 's life ) , lachesis measures it ( looks at the how long it currently is ) , and atropos cuts the thread . when the thread is cut the person dies . the moirai are capable of destroying an immortal . the decisions of the moriae about a person 's life can not be changed . even zeus is powerless to change their will . the parents of the moirai are not surely known . some said they were the daughters of zeus and the titaness themis , or more likely of primordial beings like nyx , chaos or ananke . their roman equivalent were the parcae . sources : d'aulaire 's book of greek myths
