Emphysema     emphysema is a disease of the lungs . it is one of the diseases that make up chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) . this is a set of diseases where the flow of air in the lungs is obstructed . emphysema is most often caused by smoking but can be caused by other diseases or have no known cause at all . it occurs when the very small air sacs ( called the alveoli ) at the ends of the airways in the lungs start to break down from many sacs to form much bigger sacs . the alveoli are the areas of the lung where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged into and out of the blood . emphysema makes it hard for people to blow air out of the lungs because air gets trapped inside the broken alveoli due to the collapse of the walls . emphysema is commonly associated with chronic bronchitis . as it is rather difficult to delineate `` pure '' cases of emphysema or chronic bronchitis they are classed together into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) . other websites . - global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease
