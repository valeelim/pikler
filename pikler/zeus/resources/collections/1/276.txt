Financial capital     financial capital is a form of capital . it is things that have value , but do not do anything by themselves . they are only valuable because people value ( want ) them . for example , money is a form of financial capital . you can not do anything with money but it still has value . financial capital is used to pay for things , this is because there is always more of it and people always want it . this means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people . some forms of financial capital , such as stocks , gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody . however they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital . because of this , these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price . this means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market . some things are treated as financial capital , even though they do have a use . for example , some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it . some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money . other types of capital , such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital . this may be because they involve people . treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification .
