Helicopter     a helicopter ( also often used : chopper or heli ) is a kind of flying machine or aircraft . a helicopter lifts up off of the ground and moves because of its rotors . a rotor is several small wings , called rotor blades , that spin together around a shaft . for that reason , helicopters are sometimes called `` rotary-wing aircraft '' . a helicopter flies differently from an airplane . an airplane must move forward to stay in the air , but because the helicopter 's rotor blades are always moving , the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground . this allows them to land in places where an airplane can not . helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades , which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted . since around 400 bc , the chinese had a flying top that was used as a children 's toy . the flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air . later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick . leonardo da vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490 , and drew pictures of his ideas . it was hundreds of years later ( in the early 20th century ) before anyone built one that could really fly . the first practical helicopters were built by frenchman louis breguet in 1935 and by german henrich focke in 1936. a russian immigrant , igor sikorsky , built and perfected the first practical helicopter in america in 1939 .
