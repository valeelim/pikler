Advance Wars     advance wars is a video game for the game boy advance . it is based on earlier games for nintendo systems such as the famicom and game boy . it is a strategy game : players must think of ways to win . the game can be played with two , three , or four players at a time . each player takes turns controlling their military-style playing pieces , called `` units . '' every unit can move along the playing field , which is split up into squares . the amount of squares a unit can move in one turn is different for each unit . most units can attack other units . each unit has its own strength and defense . strength is how much damage the unit can do to another unit . defense is how much damage it can avoid taking whenever it is attacked . for example , the tank unit has more defense than the soldier , so even though the helicopter always has the same amount of attacking power , it can do more damage to the soldier than the tank .
