Trieste     trieste is a city in the north-east of italy in the region of friuli-venezia giulia . trieste was a roman city that in the middle ages was under the control of the republic of venice . later was under austrian domination until the first years of the xx century , when italian irredentism was very strong in trieste . the austrians tried to erase the italian roots of the population , even promoting the immigration of many slovenes inside the city , but this created a strong support for the irredentism 's ideal of `` union to italy '' from most of the italian speaking inhabitants of trieste . indeed , together with trento , trieste was the main focus of the italian irredentist movement , which aimed for the annexation to italy of all the lands they claimed were inhabited by an italian speaking population . many local italians enrolled voluntarily in the royal italian army during wwi ( a notable example is the writer scipio slataper ) . the population of trieste , practically nearly all italian , promoted this union of the city to italy in 1918 , and since the end of wwi the city has been the capital of the italian region called `` venezia giulia '' .
