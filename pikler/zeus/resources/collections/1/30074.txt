Cowpox     cowpox is a disease . this disease affects the skin . it is caused by a virus ( cowpox virus ) that is related to the `` vaccinia virus '' . people ( or animals ) who have the disease have red blisters . the disease can be spread by touch from cows to humans . the virus that causes cowpox was used to perform the first successful vaccination against another disease . the disease vaccinated against was the deadly smallpox . smallpox is caused by the related `` variola virus '' . therefore , the word `` vaccination '' has the latin root `` vaca '' meaning cow . in 1798 the english physician edward jenner made a curious observation . jenner lived in the countryside , not in the city . some of his patients had gotten cowpox , and recovered from it . he observed that those patients did not get the disease again , they seemed to be immune against it . what was more , they also seemed to be immune against smallpox . smallpox was a deadly disease then , that killed most of the people it infected . so he used the fluid he got from cowpox lesions , and scratched it into healthy people . that way , he could make those people immune against smallpox .
