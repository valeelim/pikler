Chlorine     chlorine ( chemical symbol cl ) is a chemical element . its atomic number ( which is the number of protons in it ) is 17 , and its atomic mass is 35.45. it is part of the 7th column ( halogens ) on the periodic table of elements . chlorine is a very irritating and greenish-yellow gas . it has a strong smell like bleach . it is toxic . it can be made into a liquid when cooled . it is heavier than air . chlorine is highly reactive . it is more reactive than bromine but less reactive than fluorine . it reacts with most things to make chlorides . it can even burn things instead of oxygen . it dissolves in water to make a mixture of hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid . the more acidic it is , the more chlorine is made ; the more basic it is , the more hypochlorous acid ( normally turned into hypochlorite ) and hydrochloric acid ( normally turned into chlorides ) are there . chlorine reacts with bromides and iodides to make bromine and iodine . chlorine exists in several oxidation states : -1 , +1 , +3 , +4 , +5 , and +7 . the -1 state is most often in chloride . chlorides are not reactive . compounds containing chlorine in its +1 oxidation state are hypochlorites . only one is common . they are a strong oxidizing agent , as are all + oxidation state compounds . +3 is in chlorites . +4 is in chlorine dioxide , a common chlorine compound that is not a chloride . +5 is in chlorates . +7 is in perchlorates . hypochlorites are most reactive , while perchlorates are the least reactive .
