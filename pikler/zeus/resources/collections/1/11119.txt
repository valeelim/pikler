Garden gnome     the first garden gnome was created in switzerland . it was later introduced to the united kingdom in 1847 by sir charles isham , when he brought 21 terracotta figures back from a trip to germany and placed them around the gardens of his home at lamport hall in northamptonshire . only one of the original batch of gnomes survives : lampy as he is known , is on display at lamport hall , and is insured for one million pounds . garden gnomes have become a popular accessory in many gardens , but they are not loved by all . they can be the target of pranks . people have been known to `` return to the wild '' these garden gnomes , most notably france 's `` front de liberation des nains de jardins '' and italy 's `` malag '' ( garden gnome liberation front ) . some kidnapped garden gnomes have been sent on trips around the world , being passed from person to person and photographed at different famous landmarks , with the photos being returned to the owner . this practice is featured in the 2001 french film , `` am√©lie '' and in an advertising campaign for travelocity.com . non-conventional gnome statues have also been made , such as a flashing gnome in a raincoat , or a gnome couple in love .
