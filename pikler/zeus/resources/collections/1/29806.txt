Kronos     kronos ( also cronos or cronus ) is a titan in greek mythology . he is the titan of time . his parents are gaia ( the earth ) and uranus ( the sky ) . uranus was very vain and he cast the cyclops and hundred handed ones into tartarus ( a deep pit ) , but gaia wanted all her children to live in peace so she told the titans to kill uranus and she gave them a sharp scythe , which kronos took . while kronos 's brothers held the sky he slashed it open with the scythe and he became lord of the universe , but he had too much of his father in him so he kept his brothers locked in tartarus . with his sister and wife rhea his children are demeter , hades , hera , hestia , poseidon , and zeus . kronos became so angry about his children 's power , and had been warned by gaia , or mother earth , that one of his children would overthrow him . because of this , he decided to eat them so he could obtain their power and stop the risk of the end of his reign . he ate all but zeus because rhea hid baby zeus and gave kronos a rock instead . later , when zeus was grown , he fed kronos a mixture of mustard and wine and made him throw up his children . the reason they all survived in kronos 's stomach was because they were gods and goddesses , they were immortal .
