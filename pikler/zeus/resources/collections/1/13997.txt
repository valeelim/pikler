Tissue     tissues form part of an organ . tissues are groups of cells that work together to do a job in the body . they are a group of cells having the same origin , structure and function . the cells look the same or almost the same . the work the cells do is also the same or almost the same . kinds include muscles , nerves , and connective tissues . organs are made up of more than one kind of tissue . the heart is an organ . it is made up of different tissues . it has muscle tissue called myocardium . it has connective tissue on the inside ( endocardium ) , and on the outside ( pericardium ) . the heart has valves that make sure the blood goes the right way through the heart . so the heart is an organ made from several tissues . the study of the structure of tissues under a microscope is called histology .
