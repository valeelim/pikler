Wombat     a wombat is a marsupial in the family vombatidae . it lives in the australian eucalyptus forests . there are two genera with three living wombat species ; the common wombat and the hairy-nosed wombats . it is a medium-sized animal that makes a burrow by digging holes in the ground . wombats are usually around a metre ( 40 in ) long when they are fully grown . it is a kind of animal known as a marsupial because it has a pouch on its belly that holds its young , although it faces back instead of forward like most marsupials . having the pouch face backwards prevents dirt from building up in the pouch and hitting the offspring in the face when digging . when its young are born they spend some time growing in their mother 's pouch before going into the world . wombats are herbivores . they eat plants , roots , and grasses . they are nocturnal which means they sleep in the day and come out at night . some wombats have thick brown fur and very small ears . they can weigh from 20 to 35 kilograms ( 45 to 80 lb ) . they can live up to 7 years .
