Fossil     a fossil is the remains or trace of an ancient living thing . fossils of animals , plants or protists occur in sedimentary rock . in a typical fossil , the body form is retained , but the original molecules that made up the body have been replaced by some inorganic material , such as calcium carbonate ( caco ) or silica ( sio ) . the fossil feels like , and is , made of rock . it has been mineralised or `` petrified '' ( literally , turned into rock ) . a fossil may also be an `` imprint '' or `` impression '' of a living thing remaining in the fossilised mud of a long-gone age . some organisms fossilise well , others do not . the most common fossils are those left behind by organisms that produce hard materials . the hard , calcitic shells of molluscs ( such as clams and snails ) and of now-rare brachiopods ( also known as lampshells ) are examples . these sea-dwelling shellfish have produced many fossiliferous ( that is , fossil-bearing ) chalky layers of limestone in the earth . soft-bodied organisms can fossilise in special circumstances : the ediacaran biota is a good example .
