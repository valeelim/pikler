Mail     mail is part of the postal system . the postal system is a system where written documents and small to medium packages are sent ( delivered ) to places around the world . anything sent through the postal system is called mail or post . a postal service can be private or public . governments often make rules about private postal delivery systems . since the early 19th century , national postal systems have mostly been controlled entirely by governments . the governments make people pay a fee to send something . this fee is usually in the form of stamps . some governments only let private postal services deliver parcel ( non-mail ) packages . postal systems often do things other than sending letters . in some countries , the postal system is also in charge of telephone and telegraph systems . the postal systems in other countries can help people apply for government papers such as passports and driver 's licenses . many places the post offices also work like banks . this is so that people can take out money or pay bills at a nearby post office , instead of travelling to a big bank in the nearest town .
