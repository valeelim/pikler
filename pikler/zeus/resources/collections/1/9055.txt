Closed source     closed source ( or proprietary software ) means computer programs whose source code is not published . the source code is not shared with the public for anyone to look at or change . closed source is the opposite of open source . most companies who sell their software for money make it closed source so people can not easily change it or copy it for free . even some who give their software for free do not show the source code , because they think it looks bad , or that somebody will change the authors ' names to their own ( a kind of plagiarism ) without making the program better . some programs called “ freeware ” are given away for free , but they are not the same as free software that anyone can do whatever they want with .
