UNIX     unix , often spelled `` unix '' when the product trademark is not important , is a multi-user multi-processing operating system . it was developed beginning in 1969 at bell labs . it was created by ken thompson , dennis ritchie , douglas mcilroy , and others , using the newly invented c programming language . the unix operating system is a multiuser and multiprocessing system - this lets it run several applications at one time , and support a large number of users at the same time . it also is network oriented ; which means that it is able to operate well in a network of computers . security is also emphasized in unix , because many people can have access to it , both by using it directly or over a network . many ideas found in unix were new . other operating systems copied them . today , there are many operating systems that have some of the ideas of unix in them . for this reason , some people talk about a `` unix philosophy '' of doing things . one of these systems with many of the unix ideas in it , is called linux . linux does not use code from unix , it only shares some of the ideas and the names of commands . therefore , linux is not a unix operating system . instead it is called `` unix-like '' .
