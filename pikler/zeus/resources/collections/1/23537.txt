Atacama Desert     the atacama desert is a desert . it is on the tropic of capricorn in northern chile , and is one of the driest places on earth . in some places less than an inch ( 25mm ) of rain falls every ten years . only one of the rivers from the andes mountains reaches the ocean through the desert . the rest disappear into the dry soil . the atacama is a desert not because mountains make a rain shadow , but because the ocean does . the water on the west part of chile is quite cold , because it came from antarctica . moisture can not stay in the cold air above the cold water , so mainly fog reaches the land , but very little rain . the people of chile have learned how to get water from the fog to help them live . they `` harvest '' the clouds by putting up plastic sheets with pans underneath . the fog collects on the plastic and drips into the pans , giving the people water for crops and drinking . in parts of this desert it has not rained for over 400 years . even though the atacama is the driest place in the world that does not mean it is the hottest . the atacama desert is actually a really cold place with temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees .
