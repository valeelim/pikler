Sign     a sign is something you see ( or hear ) which means something . a sign may be natural or man-made . a natural sign shows something significant . leaves turn brown and fall off deciduous trees in the autumn . temperatures drop , daylight hours shorten . it suggests winter is coming . many birds migrate and some mammals hibernate in response to natural signs like these . humans , as usual , are a bit different . they make their own signs . a man-made sign is called a signal or symbol . it is an artificial thing , which people decide means something in their society . for example , the stop sign on the road tells the person that they must stop their car there . so does a red traffic light . they are signals with a legal meaning , and people learn what these meanings are . sometimes a person may not know what a sign means . feeling a cold wind could be a sign that someone left a door or window open . in medicine , a sign is something seen , whereas a symptom is something felt , like a pain . a sign might be something like high blood pressure , which can be measured .
