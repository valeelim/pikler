Antigen     an antigen is a protein expressed by a bacteria or virus that is recognized by the adaptive immune system as foreign which can stimulate the production of antibodies and combine specifically with them . usually an antigen is a molecule , perhaps on the cell surface of a bacterium or virus . antigens are always 'foreign ' and trigger an attack . the system is normally tolerant of its own molecules , which do n't start an attack . autoimmune diseases are caused when this safeguard fails . when an antigen is introduced into the body it causes the production of antibodies . antigens include bacteria , cells of transplanted organs , plant pollen and toxins . antigens `` stimulate '' the production of antibodies : they do not produce them directly . the first time that a new antigen comes into contact with the body the response of the immune system will be a complete immune response . during this first response , the antigen will cause antibodies to be made . the next time the same antigen contacts the body , a full-scale immune response is not needed as the body already has a specific antibody available instantly for that antigen .
