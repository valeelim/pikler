Georgian Uprising of Texel     the georgian uprising of texel ( 5 april 1945 – 20 may 1945 ) was an insurrection ( a rebellion , or mutiny , when soldiers disobey their orders ) by soviet georgian soldiers on the island of texel . the uprising was against the germans army who had taken over the dutch island during the second world war . the event is sometimes described as `` europe 's last battlefield '' . the island was very important in the german atlantic wall – the line of defences along the atlantic coast . it was strong and had many defences . the georgians were soldiers from the soviet republic of georgia who had been captured ( taken prisoner ) on the eastern front . they were now fighting for the germans so that they did not have to stay in camps for prisoners . their job was to help the german troops . on the night of 5–6 april 1945 they thought that the allies would land soon . they took over the island and killed 400 german soldiers . some parts of the island stayed under german control and the georgian soldiers could not capture them . more germans were able to come to the island to help defeat the georgians . after a few weeks of very tough fighting the germans took control of the island again .
