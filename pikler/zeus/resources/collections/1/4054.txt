Promise     when a person agrees to do something or to `` not '' do something , that person is making a promise . a promise can be made ( by saying it ) , or it can be written down as a contract . `` breaking '' a promise , or not keeping it , is often just bad manners , but it can sometimes be illegal , such as when a contract is not kept . a vow is a special promise . it is mostly used in a religious sense or in ceremonies such as marriages when the couple who are being married make their `` marriage vows '' , promising to be faithful to one another . an oath is a promise in the legal sense . when someone has to give evidence in a court of law they `` swear an oath '' . this means that they promise they will tell the truth .
