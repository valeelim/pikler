Ultraviolet     ultraviolet is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum shown on the left side of the picture below as black—because humans can not see light of such short wavelength ( or high frequency ) . many animals such as some insects , some reptiles , crocodiles , salamanders , and small birds can see things that this light . uv is a common abbreviation of ultraviolet , mainly used in technical contexts . ultraviolet is beyond the visible violet light in terms of frequency , wavelength , and energy . its wavelengths are between about 10 nanometers ( nm ) about 400 nanometers . frequency and wavelength are closely related . the equation that shows this relationship is : ν = c/λ . saying that something has a short wavelength is the same as saying that it has a high frequency . ultraviolet light is a type of ionizing radiation . it can damage or kill cells . any electromagnetic radiation ( light ) that has a wavelength shorter than 450 nm may cause trouble . therefore humans that live in places with more ultraviolet light have adapted by getting darker skins . pigments absorb the ultraviolet radiation , so it does not get through the skin to kill or injure cells inside . injury to the skin by ultraviolet is called `` sunburn .
