Ancient Australia     ancient australia ( also called the prehistory of australia ) , covers the time from when the first humans came to australia to the arrival of the first fleet in 1788. aboriginal artefacts on rottnest island have been dated from 6,500 to more than 30,000 years ago . however , more recent evidence suggests human occupation by or even before 50,000 years ago . during the pleistocene period , sea levels were much lower than they are today . this would have made migration from asia to australia much easier than it is now . however several long sea crossings would still have had to be made . these crossings would have included distances of 90100 km of open sea . it is not known what kind of boat would have been used for these crossings , but they were probably a raft made from bamboo . these first australians were the world 's first ocean travellers . the land bridge between australia and new guinea was blocked by rising sea levels about 8,000 years ago . the people of australia and new guinea are closely related by dna . dna evidence shows that the australian aborigines belong to the modern humans who left africa between 50,000 and 70,000 years ago . research shows that the australian aborigines were part of a group that left africa 24,000 years before the groups that settled in europe and asia . this makes them one of the oldest indigenous peoples outside africa . the dna also shows that most migration to australia stopped about 50,000 years ago , and the people here developed in isolation to the rest of the world . the australian aboriginal population is one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world . many aboriginal stories from northern australia say that the people came to australia from across the sea .
