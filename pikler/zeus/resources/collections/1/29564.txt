Charon (moon)    charon ( moon ) charon is a moon of the dwarf planet pluto . it is half as wide as pluto and is much like the dwarf planet itself . it was discovered many years after pluto . it is named after charon in greek mythology , a boatman who would carry the souls of dead people across the river acheron to the underworld . charon was found by astronomer james christy on june 22 , 1978 , when he was looking at highly blown up picture of pluto on a photographic plate that taken a couple of months before . christy noticed that a slight bulge was able to be seen every now and then . this finding was made public on july 7 , 1978. later , the bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to april 29 , 1965. later observations of pluto were able to figure out that the bulge was due to a smaller body . the orbit of the bulge fit in with pluto 's rotation period , which was already known from pluto 's light curve . any final doubts were erased when pluto and charon entered a five-year period of mutual eclipses between 1985 and 1990. this happens when the pluto-charon orbital plane is edge-on as seen from earth , which only happens at twice in pluto 's 248-year orbital period . it was very lucky that one of these intervals happened to occur so soon after charon 's discovery .
