Heat     heat is the opposite of cold . in thermodynamics , heat means energy which is moved between two things when one of them is hotter than the other . adding heat to something increases its temperature , but heat is not the same as temperature . the temperature of an object is a measure of the average speed of the moving particles in it . the energy of the particles is called the internal energy . when an object is heated , its internal energy can increase to make the object hotter . the first law of thermodynamics says that the increase in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done on the surroundings . thermal energy is the type of energy that a thing has because of its temperature . in thermodynamics , thermal energy is the internal energy present in a system in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium because of its temperature . that is , heat is defined as a spontaneous `` flow of energy '' ( energy in transit ) from one object to another , caused by a difference in temperature between two objects ; so objects do not possess heat .
