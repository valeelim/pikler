Cold     cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm ( opposite of cold ) . because it is relative , there is no range in coldness . the temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold . cold is the opposite of hot . the coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °c , which can be expressed as about -459.67 °f on the fahrenheit scale . this is called absolute zero . absolute zero is also 0 k on the kelvin scale and 0 °r on the rankine scale cooling is when an object gets cold , or lowers in temperature . this can happen by taking away heat , or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature . fluids used to cool objects are called coolants . air cooling making the temperature of an object lower using air . this will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object . the process will work better if there is more surface area on the object or if the item 's mass can be made smaller . other ways to cool objects include using ice , dry ice , or liquid nitrogen . this works by convection ; the heat is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant .
