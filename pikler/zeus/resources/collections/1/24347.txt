Flammability     flammability or inflammability means that something can be set on fire easily . it will burn easily . the words come from latin . the word at the base is `` in-flammare '' ( late latin ) . it means something like `` to put fire to a thing '' . `` inflammable '' and `` flammable '' are used to mean the same thing . people sometimes get confused and think that `` inflammable '' means `` not flammable '' because the prefix `` in '' is often used to mean `` not '' . for example , something that is inhuman is not human . since many people do not know that `` inflammable '' means `` burns easily '' , `` flammable '' is used more often in public places as a warning . flammability can be tested . paper , for example , is more flammable than wood , and less flammable natural gas .
