Social capital     social capital is the willingness of people to help each other . it often replaces money which people would use to buy the same help . society works best when there is plenty of social capital . the less social capital there is , the more social problems there usually are . if there is no social capital , war and revolution often results . people who have no money and can not get help from society may have to agree to do things they do not want to do , or force others to do things they do not want to . organized crime grows in this way , and so do forced labour and slavery . most ways of measuring social capital have to do with trust - people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more . those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help . a social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping . some call this kind of person a social parasite . they are very hard to detect , unlike people who cheat or commit fraud . when there are too many of these kinds of people , especially when they are politicians , people begin to their government . rather than work with a political party to change law , they may start to look for direct revenge for things .
