Money     money is what people use to buy things and services . money is what many people take for selling their own things or services . there are many kinds of money in the world . most countries have their own kind of money , such as the united states dollar or the british pound . money is also called many other names , like currency or cash . most of the time a state or a government prints paper money and makes coins at a mint . the idea of bartering things is very old . a long time ago , people did not buy or sell with money . instead , they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed . one person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much wheat . each would trade a little of what he had with the other . this would support the people on his farm . other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable . this gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices . when people changed from trading in things like cows and wheat to using money instead , they needed things that would last a long time . they must still have a known value , and could be carried around . the first country in the world to make metal coins was called lydia . these first appeared during the 7th century bc , in the western part of what is now turkey . the lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion . this idea soon spread to greece , the rest of the mediterranean , and the rest of the world . coins were all made to the same size and shape . in some parts of the world , different things have been used as money , like clam shells or blocks of salt .
