Baguette     baguettes are long thin of bread popular in france , and other french-speaking countries . baguettes are common in europe . usually , they are made of white bread . baguettes usually have a hard crust on the outside but soft white bread on the inside . french traditions say that bread may only contain the following four things : flour , water , yeast and salt . anything containing more than those things must not be called bread . a baguette is about 5-6 cm wide , 3 to 4 cm high , and about 65 cm long . such a baguette usually weighs about 250 grams . it is common to dip the bread into olive oil when it is eaten . the baguette is thought as to have come from france , but it actually came from vienna . in the middle of the nineteenth century , steam ovens had just been brought into use . this allowed loaves to be made with a crispy crust and the white centre , similar to today 's baguettes . later , in 1920 , a law was passed that did not let bakers work before 4am . this made it impossible to make a larger loaf in time for their customers ' breakfasts . the longer , thinner baguette helped solve this problem because it could be prepared and baked much faster . however , since the french had been making long thin loaves for a long time , what exactly was invented in 1920 ? it seems to be just the use of the word `` baguette '' for those thin loaves .
