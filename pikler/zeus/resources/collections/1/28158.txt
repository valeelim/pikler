Addiction     addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right . when you have addiction to something it is called being `` addicted '' or being an `` addict '' . people can be addicted to drugs , cigarettes , alcohol , caffeine , and many other things . when somebody is addicted to something , they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to . but taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health . some people who are addicts need to go to a doctor or hospital to cure the addiction , so they no longer crave ( want or need ) the drug . addiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body . the blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain , and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it ; then they want more of that substance . this takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine ; but all of them control the consumer . once under this control , the consumer does not have a completely free will , and listens to the addiction 's bidding .
