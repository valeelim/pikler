Electronics     electronics is the study of how to control the flow of electrons . it deals with circuits made up of components that control the flow of electricity . electronics is a part of physics and electrical engineering . electrical components like transistors and relays can act as switches . this lets us use electrical circuits to process information and transmit information across long distances . circuits can also take a weak signal ( like a whisper ) and amplify it ( make it louder ) . most electronic systems fall into two categories : - processing and distribution of information . these are called communications systems . - conversion and distribution of energy . these are called control systems . one way of looking at an electronic system is to separate it into three parts : 1. inputs - electrical or mechanical sensors , which take signals from the physical world ( in the form of temperature , pressure , etc . ) and convert them into electric current and voltage signals . 1. signal processing circuits - these consist of electronic components connected together to manipulate , interpret and transform the information contained in the signals .
