Hydrocarbon     a hydrocarbon is a type of chemical compound . it is made of only hydrogen and carbon atoms . they can be found in crude oil and are separated by fractional distillation ( which means they are separated into different groups ) . the hydrogen and carbon are bonded with non-polar covalent bonds . because of its lack of polar covalent bonds , hydrocarbons can not create hydrogen bonds with water and are hydrophobic . hydrocarbons are grouped into `` families '' or `` homologous series '' . there are five main families . the hydrocarbons in each family have a general formula and similar chemical properties , and similar trends in physical properties . this system was approved in 1892 by the international congress of chemists , meeting in geneva . alkanes are the simplest hydrocarbons . their general formula is ch . alkenes are similar to alkanes . the main difference between them is that alkenes have a carbon to carbon double bond . the general formula for the alkenes is ch . note that there is no `` methene '' . methene is not possible as alkenes require a carbon-carbon double bond and methane only has one carbon atom .
