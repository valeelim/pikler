1973 oil crisis     the 1973 oil crisis started on october 17 , 1973. when the members of organization of arab petroleum exporting countries ( oapec ) said , because of the yom kippur war , that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations that had supported israel in its conflict with syria and egypt ( the united states , its allies in western europe , and japan ) . the embargo was lifted in march of 1974. about the same time , opec members agreed to raise world oil prices , after attempts at negotiation with the `` seven sisters '' oil company earlier in the month failed . due to the dependence of the industrialized world on crude oil and the role of opec as a major supplier , these price increases hurt the economies of the targeted countries , while at the same time limiting economic activity . the targeted countries responded with new , and mostly permanent , attempts to limit any more dependency . during this time , many other problems arose . these problems badly affected the economy of the world . the problems continued even after 10 years until the early 1980s . the higher oil prices continued until 1986. japan did well soon after the 1973 oil crisis . for example , japanese companies started manufacturing automobiles that used less oil to run . soon many other automobile companies in different countries also started to manufacture automobiles that used less oil to run . the japanese also began focusing on producing electronics such as transistor radios and televisions . this production is what helped the japanese economy to bounce back after the shock of the oil crisis .
