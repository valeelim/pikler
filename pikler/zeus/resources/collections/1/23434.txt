Pyongyang     pyŏngyang ( 평양 직할시 in hangul , 平壤直轄市 in hanja ) is the capital and biggest city in the democratic people 's republic of korea or dprk ( north korea ) . the government does not want people to know anything so pyongyang is one of the few places in north korea that foreigners ( people from other countries ) can travel to . pyongyang is a closed city meaning that north koreans ca n't just go there . they must apply for a permit or be high up in the military . it is the most advanced city in the country which allows tourists to go there . pyongyang does not really show what north korea is really like as the government uses it to give the illusion to tourists that the country is not poor . the city is kept very clean and littering is strictly not allowed . the city is home to the dprk 's only fast food restaurant which only the most privileged north koreans go to ( a meal would be worth around a weeks wages for the average person there ) . many shops there have plastic food on display in the windows to make tourists think that there is lots of food in the country when in fact , food is scarce .
