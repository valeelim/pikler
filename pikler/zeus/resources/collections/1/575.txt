Open content     open content is when someone creates something and lets others copy it or change it without having to ask for permission . any media can be open content , from text and pictures to video and sound . when someone creates something ( like a picture or book ) , they can make that work `` open '' . this means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want . something that is open content may be free of charge , but it does not have to be . the simple english wikipedia is open content . so are other wikipedias . if a person changes open content or makes new open content , everyone can give it to anyone else , or even sell it . it is never needed to ask permission to do this , because the people who wrote the text already gave their permission when they clicked the save button . the rules that say how people can use , change and pass around open content are called a license . a license explains exactly what you are allowed to do with the content that falls under it . licenses are often written in difficult lawyer language ( legal jargon ) , but many licenses have summaries that are much easier to understand .
