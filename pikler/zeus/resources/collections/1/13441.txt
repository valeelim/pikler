Dualism     dualism is the idea or theory that something ( an object , an idea or the whole world ) is split into two parts . these parts are separate from each other , and the thing can not be divided up in any other way . the idea or theory that something can not be split into any parts is called monism . the idea that something can be split into many parts is called pluralism . in philosophy there are many kinds of dualism . - in the philosophy of mind dualism means that the mind and the body are two very different things . nothing that is part of the body can be part of the mind and nothing that is part of the mind can be part of the body . people like this sort of dualism because they think that the mind is too important or too strange to be part of the body . another idea is that the mind and body are the same thing or that mind is just another word for the brain . ( see also ren√© descartes ) - in epistemology , dualism means that there is a barrier between a person and the world around them . this barrier splits the world into two for that person , into 'myself ' and 'the world ' . each person can see , hear , taste , smell and touch the world but can not know it directly . for example somebody can not know just by looking that things are made up of many atoms . this means that something could happen in the world that we would not know about because we could not see , hear , taste , smell or touch it . a non-dualist idea is that a person is just another part of the world and that there is no barrier . for example it could be said that if somebody can not see , hear , taste , touch or smell something then it does not affect them .
