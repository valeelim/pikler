Reward     a reward is getting something good for doing a given task . it needs someone who has the power to give the good thing . it is the opposite of punishment . ideas like risk and reward , reward and punishment are based on the idea that people do things , or avoid doing things , to get rewards . in psychology there is another idea that this is not true . this other idea says that training ( conditioning ) and emotions ( affective factors ) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others . in trying to catch criminals and other bad people , the government often offers money to people . this money is given to people who may capture the criminal , or give information that helps the police catch them . for example after the eureka stockade rebellion in ballarat , victoria in 1854 , the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it . in 2001 , the us government offered a big reward of 2.5 million dollars for help in capturing the person who had sent anthrax in letters to a newspaper journalist and 2 senators . anthrax is a disease which can kill people .
