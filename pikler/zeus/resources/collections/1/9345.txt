Electric charge     electric charge is a basic property of electrons , protons and other subatomic particles . electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged . things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on ( attract ) each other . this makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms . things that have the same charge push each other away ( they `` repel '' each other ) . this is called the `` law of charges '' . it was discovered by charles augustin de coulomb . the law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called coulomb 's law . things that have equal numbers of electrons and protons are `` neutral '' . things that have more electrons than protons are negatively charged , while things with fewer electrons than protons are positively charged . things with the same charge repel each other . things that have different charges attract each other . if possible , the one with too many electrons will give enough electrons to match the number of protons in the one that has too many protons for its load of electrons . if there are just enough electrons to match the extra protons , then the two things will not attract each other anymore . when electrons move from a place where there are too many to a place where there are too few , that is called an electrical current .
