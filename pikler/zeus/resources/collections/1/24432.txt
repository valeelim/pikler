Charles Richter     charles francis richter ( april 26 , 1900 â€“ september 30 , 1985 ) was an american seismologist ( someone who studies earthquakes ) and a physicist . he is known for creating the richter scale of magnitude , which says how big an earthquak . richter went to work at the carnegie institute in 1927 after robert millikan offered him a position as a research assistant there , where he began a collaboration with beno gutenberg . the seismology lab at the california institute of technology wanted to begin publishing regular reports on earthquakes in southern california and had a pressing need for a system of measuring the strength of earthquakes for these reports . together , richter and gutenberg devised the scale that would become known at the richter scale to fill this need , based on measuring quantitatively the displacement of the earth by seismic waves , as kiyoo wadati had suggested .
