Mass     the mass of an object is a measure of an object 's resistance to acceleration , sometimes also called `` inertia '' . a mountain has typically more mass than a rock , for instance . mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of weight . a large mass like the earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away . `` mass attraction '' is another word for gravity , a force that exists between all matter . the unit of mass in the international system of units is the kilogram , which is represented by the symbol 'kg ' . fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram ( one thousandth of a kg , symbol 'g ' ) and the tonne ( one thousand kg ) , amongst many others . in some fields or applications , it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings . for instance , - atomic physicists deal with the tiny masses of individual atoms and measure them in atomic mass units . - jewelers normally work with small jewels and precious stones where masses are traditionally measured in carats , which correspond to 200 mg or 0.2 g .
