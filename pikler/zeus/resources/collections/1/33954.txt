Microcode     microcode is the name for a number of instructions or data structures which are involved in implementing higher-level machine language in many processors , especially microprogrammed ones . microcode is on memory that is very fast to access . when a machine level instruction needs to be executed , microcode tells the processor what electronic circuits should be used . when a new processor is designed , an engineer also writes the microcode for the instructions of machine language . this is called microprogramming , the resulting code is called a microprogram . in early processors , each instruction was hard-wired . this has several drawbacks , the most obvious is that correcting an error in processor design means that the processor needs to be replaced . a processor should add two values , which are in registers a and b . 1. configure the alu for addition 1. put the value of register a on one input of the alu 1. put the value of register b on one input of the alu 1. after waiting a short time , to allow for the addition , the result needs to be copied into a register , which has not been used yet
