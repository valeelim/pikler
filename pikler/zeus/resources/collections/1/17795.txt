United States Congress     the united states congress is the legislative , or law making , branch of the united states government . it meets in the united states capitol . it has two houses ( parts ) : the united states house of representatives and the united states senate . this two house system is known as a bicameral ( `` bi '' is the latin word for `` two '' , and `` camera '' is latin for `` chamber '' or `` room '' ) legislature . there are 435 representatives in congress , split between the states based on how many people live in the state . there are 100 senators in congress , with two coming from each state . the primary duty of congress is to write , debate , and pass bills ( laws they want ) . for congress to pass a bill , both houses must pass exactly the same bill . for each house to pass a bill , more than half of its members must vote in favor of passing the bill . after both houses pass the same bill , this bill is then sent to the president . if the president agrees the bill should be a law he or she signs the bill within 10 days . if the president does not agree , then he or she can veto the bill and send it back to congress . if the bill is neither signed nor vetoed by the president within 10 days , the bill becomes law anyway if congress does not adjourn ( end its session ) within that time . if congress adjourns within that time , the bill does not become a law . congress may override a president 's veto of a bill by having more than two thirds of its members passing the bill . in that case , the bill becomes law even though the president vetoed it .
