Canary Islands     the canary islands are a group of islands off the coast of morocco . they are an autonomous community of spain ( they make their own laws ) . there are seven main islands . the people who live there speak spanish . the autonomous community has two capital cities , of equal status : santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria . like the other islands of macaronesia , they were created by volcanoes on the bottom of the sea . those volcanoes slowly rose above the water and became islands . this process lasted many thousands of years . the islands have a very long and interesting history . when europeans first came to the canary islands , they found people already living there . these people were called the guanches . many of the guanches were killed in 15th century battles with the spanish , and the ones who remained adopted the spanish way of life . after the spanish conquest many battles were also fought against pirates . most recently morocco was interested in them . after the spanish conquest many europeans settled there . portuguese and spaniards , and also belgians and maltese were among the early settlers . recently many people from all over europe , america , india and africa have also become citizens or permanent residents .
