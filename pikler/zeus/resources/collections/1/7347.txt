Binary number     the binary numeral system is a way to write numbers using only two digits : 0 and 1. these are used in computers as a series of `` off '' and `` on '' switches . in binary , each digit 's place value is twice as much as that of the next digit to the right ( since each digit holds two values ) . in decimal - the system that humans normally use - each digit holds ten values , and the place value increases by a power of ten ( ones , tens , hundreds , etc. ) . the place value of the rightmost digit in either case is 1. example : 10110011 - the place value of the last 1 ( rightmost position ) is 1 . - the place value of the 1 before that is 2 . - the place value of the 0 before that is 4 . - the place value of the 0 before that is 8 . - the place value of the 1 before that is 16 . - the place value of the 1 before that is 32 . - the place value of the 0 before that is 64 . - the place value of the 1 before that is 128. adding together all the place values that have 1s , it would be 1+2+16+32+128 = 179. for convenience , binary digits ( bits , for short ) are usually grouped together in two groups of 4 bits . this is 8 bits , or a byte , and is written using the hexadecimal numeral system . this would be shown as 1011 0011 = b3 .
