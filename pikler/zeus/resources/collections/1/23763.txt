Seaweed     seaweed is a term used for several forms of multicellular marine algae . red algae , green algae and brown algae are commonly considered to be seaweed . seaweed gets its energy from photosynthesis just as plants do . two specific environmental requirements dominate seaweed ecology . these are the presence of seawater ( or at least brackish water ) and the presence of enough light for photosynthesis . often , a firm attachment point is also needed . for this reason , seaweeds can be found in the littoral zone of the sea . within that zone , they are more frequent on a rocky shore , than on sand . another common requirement is a firm attachment point . as a result , seaweeds most commonly inhabit the littoral zone and within that zone more frequently on rocky shores than on sand or shingle . seaweeds occupy a wide range of ecological niches . the highest elevation is only wetted by the tops of sea spray , the lowest is several meters deep . in some areas , littoral seaweeds can extend several miles out to sea . the limiting factor in such cases is sunlight availability . the deepest living seaweeds are the various kelps .
