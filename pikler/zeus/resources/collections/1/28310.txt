Standard Model     the standard model ( sm ) of physics is a theory of the elementary particles , which are either fermions or bosons . it also explains three of the four basic forces of nature . the four fundamental forces are : gravity , electromagnetism , the weak force , and the strong force . gravity is the one the model does not explain . the model uses the parts of physics called quantum mechanics and special relativity , and the ideas of physical field and symmetry breaking . some of the mathematics of the sm is group theory , and also as equations which have biggest and smallest points , called lagrangians and hamiltonians . fermions are particles that join together to make up all `` matter '' we see . examples of groups of fermions are the proton and the neutron . fermions have properties , such as charge and mass , which can be seen in everyday life . they also have other properties , such as spin , weak charge , hypercharge , and color charge , whose effects do not usually appear in everyday life . these properties are given numbers called quantum numbers .
