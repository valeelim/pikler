Plant     plants are one of five big groups ( kingdoms ) of living things . they are autotrophic eukaryotes , which means they have complex cells , and make their own food . usually they can not move ( not counting growth ) . plants include familiar types such as trees , herbs , bushes , grasses , vines , ferns , mosses , and green algae . the scientific study of plants , known as botany , has identified about 350,000 extant ( living ) species of plants . fungi and non-green algae are not classified as plants . most plants grow in the ground , with stems above the atmosphere , and roots below . some float on water . water and some nutrients come from the roots . then climb the stem and reach the leaves . the evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant . this is called transpiration . a plant needs sunlight , carbon dioxide , minerals and water to make food by photosynthesis . a green substance in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the sun needed to make food . chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves , inside plastids , which are inside the leaf cells . the leaf can be thought of as a food factory . leaves of plants vary in shape and size , but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy . once the food is made in the leaf , it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots .
