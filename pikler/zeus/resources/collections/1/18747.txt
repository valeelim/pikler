Ladino language     ladino ( also called judeo-spanish ) is a jewish language that is very close to the spanish language from which it originates . it has many old spanish words and hebrew words . during the middle ages , many jews lived in spain . these jews were called sephardic jews or `` sephardim '' ( in hebrew ) . they were forced to leave spain after the country was taken over by christians , and they brought this old spanish with them to the countries they ran away to . today some sephardic jews still speak ladino in israel , turkey , bulgaria , the united states , and other countries . like many other jewish languages , ladino , which as an endangered language , is in danger of language death and thus could become an extinct language . most native speakers are old , because many of them who emigrated to israel , did not pass on the language to their children or grandchildren . in some sephardic jewish communities in latin america and elsewhere , there is a threat of dialect levelling , meaning extinction by assimilation into modern spanish .
