Computer engineering     computer engineering is the practice of making computers and their parts . computer engineers are always trying to make new parts smaller and better . they can also work on software , especially software for embedded systems ( specialized electronics like cell-phones and satellite receivers , not a general-purpose computer ) . computers are electrical machines that run programs . so computer engineering has parts of both electrical engineering and computer science/software engineering . in computer engineering classes , students learn about the hardware and software of computers . this starts with learning how transistors and computer chips are made and how they work ( which uses quantum mechanics ) . then the student learns how the chips talk to each other and how to make a complete printed circuit board ( pcb ) . this is the electrical part . they also learn how to program the rom or flash memory so the computer can do something useful . because computer engineering is closely related to electrical engineering and computer science , the fields are found in the same department at many universities . students also need to learn fundamental science subjects and mathematics , such as calculus and differential equations .
