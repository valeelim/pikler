Auction     an auction is a place where people can buy or sell things . people say how much they will pay for something and the person who is willing to pay the most gets the item . the amount people will pay is called a bid . the person in charge of the auction is the auctioneer . he or she usually has a hammer , which they will knock when a bid is accepted . some auctions only let you place one bid . some let you change your bid if someone else bids higher . there is also another kind called a dutch auction . in a dutch auction , the auctioneer starts off with a price that is much too high and then makes it lower until somebody makes a bid . that person will then buy the item . recently , people have also started to do auctions online . the most popular online auction place is ebay . a common prank is to fake bid , where a person bids an amount and they do not actually pay it . this usually happens when people bid simply to force others to bid higher , forcing them to lose more money in the process . occasionally , the fake bidder is actually the highest bidder at which point they will promptly leave . although generally frowned upon , fake biding is not thought to be illegall in many countries ; however , legal action may be pursued against the fake bidder .
