Engine     an engine , or motor , is a machine used to change energy into movement that can be used . the energy can be in any form . common forms of energy used in engines are electricity , chemical ( such as petrol or diesel ) or heat . when a chemical is used to produce energy it is known as `` fuel '' . the difference of `` engine '' and `` motor '' is that an engine creates mechanical energy from heat , while motor creates mechanical energy from other kinds of energy , like electricity . typical `` engines '' are steam engine and internal combustion engine , while typical `` motors '' are electric motor and hydraulic motor . `` engine '' was originally a term for any mechanical device that converts force into motion . hence , pre-industrial weapons such as catapults , trebuchets and battering rams were called `` siege engines '' . the word `` gin , '' as in `` cotton gin '' , is short for `` engine . '' the word derives from old french '' engin '' , from the latin '' ingenium '' , which is also the root of the word '' ingenious '' . most mechanical devices invented during the industrial revolution were described as enginesâ€”the steam engine being a notable example .
