Chromosome     the chromosomes of a cell are in the cell nucleus . they carry the genetic information . chromosomes are made up of dna and protein combined as chromatin . each chromosome contains many genes . chromosomes come in pairs : one set from the mother ; the other set from the father . cytologists label chromosomes with numbers . chromosomes are present in every cell nucleus with very few and special exceptions . this means they are found in all eukaryotes , since only eukaryotes have cell nuclei . when eukaryote cells divide , the chromosomes also divide . when a somatic ( body ) cell ( such as a muscle cell ) divides , the process is called mitosis . before mitosis , the cell copies all the chromosomes and then it can divide . when they duplicate , chromosomes look like the letter `` x '' . when they are doubled , the two halves are called chromatids ( see diagram ) . the chromatids are joined at the centromere . there are 46 chromosomes in a human , 23 pairs . everyone has a set of chromosomes from their father and a matching set from their mother . they include a pair of sex chromosomes . the mother 's eggs always contain an x chromosome , while the father 's sperm contains either a y chromosome or an x chromosome . that determines the sex of the child . to produce sex cells ( gametes ) , the stem cells go through a different division process called meiosis . this reduces the 23 pairs ( diploid ) to 23 singles ( haploid ) . these , when combined by fertilisation , produce the new set of 23 pairs .
