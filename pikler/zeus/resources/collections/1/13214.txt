Animation     animation is a way of making a movie from many still images . the images are put together one after another , and then played at a fast speed to give the illusion of movement . animation is a relatively new art form , and though the concept of moving images has been a theme throughout ancient civilizations , it was not until late into the 19th century that experimental animation truly began . today , the industry of animation is booming , making up a huge commercial enterprise . however , among individual artists , it remains a sacred and unique form of art . a person who makes animations is called an `` animator . '' there are three ways to animate : 1. draw each frame 1. use stop-motion : make a model scene and change it to create a new image ( frame ) 1. make computer graphics because it is expensive to make , most animation comes from professional companies . however , independent animators have existed since the 1950s in america , with many of those people entering the professional industry . in europe , the independent movement has existed since the 1910s , with animators like pre-revolutionary russia 's ladislas starevich and germany 's lotte reiniger .
