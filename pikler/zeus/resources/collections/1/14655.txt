Inflation     inflation means that the general level of prices is going up , the opposite of deflation . more money will need to be paid for goods ( like a loaf of bread ) and services ( like getting a haircut at the hairdresser 's ) . economists measure inflation regularly to know an economy 's state . inflation changes the ratio of money towards goods or services ; more money is needed to get the same amount of a good or service , or the same amount of money will get a lower amount of a good or service . economists defined certain customer baskets to be able to measure inflation . there can be positive and negative effects of inflation . when the total money in an economy ( the money supply ) increases too rapidly , the quality of the money ( the currency value ) often decreases . economists generally think that this money supply increase ( monetary inflation ) causes the goods/services price increase ( price inflation ) over a longer period . they disagree on causes over a shorter period . the demand-pull inflation theory can be said simply as `` too much money chasing too few goods . '' in other words , if the will of buying goods is growing faster than amount of goods that have been made , then prices will go up . this most likely happens in economies that are growing fast .
