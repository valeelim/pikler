Computer programming     programming is telling a computer how to do certain things by giving it instructions . these instructions are called programs . a person who writes instructions is a computer programmer . these instructions come in different languages ; they are called programming languages . sometimes programmers use special software , such as ides , which have many features to help them to make programs , and sometimes they use simpler software , called a text editor , which only gives them a place to type . there are many types of programming languages . writing these instructions directly in `` machine code '' is tedious and difficult , so instructions are written in a language easier for people to use , which the computer converts into `` computer form '' instructions so the computer can follow them . the simplest of these are assembly languages . programs written in a language more like english is converted by a compiler . some languages , called interpreted languages , use interpreters instead of assemblers or compilers .
