Wall of Voodoo     wall of voodoo is a rock band from the united states . the band was from los angeles , california . the band 's music style was punk and new wave . their most famous song was `` mexican radio '' . the band 's genesis was in a hollywood company called `` acme soundtracks '' , a commercially unsuccessful venture founded in 1977 in hollywood by songwriter stan ridgway . ridgway 's intent for the company was to provide soundtrack music for independently produced low-budget horror films ; unfortunately , they found few takers for their services . instead , acme soundtracks evolved into a band that played live shows , as ridgway ( vocals , harmonica , keyboards ) enlisted marc moreland ( guitar ) followed by marc 's brother bruce moreland ( bass ) , chas t. gray ( keyboards ) , and joe nanini ( percussion ) to the line-up . the band was named wall of voodoo by ridgway before their first gig in reference to a comment made while recording and overdubbing a kalamazoo rhythm ace drum machine , a gift to ridgway by writer and iconic voice over artist daws butler , partner to stan freberg , voice of yogi bear and many other hanna-barbera characters . when someone jokingly compared the multiple drum machine and farfisa organ laden recordings to phil spector 's wall of sound , ridgway commented it sounded more like a `` wall of voodoo '' , and the name stuck .
