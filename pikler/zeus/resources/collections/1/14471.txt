Byte     a byte is a unit of measurement of the size of information on a computer or other electronic device . a single typed character ( for example , 'x ' or '8 ' ) measures one byte . a single byte generally holds eight bits ( bits are , in turn , the smallest unit of storage on a computer , meaning what atoms mean for matter ) . bytes are often represented by the letter b. historically , bytes have been used to encode text characters . most of the time , this was done using eight bits per byte , but other numbers of bits were also used . to describe the byte that uses 8 bits , computer scientists talk about octet . ebcdic is a character encoding used mainly on mainframe computers that uses 8 bits per byte , ascii is another encoding that uses only seven bits . when used as a measurement , the byte is basically measuring how many numbers a computer ( or electronics device ) can hold . this is useful for things like ram in a computer , or storage devices like usb drives and other types of flash memory . sending of data ( for a modem or wi-fi ) is usually measured in bits , not bytes .
