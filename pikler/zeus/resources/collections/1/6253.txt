Funeral     funeral is an official ceremony of someone who has died . most religions have their own style of funeral ceremony . a funeral ceremony can be held in the house of the dead , a church , a temple or a public place . the family and friends of the dead come together , remember the dead , and comfort each other . if it is a religious ceremony , they say a prayer for the dead so that his or her soul may rest in peace . there are lots of different traditions that different religions use . sometimes at funerals , the family or friends of the dead person want to pray or say something nice about them . at christian funerals , the priest or preacher may say : `` from earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust '' . modern funerals have greatly changed over time . present day funeral or memorial services may often be more like a thanksgiving for the life of the dead person , rather than just thinking about the sadness of death . at many present day funerals there is a video tribute played before , after , or during the funeral service . memorial folders or prayer cards are handed out at many funeral services and this , too , is a way to make a funeral service personal . at funerals it is not uncommon to see a `` life reflection '' table .
