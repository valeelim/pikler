Magnetic field     in physics , the magnetic field is a field that passes through space and which makes a magnetic force move electric charges and magnetic dipoles . magnetic fields are around electric currents , magnetic dipoles , and changing electric fields . when placed in a magnetic field , magnetic dipoles are in one line with their axes to be parallel with the field lines , as can be seen when iron filings are in the presence of a magnet . magnetic fields also have their own energy and momentum , with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity . the magnetic field is measured in the units of teslas ( si units ) or gauss ( cgs units ) . there are some notable specific kinds of the magnetic field . for the physics of magnetic materials , see magnetism and magnet , and more specifically diamagnetism . for magnetic fields made by changing electric fields , see electromagnetism . the electric field and the magnetic field are components of the electromagnetic field . the law of electromagnetism was founded by michael faraday .
