Monotreme     monotremes are a group of mammals that form the order monotremata . monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs , but they also feed their babies with milk . the word 'monotreme ' refers to their common rear opening , the cloaca . in amphibia , reptiles , birds and probably all early tetrapods , there is a common opening for urine , reproduction and faeces . monotremes are derived from earlier mammals than the marsupials and eutherians , but their fossil record is poor . the time at which the monotreme line diverged from other mammalian lines is uncertain , but one survey of genetic studies gives an estimate of about 220 million years ago . this is in the upper triassic . fossils of a jaw fragment 110 million years old were found at lightning ridge , new south wales . this means they originated up to 100 million years before the metatheria or eutheria , so they are definitely 'living fossils ' . the egg-laying and the cloaca are primitive ( 'basal ' ) features inherited from earlier synapsid tetrapods .
