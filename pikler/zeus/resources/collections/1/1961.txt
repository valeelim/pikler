Mainland China     mainland china is the part of china not including the republic of china controlling taiwan , kinmen , matsu , and the pescadores . the term also excludes hong kong and macau . in the qing dynasty , all of mainland china , hong kong , macau , taiwan , kinmen , matsu , the pescadores , and mongolia were part of the chinese empire . taiwan , hong kong , and macau were given to foreigners for some years ( taiwan to the japanese , hong kong to the british , and macau to the portuguese ) . by the end the qing empire , china became nationalist china ( the republic of china ) and it got taiwan back in 1945. after the communists ( the people 's republic of china ) took over most of china , the nationalists kept only taiwan , kinmen , matsu , and the pescadores . mongolia became an independent state later . since then , communist china only includes the part on the continent ( mainland ) and some small islands that are very near ( the largest communist island is hainan ) . this region is mainland china . later hong kong and macau were returned to the government of china , but because the government calls them `` special administrative regions '' under a `` one country , two systems '' idea , they are still not thought of as part of mainland china .
