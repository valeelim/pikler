Ahimsa     ahimsa ( also ahiṃsā , ahinsa , sanskrit : अहिम्स ) is a sanskrit word which means `` non-violence ” or `` non-injury '' . the practice of ahimsa is an important aspect of religions like hinduism , jainism and buddhism . a person who practices ahimsa generally eats vegetarian foods . a religious person who practices ahimsa does not take part in animal sacrifice . in twentieth century , mohandas karamchand gandhi and martin luther king each followed a path of ahimsa , though in different ways . they struggled without fighting , while asking for the rights of their followers . the concept of ahiṃsā forms the base of buddhism . in buddhism , the first of the five basic vows ( `` precepts '' ) that are undertaken voluntarily by those who practice , is `` i undertake the training rule to abstain from killing '' . in buddhism , killing any living being out of passion is considered 'hiṃsā ' ( injury ) and abstaining from such act is 'ahiṃsā ' ( non-injury or nonviolence ) .
