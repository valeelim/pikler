Language family     language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older language . the languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure . for example , french and spanish both come from latin . latin was spoken a long time ago , and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way , saying , for example , for good : `` bueno '' while another group started saying `` bon . '' most words are said a little differently in spanish and french , so the two are called different languages . most languages belong to a language family , but some languages do not . these languages are called language isolates . there also are constructed languages , like for example esperanto . constructed languages are made for different reasons : making a 'world language ' , for fun , for use in fiction , etc . some language families with sub-families and language examples : indo-european languages . - celtic languages - goidelic languages - brythonic languages
