3D     3d ( or 3-d ) means three-dimensional , or having three dimensions . for example , a box is three-dimensional ; it is solid , and not thin like a piece of paper . it has volume , a top and bottom , left and right ( sides ) , as well as a front and back . you can turn the box around to view it from another side ( called a face , surface or simply side ) . a dimension is measurable in inches , microns , miles , kilometers , or any other unit of length . the three dimensions are often called length ( or depth ) , width ( or breadth ) , and height . some purposes use other words . 3d graphics are used to make video games or animated movies . many calculations are needed to make pictures seem three-dimensional on a screen . modern computers usually have a gpu ( graphics processing unit ) to handle these calculations . in the cartesian coordinate system , length , width , and height are given in letters ( variables ) to make them easier to write , or if a value is not known . often x is width , y is height , and z is length . other 3d coordinate systems such as spherical coordinates include both linear and angular measurements .
