Coral reef     a coral reef is a large underwater structure made of dead and living corals . in most healthy reefs , stony corals are predominant . they are built from colonial polyps from the phylum cnidaria which secrete an exoskeleton of calcium carbonate . the reefs are formed in tropical marine areas ( 30 degrees north and south of the equator ) . the reef acts as the home of many tropical fish and other animals . coral reefs systems are a major tourism attraction because of their beauty and color of the corals and their many associated animals . people look at them while snorkeling and diving . one example of a coral reef is in malaysia at pulau tioman , off the state of pahang . most present-day coral reefs were formed after the last ice age when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves . this means they are less than 10,000 years old . as coral reef communities were established on the shelves , they built reefs that grew upwards , keeping pace with the rise in sea level . reefs that did not keep pace became `` drowned reefs '' , covered by so much water that there was insufficient light for further survival .
