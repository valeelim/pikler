Nuclear meltdown     a nuclear meltdown describes a malfunction of a nuclear reactor . a nuclear meltdown occurs when the middle portion of the nuclear reactor ( its `` core '' ) is not properly cooled . this can occur when the cooling system fails or is otherwise defective . if this happens , uranium or plutonium or similar materials inside the nuclear reactor become hot and may start melting or dissolving . it is this melting that is a nuclear meltdown . around the world , some nuclear meltdowns have occurred . some of them were mild , but few of them were very serious . nuclear meltdowns can kill people from radiation poisoning . the very last accident was the fukushima nuclear disaster in march 2011. four reactors at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant had cooling problems after back-up diesel generators were destroyed by the tsunami . in 1986 , a nuclear meltdown occurred in a place named chernobyl ( ukraine ) . in this case , all the people living in the towns and the villages ( near the defective nuclear reactor ) had to move to far away places .
