International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement     the international red cross and red crescent movement is a movement to save human life and health . its headquarters are in geneva , switzerland . although it is a big international organisation , it is privately run . no government controls the red cross . the red cross has a special job , given by international law . it is the only private group to have its jobs set out by international law . three things make up the movement : - the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) was created in 1863 in geneva . its job , under international law , is to protect the life and dignity of the victims of war . - the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ( ifrc ) was founded in 1919. it tries to make sure the national red cross and red crescent societies can work together and organise relief assistance missions in case of large-scale emergencies . the international federation secretariat is also based in geneva , switzerland . - there is a red cross and red crescent society in nearly every country in the world . 186 national red cross and red crescent societies are recognized by the icrc and admitted as full members of the federation . each one works in its home country , following the ideas of international humanitarian law and the statutes of the international movement . if possible national societies can take on additional humanitarian tasks that are not directly defined by international humanitarian law or the mandates of the international movement . the british red cross society , for example , organises volunteer ambulances at public events . the german red cross operates a blood bank and a professional full-time ambulance service for hospitals .
