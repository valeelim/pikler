Atomic theory     in chemistry and physics , the atomic theory explains how our understanding of the atom has changed over time . atoms were once thought to be the smallest pieces of matter . the first idea of the atom came from the greek philosopher democritus . a lot of the ideas in the modern theory came from john dalton , a british chemist and physicist . the theory applies to solids , liquids and gases , but it does not apply in quite the same way to plasmas or neutron stars . democritus thought that if you cut something in half again and again , you would at last have to stop . he said that this last piece of matter could not be cut any smaller . democritus called these small pieces of matter atoms , which means `` indivisible '' . he thought that atoms would last forever , never change and could not be destroyed . democritus thought that there was nothing between the atoms and that everything around us could be explained if we could understand how atoms worked . some other philosophers agreed , and others disagreed . they had no way to experiment to show whether it was true or not .
