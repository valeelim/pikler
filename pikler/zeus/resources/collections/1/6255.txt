Neutrino     neutrinos are a type of elementary particle that exist all across the universe . physicists study these particles , but they are hard to find because they have a very small chance of interacting with regular matter . ( for example , they pass through the whole earth without touching any other particles ) . neutrinos travel near the speed of light . we used to think that they have no mass , but a few years ago physicists found that they have a very small mass , much lighter than electrons . by finding neutrinos , we can learn about the structure and the history of the universe . neutrinos are very difficult to detect . they are very unlikely to collide ( interact , in this case ) with other particles as they travel through space or through matter . unlike negatively charged electrons , neutrinos have no charge ( neutrino meaning small neutral particle ) . this means that they are unaffected by the electromagnetic force , too . detectors built to find them only see 10-15 a year . they are commonly generated in particle accelerators , the sun , nuclear reactions , and other stars . they are generated whenever there is a nuclear reaction in the form of beta decay . this process starts off with one neutron , and ends with one electron , one proton , and one neutrino .
