Global warming     global warming is a slow rise in earth 's surface temperature . temperatures today are 0.74 °c ( 1.33 °f ) higher than 150 ago . many scientists say that in the next 100–200 years , temperatures might be up to higher than they were before the effects of global warming were discovered . of the greenhouse gases , the basic cause seems to be a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration , as predicted by svante arrhenius a hundred years ago . when people use fossil fuels like coal and oil , this adds carbon dioxide to the air . when people cut down many trees ( deforestation ) , this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by those plants . as the earth 's surface temperature becomes hotter the sea level becomes higher . this is partly because water expands when it gets warmer . it is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers melt . the sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood . weather patterns , including where and how much rain or snow there is , will change . deserts will probably increase in size . colder areas will warm up faster than warm areas . strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food . these effects will not be the same everywhere . the changes from one area to another are not well known .
