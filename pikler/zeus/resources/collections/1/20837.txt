Nerve agent     nerve gas or nerve agent is the name of a family of chemical poisons . usually people call them `` nerve agents '' ( they are not always gases ) . they work by changing the way the nerves work in the human body . they stop messages from the brain from getting sent to the muscles and organs . nerve agents are organic chemicals that have phosphorus in them ( organophosphates ) . many organophosphates are pesticides , and have the same effects as nerve agents if people are exposed to them . however , these pesticides are not used against people as weapons like nerve agents are . since they are chemical weapons , nerve agents are classified as weapons of mass destruction by the united nations according to un resolution 687. since 1993 , making or stockpiling them has been against international law . nerve agents have long-lasting effects . people who survive nerve agent poisoning almost always have chronic damage to the brain and nerves . this damage can also cause mental health problems . nerve agents work by blocking communication between the brain and the body . usually , a neurotransmitter ( a chemical messenger ) called acetylcholine gives the signal for the muscles to tighten up . it also keeps them from relaxing . however , when it is time for the muscles to relax , an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase destroys acetylcholine , and another neurotransmitter tells the muscles to relax .
