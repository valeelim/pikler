Hildesheim     it has about 110,000 people living there . hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in north germany . the city may have been founded when the bishop moved from elze to the innerste ford , where it was an important market on the hellweg trade route . the settlement soon grew into a town which was awarded market rights by king otto iii in 983. originally the market was held on a street called old market ( `` alter markt '' ) , which still exists today . the first market place was laid out around saint andrew 's church . as the city grew larger , a bigger market place became more important . the current market place of hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 people living there . when hildesheim got city rights in 1249 , it was one of the biggest cities in northern germany . for four centuries the clergy ruled hildesheim , before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence . construction of the present city hall started in 1268 , and in 1367 hildesheim became a member of the hanseatic league . a war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud . hildesheim became protestant in 1542 , and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in imperial ( catholic ) hands . several villages around the city remained catholic as well . in 1813 , after the napoleonic wars , the town became part of the kingdom of hanover , which was annexed by the kingdom of prussia after the austro-prussian war in 1866 as a province .
