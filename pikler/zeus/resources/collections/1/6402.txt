Baseball     baseball is a sport played on a field by two teams against each other . in baseball , a player on one team throws a small round ball at a player on the other team , who tries to hit it with a bat . then the player who hits the ball has to run around the field . players score points by running around in a full circle around three markers on the ground called bases , to back where they started , which is called home plate . they have to do this without getting caught by the players on the other team . baseball started in the united states in the 1700s and 1800s , but historians are not sure who invented it . many people in north america , south america , and east asia play baseball , but the sport is most popular in the united states and japan . in the u.s. , baseball is called the `` national pastime '' , because so many people in the united states used to spend a lot of time playing or watching baseball games . today , though , most americans follow football more than baseball , especially when it comes time for the super bowl .
