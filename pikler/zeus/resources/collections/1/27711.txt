League of Nations     the league of nations ( french la société des nations ) was the predecessor to the united nations . the league was founded in 1920 , after world war i , but failed to maintain peace during world war ii . the league had a council of the great powers and an assembly of all the member countries . the league of nations was thought up by woodrow wilson , the american president during the first world war . it was to be a group of nations that worked together to keep peace . one of the reasons for its downfall was that , after a vote , the american public refused to join . the league did not have the power it needed to enforce any of the rules that made it up . this later proved to be a fatal flaw in the league 's structure . another flaw in the league was that it was not representative enough : no more than 65 nations were members at any given time , and the interests of the leading members ( notably britain and france ) often outweighed those of smaller , less powerful members . the league also had no troops of its own , and decisions it made were often slow . for example , when the empire of japan invaded manchuria ( north-east china ) in 1931 , the league took a whole year to make a decision . when it came , japan ignored it . when italy invaded abyssinia in 1935 , the league condemned it more quickly but italy merely quit the league and continued its conquest . after these disasters the league was thought to be weak and powerless and stopped operations in 1939 .
