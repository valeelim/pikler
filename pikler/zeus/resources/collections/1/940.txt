Want     a want is a wish or a desire for something . if a person would like to have something , but can choose not to have it , that thing is wanted or can be called a want . to want is not the same as to need , which is when someone `` must '' have something . people often talk about needing a thing , when they really just want it . wants can be for the same things as needs . for example , a person can `` need '' to eat food and can `` want '' to eat cake . if there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else , perhaps bread . the need is no longer so important ( the person is no longer hungry ) although the want may still be there . if there is cake , then the person 's needs and wants can both be met . in economics , a want is about goods or services . choice is how to satisfy a want , when there are different ways to do this . want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor , hungry or with no money . charles dickens wrote a famous book called `` a christmas carol '' in which there are two children , named want and ignorance .
