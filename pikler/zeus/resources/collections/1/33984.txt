Sequence     a sequence is a word meaning `` coming after or next , a series '' . it is used in mathematics and other disciplines . in ordinary use it means a series of events , one following another . in maths , a sequence is made up of several things put together , one after the other . the order that the things are in matters : ( blue , red , yellow ) is a sequence , and ( yellow , blue , red ) is a sequence , but they are not the same . sequences made up of numbers are also called progressions . there are two kinds of sequences . one kind is finite sequences , which have an end . for example , ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) is a finite sequence . sequences can also be infinite , which means they keep going and never end . an example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all even numbers , bigger than 0. this sequence never ends : it starts with 2 , 4 , 6 , and so on , and you can always keep on naming even numbers . if a sequence is finite , it is easy to say what it is : you can just write down all the things in the sequence . this does not work for an infinite sequence . so another way to write down a sequence is to write a rule for finding the thing in any place you want . the rule should tell us how to get the thing in the `` n '' -th place , if `` n '' can be any number . if you know what a function is , this means that a sequence is a kind of function .
