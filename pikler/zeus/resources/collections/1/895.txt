Volume     the volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space occupied by that object , not to be confused with mass . the volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock , for instance . the word volume implies a three-dimensional context where , by convention , - the length is the longest distance between the object 's extremities - the width ( or breadth ) refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length - the height ( or depth ) stands for the size of that object in the direction perpendicular to both the length and the width . for objects at or near the earth 's surface , height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical . all physical objects occupy a volume , even if some are so thin that they appear to be two-dimensional , like a sheet of paper . the unit of volume in the international system of units is the cubic meter , which is represented by the symbol m. in some fields or applications , it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings . for instance ,
