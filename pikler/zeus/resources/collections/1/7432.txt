Software engineering     software engineering is a field of engineering , for designing and writing programs for computers or other electronic devices . a software engineer , or programmer , writes software ( or changes existing software ) and compiles software using methods that improve it . better quality software is easier to use . better documentation helps other people understand and maintain it and add new features . becoming a software engineer requires experience and practice writing code . software engineering may be very difficult work . it may be repeated during the software release life cycle . software engineering can broadly be split into the following steps : - `` requirements '' say what the software should do . - `` software design '' is usually done on paper . it says what the different parts of the software are , and how they talk to each other . - after the design phase is done , each component ( part ) of the software is coded . code is what tells the computer exactly what to do at each step . - testing is done to see if the components meet the requirements and that the system as a whole meet the requirements .
