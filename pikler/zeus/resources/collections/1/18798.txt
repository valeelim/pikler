Flag of Greenland     the flag of greenland was designed by greenlander thue christiansen . it features two equal horizontal bands of white ( top ) and red with a large disk at the center . the top half of the disk is red , the bottom half is white . its local name in the greenlandic language is `` erfalasorput '' , which means `` our flag '' , but aappalaartoq ( meaning `` the red '' ) is also used for both the greenlandic flag and the dannebrog . today greenlanders display both the erfalasorput and the dannebrog , often side-by-side . greenland first thought of the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 , when five greenlanders proposed a green , white and blue flag . the following year , a newspaper printed eleven design proposals ( all but one of which was a nordic cross ) , and polled the people to determine the most popular . the dannebrog was better liked than any . little came of this effort . in 1978 , denmark granted home rule to greenland , making it an equal member of the danish kingdom . the home rule government asked for flag proposals , receiving 555 . 293 were made by greenlanders .
