Cassandra     cassandra or kassandra ( greek : `` κασσάνδρα '' , also 'alexandra ' ) was a person in greek mythology . she was the daughter of king priam of troy and hecuba , and twin sister of helen . she was famous for her prophesies of bad events . the god apollo gave her the gift of prophecy so that she would love him , but kassandra did not want him . this made apollo angry , but he could only change his gift and not take it away . so he made it that kassandra could only foresee bad things , and that no one would ever believe her . in the trojan war kassandra knew of the trick with the trojan horse , but no one believed her , and so troy was destroyed . after the trojan war she became a slave of agamemnon . she warned him that his wife klytaimnestra would kill him . but he would not believe her , and so agamemnon was killed , and kassandra shortly after him . there is a work called `` alexandra '' by lykrophon . the poet is only known through this work which was done between 196 and 190 bc . the work has 1474 lines , which are done in jambic trimeters . this is what most greek tragedies were written in .
