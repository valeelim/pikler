Premature ejaculation     premature ejaculation ( also known as pe ) is a condition affecting many men . it is when during sexual intercourse ( sex ) the male can not stop himself from ejaculating after starting sex . the condition is usually curable or at least treatable by a few exercises . ( there are more exercises than these , however , these are the most common . ) one exercise is to create an erection and begin to lose it , then stimulate it again . this exercise is best done alone at first and then with a partner . thrusting should not be used with a partner until very near the end of treatment . this treatment may take several weeks to fully cure the problem if it is used properly . another treatment involves using the muscle which stops urine . to locate the muscle , simply begin urinating and stop quickly before emptying the bladder . doing that , will demonstrate how to use the muscle . then whenever convenient use the muscle . you do not need to be urinating to use the muscle and it is suggested you are not . after a few weeks of both these treatments , the pe will become more like traditional ejaculation and after about one and a half to two and a half months , it should be absolutely normal .
