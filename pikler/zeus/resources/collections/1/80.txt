Beekeeping     beekeeping or apiculture is the farming of honeybees . the keeping of bees is usually , and has been in the past , for honey . that is becoming less true . instead , it is more used for crop pollination and other products . these are wax and propolis . there is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest . she lays all the eggs , which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons . however , they do not control the hive . the largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit . some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a hobby . urban beekeeping is a growing trend , and some have found that `` city bees '' are actually healthier than `` rural bees '' because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity . colony collapse disorder is a growing problem , along with mites .
