Soil erosion     soil erosion is the washing or blowing away ( by water or wind ) of the top layer of soil ( dirt ) . this is a serious problem for farmers . if the soil has eroded , the crops that make food will not grow very well . soil erosion was a big problem in the midwestern united states in the 1930s dust bowl . erosion also leaves large sinkholes in the ground , which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse . urban areas are usually protected from soil erosion , so not many buildings collapse from erosion . soil erosion can be conserved in several ways : - planting wind breaks can be effective . a wind break is a line of plants that are planted to stop or slow the wind . a thick row of bushes planted next to a field of plants can stop the wind from blowing the soil away . this method also helps against water erosion , as the soil gets caught up against the roots of the bushes , rather than washing away . - terraces are level places that have been made on hill sides . they are used for terrace farming .
