Gregor Mendel     gregor johann mendel ( heinzendorf , austria , 20 july 1822 – brünn , austro-hungary , 6 january 1884 ) was an austrian monk and botanist . he founded genetics by his work cross-breeding pea plants . he discovered dominant and recessive characters ( genes ) from the crosses he performed on the plants in his greenhouse . what he learnt is known today as mendelian inheritance . his work was not appreciated at first , but was 'rediscovered ' in 1900 by carl correns and hugo de vries . erich von tschermak 's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing . mendel used the edible piss ( `` pisum sativum '' ) for his crosses . he selected seven characters which were distinctive , and never blended ; they occurred as either-or alternatives . examples : plant height ( short or tall ) ; colour of peas ( green or yellow ) ; position of flowers ( restricted to the top or distributed along the stem ) . when he crossed varieties which differed in a trait ( e.g . tall crossed with short ) , the first generation of hybrids ( f1 ) showed only one of the two alternatives . one character was `` dominant '' , and the other `` recessive '' . but when he crossed these hybrids with each other , the recessive character reappeared in the second ( f2 ) generation . the proportion of plants showing the dominant as opposed to the recessive character was close to 3 to 1. further analysis of the descendants ( f3 ) of the dominant group showed that one-third of them were true-breeding and two-thirds were of hybrid constitution . the 3:1 ratio could therefore be rewritten as 1:2:1 , meaning that 50 percent of the f2 generation were true-breeding and 50 percent were still hybrid . this was mendel ’ s major discovery .
