House     a house is a building that is made for people to live in . it is a `` permanent '' building that is meant to stay standing . it is not a place to live that can easily be packed up and carried away like a tent , or moved like a caravan . if people live in the same house for more than a short stay , then they call it their `` home '' . houses come in many different shapes and sizes . they may be as small as just one room , or they may have hundreds of rooms . they also are made many different shapes , and may have just one level or several different levels . a house is sometimes joined to other houses at the sides to make a `` terrace '' or `` row house '' ( a connected row of houses ) . a big building with many levels and apartments is called `` a block of flats '' ( british ) or an apartment building . one of the differences between a house and an apartment is that a house has a front door to the outside world , whereas the main door of an apartment usually opens onto a passage or landing that can be used by other people in the building .
