Flea     the flea ( `` siphonaptera '' ) is an insect that lives on many kinds of animals and sometimes humans . fleas are considered parasites , and they drink the blood of the animal they bite . fleas can live outdoors in sand or tall grass , and they will jump to any passing animal and lay eggs . flea bites are usually red bumps and they itch . they can carry disease and make animals sick . there are several types of flea including the dog flea , cat flea , human flea , northern rat flea , and the oriental rat flea . during the middle ages , the oriental rat flea spread a bacteria that caused the bubonic plague , also known as the black death or black plague , a huge epidemic much more severe than today 's bird flu . the oriental rat flea would become infected by the bacteria `` yersinia pestis '' . after infection the bacteria grew inside of the flea , eventually blocking the path to its stomach . because of this , the flea was always hungry . when the flea would bite a human it opened up the skin but since the stomach of the flea was blocked , the blood from the human was heaved up back into the human , only this time it was infected with the bubonic plague bacteria .
