Pedipalp     pedipalps are the two appendages on the front of a spider 's head . some spiders seem to have ten legs and not eight , because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs . the pedipalps are used rather like arms . spiders often use them to hold insects ( for example crickets ) for them to eat . male spiders also use pedipalps for mating . the male spiders make some silk , put sperm onto the silk , and then put their pedipalps into the sperm . the pedipalps then hold the sperm , and the spider can use it to mate with a female by putting them inside her epigynum . the pedipalps of all chelicerates vary : ricinulei , thelyphonida , amblypygi , some opiliones , schizomida , scorpions and pseudoscorpions all have theirs as pincers , with the amblypygi 's being their entire pedipalps shaped like mantids . the palpigradi 's pedipalps have some of the strangest roles of arachnids as they use theirs for locomotion . the pedipalps of solifugae act as antenna . other websites . - close-up view of pedipalps on a large spider
