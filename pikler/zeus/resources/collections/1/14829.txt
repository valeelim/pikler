Confucianism     confucianism is the philosophy based on the teachings of confucius ( 551 bc - 479 bc ) , who was an important chinese philosopher . confucianism has a complete system of moral , social , political , and religious thought , and has had a large influence on the history of chinese civilization . however , there remains some controversy over whether or not it should be considered a religion . confucianism was made to stop the fall of chinese society . after the zhou dynasty fell , people cared only for themselves and did not have any respect for others . confucianism became a social order for china , teaching that social relationships are the most important . people slowly started to believe in it , because they wanted to have peace , but they had to care for themselves too . as a result , confucianism brought the people love , harmony , and respect for one another . confucianism was started in ch'u-fu , confucius 's birthplace . today , confucianism has spread all the way around the world , but is still more pronounced in china .
