Plato     plato was one of the greatest classical greek philosophers . he lived from 427 bc to 348 bc . he was a student of socrates and the teacher of aristotle . plato wrote about many ideas in philosophy that are still talked about today . one modern philosopher , ( alfred north whitehead ) , said that all philosophy since plato has just been comments on his works . plato wrote his books in the form of dialoguesâ€”people talking about ideas , and sometimes disagreeing about them . socrates is usually the main person in plato 's dialogues . usually , socrates talks with people about their ideas , and tries to see if they believe anything that is illogical . other people in the stories often become angry with socrates because of this . people who study plato argue about whether socrates really said the same things that plato makes him say , or whether plato just used socrates as a character , to make the ideas he was talking about seem more important . plato opposed the rhetorics of sophism and insisted true justice and equality in his work `` gorgias '' and immortality of soul in `` phaedo '' .
