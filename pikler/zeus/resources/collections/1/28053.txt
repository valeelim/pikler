Church of England     the church of england is the leading christian church in england . it is the church established by law : its formal head is the english monarch ( elizabeth ii ) . it is the mother church of the anglican communion . the church of england understands itself to be both catholic and reformed : - catholic because it views itself as a part of the universal church of jesus christ in unbroken continuity with the early apostolic church . this is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early church fathers , as in the apostles creed , nicene creed and athanasian creed . - reformed because it has been shaped by the doctrinal ideas of the 16th century protestant reformation , in particular by the thirty-nine articles and the book of common prayer . there are other protestant churches in england which are not part of the anglican communion . the church of england became independent under king henry viii in 1534. henry viii was married to catherine of aragon , but asked the pope to annul the marriage ( say that there was a mistake and that henry and catherine were never really married ) . he had wanted to annul the marriage because he wanted a male heir to his throne and catherine could not produce one . when the annulment was refused , henry viii used his position as king to break the church away from the roman catholic church . this established the independence of the church of england , sometimes called the anglican ( english ) church . methodism broke away from the church in the 18th century . the oxford movement brought some catholic beliefs and practices back into the church in the 19th century .
