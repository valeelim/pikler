Magnesium     magnesium ( /mæɡˈniːziəm/ mag-nee-zee-əm ) is a chemical element with the symbol `` mg '' , atomic number 12 and common oxidation state +2 . it is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the earth 's crust , where it constitutes about 2 % by mass , and ninth in the known universe as a whole . this preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon ( which in turn is made from three helium nuclei ) . magnesium ion 's high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater . magnesium is the 11th most abundant element by mass in the human body . its ions are essential to all living cells . the ions play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like atp , dna , and rna . hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function . magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll , and is thus a common additive to fertilizers . magnesium ions are sour to the taste , and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters .
