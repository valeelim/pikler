Area     area is the amount of space a two dimensional ( flat ) surface takes up . it is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container ; for example , how much wood is needed to make a wardrobe . you can use different formulas to find the area of different shapes . - area of a rectangle is the length of any two touching sides multiplied together . in other words , length times width . - area of a triangle is half of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height . this can be found using the trigonometry formula , formula_1 . - area of a circle : formula_2 . the area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object . the area under a curve can be found using integration , from calculus . some units used to measure area are square mile and square kilometre .
