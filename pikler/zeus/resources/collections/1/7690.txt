Orchestra     an orchestra is a group of musicians playing instruments together . they usually play classical music . a large orchestra is sometimes called a `` symphony orchestra '' and a small orchestra is called a `` chamber orchestra '' . a symphony orchestra may have about 100 players , while a chamber orchestra may have 30 or 40 players . the number of players will depend on what music they are playing and the size of the place where they are playing . the word `` orchestra '' originally meant the semi-circular space in front of a stage in a greek theatre which is where the singers and instruments used to play . gradually the word came to mean the musicians themselves . the orchestra is directed by a conductor . he/she helps the players to play together , to get the right balance so that everything can be heard clearly , and to encourage the orchestra to play with the same kind of feeling . some small chamber orchestras may play without a conductor . this was usual until the 19th century when the orchestras got very big and needed a conductor who made decisions and stood in front so that all the players could see him .
