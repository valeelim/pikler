God paradox     the god paradox is an idea in philosophy . this idea is explained here : this is a paradox because : - if god is able to make a mountain more heavy than he is able to lift , then there may be something he is not able to do : he is not able to lift that mountain . - if god is not able to make such a mountain , then there is something he is not able do : he is not able to make that mountain . if either outcome were considered true , then it is argued that god almighty is actually not almighty . the god paradox is a good example of a philosophical problem . this section has some answers to this paradox . one answer is that god could make it so he ca n't lift the mountain by his own choice . in other words , god can lift the unliftable mountain because he is all powerful , but he chooses not to be able to , and so he chooses to cut his own power , because he is able . god can also choose to not be able to create such a mountain . god is all powerful , so he can choose not to have the power to make an unliftable mountain . simply said , god can cut his own power , but in so doing , he can still regain that power . it is a limbo , a state between not powerful and powerful , something that is not definable by our knowledge of what is possible or impossible . because god is allmighty , he surpasses our definitions of what he can and can not do .
