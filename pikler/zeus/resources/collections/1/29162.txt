Reichstag     it was building used by the parliament of the german empire until 1918. the parliament of the weimar republic , also called the reichstag sat there until the 1933 reichstag fire . the third reich seldom used its parliament , so the building remained empty and derelict until after german reunification . then it became the seat of the german parliament again in 1999 after a reconstruction led by british architect lord norman foster . today 's parliament of germany is called the `` bundestag . '' the `` reichstag '' as a parliament dates back to the holy roman empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of nazi germany ( 1933-1945 ) . in today 's usage , the german term `` reichstag '' refers to the building , while the term `` bundestag '' refers to the institution . the reichstag dome is the large glass dome at the very top of the building . the dome has a 360-degree view of the surrounding berlin cityscape . the main hall of the parliament below can also be seen from inside the dome , and natural light from above emits down to the parliament floor . a large sun shield tracks the movement of the sun electronically and blocks direct sunlight which would not only cause large solar gain , but impress those below . construction work was finished in 1999 and the seat of parliament was transferred to the bundestag in april of that year . the dome is no longer open to anyone without prior registration .
