Chinese character     chinese characters are symbols used to write the chinese and japanese languages . in the past , other languages like korean and vietnamese also used them . the beginning of these characters was at least 3000 years ago , making them one of the oldest continuously-used ( meaning it has not fallen out of use ) writing systems in the world . in chinese they are called `` hanzi '' ( ) , which means `` han character '' . in japanese they are called `` kanji '' and in korean `` hanja '' . chinese characters are an important part of east asian culture . chinese characters may be considered to be abstract art , because of how the characters are made up of lines and dots . the art of writing chinese characters is called calligraphy . chinese characters are a type of logogram ; they mainly represent words instead of sounds . most earlier chinese characters were pictographs , which are simple pictures used to mean some kind of thing or idea . today , very few modern chinese characters are pictographs , but are a combination of two or more simple characters , also known as radicals . while many radicals and characters show a word 's meaning , not all characters neatly fit that description . sometimes a radical or even an entire character itself hints at the word 's pronunciation , instead of its meaning .
