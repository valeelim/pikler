Principle of relativity     in the physics of aristotle , heavy objects fall faster than objects that are not heavy . the natural science of aristotle was most popular in western thought for 2,000 years . galileo proved that all objects fall with the same acceleration . therefore , the longer an object moves with constant acceleration the faster its final velocity is . also , if different objects each having a different mass are dropped from rest ( initial velocity is zero ) at the same height in a vacuum , they will all hit the ground at the same velocity regardless of their mass . the experimental discoveries of galileo and the laws of motion developed mathematically by newton gave birth to modern science . galileo 's principle of relativity states `` it is impossible by mechanical means to say whether we are moving or staying at rest '' . if two trains are moving at the same speed in the same direction , then a passenger in either car will not be able to notice that either train is moving . however , if the passenger takes a fixed frame of reference , a fixed point , like the earth , he will then be able to notice the motion of either train . another thing , if one stands on the earth one will not be able to see that it is moving .
