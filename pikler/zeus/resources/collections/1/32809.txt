Taxi     a taxi ( also called a taxicab or cab in the united states ) is a car , van , or other vehicle that is used for public transport . people use them to get to where they want to go directly . this means that there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off , which is often very close to the place that they are going . many big cities have taxis . in most other types of public transport , such as a bus , tram , or train , the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off . these vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route , and because of this , they usually do not stop exactly where people who use them want them to . riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car , but you do n't need to drive . taxis work differently around the world , but you only need to tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there . how much you pay for the ride , in most cases , depends on how far you are going from where you get on , but it is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than for other forms of transport .
