Particle     particles are tiny bits of matter that make up everything in the universe . in particle physics , an elementary particle is a particle which can not be split up into smaller pieces . there are many different types of particles , with different particle sizes and properties . `` macroscopic particles '' are particles that are larger than atoms or molecules . they have volume and shape . powder and dust are some examples of macroscopic particles . atoms and molecules are called `` microscopic particles '' . nanoparticles could also be included . `` subatomic particles '' are particles that are smaller than atoms . the proton , the neutron , and the electron are subatomic particles . these are the particles which make atoms . the proton has a positive charge ( a + charge ) . the neutron has a neutral charge . the electron has a negative charge ( a - charge ) , and it is the smallest of these three particles . in atoms , there is a small nucleus in the center , which is where the protons and neutrons are , and electrons orbit the nucleus .
