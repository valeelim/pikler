Squid     squid are cephalopods of the order teuthida . they are the sister group to the octopods . squid are carnivores and , in turn , they are hunted . the largest squid , the giant squid and colossal squid , are eaten by sperm whales and sleeper sharks . there are about 300 species of squid . squid , like cuttlefish , have eight arms arranged in pairs , and two longer tentacles with suckers . all squid have a mouth with a radula , and jet propulsion with the siphon from the mantle . the radulla is a scraping organ in the mouth that scrapes nutrients from food sources . tentacles are used for locomotive power and capturing food sources . all squids are carnivores ; they eat other animals , not plants . like other cephalopoda , squid are intelligent animals . squids have a head-like structure , with sense organs and brains in the front end . although the squids lack exterior shells they have a vestigial shell inside , made of chitin . the skin is covered in chromatophores , which enable the squid to change colour to suit its surroundings , making it effectively camouflaged . controlled by the nervous system , the camouflage can change in 'real time ' .
