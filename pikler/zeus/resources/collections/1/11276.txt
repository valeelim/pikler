Afterlife     the afterlife is what some people believe happens after death . different religions teach different things about the afterlife . some religions believe in reincarnation ( to come back to life as a different person or even animal ) . these religions include buddhism and hinduism . hinduism specifically believes that at death the soul leaves the physical body but does not die . it lives in an astral body in an astral plane . here the soul continues until it is born again in another physical body as a baby . most people in the world believe you go to another place after you die , such as heaven or hell . christianity , judaism , islam and jainism are religions that believe in this . for example , those that follow christianity believe that if you accept the christ ( jesus of nazareth , the son of the virgin mary ) as your saviour , you will spend eternity in heaven after death ; if you do not accept him , you will be separated from him after death . ancient egyptians also believed in an `afterlife` . others ( like african animists ) believe that some people change into spirits called ghosts .
