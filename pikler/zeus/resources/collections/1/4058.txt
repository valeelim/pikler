Solid     solid is one of the four common states of matter . the molecules in solids are closely bound together , they can only vibrate . this means solids have a definite shape that only changes when a force is applied . this is different to liquids and gases which move randomly , a process called flow . when a solid becomes a liquid , this is called melting . liquids become solid by freezing . some solids , like dry ice , can turn into gas without turning liquid first . this is called sublimation . the forces between the atoms in a solid can take many forms . for example , a crystal of sodium chloride ( common salt ) is made up of ionic sodium and chlorine , which are held together by ionic bonds . in diamond or silicon , the atoms share electrons and make covalent bonds . in metals , electrons are shared in metallic bonding . some solids , like most organic compounds , are held together with `` van der waals forces '' coming from the polarization of the electronic charge cloud on each molecule . the dissimilarities between the types of solid come from the differences between their bonding .
