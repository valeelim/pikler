Condensation     condensation is the process in which gas changes into a liquid when it touches a cooler surface . condensation is an important part of the water cycle . it is the opposite of evaporation . condensation of water is when water changes from gas to a liquid or crystal shape . any gas can condensate , usually at a low temperature or high pressure . however , condensation can technically happen at any temperature , as long as the pressure of the condensing gas is more than the pressure of the liquid state of that gas ( both at the same temperature ) . during condensation , the molecules in the matter slow down . heat energy is taken away , causing the state of matter to change . condensation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature . this means that if there is a lot of condensation , the temperature goes up . alternatively , if there is hardly any condensation , there will be a temperature loss . it is a useful process . one use is in the creation of “ new water ” ( drinkable water made from drinkable sources ) .
