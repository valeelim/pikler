Duke     a duke is someone part of nobility . in monarchies , like the uk , the title has legal status , and is inherited in the male line . the first english dukes were created by edward iii in 1337 , when he gave his eldest son , edward , the black prince , the title of duke of cornwall . dukes are formally referred to as 'the duke of ( place name ) ' , and addressed as `` your grace '' . on state occasions , dukes rank below royal dukes , and above earls . this is called the order of precedence , because in procession to the opening parliament , or on other state occasions , they walk in order of their rank . the office or position of a duke is called a dukedom . the wife of a duke is a duchess . this is an honorary title , given for life to the lawfully wedded wife of a duke . if she divorces and remarries a commoner , ( person with no title ) their children have no title . the children of a duke , on the other hand , do have honorary titles ( so long as they are born in lawful wedlock ) . the eldest son may bear what is called a junior title which an ancestor was given before the dukedom was created . other children would be called 'lady ' jane ( or other christian name ) and 'lord ' james ( or other christian name ) . children use the family surname , not the dukedom .
