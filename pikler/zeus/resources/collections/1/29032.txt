Viola     a viola ( pronounced vee-oh-la ) is a musical instrument which is similar to the violin and cello . the viola sounds lower than a violin , but higher than a cello . it has four strings , called the c , g , d , and a strings . the highest string is the a. the viola is played with a bow in the right hand . playing with the bow is called arco . sometimes the strings may be plucked ( pizzicato ) . when people see the viola , sometimes they think it is a violin . this is because the viola is only a little larger than a violin , and like the violin , the viola is held on the player 's left shoulder . it is also because the sound of the viola is only five notes lower than the sound of the violin . the biggest difference between the viola and the violin is the different sound . the viola 's lowest string is the `` c '' string and its highest string is the `` a '' string . so , to see whether a violin-like instrument is a violin or viola , one will need to pluck the thinnest string . the violin 's lowest string is the `` g '' string and its highest string is the `` e '' string . even though the viola and violin can play many of the same notes , they each have a special sound quality . sometimes people describe the viola 's sound as more `` dark '' , `` earthy '' , or `` mellow '' than the violin 's sound .
