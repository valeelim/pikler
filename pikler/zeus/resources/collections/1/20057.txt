Software licence     a software licence ( or software license in united states english ) is a kind of licence that is used to set rules about how a piece of software can or can not be used . after getting the software by either downloading it or buying it , you need to agree with the licence in order to use it . the licence is chosen or created by the software developer/creator or software publisher . many licences answer questions such as `` can i use this software commercially/to make money ? `` , or `` can i give this software to other people ? `` , or in general , `` in what ways am i allowed/permitted to use this software ? '' . one kind of software licence , an end user licence agreement , or `` eula '' , is very specific/descriptive about the things that you can or can not do with the software , and oftentimes establishes/defines the rights of the software developer over the user . most eulas are written by the specific software developer and are not shared like other software licences . another type of software licence is an open source distribution licence . these licences let software developers choose what people can and can not do with the code of the software . there are many licences freely available which allow you to do this , such as the mit licence , which allows for the software to be used by any person for any reason/purpose . the gnu general public licence , often abbreviated/shortened as gpl is a licence which makes all copies of the software free and open source . therefore , gpl can not be included in any part of proprietary/closed software because it does not follow the rules of the licence . the apache licence is more definitive and specific , but is more common with larger companies , such as google , but is still considered a free software licence . creative commons is a popular licence used by people who want to give something out for free without taking as much credit . creative commons is very open , and is even used by wikipedia for its pages and other content .
