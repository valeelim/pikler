Guqin     the ( ; ; wade-giles : ku-ch'in ; literally `` ancient stringed-instrument '' ) is the modern name for a plucked seven-string chinese musical instrument of the zither family . it has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favored by educated people as an instrument of great beauty and refinement . it is uncommonly spelt as gu qin ( and sometimes guqin or gu-qin ) in english . traditionally the instrument was called simply qin 「琴」 , but by the 20th century the term had come to be used on many other musical instruments as well ( for example , the `` yangqin '' 「揚琴」 hammered dulcimer , the `` huqin '' 「胡琴」 family of bowed string instruments , and the western piano ( ; literally `` steel stringed-instrument '' ) ) , so the prefix `` gu- '' 「古」 ( meaning `` ancient '' ) was added for clarification . it can also be called qixianqin 「七絃琴」 ( `` seven-stringed instrument '' ) . the guqin is not to be confused with the `` guzheng '' , another chinese long zither also without frets , but with moveable bridges under each string . because robert hans van gulik 's famous book about the qin is called `` the lore of the chinese lute '' , the qin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute . other incorrect classifications ( mainly from music cds ) include `` harp '' or `` table-harp '' . other western nicknames for the guqin include `` chinese guitar '' and `` chinaman 's harp '' .
