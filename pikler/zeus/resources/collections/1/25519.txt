Feta cheese     feta cheese ( greek : φέτα , feminine gender ; pronounced ) , or simply feta is a kind of cheese . usually it is made from the milk of sheep or goats . feta cheese originally is from the greek mainland , or from lesbos in the aegean sea . other cheese ( which is usually not from greece and is usually made from cow milk ) must not be called `` feta '' from 2007. the european court said so in its decisions c-465/02 and c-466/02 ( from october 25 , 2005 ) . what is now called `` feta cheese '' was known to ancient greeks . homer must have known about it . there were several references to the cheese in the `` odyssey '' . according to the myth , the cyclops polyphemos was the first cheese manufacturer . he carried the milk in animal-skin bags . he had collected the milk from his sheep . he was very surprised to see that days later the milk had become solid . when polyphemus tried to eat it , it tasted well . he also found that as such a solid , it would go bad later than with milk . the name `` feta '' has an italian origin . it is derived from `` fetta '' ( slice ) , and dates back to the 17th century . very likely this referred to the method of cutting the cheese in slices to put it in barrels .
