Tin     tin is a chemical element with symbol sn ( for ) and atomic number 50. it is in group 14 on the periodic table . it is not radioactive . tin is a silver , somewhat soft metal . it is a post-transition metal . its melting point is 231.93°c and its boiling point is 2602 °c . it can melt easily in a flame . it is malleable . it makes a crackling sound called tin cry when a piece of it is bent . tin has more non-radioactive isotopes than any other element . tin is found in two allotropes : alpha-tin and beta-tin . alpha-tin is a brittle , dull , powdery , semimetallic form of tin . it is made when very pure tin is cooled . beta-tin is the normal shiny , soft , conductive , metallic form . it is made at higher temperatures . the decay of tin by turning from beta-tin to alpha-tin is called `` tin pest '' . alpha-tin is not wanted in many places . when small amounts of other elements like antimony are added , the tin can not change into alpha-tin . when alpha-tin is heated , it changes into beta-tin . tin can be hardened by adding antimony or copper , as well as some other elements . these also make it resistant to tin pest . tin can also be made very shiny . tin can make an alloy with copper called bronze .
