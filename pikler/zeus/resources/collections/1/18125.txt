Phenomenon     a phenomenon ( greek : `` , pl. `` ) is an observable event or , quite literally , something that can be seen . it comes from the noun ( `` phainomenon , df . appearance '' ) and is also related to the verb ( `` phainein , df . to show '' ) . its plural is phenomena . its antonym is `` lathomenon '' , meaning `` something lying beneath the surface '' . phenomenon can also mean a `` surprising development '' or `` unusually successful person '' . in science , `` phenomenon '' stands for any event which we can sense or detect or record . in science , the word `` observe '' means more than just `` visible to the naked eye '' . it means `` sensible '' , available to our senses . the senses we are born with are extended by a whole range of instruments which record things we can not see , and make them visible to us . so , while some events are easy to observe , others need technology to make observation possible .
