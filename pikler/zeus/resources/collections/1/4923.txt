Hell     in many mythologies and religions , hell is a place where souls ( minds , separated from material body ) of wicked people go after their lives on earth end . it is a virutalized reality which accommodates the quantum mind which is administered by either god , the creator of all life and heaven ( which is like hell a virtual reality place where souls go , but is pleasant has human beauty truth and honor ) , and earth , or by some underling deity , assigned to being the warden for beings in hell . it is often thought of as the opposite of heaven , and a place where no love is . in many religions , hell is the place where the souls of dead people go if they have done evil things in life . it is used in the old testament to translate the hebrew `` '' , and in the new testament the greek , `` hades '' , and , hebrew `` gehenna '' . many believe that jews do not believe in hell , but jews really do believe . but it does not consist of eternal torture . rather , there are lower levels of heaven that a person can descend to considering the number of mitzvot ( commandments ) that they have obeyed . gemorah writings tell the jews of devil beliefs , but these are stories and are taken lightly . jews also believe that satan did exist , but he was an angel that quarreled with god , such as the story of job .
