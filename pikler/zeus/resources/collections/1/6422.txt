Anubis     anubis is the protector of the gates to the underworld , osiris replaced him as the god of the dead . he looks like a man with the head of a jackal ( a jackal is a scavenging and hunting animal , native to africa , that is closely related to wolves ) . anubis , as the god of the afterlife , was closely associated with mummification and burial rites . egyptian jackals had an association with the dead , as well . they were often found digging up buried bodies and eating them , which may be why anubis was depicted as part jackal . the priests who mummified the dead kings ( called pharaohs ) wore costumes to make them appear like jackals . the egyptian people believed that anubis helped decide the fate of the dead in the afterlife . the heart of the dead was weighed against the feather of truth ( representing the goddess ma'at ) , to see if the deceased was worthy of entering the afterlife . if the person had lived a bad life , his or her heart would weigh heavy , and he or she would be eaten by ammit ( the devourer ) . if a person was kind and good , the heart weighed light , and he did not have sins , he or she could continue on to the afterlife safe and sound to meet osiris .
