Wave (physics)    wave ( physics ) a wave is a kind of oscillation ( disturbance ) that travels through space and matter . wave motions transfer energy from one place to another . waves are found everywhere in the natural world . examples of waves : - sound - water waves - seismic wave ( earthquakes ) - electromagnetic wave - light wave - radio wave waves have properties that can be measured . all waves can be pictured by adding sine waves . sine waves can be measured too . the shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude , phase , wavelength and frequency . the speed that the sine wave moves can be measured . the amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture . the highest point on a wave is called the peak . the lowest point is called the trough . the peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the wave 's amplitude apart from each other . the part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline . complicated wave forms ( like the sound waves of music ) can be made by adding up sine waves of different frequencies . this is how mp3 audio files are converted from their compressed form into music we can hear .
