Machine code     machine code or machine language is the name for commands . they can directly be executed by a processor . usually , they are 1s and 0s . their order tells the computer what to do . this code is the lowest level of software . all other kinds of software need to be translated into machine code before they can be used . each processor has its own machine code . each instruction is made up of an opcode ( operation code ) and operand ( s ) . an instruction tells the computer to do one thing . the operands are usually memory addresses . an instruction set is a list of the opcodes used in a computer . machine code is what assembly code and other programming languages are compiled to or interpreted as . program builders turn code into another language or machine code . machine code is sometimes called native code . this is used when talking about things that work on only some computers . machine code can be written in different forms : - using a number of switches . this generates a sequence of `` 1 '' and `` 0 '' . this was used in the early days of computing . since the 1970s , it is no longer used .
