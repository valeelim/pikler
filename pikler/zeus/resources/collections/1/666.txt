Regime     a regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state . there are many kinds of regimes . they can achieve power in many ways . depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system , they can lose power in many ways too . the most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup , invasion or revolution until the 20th century . after that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods . peaceful regime change is usually by an election - this method is now used by more than half the people on the earth . it is called representative democracy . such regimes are often called administrations to make it clear they are not dictators , and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a legislative branch . also the judicial branch is separate . the courts are not usually considered part of the regime . however , some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power : - the regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power - these may be in the military or a political party .
