Advanced Photo System     the advanced photo system was a technology for photographic film and cameras . people started using it in the year 1996. this is what it did : - it had a new way of changing film in cameras , so that the film could be `` dropped in '' , just like people changed batteries . - it allowed for people to change a film , even if the entire film had not been used yet . - when the film was developed , it had an `` index print '' which showed small copies of every picture . - for each photo taken , special information was saved onto the film , called `` metadata '' - there were three different kinds of images , which were made by cropping ( cutting ) the negative . the camera always started with the largest kind , but the finished picture could change depending on what the owner wanted . - panoramic - classic - hdtv ( 16:9 ) . the system also had problems : - film size is smaller ( 30x16 compared to 24x36 for older cameras ) . - the final print is not as good - photography companies needed to buy new equipment , since their old equipment would not work with aps .
