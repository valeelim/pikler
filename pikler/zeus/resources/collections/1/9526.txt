Proton     a proton is part of an atom . they are found in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons . the periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have . a single atom of hydrogen ( the lightest kind of atom ) is made up of an electron moving around a proton . most of the mass of this atom is in the proton , which is almost 2000 times heavier than the electron . protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom . in any one element , the number of protons is always the same . an atom 's atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom . protons are made of quarks . a proton is believed to be made up of 3 quarks , two up quarks and one down quark . one down quark has a charge of -1/3 , and two up quarks have a charge of +2/3 each . this adds to a charge of +1 . a proton has a very small mass . the mass of the proton is about one atomic mass unit . the mass of the neutron is also about one atomic mass unit . the size of a proton is determined by the vibration of the quarks that are in it , and these quarks effectively form a cloud . this means that a proton is not so much a hard ball as an area that contains quarks .
