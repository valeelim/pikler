Accident     an accident is when something goes wrong when it is not meant to . physical accidents are things like collisions , injuries , and falling . non-physical accidents are things like accidentally telling someone a secret , forgetting something important , or deleting an important computer file . road accidents kill thousands of people each month in the united states , and thousands each week in the world . they injure more thousands each week . the majority involve a car but there are also many bus , truck and bicycle accidents . aircraft crashes , ship sinkings and other transport accidents also attract much attention . injuries from accidents , however , are more numerous at home than elsewhere . they attract less attention because only a few people are hurt at a time . often , accidents are investigated so that we can learn how to avoid them in the future . sometimes by studying an accident we can discover new things , for example penicillin . most of the deaths resulting from injuries are caused by fire accidents . thus , accidental fires are one of the leading causes of unintentional deaths . the main cause of death in fire incidents is burning , but inhalation of smoke and toxic gas causes death as well . often the cause of the fire is very simple and unexpected , such as forgetting a candle near something flammable , defect in the hardware , or old electrical wires . so most of the large fires are caused by simple reasons .
