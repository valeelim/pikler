Easter     easter , also called resurrection day and pascha , is a christian holiday celebrating jesus christ returning from the dead . christians believe that it is the holiest day in the year . some people who are not christians celebrate it as a cultural holiday . easter is not held on the same date every year . this is called a `` moveable feast '' . western churches , like the roman catholic church , use the gregorian calendar , while eastern churches , like the eastern orthodox church , use the julian calendar . because of this , the date of easter celebrations is different for these two types of churches even though the way they calculate the date is similar . in 2015 easter was celebrated on april 5 for both the gregorian calendar and julian calendar . the word `` easter '' is derived from `` eastre '' , the name of the ancient german goddess of spring . her festival occurred at the vernal equinox . the french word for easter , `` p√¢cques '' , comes from the greek word for passover , which is the jewish holiday celebrated at about the same time of the year .
