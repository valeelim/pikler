Ethics     ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with good and evil . ethics tries to answer questions like : - what actions are good ? what actions are evil ? - how can we tell the difference ? - are good and evil the same ? - how should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people ? - how do our actions affect others ? when discussing ethics , the philosophy is generally separated into : - thinking about morality , - the involvement of science , - the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs . `` morality '' is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad . there are many different moralities , but they share some things . for example most people think that murder ( killing somebody ) is wrong . ( compare exodus 20:13 ) some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share . they think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad . their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation , such as how people should treat
