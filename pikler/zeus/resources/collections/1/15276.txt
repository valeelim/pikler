Tuna     tuna , sometimes called tunafish , are several species ( kinds ) of fish . they are in the family scombridae , mostly in the genus thunnus . tuna are fast swimmers . people have seen tuna swim at up to 77 km/h . several species of tuna are warm-blooded . most species of fish have white flesh . the flesh of the tuna is different . it is pink to dark red . this is because tuna muscle tissue contains greater quantities of myoglobin . myoglobin is a molecule that binds oxygen . some of the larger tuna species such as the northern bluefin tuna can raise their blood temperature above the water temperature with muscular activity . this enables them to live in cooler waters and survive a wider range of circumstances . tuna is an important commercial fish . some varieties of tuna , such as the bluefin and bigeye tuna are threatened by overfishing , dramatically affecting tuna populations in the atlantic and northwestern pacific oceans . other populations seem to support fairly healthy fisheries ( for example , the central and western pacific skipjack tuna ) , but there is mounting evidence that overfishing threatens tuna fisheries world-wide .
