Emotion     emotions are what people feel . they are very ancient , and can be seen in all mammals . emotions are caused by a complex mixture of hormones and the unconscious mind . only with great difficulty can we control our emotions by conscious effort . they cause mammals to change behaviour according to changes in their situation . in our case they sometimes run against our attempt to live our lives in a logical way . a scientific definition is not simple ; over 90 definitions have been offered by experts . a definition of emotion needs to includes three things : 1. conscious experience ( feelings ) 1. expressions which can be seen by others 1. actions of the body ( 'physiological arousal ' ) here is one definition : in physical terms , emotions involve body systems which have operated for hundreds of millions of years . these are the hormone system , the autonomic nervous system and the 'lower ' brain centres ( hindbrain and midbrain ) . the study of emotions became one of darwin 's books after `` the descent of man '' . he published `` the expression of the emotions in man and animals '' in 1873. he had discovered , by sending letters and a list of questions worldwide , that in different societies emotions were expressed in almost the same way .
