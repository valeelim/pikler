Combinatorial game theory     combinatorial game theory , also known as cgt is a branch of applied mathematics and theoretical computer science that studies combinatorial games , and is distinct from `` traditional '' or `` economic '' game theory . cgt arose in relation to the theory of impartial games , the two-player game of nim in particular , with an emphasis on `` solving '' certain types of combinatorial games . a game must meet several conditions to be a combinatorial game . these are : 1. the game must have at least two players . 1. the game must be sequential ( i.e . players alternate turns . ) 1. the game must have perfect information ( i.e . no information is hidden , as in poker . ) 1. the game must be deterministic ( i.e . non-chance ) . luck is not a part of the game . 1. the game must have a defined amount of possible moves . 1. the game must eventually end . 1. the game must end when one player can no longer move . combinatorial game theory is largely confined to the study of a subset of combinatorial games which are two player , finite , and have a winner and loser ( i.e . do not end in draws . )
