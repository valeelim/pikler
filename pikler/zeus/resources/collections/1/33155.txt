Vas deferens     the vas deferens ( or `` ductus deferens '' ) is a duct in a man â€™ s body . it is also present in other male vertebrates . its function is to carry sperm away from the testes , towards the penis . there are two of these ducts , which are tubes surrounded by smooth muscle . they connect the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm . each tube is about 30 centimeters long . during ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts . that pushes the sperm toward the penis . the sperm go from the vas deferens into the urethra . other male sex glands push out at the same time . there is a surgery called vasectomy that is a method of contraception . the two vasa deferentia ( latin plural ) are cut and sealed , so the sperm can not get out of the body . this is usually permanent , but in some cases it can be reversed . sometimes instead of cutting the vas deferentia , the surgeon puts something to block the sperm instead of cutting them . related pages . - cystic fibrosis
