Germ theory of disease     the germ theory of disease is a theory in biology . it says that small organisms ( called germs ) , also known as microbes , cause diseases . most , but not all diseases are infectious diseases . the germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected . the body 's reaction to infection is called a disease . many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms . even after the microscope was invented , people still did n't know that germs caused diseases . people long believed that `` bad air '' from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases . so people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the `` bad air . '' scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air . but people still got sick and even died , so this theory was wrong . polluted air is not the cause of disease . one problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated . spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat . that old theory is called abiogenesis . in the seventeenth century , francesco redi ( february 18 , 1626 â€“ march 1 , 1697 ) discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots . prior to this , people thought that maggots came from rotting meat . he discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it . no maggots were found on the sealed meat . he also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze . maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar . but when he placed meat in an open jar , maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar . experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs , not from rotting meat . later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air . diseases are spread by infection .
