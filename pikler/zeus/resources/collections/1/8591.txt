Lighthouse     a lighthouse is a tall building that has a light near the top . lighthouses are built on the coast of an ocean or lake . the lighthouse protects ships from crashing into shore by sending the light out towards the sea . when sailors see the light , they know to avoid hitting the shore . the light usually turns in a circle so that ships see a flashing light . the light is usually covered by a fresnel lens . this lens enables the light to travel a far distance . one of the most famous lighthouses was the lighthouse of alexandria . it was on an island near the coast . that island was called `` pharos '' . even today , in many languages , the word for `` lighthouse '' comes from the name of the island . almost all lighthouses are automatic now .
