Set     a set is an idea from mathematics . a set has `` members '' ( also called `` elements '' ) . a set is fixed by its members . it is the only set which has the same members . ( if set `` x '' and set `` y '' have the same members , then `` x = y '' . a set can not have the same member twice - never more than once . membership is the only thing that means anything . for example , there is no order or other distinction among the members . ) one particular set is the `` empty set '' ( also called the `` null set '' ) . the empty set has `` no '' members . `` anything '' can be a member of a set . a set can be a member of a set . ( if a set is a member of itself , beware of russell 's paradox . ) most mathematicians use uppercase `` italic '' ( usually roman ) letters to write about sets . the things that are seen as elements of sets are usually written with lowercase roman letters . one way of showing a set is by a list of its members , separated by commas , included in braces . for example , - x= { 1,2,3 } is set which has members 1 , 2 , and 3. another way is by a statement of what is true of the set , like this :
