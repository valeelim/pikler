( the males are larger . ) most pumas live up to 21 years . although pumas are very large and some are larger than humans , the puma is classified is a small cat . that means that , in scientific terms , the puma is more closely related to the domestic cat than they are to lions . unlike the big cats in the genus `` panthera '' , the puma can not roar . instead , it can growl , hiss , screech , and purr . since pumas are , in the biological sense , small cats , they are capable of purring continuously . the big cats can only purr while breathing out . pumas are carnivores because they eat only meat . they hunt deer , raccoons , squirrels , foxes , rabbits and skunks . they can also eat mice , beavers , coyotes , birds and porcupines . they hunt at night . cougars can see better at night than what people can . they can hear well too . pumas stalk their prey , which means they walk slowly and quietly , they hide and then when close , they jump or run fast to catch their prey in a very sneaky way . they live and hunt alone . female cougars take care of their babies until they are old enough to take care for themselves . baby cougars are called cubs or kittens .
