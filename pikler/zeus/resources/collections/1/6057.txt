Brush     a brush can be a lot of different things . all brushes have a long part at one end to hold ( the handle ) , and hairs or bristles ( short , hard hairs or pieces of plastic ) on the other end ( the head ) , and we use them for cleaning , making hair look good , or painting . there are a lot of sorts of brushes for cleaning , for example toothbrushes or brushes for cleaning the floor . we use paint brushes for putting ink or paint on paper . in computer software there are sometimes ditigal paintbrushes for making pictures , too . paint brushes can have three shapes : - round : the long , close-together bristles of these brushes mean they can hold more paint . this is why many artists like them for painting large things and for color washes . - flat : these are good for spreading paint . - fan-shaped : these mix paint well . brush care . - clean paint from brushes after you use them . this is very important for oil and acrylic paint because when the paint is dry , taking it off can break the brush . - never leave brushes in water ( etc . ) with the bristle end down . this is because the bristles can change shape .
