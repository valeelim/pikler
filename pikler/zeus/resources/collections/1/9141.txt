Scandinavia     scandinavia is a group of countries in northern europe . it always includes denmark , norway and sweden . the term is most often used linguistically , to mean places that speak scandinavian languages ( also called the north germanic languages ) . the scandinavian languages ( swedish , norwegian , danish ) are closely related , and many scandinavians are able to understand some of the other languages , with some difficulty . the scandinavian peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern europe over the north side of the baltic sea . norway , sweden and some of finland are on this peninsula . however , denmark , but not finland , is seen as part of scandinavia in the ethic sense . this is because danish is a scandinavian language but finnish is not . the term nordic countries is sometimes used as a more correct geographical term , but the nordic countries include norway , sweden , denmark ( including the faroe islands ) , finland and iceland . these five countries coordinate political and cultural activities through the nordic council . denmark , sweden and finland are also members of the european union , but only finland is part of the eurozone , meaning that it uses the euro as its currency . the other nordic countries still use their own currencies , called `` krone '' or `` krona '' ( `` crowns '' ) . norway and iceland , which are not members of the eu , are members of nato and the european free trade association ( efta ) . only denmark is a member of both the eu and nato .
