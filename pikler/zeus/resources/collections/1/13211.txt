Masturbation     masturbation is when a person touches their own sex organs to have pleasure . it often results in an orgasm . masturbating may be done alone , but can also be done with another person . this is called `` mutual masturbation '' . vibrators and dildos can be used to make masturbation easier or feel better , but it is often done with just a person 's hand . studies have shown that a large number of people masturbate regularly . some people do it once or twice a month , while other people do it several times a day . the female sex organ most sensitive to touch is the clitoris . therefore , female masturbation almost always involves stimulating the clitoris , either by hand or with a vibrator . many women also enjoy the feeling of fingers or a sex toy in the vagina , however this is a secondary sensation that is not necessary for orgasm , and that rarely results in orgasm on its own . some women find stimulation of the front vaginal wall , or g spot , particularly pleasurable . the anus is rich in nerve endings and is also sometimes stimulated during masturbation , as are the nipples .
