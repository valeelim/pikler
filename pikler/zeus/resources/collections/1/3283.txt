Gas     a gas is one of the four most common states of matter . in a gas the molecules move freely and are independent of each other . this makes it different from a liquid where the molecules are loosely attached . it is also different from a solid where the bonds are strong and hold the molecules together . in a pure gas , each molecule may be made of an individual atom . it may be elemental , where each molecule is made of more than one of the same atom bound together . it may be compounds where molecules are made of many types of atoms together . an example of a monoatomic gas is neon , an example of an elemental gas is hydrogen and an example of a compound gas is carbon dioxide . a gas mixture contains a mix of any of the above types , for example air which is 78 % nitrogen , 20 % oxygen and 2 % argon and carbon dioxide . poison gases were used as chemical weapons in world war i but were later banned . natural gas is a natural mixture of methane and other gases . all gases can flow , like liquids . this means the molecules move about independently of each other . most gases are colourless , like hydrogen . gas particles will spread about , or diffuse , in order to fill all the space in any container such as a bottle or a room . compared to liquids and solids , gases have a very low density and viscosity . we can not directly see most gases since they are n't coloured . however it is possible to measure their density , volume , temperature and pressure .
