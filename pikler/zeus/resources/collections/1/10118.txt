Torah     torah ( ) is a hebrew word that means `` instructions '' . when most people say the word torah they are either referring to the whole jewish bible , the tanakh , the first 5 books of the bible or all of the jewish teaching in general . these five books are the beginning of both the jewish and christian bibles . the five books are : 1. genesis ( ) , 1. exodus ( ) , 1. leviticus ( ) , 1. numbers ( ) and 1. deuteronomy ( ) . other names for this set of books are the `` five books of moses , '' or `` pentateuch '' ( a greek word ) some people may use the word torah as a name for all the main jewish teachings . each of the books in the torah are separated into parts called `` '' parshiyot '' . '' `` parsha '' is a hebrew word meaning `` portion . '' every shabbat one `` parsha '' is read in the synagogue , but sometimes two are read . this is so that all the `` parshiyot '' are finished every year , on the jewish holiday of simchat torah .
