Ido     ido is a constructed language , a so-called reformed esperanto , which was developed in 1907. ido was made by a group of people that thought esperanto was too hard to be a world language . they did not like how esperanto used letters with special diacritic marks over them , because that made it hard to type , and they thought that a world language should be easy to learn and write . ido is not as popular as esperanto , but still about 100-200 people in the world speak it . they have a conference every year where people come together and speak the language . ido is easy to learn for many reasons : - the speaker says ido the same way it is written . in english , the words `` doughnut '' , `` tough '' , and `` through '' all have the letters `` ough '' , but the speaker says them differently . in ido , the word `` skolo '' is `` sko-lo '' , the word `` multa '' is `` mool-ta '' , and so on . - verbs ( action words ) all act the same - in english the speaker says `` i learn , you learn , we learn , she learns '' . in ido the verb is always the same - `` '' .
