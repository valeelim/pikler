Rugby football     rugby football is a sport that people play around the world . many people play rugby in the uk , australia , new zealand , ireland , italy , france , south africa , argentina , japan , usa , canada the pacific islands and some 100+ other countries . it is the world 's premier oval ball football and is usually just called `` rugby '' . rugby football is named after rugby school , the school in england where it was developed . legend has it that one day in 1823 , a senior boy called william webb ellis elected to run with the ball rather than retiring to kick it as was the normal mode of play in rugby school football matches . `` running in '' was not considered quite the done thing then but was later formalised in the laws of rugby football ( first published in 1846 ) . association football was not formalised until 1863 and even then allowed handling of the ball , but not catching it and running with it . in the mid 1860 's an attempt was made to provide one set of laws for all football but there were irreconcilable differences , mainly concerning `` hacking '' ( dispossessing an opponent of the ball by kicking him in the shins ) . the `` hackers '' went on to eventually play rugby football even though hacking was barred a few years later . the `` anti-hackers '' went on to form association football , eventually banning any handling .
