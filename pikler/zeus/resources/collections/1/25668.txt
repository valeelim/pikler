Medieval commune     medieval townspeople in western europe during the period of the high middle ages needed protection from lawless nobles and bandits . the walled city was protection from direct assault , but once a townsperson left the city walls , he or she was at the mercy of often violent and lawless nobles in the countryside . because much of medieval europe lacked central authority to provide protection , such as a police force ( to use a modern analogy ) , each city had to provide its own protection for citizens both inside the city walls , and outside . in order to do this towns formed what are called communes . every town had its own commune and no two communes were alike , but at the heart , communes `` were sworn alliegences of mutual defense '' . when a commune was formed , all particpitating members gathered and swore an oath together , in public , they would defend each other in time of trouble . in addition they would swear to maintain the peace within the city proper . what did it mean for a commune member to defend another ? obviously if a commune member was attacked outside the city it was too late to call for help as it would be unlikely anyone would be around in time . instead the commune would promise to exact revenge on the attacker , the promise of revenge being a form of defense . however , what would happen if the attacker was a noble who had a castle , too strong for the townspeople ? this was often the case and certainly the town commune could not muster the forces to attack a castle . instead they might attack the nobles family , or burn his crops , or kill his serfs , or destroy his orchards . it was eye for eye violent revenge .
