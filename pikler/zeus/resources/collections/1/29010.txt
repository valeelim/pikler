Turing machine     turing machine is a term from computer science . a turing machine is a system of rules , states and transitions rather than a `` real '' machine . it was first described in 1936 by english mathematician alan turing . there are two purposes of a turing machine . either it can be used to decide a formal language or it solves mathematical functions . turing machines are one of the most important formal models in the study of computer science . a turing machine consists of the following components ( simplified ) : - a limited set of states ( with one state marked as `` start state '' ; while running , a turing machine always has a `` current state '' ) - an infinite tape with storage cells and a `` read/write-device '' that can move on the tape - a definition of a so-called `` transition function '' also , a working-alphabet ( set of characters ) has to be defined . when a turing machine is started , a word ( out of the working-alphabet ) must be present on the infinite tape of the machine . the read/write-device on the first character now reads the first character and depending on the current state of turing machine the read/write-device overwrites the character with a new one or moves one cell to the left or to the right . furthermore the current state of the machine can be switched .
