String theory     string theory is a set of attempts to model the four known fundamental interactions—gravitation , electromagnetism , strong nuclear force , weak nuclear force—together in one theory . this tries to resolve the alleged conflict between classical physics and quantum physics by `` elementary units '' —the one classical force : gravity , and a new quantum field theory of the other three fundamental forces . einstein had sought a unified field theory to explain the fundamental interactions within one model revealing the mechanics of the universe . yet today 's search for a unified field theory that is `` quantized '' and that explains matter 's structure , too , is called the search for a theory of everything ( toe ) . the most prominent contender as a toe is string theory converted into superstring theory with its 6 higher dimensions in addition to the four common dimensions ( 3d + time ) . some superstring theories seem to come together on a shared range of geometry that , according to string theorists , is apparently the geometry of space . the mathematical framework that unifies the multiple superstring theories upon that shared geometrical range is m-theory . many string theorists are optimistic that m-theory explains our universe 's very structure and perhaps explains how other universes , if they exist , are structured as well . m theory/supergravity theory has 7 higher dimensions + 4d .
