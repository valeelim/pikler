Adam Smith     adam smith ( 16 june 1723 â€“ 17 july 1790 ) was a scottish economist , who is called the father of modern economics . his book , `` an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations '' , published in 1776 , was very important . people call the book just `` the wealth of nations '' . it stated some of the ideas on which modern economics is based off , especially market economics . in the `` wealth of nations '' adam smith asks 'what can a person do that is best for his country ? ' he decides that if every person does what is best for themself and their little circle of family and friends , then the country will do better . this is because every person knows a lot about their own situation ( what they need and what they want , what works and what does not work ) , much more than the government knows . this sort of thinking is called `` liberal theory '' , a main part of liberalism . he was also a philosopher who wanted to know why people thought ( felt ) that some things are good and others bad . he wrote an earlier book , in 1759 , called `` the theory of moral sentiments '' . he thought that empathy was very important in ethics . empathy is when you see how someone else is feeling , imagine what it feels like , and then end up feeling the same way : for smith , empathy is like `` putting yourself in someone else 's shoes '' . for example , empathy makes us feel happy to see someone else who is happy , or feel sorry for someone who is sad . empathy may even make `` us '' feel pain when we see someone in pain ( as if `` we '' had been hurt or affected ) . both smith and his friend david hume , who was another scottish philosopher , wrote about the importance of sympathy in ethics .
