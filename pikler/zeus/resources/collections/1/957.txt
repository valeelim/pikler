Zoo     a zoological garden , zoological park , or zoo is a place where many different species ( types ) of animals are kept so people can see and watch them . modern zoos try not only to be for people 's entertainment , but for education , research , and the conservation and protection of animals . many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out . these modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life , so that they are healthy and behave normal . this is done for the animals , but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature , and not in a zoo . zoos cost money . they educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world . they help people and wildlife successfully coexist . they pursue continuing research and education for people . they preserve crucial natural resources . they work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care . without enough money they can not do these things . many zoos are not like the modern type of zoo . there the animals are held in bad conditions . they are kept in small cages , and they are bored and get sick .
