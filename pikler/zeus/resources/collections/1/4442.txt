Acid     an acid is a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion ( h ) ( generally speaking , this will be a proton ) to another substance . acids have a ph less than 7.0. a chemical can donate a proton if the hydrogen atom is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen , nitrogen , or chlorine . some acids are strong and others are weak . the weak acids hold on to some of their protons , while the strong acids let go of all of them . all acids will release hydrogen ions into solutions . the amount of ions that get released per molecule will determine if the acid is weak or strong . weak acids are acids that partially release the hydrogen atoms that are attached . these acids , then , may lower ph by dissociation of hydrogen ions , but not completely . weak acids generally have a ph value of 4-6 while strong acids have a ph value of 1 to 3. a base is an acid 's `` chemical opposite . '' a base is a substance that will accept the acid 's hydrogen atom . bases are molecules that can split apart in water and release hydroxide ions .
