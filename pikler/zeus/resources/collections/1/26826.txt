Nyx     nyx was the goddess of the night in greek mythology . she came out of chaos . her roman equivalent was nox . nyx could not die . this is because she was sent to earth by the greek gods and goddesses . in his theogony ( how the gods came to be ) , hesiod tells : `` night is born of chaos ; her offspring are many , and telling . with erebus , night gives birth to the following deities : - aether ( `` atmosphere '' ) and hemera ( `` day '' ) . later , on her own , night gives birth to - momus `` blame '' - ponos `` toil '' - moros `` fate '' - thanatos `` death '' - hypnos `` sleep '' , - the oneiroi `` the tribe of dreams '' - the hesperides - the keres and fates - nemesis `` retribution '' - apate `` deception '' - philotes `` friendship '' - geras `` age '' , - and eris `` strife '' . in his description of tartarus , hesiod says further that hemera `` day '' , who is now night 's sister rather than daughter , left tartarus just as nyx entered it ; when hemera returned , nyx left . this mirrors the portrayal of ratri `` night '' in the rig-veda , where she works in close cooperation but also tension with her sister ushas `` dawn '' .
