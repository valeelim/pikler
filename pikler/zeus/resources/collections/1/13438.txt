LGBT     lgbt is an acronym connected with human sexuality . it means lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender , but it can refer to a community of people who are not heterosexual or cisgender . it is a word which has been used since the 1990s , and was a change from the previous acronym lgb or the group of words gay community , because many people in the lgbt community did not think that the group of words accurately described everyone it was referring to . the acronym has become more normal to use now and has been taken up by most sexuality and gender identity-related community centres in america , the english-speaking countries and in other countries where the acronym means something in their languages , such as france and argentina . people who are lgbt are romantically and/or sexually attracted to people of their own gender ( this is also known as their sexual orientation ) ; or they act in a way that most people of their gender would not act ( this is also known as their gender identity ) . before the `` sexual revolution '' of the 1960s , there was no neutral word or group of words for people who were not heterosexual . the group of words `` third gender '' , or third sex , had existence in the 1860s . however , this did not become popular in america .
