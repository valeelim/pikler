Urdu     urdu is the name of one of the languages spoken in south asia . it is the national language of pakistan . it is spoken in pakistan and indian-administered kashmir and is the official language of the country . it is also an official language in india . it is spoken all over india , particularly in the states of andhra pradesh , delhi , and uttar pradesh . the origin of the urdu language is the mughal empire 's word for army , urdu . however , contrary to popular belief , urdu was not created in the army camps of the mughal army . urdu is spoken the same as present-day hindi , but hindi uses the traditional devanagari script ( a decedent of sanskrit ) , whereas urdu uses the persio-arabic alphabet . the poet ghulam hamadani mushafi coined the term urdu for this language in 1780. however , this began to alienate the two major cultures in india/pakistan , the muslims and hindus . hindus began to speak and write hindi , whereas muslims would begin to speak urdu . this also lead to a need to `` cleanse '' urdu of all its sanskrit words and lead hindi speakers to want to be rid of persian words that remained in their language .
