Potential energy     potential energy is the energy that an object has because of its position on a gradient of potential energy called a potential field . - actual energy ( `` e '' = `` h '' '' f '' ) is nonzero‑frequency angular momentum . - potential energy ( rest mass ) is zero‑frequency angular momentum . the potential fields are irrotationally radial ( `` electric '' ) fluxes of the vacuum and divide into two classes : - the gravitoelectric fields ; - the electric fields . the potential energy is negative . it is not a mere convention but a consequence of conservation of energy in the zero-energy universe—as an object descends into a potential field , its potential energy becomes more negative , while its actual energy becomes more positive . negative potential energy is also known as binding energy . in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle , the universe 's matter flows towards ever more negative total potential energy . this cosmic flow is time . bringing a rock uphill increases ( `` i.e . `` , makes less negative ) its gravitoelectric potential energy . stretching a rubber band increases its elastic potential energy , which is a form of the electric potential energy . a mixture of a fuel and an oxidant has a chemical potential energy , which is another form of the electric potential energy . batteries too have chemical potential energy .
