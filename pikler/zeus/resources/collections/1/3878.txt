Relative humidity     relative humidity is a way of describing how much humidity there is in the air , compared to how much there could be . meteorologists often use the relative humidity as a measurement to describe the weather at various places . when the temperature is warm , more water vapor can be in the air than when it is cold . if the actual amount of vapour is compared to the total amount there could be , as a fraction , then the number tells if the air feels dry or moist . the value is usually written in percent , where 0 % means that the air is totally dry , and 100 % means that it is so moist that mist or dew is about to form . when the temperature is lowered a lot , then the water vapour turns into condensation or precipitation , as dew , rain or snow ( etc . ) .
