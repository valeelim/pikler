Touch     touch is one of the five main senses that animals have . it can be called the sense of body or the sense of touch . the system also has internal sensory receptors , and includes sensing temperature and pain . there is a special area in the brain used to processing input of touch . it is in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex . an animal knows if something is against a part of its body . this is called the sense of touch . the process of touching something may be called feeling . tiny touch sense organs under the skin help animals feel hardness , softness , and sharpness , for example . animals also have sense organs which feel temperature and pain . some parts of the body , such as fingertips have many more sense organs than others . when animals touch things , nerve fibres attached to the sense organ sends messages to the brain through the central nervous system . the brain interprets the messages , and animals feel things . humans , and mammals in general , often touch each other . touch is a kind of non-verbal communication . behaviours based on touch are very important for keeping family and group members together ( 'bonding ' ) . it is part of the 'glue ' of their social life . monkeys grooming each other 's fur is a good example .
