Velocity     velocity is a measure of how fast something moves in a particular direction . in other words , a velocity is a speed with a direction . for instance , if an object moves east at 7 metres per second ( 7 m/s ) , we would say that its velocity is 7 m/s to the east . to calculate the velocity of an object , we divide its displacement ( its change of position ) by the time it took to change position.formula_1for example , if an object moves 20 meters ( m ) to the left in 4 seconds ( s ) , its velocity ( v ) would be equal to : formula_2 a change in velocity is acceleration
