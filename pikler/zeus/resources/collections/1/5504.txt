Man     a man is a male adult human . he is the opposite of a woman . we use the word `` man '' ( one `` man '' , two or more `` men '' ) to talk about gender . manhood is the period in a male 's life after he changes from a boy . a boy is a male child , the opposite of a female child ( a girl ) . after boys reach maturity , they can be called a man . like most other male mammals , a man inherits an x chromosome from his mother and a y chromosome from his father . there are some sexual differences between a man and a woman . men have sex organs which we call `` external '' ( not inside the body ) . but many parts of the male reproductive system are internal too . the study of male reproduction and sex organs is `` andrology '' . men normally have the same illnesses as women , but there are some sexual illnesses which men have only , or more often . there are more differences between men and women , not only sexual differences . - some people say men , as a group , are more aggressive than women ; they want to fight more . but most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive .
