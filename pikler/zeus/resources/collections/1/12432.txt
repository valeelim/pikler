Leaning Tower of Pisa     the leaning tower of pisa is a building in pisa , italy . it is a bell tower . it is famous because it is not vertical . in 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing . after that , much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely . there was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years . on 26 april 2011 , the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again . the height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground . its weight is about 14,500 tonnes . it now leans at about 3.99 degrees . the tower has 294 steps . when the second floor was built in 1178 , the tower started to lean . this was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil . the design of this tower was bad from the beginning . construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of pisa were often at war with genoa , lucca , and florence .
