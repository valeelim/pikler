Bamboo     bamboo is a name for over 1,400 species of giant grasses in 115 different genera . all bamboos have wood-like stems . bamboo mainly grows in africa , america and in asia but can easily grow in europe . bamboo grows in clumps ( although running varieties exist ) . the runners can be up to 40 metres ( 130 feet ) . david farrelly , in his book `` the book of bamboo '' , says that bamboo has been measured to grow 1.21 meter ( 47.6 inches ) in a 24-hour period . however , most bamboos ( used for gardening ) will grow more like 3 cm to 5 cm ( 1-2 inches ) a day . almost all species of bamboo have hollow stems divided into nodes or joints . the stem can be up to 30 cm ( a foot ) in diameter . each of the node has one side bud . not all of those buds develop into branches , but some do . this makes bamboo one of the few grasses that have a branch structure . bamboo rarely flowers . some species only flower once , and then die off . the distance of two joints in a bamboo is the basis of a traditional japanese unit of measurement , `` shaku '' .
