Zinc     zinc , sometimes called spelter , is a chemical element . it is a transition metal , a group of metals . it is sometimes considered a post-transition metal . its symbol on the periodic table is `` zn '' . zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table , and has an atomic number of 30. zinc has a mass number of 65.38. it contains 30 protons and 30 electrons . in total , 29 isotopes of zinc are known , and five of these occur in nature . some isotopes are radioactive . their half-lives are between 40 milliseconds for zn and 5x10 years for zn . zinc is a metal that is mostly used for galvanizing and batteries . it is the fourth most common metal . zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal . when it has just been cut , zinc has a whitish-grey color . if it is exposed to air , it will not stay shiny for long . its melting point is at ( ) and boiling point is ( ) . this temperature is lower than most transition metals but higher than tin or lead . it can be melted on a cooking stove . it boils at a low temperature for a metal . it is not magnetic . when heated a little , it becomes very flexible . if it is heated more , it becomes very brittle . it forms alloys easily with other metals .
