Gravitational energy     gravitational energy is the potential energy held by an object because of its high position compared to a lower position . in other words , it is energy associated with gravity or gravitational force . for example , a pen being held above a table has a higher gravitational potential than a pen sitting on the table . gravitational potential energy is mechanical energy minus kinetic energy . it has a scalar quantity measured in joules ( j ) . an object gets gravitational potential energy when it moves uphill . the energy used up when moving up the hill is changed into gravitational potential energy . when the object comes back down again , the gravitational potential energy is turned back into kinetic energy ( movement ) . that is why riding a bike up a steep hill is very hard , but when you are coming back down , you will not need to pedal at all - you are being powered by the gravitational potential energy that you stored when you rode up the hill . another way gravitational potential energy helps us is by keeping earth and the other planets in orbit in our solar system around the sun .
