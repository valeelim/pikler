Interplanetary Internet     an interplanetary internet does not exist yet . when people talk about an interplanetary internet , they are talking about a problem they are still trying to solve - the problem of making the internet to work between different planets . the way the internet works here on earth is simple . computers need to connect to each and can share a network . one computer sends another computer a message ( called a packet ) and then the other sends back a message saying it got it . this works fine because the messages only take a second to get back and forth . but if you were sending that message to mars , it would take about ten minutes for the message to get there , and another ten for it to get back . that means we need to completely change the way computers talk to each other if we are going to communicate between different planets . that is the problem people are trying to solve when they talk about the interplanetary internet . it 's a new and a very interesting concept . other websites .
