Machu Picchu     machu picchu is a pre-columbian 15th-century inca site in peru , in south america . the incas built the city on a mountain ridge , 2430m above sea level . they lived there between 1200 and 1450 ad . other people lived there before about 650 ad . the incas built houses , fields and temples by cutting the rock on the mountain so it was flat . they built an observatory to look at the stars . when the spanish invaded peru , the incas left machu picchu . nobody knows for sure why they did that , but some think it was because they were scared of the spanish . the city was left unfinished , most likely due to the spanish invasion and/or a civil war between the ruling rival inca brothers named huascar and atahualpa . the spanish never found machu picchu or the lost city during their occupation . machu picchu is very difficult to get to because it is so high in the mountains . it has only one way in and a stone wall to protect it . most people on earth did not know it was there until a yale graduate named hiram bingham rediscovered it in 1911. he heard rumours of a hidden city which was already known to the native peruvians , who guided him there . he led a restoration project that was partly funded by the national geographic society . bingham made a deal with the government to take artifacts to the peabody museum for study . peru is still trying to have those artifacts returned to them .
