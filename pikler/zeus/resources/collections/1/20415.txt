Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia     `` sons and daughters of saint lucia '' is the national anthem of saint lucia . the song has been used since the country became independent in 1979 . < poem > sons and daughters of saint lucia , love the land that gave us birth , land of beaches , hills and valleys , fairest isle of all the earth . wheresoever you may roam , love , oh , love your island home . gone the times when nations battled for this 'helen of the west , gone the days when strife and discord . dimmed her children 's toil and rest . dawns at last a brighter day , stretches out a glad new way . may the good lord bless our island , guard her sons from woe and harm ! may our people live united , strong in soul and strong in arm ! justice , truth and charity , our ideal for ever be ! < /poem >
