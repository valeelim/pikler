Market     a market is a place where people go to buy or sell things . when people have products to sell , they set up a market place . there may be a special building for the market place , or the market may be held in an open space where the sellers can put up a stall ( like a kind of tent ) and then take the stall down at the end of the day . the word market can also have a more general meaning in the economy . it can mean the way things are bought or sold . `` there is a big market for dishwashers '' means that lots of people want to buy dishwashers , so therefore a business that makes dishwashers is likely to be able to make a lot of money . when things are sold , people buy the product , and this `` stimulates the economy '' ( helps people to spend and earn money ) . the market needs to balance supply and demand . there is no point in supplying ( making ) lots of dishwashers if people do not want them . in the market prices may change quickly if supply or demand changes . if a seller of a good can not supply what customers want or ask for too high of a price , other sellers may try to supply that good . if other sellers enter the market for that good , in competition , that will tend to fulfill demand and lower prices . sellers do not like competition and may try to kill the competition . sellers that kill competition want to earn profits that they should not get , and they must be stopped by laws .
