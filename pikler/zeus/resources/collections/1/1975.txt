Pacific Ocean     the pacific ocean is the body of water between asia and australia in the west , the americas in the east , the southern ocean to the south , and the arctic ocean to the north . it is the largest named ocean and it covers one-third of the surface of the entire world . it joins the atlantic ocean at a line drawn south from cape horn , chile/argentina to antarctica , and joins the indian ocean at a line drawn south from tasmania , australia to antarctica . as the atlantic slowly gets wider , the pacific is slowly shrinking . it does this by folding the sea floor in towards the center of the earth - this is called subduction . this bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosions of hot rocks and dust . when an earthquake happens under the sea , the quick jerk causes a tsunami . this is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the pacific than anywhere else . many of the earth 's volcanoes are either islands in the pacific , or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean 's edge . plate tectonics are another reason which makes pacific ocean smaller .
