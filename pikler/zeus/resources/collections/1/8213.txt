Movie director     a movie director is a person who helps lead the making of a movie ( or `` film '' ) . they take care of the artistic things in the movie . they give instructions to the actors and direct the people that work on the movie . directors give many of their responsibilities to other members of their movie-making team ( called a movie crew ) . for example , the person who is responsible for the lighting is told by the director what style of lighting he wants and he then creates the lighting for him . it is common for movie directors to work closely with a movie producer . movie producers are people who control the non-artistic side of movie making . for example , they control all the money that is used for making the movie . the amount of control a director has in creating their movie is different for each director . it is most common for directors to have some control , while the rest of the movie-making is controlled by the movie studio ( the area where the movies are made ) , and by the people who pay for the movie . this was very common for american movies made in the 1930s to 1950s . during those years , the studios used many different directors for making a single movie . there are a small number of directors who are given complete control over making their movie . for example , stanley kubrick , jean-luc godard , steven spielberg and james cameron are all movie directors who had a great amount of control in making their movie .
