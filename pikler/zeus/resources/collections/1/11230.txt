Polygon     a polygon is a closed two-dimensional shape . it is also a simple curve that is made up of line segments . it usually has three sides/corners or more . it could also be referred to as 'a closed plane figure bound by three or more line segments ' . it has a number of edges . these edges are connected by lines . a square is a polygon because it has four sides . the smallest possible polygon in a euclidean geometry or `` flat geometry '' is the triangle , but on a sphere , there can be a digon . the monogon is a theoretical figure that can not exist - it has only one side and one edge . if the edges ( lines of the polygon ) do not intersect ( cross each other ) , the polygon is called `` simple '' , otherwise it is `` complex '' . in computer graphics , polygons ( especially triangles ) are often used to make graphics .
