Hatikvah     hatikvah ( also transliterated as hatikva , or , without vowels , h-t-k-v , `` the hope '' ) is the national anthem of israel . the song tells about the 2000-year-old hope of the jewish people to return to their homeland , israel . the song lyrics ( words ) were originally a 9-stanza poem called `` תקותנו '' ( tikvatenu ) , or `` our hope , '' written by naphtali imber . `` hatikvah '' uses only the first stanza and the refrain of imber 's poem . the last line of the refrain was changed , and the words were put to music . the music is from a very old -- and very popular -- folk song that samuel cohen , a jew born in spain , found himself humming one day . it is in a minor key , which is usually not used for national anthems , because it sounds sad , but the words to the song are about the jews ' hope that one day their sadness will be turned into joy . כל עוד בלבב פנימה נפש יהודי הומיה , < br > ולפאתי מזרח קדימה < br > עין לציון צופיה - עוד לא אבדה תקותנו , < br > התקוה בת שנות אלפים , < br > להיות עם חופשי בארצנו < br > ארץ ציון וירושלים . hatikva < br >
