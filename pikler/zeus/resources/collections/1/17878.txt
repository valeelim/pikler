Heinrich Heine     christian johann heinrich heine ( born as `` harry heine '' 13 december 1797–17 february 1856 ) was one of the most significant german poets of the 19th century . heine was born into an assimilated jewish family in düsseldorf , germany . his father was a tradesman . after his father 's business failed , heine was sent to hamburg . his uncle in hamburg was a very successful banker , so heine started learning his business , but he droped it later on . then heine started to study law at the universities of göttingen , bonn and berlin , but he was more interested in literature than in law . he took a degree in law in 1825. at the same time he had decided to convert from judaism to protestantism . this was necessary because of the severe restrictions on jews in the german states . only christians were allowed to have certain businesses or to be clerks of the state . jews were also forbidden to become university professors , which was a particular ambition for heine . heine himself said , his conversion was `` the ticket of admission into european culture '' .
