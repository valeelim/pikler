Socialist Party (England and Wales)    socialist party ( england and wales ) the socialist party is a socialist political party active in england and wales and part of the committee for a workers ' international . they publish a weekly newspaper entitled `` the socialist '' and a monthly `` socialism today '' . as an organisation , it has evolved from the militant tendency , who in the early 1980s started to be expelled from the labour party , for organising a mass campaign against the poll tax . there was a debate with the militant tendency as to whether or not to cease working within the labour party and the majority of the group decided to do so , although a minority around ted grant broke away to form socialist appeal . this debate ran alongside a parallel debate on the future of scottish politics . the result was that the experiment of operating as an `` open party '' was first undertaken in scotland under the name of scottish militant labour . this initiative would eventually lead to the foundation of the scottish socialist alliance . the majority of scottish members , after forming the scottish socialist party , left the cwi in early 2001 as they moved away from traditional trotskyist politics .
