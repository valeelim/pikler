Theorem     a theorem is a proven idea in mathematics . theorems are proved using logic and other theorems that have already been proved . a theorem that someone must prove so that he/she can prove another theorem is called a lemma . theorems are made of two parts , there are hypotheses and conclusions . theorems use deduction , in contrast to theories which are empirical . some theorems are trivial , they directly follow from the propositions . other theorems are called `` deep '' , their proof is long and difficult . sometimes , such proofs involve other areas of mathematics or show connections between different areas . a theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep . an excellent example is fermat 's last theorem , and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics , among other areas . there are other theorems for which a proof is known , but it can not easily be written down . among the best examples are the four color theorem and the kepler conjecture . both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search which is then verified by a computer program . at first , many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof , but it has become more widely accepted in recent years . the mathematician doron zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved . many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation , including polynomial identities , trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities .
