Interlingua     interlingua is a planned language using words that are found in most west-european languages . it was made by iala - a group of people ( the most known was alexander gode ) who worked on it for more than 20 years , and they finished and published the first dictionary in 1951. interlingua was created on the base of languages : english , french , spanish , portuguese , and italian . `` inter '' is the same root word like you see in the words `` interaction '' , `` interface '' and so on , and it means `` between '' or `` to each other '' ; `` lingua '' means `` language '' . they chose the name interlingua because they wanted it to be used for people of different countries to talk to each other easily . because interlingua was made by people to be easy , it is easier than natural languages to learn . many thousands of people know interlingua , and interlingua speakers say that millions can understand it ( read texts in it and listen to someone talk in it ) without having to learn it first . there are two other planned languages in the world that have more than 1000 speakers , esperanto and ido . those two were made before interlingua . some people think esperanto and ido are easy to learn because they have no `` exceptions '' ( words that break the rules ) but other people think interlingua is easier because the makers chose all the words to be easy to understand for people who know english , french , spanish , portuguese , or italian , plus languages like occitan and romanian , languages that used to be latin , the language used in rome a long time ago .
