Ionizing radiation     ionizing radiation is a process in physics where something sends out particles or waves that can ionize an atom or molecule through atomic interactions . the strength of ionizing radiation depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves , and not a function of the number of particles or waves present . ionizing radiation can be electromagnetic radiation or subatomic particles . electromagnetic : - gamma rays are electromagnetic waves of highest energy . - x-rays are less energetic . - ultraviolet radiation only ionizes some materials . subatomic particle radiation includes : - alpha particle radiation , made of helium nuclei - beta particle radiation , made of energetic electrons or positrons - neutron radiation , made of neutrons some radiation can go through the human body and other objects . usually when people use the term radiation , they are talking specifically about potentially harmful types of ionizing radiation . if something produces this sort of radiation , we can say it is radioactive .
