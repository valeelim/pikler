Liberalism     liberalism is a way of thinking about politics and government . some liberals believe that freedom is impossible without equality , and that governments should promote egalitarianism by providing education and health care supported by taxes . other liberals believe that taxes are bad , and that people should provide their own education and health care ; these people are usually called libertarians today . most liberal governments today do provide at least some education and health care , though not necessarily equally for all citizens . other concepts important to some liberals include : - `` free markets '' ( market economy ) – people should be free to buy and sell goods and services . - peace– people should not start wars or use violence . in the old days , kings or queens told people what to do ( a form of government called a monarchy ) , and there was very little freedom . a few hundred years ago , philosophers such as simón bolívar , john stuart mill and jeremy bentham began to write about freedom . earlier writers , such as marcus aurelius , had written about freedom , but this time the idea caught on . the united states of america was the first country to have a constitution which was based on the ideas of mill and bentham , and which guaranteed certain rights to all citizens , including freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , the right to assemble ( get together in groups ) , the right to bear arms ( weapons ) , and the right to ask their government to take action ( right of petition ) or to remove from office rulers they did not like ( right of referendum ) .
