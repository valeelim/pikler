DOS     a disk operating system ( dos ) will load from a floppy disk each time a computer starts , and will access that disk for software to complete operations . ms-dos is probably the most well-known dos , and was purchased by microsoft corporation from a system known as qdos . as operating systems became more complicated and took up more space , they began to be permanently installed on hard drives , which are faster and more reliable than floppy disks , and can store more data . this was encouraged by a steady drop in hard drive prices . `` dos '' es are usually text-based and without graphics to save space on a floppy disk . although doses have mostly been replaced by windows , macintosh , and linux systems , among others ( sporting a gui , or graphical user interface ) , they are still in use in some places , mostly on older computers . this may be because of a lack of money , the need to use software which still runs on a dos system , nostalgia for an older operating system , or the belief that text-based systems are more efficient .
