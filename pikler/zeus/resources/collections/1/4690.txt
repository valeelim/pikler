Computer mouse     a computer mouse is an input device that is most often used with a personal computer . moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen . items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons ( called clicking ) . it is called a computer mouse because of the wire that connects the mouse to the computer . the people who designed the first computer mice thought that it looked like the tail on a mouse . today , many computer mice use wireless technology and have no wire . in 1964 douglas engelbart ( 1925-2013 ) , a researcher at stanford research institute , wanted to find a way to make using computers easier . in those days , computers were large and expensive . using them was very hard because everything had to be typed in by hand , and there was no way to alter things if you made a mistake . after studying and designing for a long time , engelbart succeeded in inventing an input device which he named 'xy index ' . at first , it needed two hands to use , but it was changed so that only one hand was needed to use it . this model was more like the mouse that we use today . xerox palo alto research introduced a gui in 1981 , using a mouse .
