Phasor     a phasor is a tool in mathematics . it is used to show numbers in a different coordinate system . certain electronic components have models that can be described more easily by the use of phasors . inductors add a +90ยบ `` phase '' , while capacitors add -90ยบ `` phase '' . both elements work on the imaginary axis . resistors have 0ยบ `` phase '' , and are considered real .
