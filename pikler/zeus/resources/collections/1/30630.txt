Concerto grosso     a concerto grosso is a piece of music from the 18th century in which there are a small group of instruments and a large group of instruments . these two groups are contrasted with one another . sometimes both play together , sometimes one plays by itself , or the two groups might imitate one another . the small group is called “ concertino ” and the large group is called `` tutti '' , “ ripieno ” or “ concerto grosso ” ( the same name as the musical piece ) . “ concerto grosso ” is italian for “ big concerto ” . the plural is “ concerti grossi ” . notice that the second “ c ” in “ concerto ” is pronounced like an english “ ch ” . a concerto grosso has several parts that differ in speed and character . there are usually three movements ; the first is fast , the second is slow , and the last is fast . the first movement contrasts the tutti and the soloists , the second movement is quiet , while the last movement is lively . the composer who made the concerto grosso very popular was the italian arcangelo corelli ( 1653-1713 ) . the instruments in the small group of soloists in his concerti grossi were usually two violins and one cello . george frideric handel ( 1685-1759 ) also used that combination for his concerti grossi .
