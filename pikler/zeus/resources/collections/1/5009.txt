Radio wave     radio waves make up part of the electromagnetic spectrum . these waves are packets of energy with differing wavelengths , similar to visible light waves , x-rays or gamma rays , except longer . a radio wave , like other electromagnetic waves , is similar to an ocean wave or any other type of wave . both types of wave have a hill and valley shape , repeating over and over . a wavelength is measured as the distance from the top of one crest to the top of its neighboring crest . while the wavelength of visible light is very very small , less than one micrometer and much less than the thickness of a human hair , radio waves can have a wavelength from a couple centimeters to several meters . they also have a radio frequency . the smallest radio waves are called microwaves . shortwaves are not quite so small . there are also medium and long waves . antennas designed to send and receive radio waves are usually similar in size to the wavelength they are to use . many radio antennas ( like those on cars ) are made long because they receive signals of fm radio ( a few meters , several feet ) or am radio ( hundreds of meters , about a thousand feet ) .
