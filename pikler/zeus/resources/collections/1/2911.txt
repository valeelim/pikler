Telescope     a telescope is an important tool for astronomy that gathers light and directs it to a single point . some do this with curved mirrors , some with curved lenses , and some with both . telescopes make faraway things look bigger , brighter and closer . galileo was the first person to use a telescope for astronomy , but he did not invent them . the first telescope was invented in the netherlands in 1608. some telescopes , not mainly used for astronomy , are `` binoculars , '' `` camera lenses '' , or `` spyglasses '' . the word `` telescope '' is usually used for light your eyes can see , but there are telescopes for `` invisible '' light . infrared telescopes look like normal telescopes , but have to be kept cold since all warm things give off infrared light . radio telescopes are like radio antennas , usually shaped like large dishes . x-ray and gamma ray telescopes have a problem because the rays go through most metals and glasses . to solve this problem , the mirrors are shaped like a bunch of rings inside each other so the rays strike them at a shallow angle and are reflected . these telescopes are space telescopes because not enough of this radiation reaches the earth . other space telescopes are put in orbit so the earth 's atmosphere does not interfere .
