Domestication     domestication is a change that happens in wild animals or plants , when they are kept by humans for a long time . if humans take wild animals and plants and keep and breed them , over time the animals and plants may change . the animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them , and they change in ways that are better for human use . this change ( domestication ) happens by humans choosing which animals will breed the next generation . biologists call this method artificial selection . the first domestication of plants happened during the first use of agriculture . humans first domesticated dogs . after the invention of agriculture , people domesticated sheep and goats , and later cattle and pigs . domesticated plants are crops or ornamental plants . people use domesticated animals as livestock , that means for food , clothing , and work . otherwise , the domesticated animals may be kept as pets . the origin of the domestic dog ( `` canis lupus familiaris '' ) began with the domestication of the grey wolf ( `` canis lupus '' ) several tens of thousands of years ago . domesticated dogs provided early humans with a guard animal , a source of food , fur , and a working animal ( hunting , pulling sleds ) . the process continues to this day .
