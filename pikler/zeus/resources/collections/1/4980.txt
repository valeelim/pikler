Martin Luther     martin luther ( 10 november 1483 in eisleben - 18 february 1546 in eisleben ) was a german monk and theologian of christianity . he is credited with starting the protestant reformation . as this happened , what are now called protestant churches split from the roman catholic church . he started the lutheran church , the first protestant church . luther studied philosophy at the university of erfurt . in 1505 , he entered into the augustinian order as a monk . luther studied theology and ancient languages in erfurt . in 1512 he became a doctor of theology in wittenberg and began his lectures on the psalms and letters of paul . in october 1517 , luther wrote his 95 theses . many people think that he put them on the door of a church in wittenberg , but this is not sure . instead , he published a copy . he presented these to church officials at worms cathedral . luther called them `` the disputation of doctor martin luther on the power and efficacy of indulgences '' . it questioned the teaching of the western church and its ideas about penance , the authority of the pope and the usefulness of `` indulgences '' . at that time , the catholic church was selling indulgences to get out of purgatory , and go right to heaven after death . they were selling indulgences for money for the dead so they could go to heaven faster . if that was true , it would mean that poor people would not be able to go to heaven as quickly , but that the priests in the church would be rich from selling these things . luther thought that this was all wrong , and was against the bible .
