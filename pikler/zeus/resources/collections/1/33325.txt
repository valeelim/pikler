Common wombat     the common wombat , `` vombatus ursinus '' , is one of three wombat species living in australia . it is found the mountains and hills of southeast australia , tasmania , and flinders island in bass strait . they look like a small bear , which is what the name `` ursinus '' means . it is a marsupial , a type of mammal that carried its young in a pouch . it is the largest burrowing plant-eating mammal in the world . its closest living relative is the koala . they are a short and muscular animal that walks on four strong legs . the feet and claws are designed to help the wombat dig tunnels in rocky ground . they are between 70–120 cm in length and weigh between 15–35 kg . it is covered in a very rough and coarse fur which can be anywhere from black to silver grey , from dark brown to sandy brown . wombats have very tough skin on their rump . wombats live alone but meet up to breed in april to june on mainland australia . in tasmania the breeding can occur at any time of the year . the young wombats are tiny , about two cm long , when they are born after a gestation of only 21 days , and move into the mother 's pouch . wombats normally only have one baby although the pouch has two nipples . unlike a kangaroo , the pouch opens backwards , which would prevent it from filling with dirt as it crawls into its burrow . the young wombat lives in the pouch for about six months , and finally becomes independent of the mother at about 18 months of age . wombats live for about five years , although some in captivity have lived for 26 years .
