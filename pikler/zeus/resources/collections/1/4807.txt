Anarchism     anarchism is a political belief that no government is supposed to exist . anarchists also believe that participation should never be forced by other people . a major question in anarchism is , `` what is consent '' ? anarchists often do not believe in the consent of the governed . anarchism is `` a cluster of doctrines and attitudes centered on the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary . '' the word `` anarchism '' is from the greek αναρχία , which means `` without rulers '' , not `` without rule '' ; it is also occasionally translated as `` without government '' . in the common language , the word `` anarchy '' is often used to describe chaos or anomie . however , anarchists usually do not want this . rather , they define `` anarchy '' as a way of relations between people . they believe that , once put into place , these relations work on their own . anarchists are usually opposed by the institutions they wish to topple , as well as the general masses who tend to follow a pragmatic philosophy of antidisestablishmentarianism .
