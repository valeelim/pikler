Odd number     can only odd numbers be prime ? what about considering irrational and fraction numbers or decimal approximations of each of these ? does it matters where one rounds the answer to ? an integer that is not an odd number is an even number . some sequential even numbers are : { 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 ... } . an even number is defined as a whole number that is a multiple of two . if an even number is divided by two , the result is another whole number . on the other hand , an odd number , when divided by two , will result in a fraction . since odd and even numbers are defined only in reference to the set of integers ( ... , −3 , −2 , −1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) , all negative numbers can also be either odd or even . to find the set of odd natural numbers , we use 2 '' n '' +1 where `` n '' is any natural number starting with 0 .
