Anchor     anchors are used to stop boats from moving . today , anchors are usually made of metal , and they are made to catch the ocean floor ( the seabed ) . there are two main types of anchors : temporary and permanent . a permanent anchor is called a `` mooring block '' and is not easily moved . a temporary anchor can be moved and is carried on the boat . when people talk about anchors , they are usually thinking about temporary anchors . an anchor works by either weight ( mass ) or shape . shape is more important to temporary anchors , and design is very important . anchors must resist wind and tide , and also the up-and-down movement of waves . the oldest anchors were just rocks , and many rock anchors have been found from a long time ago . many modern moorings still use a large rock as the mooring block . a simple anchor which uses two arms made of wood , and a rock weight , is an anchor which is still used today . the wood arms are sharp to enter the seabed , and the weight will hold normal movement . the english language uses several special words to describe parts of anchors . this is because england has a rich marine and naval history , and so the language gives a large number of words to boat and ship terminology .
