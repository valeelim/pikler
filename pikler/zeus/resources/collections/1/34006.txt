OpenGL     opengl is a programming interface for 3d graphics which helps computer programmers make their 3d graphics perform better and faster by running parts of their programs on a video card ( gpu ) rather than just the central processor ( cpu ) . programming interfaces like opengl are usually called an `` api , '' which stands for `` application programming interface '' . opengl is often compared to direct3d , an api for 3d graphics on windows . programming for direct3d is different in some ways because the apis use different naming schemes for talking to a computer 's graphics driver , which means that programmers need to write different code for opengl and direct3d to do the same things . opengl is owned by the khronos group , and is an example of open source software . this means that all of opengl 's programming , and the explanations for how the programming all works , can be viewed , copied , revised , and re-released by anyone .
