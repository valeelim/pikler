Manhole     a manhole ( also called a utility hole , cable chamber , maintenance hole , inspection chamber , access chamber or confined space ) is a hole for a person to go into to fix underground services . some examples of these are sewers , telephone , electricity , storm drains and gas . the opening is protected by a manhole cover . a manhole cover can also be called a `` biscuit '' . it is designed to stop people falling down the hole and to stop people going underground if they are not allowed to . manholes usually have metal or polypropylene steps on the wall to make it easier to get into the manhole . manholes are usually found in urban areas , in streets and sometimes under sidewalks . they are usually circular to stop the manhole cover from falling into the hole . in urban areas , electricity being in places it is not supposed to be ( stray voltage ) has become a big concern . in 2004 , jodie s. lane was electrocuted after stepping on a metal manhole cover . she was walking her dog in new york city when it happened .
