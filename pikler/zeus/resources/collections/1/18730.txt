Snowboarding     snowboarding is a sport that is much like skiing . a person stands on a `` snowboard '' and rides down a mountain covered with snow . a snowboard is a flat board with bindings that hold your feet in place while gliding down the mountain . it is different from skiing because both feet are on one board - like surfing . some snowboarders like to ride over jumps and do tricks . the snowboard was born in the seventy 's through the imagination of several different americans . the original idea was born in 1965 through sherman poppen . he invented the ‘ ’ snurfer ‘ ’ , which was made of two skis fixed together , as a gift to his daughter . it soon became very popular , so he licensed it to the brunswick corporation who sold about a million over the next 10 years . in the mid 1970 's dimitrije milovich created a snowboard inspired by the surfing board called the 'winterstick ' . finally , in 1977 jake burton carpenter helped by tom sims and chuck barfoot created the first snowboard model , which made them very rich .
