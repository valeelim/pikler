Geta (footwear)    geta ( footwear ) geta are traditional japanese sandals . they are stilted to keep the hem of a kimono above the ground . they are worn with tabi socks . geta makes the person 's feet stay out of the mud . usually japanese people wear them with a casual kimono rather than formal one . it is common to wear them with bare feet when a yukata is worn . also they are worn with western clothes . today , in japan , most people rarely wear kimono and rarely wear geta . one reason for this is most gravel roads were changed to asphalt roads for tokyo olympic . since 1995 , the number of people who wear geta casually increased because of the pretty looks and sounds . in addition , the popularity of geta grew little by little through trend for yukata . at one time , japanese people thought that it is hard to walk with geta and sometimes get injured by hanao . hanao is a rope which is set between the big toe and second toe when geta are worn . however , because of efforts by yukata makers and footwear makers , japanese people are starting to like to wear geta again .
