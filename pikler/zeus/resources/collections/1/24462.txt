Spiritism     spiritism is a doctrine promoted by the french professor allan kardec . his first two books were : - `` the spirits ' book '' — defines the guidelines of the doctrine , covering points like god , spirit , universe , man , society , culture , morals and religion . - `` the mediums ' book '' — details the mechanics of the spiritual world , the processes involved in channeling spirits , techniques to be developed by mediums , etc . other characteristics ideas of his were : - promoting the dialog between the three classical forms of knowledge ( science , philosophy and religion ) for achieving a more complete comprehension of the reality ; - submitting the fundamental points of the religious systems to a critical and empirical exam , for separating fantasy and reality . this way , men can avoid materialism and dogmatism at once , being critical and spiritual . - emphasizing human power and responsibility for acting , creating and changing the world around . although kardec claimed it was distinct , spiritism is similar to spiritualism . kardec 's books were based on reporting séances in which he claimed to observe phenomena which he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ( spirits ) . arthur conan doyle included a chapter about spiritism in his book `` history of spiritualism '' . this said that spiritism is spiritualist ( but not vice-versa ) . as a consequence , many spiritualist works are widely accepted in spiritism , particularly the works of scientists sir william crookes and oliver lodge .
