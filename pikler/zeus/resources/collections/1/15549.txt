Jack the Ripper     jack the ripper is the name given to an unidentified serial killer . he was active during the summer and autumn of 1888 in the whitechapel district of london , england , which was known for its overpopulation and prostitution . the main victims thought to be killed by the ripper were five prostitutes : - mary ann nichols - 47 years old ( 31 august ) - annie chapman - 42 years old ( 8 september ) - elizabeth stride - 44 years old ( 30 september ) - catharine eddowes - 46 years old ( 30 september ) - mary jane kelly - around 40 years old ( 14 november ) newspapers and police in london around this time started to get taunting letters . the letters were signed `` jack the ripper '' . other murders were reported around the same time , but were not thought to be done by jack the ripper.he was also known to have sex with his victims before he killed them . nobody knows who jack the ripper really was . some think he might have been a doctor or a butcher because of how he killed and cut up the women , much like how a surgeon might perform surgery , or how a butcher might dissect an animal . all the murders happened on weekends , so it could have been someone who did not live in london but visited the city on weekends , or someone who worked during the week and was only free at the weekends .
