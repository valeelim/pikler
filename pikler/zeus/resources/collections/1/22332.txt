Conduction     conduction in physics is about forms of energy such as light , heat or electricity . - heat conduction takes place between two objects in contact with each other . heat energy moves from one material to the other . in heat conduction , the heat energy travels from the hot point to a cold point . eventually , the two materials will even out in temperature as the heat keeps on transferring until the temperatures are the same . this is equilibrium . for example , a pan of hot soup is taken off the oven and put on a table . the area of the table under the pot gets hot . heat from the pot moved to the table top by conduction . - electrical conduction is usually done through wires or cables . something that electrons can easily move through is a good conductor . metals are mostly good conductors . an insulator like rubber is a poor conductor . plastics are insulators . some materials , such as glass , are conductors for heat but not electricity . - light is another type of energy . it can be transmitted through light cables by fibre optics . fibre optic communication is of the greatest importance to telecommunication and computer networking .
