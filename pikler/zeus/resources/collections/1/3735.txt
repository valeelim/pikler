Lithium     lithium ( from greek `` lithos '' 'stone ' ) is a soft , silver-white metal with symbol li . it is the third chemical element in the periodic table . this means that it has 3 protons in its nucleus and 3 electrons around it . its atomic number is 3. its mass number is 6.94. it has two common isotopes , li and li . li is more common . 92.5 % of lithium is li . lithium is a soft silvery metal that is very reactive . it is used in lithium batteries and certain medicines . lithium is one of the alkali metals . lithium is a silvery solid metal ( when freshly cut ) . it is very soft . thus it can be cut easily with a knife . it melts at a low temperature . it is very light , similar to wood . it is the least dense metal and the least dense element in a solid or liquid state . it can hold more heat than any other solid element . it conducts heat and electricity easily . it will react with water , giving off hydrogen to form a basic solution ( lithium hydroxide ) . because of this , lithium must be stored in petroleum jelly . sodium and potassium can be stored in oil but lithium can not because it is so light . it will just float on the oil and not be protected by it .
