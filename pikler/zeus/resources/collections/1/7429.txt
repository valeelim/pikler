Golden Gate Bridge     the golden gate bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses over the san francisco bay , going from san francisco to marin county , in the u.s. state of california . it was opened for use in 1937. when the bridge was finished , its length of 9,266 ft ( 2824 m ) made it the longest bridge in the world . now there are several bridges that are longer , but for many people , it is still one of the most beautiful bridges in the world . before the bridge , the only way to go north from san francisco to marin county was by ferryboat . the trip by ferry took 20 minutes to complete . before the bridge was built , san francisco was the biggest american city still served mostly by ferries . some experts did not think that people could build a bridge because the water currents between marin and san francisco were very strong . also , the water was very deep in the middle - 102 m - and there was a lot of wind and fog that could make building a bridge difficult . in 1916 , san francisco 's city engineer asked other engineers to offer ideas for a bridge . one man , joseph strauss , designed a very cheap bridge - only $ 17 million , but many thought it was ugly . local authorities asked him to change the design and to work with other experts . he agreed . he and other experts , especially architect irving morrow , designed the bridge again , this time as a suspension bridge . a suspension bridge has tall towers that hold long cables , and the cables hold up or `` suspend '' the bridge .
