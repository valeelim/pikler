Belaying     belaying is a way to hold and control a rope for a person who is rock climbing . a climber has to be attached to a rope so they do not fall very far . a person on the ground who is belaying is called a `` belayer '' . the belayer usually puts the rope through a `` belay device '' , which lets the rope move through the device in one direction ( as the climber being belayed goes up ) . if the climber falls , the device lets the belayer also hold the rope still , so the climber hangs in the air but does not hit the ground . a belayer can hold the weight of the climber with the rope and help prevent an injury causing fall .
