Plane (mathematics)    plane ( mathematics ) a plane is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions . try to imagine the ceiling of a room , only extended into all directions infinitely . a plane has two dimensions : length and width . all planes are flat surfaces . if a surface is not flat , it is called a `` curved surface '' . the tool `` plane '' can be used to create a flat , level surface like the mathematical plane : therefore the name . in geometry , a plane is made up of an infinite number of lines ( or points ) . it has no depth . a `` plane figure '' is part of a plane . it is named by the capital letters ( e.g . a , b , c , ... x , y , z ) that are put at its corners . mathematicians say two planes can be : - parallel = they never meet . - concurrent = they meet forming a line . - coincident = they are one and the same . in mathematics , a plane is a fundamental two-dimensional object . intuitively , it looks like a flat infinite sheet of paper . there are several definitions of the plane . they are equivalent in the sense of euclidean geometry , but they can be extended in different ways to define objects in other areas of mathematics . the only 2 dimensional figure in our 3 dimensional world is a shadow .
