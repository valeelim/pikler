Bomber     a bomber is a type of airplane that is used to attack ground targets , mainly by dropping bombs . the first bombers were made at the start of world war i. bombers often fly low to the ground to confuse enemy radar . most can not fly very fast . because of this , bombers are not outfitted to fight other airplanes . to make up for this , bombers in the past had many machine guns . strategic bombing became important in world war ii . bombers had large crews , sometimes as many as 12 people . usually a bomber had a pilot , a bombadier , a co-pilot/navigator , and many machine gunners all around to shoot at enemy fighter aircraft defending the target . friendly fighters often came along to help fight the defenders . bombers now have one or two people in them . the other positions have been replaced by computers . bombers have very few guns on them partly because they are much faster . in bombing missions now , the pilot drops a bomb and leaves as quickly as possible . during the cold war , a few bombers were made that could travel supersonic , so a nuclear bomb could be dropped without killing the people in the airplane . they were not used that way , however .
