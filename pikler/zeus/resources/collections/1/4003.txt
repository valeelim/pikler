Time zone     time zones give specific areas on the earth a time of day that is earlier or later than the neighboring time zones . this is because when it is daytime on one side of the earth , it is night-time on the other side . there are 24 time zones dividing the earth into different times , each with its own name , like the north american eastern time zone . the north american eastern time zone contains large cities in north america like new york city and miami . greenwich mean time ( gmt ) began in 1675. this was when the royal observatory at greenwich was built to help ships find their longitude at sea . gmt was a standard reference for time keeping when each city in england kept a different local time . by about 1900 , almost all time on earth was in the form of standard time zones . now , all places on earth are divided into time zones . greenwich mean time is now called utc ( coordinated universal time ) . utc is the time standard of the world . all other parts of the world are offset ( plus or minus ) according to their longitude . most of the zones are offset by a full hour , but there are some offset by half an hour or 45 minutes .
