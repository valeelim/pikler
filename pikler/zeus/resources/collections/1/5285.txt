Bronze Age     the bronze age is the time period when people made tools from an alloy ( a mixture of metals ) called bronze . bronze is a mixture of mainly copper and tin : usually nine parts copper to one part tin . materials like wood and stone were also used for tools , but bronze was better for cutting and chopping , and was easy to shape . the bronze age was not at the same time everywhere , because different groups of people began to use bronze at different times . in western europe , the bronze age lasted from about 2000 bc until 800 bc . in the middle east , it started about a thousand years earlier . for example , bronze was first used in mesopotamia around 3300 bc . archaeologists think that people became more organised in the bronze age , because the making of metal tools was difficult and needed certain skills . the people who had these new skills would have been important . the new metal tools were bought , sold , or traded across larger distances . later , when iron tools spread , the bronze age ended and the iron age started . a reason for iron replacing bronze is that tin ore , a rock in which tin may be found , is much more rare than iron ore. copper tools were not useful because they were too soft .
