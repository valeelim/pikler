Breeches role     a breeches role is a part in an opera in which a woman plays the role of a man . it is also called a trouser role ( british ) or pants role ( u.s. ) or travesti role ( the italian word ) . it is called a breeches role because breeches are tight-fitting , knee-length trousers . these used to be worn by men at the time that breeches roles became popular . sometimes breeches roles are in plays , but they are usually in opera . breeches roles are usually female singers acting the role of a young man . they are normally sung by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos with light voices because they can often sound boyish . in the 17th and 18th centuries it was normal to have actors and actresses who cross-dressed . it was the time when castrato singers were popular . these castrati were men pretending to be women , but there were also women pretending to be men ( especially when the actress was trying to deceive another character ) and the audiences were used to this kind of thing . as they gradually stopped the horrible practice of castrating young boys in the late 18th century these male characters started to be sung by mezzo-sopranos instead .
