Download     download means getting information from another computer or server . the opposite of downloading is uploading , which is sending data to another computer . usually we do not say `` download '' for a single web page ( for example when you open this page on your computer ) . when we say we downloaded something , it is normally a bigger computer file , like data or a computer program . the word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from an owner for one 's use . the source is expected to be authentic and have the right to send it . at the user 's end , the downloaded information or data are to be used based on agreement notice . in the 21 century , it is very easy to download files or informations - legally or not - from the internet . as most non-technical users use the word download to talk about any data transfer , the word `` sideload '' is sometimes used for local to local transfers as distinct from distant ones .
