Light-emitting diode     a light-emitting diode ( led ) is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity . leds last a long time and do not break easily ( compared to incandescent lightbulbs ) . they can produce many different colors . they are efficient - most of the energy makes light , not heat . an led is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electricity is sent through it in the expected direction ( electrically biased in the forward direction ) . this effect is a kind of electroluminescence . the color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used , and can be near-ultraviolet , visible or infrared . the color affects how much electricity is used by the led . a white led has either two or three leds inside , of different colors . some white leds have one single-color led inside , combined with a phosphor that converts that single color to white . leds are used in many places . they are the colored indicator lights on many electronic devices , they can be used to make bright advertising signs , brake lights on a car , in tvs and more recently , light bulbs for the home . white leds bright enough to illuminate rooms are usually more expensive than regular lightbulbs but they last longer and burn less electricity .
