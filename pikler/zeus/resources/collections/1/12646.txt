Korean language     the korean language ( korean ) , is spoken mainly in north and south korea . it is spoken by more than 78 million people ( most of whom are north or south koreans ) . in south korea , it is called `` hangukmal '' ( 한국말 ) or `` hangugeo '' ( hangeul : 한국어 , hanja : 韓國語 ) . in north korea , however , it is called `` choseonmal '' ( 조선말 ) or `` choseoneo '' ( 조선어 , 朝鮮語 ) . they are named differently because the common names for north and south korea are different . in additional , koreans usually call their language `` urimal '' ( hangeul : 우리말 ) or `` urinara mal '' ( hangeul : 우리나라 말 ) meaning `` our language '' or `` our country 's language '' . the korean language uses two different writing systems . the first is hangul , the main alphabet . in north korea , only hangeul ( known as choseongeul in north korea ) is used by law . in south korea , only hangeul should be used in most public areas like education , but the second system , hanja , is still used in some newspapers and professional areas . hanja is the system of chinese characters that are used in korean . hanja was the only way to write korean before the creation of hangeul in the 15th century , and it was common in novels before the 19th century . despite the fact that king sejong the great led the development of hangeul in order to allow literacy to spread among common people and to create a writing system that more accurately represented the korean language than hanja , it was not adopted by the upper classes of koreans , and therefore hanja would continue to be the official writing system util the late 19th century . despite it being rejected by the elite classes , hangeul was used often by lower classes as a way to write down korean literature and for lower classes to communicate with each other .
