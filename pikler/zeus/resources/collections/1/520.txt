Molecule     a molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist . if a molecule were split into smaller pieces , it would be a different substance . molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape or form . not all combinations of atoms are usually possible ; atoms like certain shapes , but not others . also , they like certain arrangements of atoms . for example , oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms , carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms , and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms . in the kinetic theory of gases , the term `` molecule '' is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition . according to this definition , noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules . in gases like air , the molecules are just flying around . in liquids like water , the molecules are stuck together but they can still move . in solids like sugar , the molecules can only vibrate . in the fourth state of matter known as plasma , the atoms are ionized and can not form molecules .
