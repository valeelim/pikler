Marxism     marxism is the name for a set of political and economic ideas . the base of these ideas comes from the works of karl marx and friedrich engels . they have had a lot of influence in many countries . marxism influenced other political views , such as social democracy and reformist socialism . both believe that the ideas of marx and engels can be achieved through what marx called 'bourgeois democracy ' . opinions about how a marxist society should be organised are extremely varied : `` marxist political economists differ over their definitions of capitalism , socialism and communism . these differences are so fundamental , the arguments among ... marxist political economists have sometimes been as intense as their oppositions to ... capitalism '' . many marxists say that modern `` communism '' is not communism at all . they say that `` communist '' countries like the soviet union , the people 's republic of china , cuba , and vietnam are really using different forms of capitalism , often with heavily `` nationalized '' industries . a thinker named tony cliff was one of the biggest supporters of these ideas . he wrote that states like the soviet union and communist china ( before 1980 ) were `` state-capitalist .
