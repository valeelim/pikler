DNA     dna , short for deoxyribonucleic acid , is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms . this includes animals , plants , protists , archaea and bacteria . dna is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make . mostly , these proteins are enzymes . dna is inherited by children from their parents . this is why children share traits with their parents , such as skin , hair and eye color . the dna in a person is a combination of the dna from each of their parents . part of an organism 's dna is `` non-coding dna '' sequences . they do not code for protein sequences . some noncoding dna is transcribed into non-coding rna molecules , such as transfer rna , ribosomal rna , and regulatory rnas . other sequences are not transcribed at all , or give rise to rna of unknown function . the amount of non-coding dna varies greatly among species . for example , over 98 % of the human genome is non-coding dna , while only about 2 % of a typical bacterial genome is non-coding dna . viruses use either dna or rna to infect organisms . the genome replication of most dna viruses takes place in the cell 's nucleus , whereas rna viruses usually replicate in the cytoplasm .
