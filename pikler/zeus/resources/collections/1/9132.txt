Vacuum tube     a vacuum tube , also called a `` valve '' in british english , is an electronic device used in many older model radios , television sets , and amplifiers . the cathode is heated , as in a light bulb , so it will emit electrons . the anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons . the device may have other parts . vacuum tubes must be hot to work . most are made of glass , thus are fragile and can break . vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the eniac , which were large and need much work to continue operating . although the vacuum tube was invented by john ambrose fleming later , it was thomas edison who discovered the “ edison effect ” . the edison effect states that electricity does not necessarily need a solid material to move through ; it can move through gas or vacuums as well . without this realization , vacuum tubes would never have been invented . john ambrose fleming invented the first vacuum tube , the diode , in 1904. lee de forest invented the `` audion '' in 1906 ( which was improved by others as the triode in 1908 ) and used in the first telephone amplifiers . many other kinds were invented for various purposes .
