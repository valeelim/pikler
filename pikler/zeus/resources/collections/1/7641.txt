Roman numeral     a roman numeral is the name for a number when it is written in the way the romans used to write numbers . roman numerals are not used very often today in the west . they are used to write the names of kings and queens , or popes . for example : queen elizabeth ii . they may be used to write the year a book or movie was made.did you know the romans had no 0 in roman numerals ? in general , the system is additive , which means that the numbers are added . as an example 'vi ' represents the number 6 , 'xiii ' is 13. there is a simple rule , which generally avoids that more than three of the same symbols are added . it says that the lower value symbol which is directly before the higher one , is subtracted , and not added . this rule was used in roman times , but not at all times . it is used since about the middle ages . this means that rather than writing 'iiii ' , it is preferable to write 'iv ' , for the number 4. also note that the subtraction rule is only valid for the symbol which comes right beforehand in the sequence . this means that 99 is written xcix , and not ic .
