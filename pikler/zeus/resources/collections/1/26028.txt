Foreskin     the foreskin is a fold of skin that covers the glans penis when the penis is uncircumcised . most mammals have foreskin . the outside of the foreskin is like normal skin but the inside of the foreskin is a membrane like the inside of an eyelid or mouth . the foreskin is attached to the penis by the frenulum , but it can move . muscles made it very stretchy . the five most sensitive areas of the penis are on the foreskin . the world health organization say that there are lots of uses for the foreskin , such as keeping the glans penis moist , protecting it or to make sexual intercourse feel nicer since it has so many nerves in it . the removal of the foreskin , the circumcision , reduces diseases . however , moses and bailey ( 1998 ) , say that `` it has not been demonstrated that [ the foreskin ] is associated with increased male sexual pleasure . '' `` circumcision '' is when the foreskin is cut off . it is done to satisfy medical , religious and aesthetic views . circumcision reduces disease , though most medical associations agree the benefits are small ( see circumcision # policies of various national medical associations ) .
