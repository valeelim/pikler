Al Ain     al ain ( arabic : العين ) is a city in the united arab emirates . the city name literally means `` the spring '' or `` the eye '' in arabic . this name come from the water sources in the area . the city is in the emirate of abu dhabi , right next to the border with oman . it is often called the 'garden city of the persian gulf ' because of the many parks , tree-lined avenues and decorative roundabouts within the city . al ain , abu dhabi and dubai form a kind of geographic triangle in the center of the country . each city is around 150 kilometers from the other two . al ain is the fourth largest metropolitan area by population in the emirates , with a population of 348,000 ( 2003 census estimate ) . there are more emirati nationals in al ain than other places in the country , but most who live there are people who left other countries , particularly from the indian sub-continent . there are fewer western people than in the larger centers of abu dhabi and dubai . this gives al ain a more 'arabic ' look and feel , compared to the larger cities of the emirates .
