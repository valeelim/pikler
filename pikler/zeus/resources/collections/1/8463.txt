Authority     authority is the ability of a person or an organization to conduct a certain lifestyle for another person or a group . authority is known as one of the basis of society and stands against cooperation . adopting lifestyle patterns as a result of authority is called obedience and authority as a concept includes most leadership cases . although authority is usually described as human there is also frequent mention of divine authority . authority is made by a certain social power . this power might be materialistic ( such as a threat to harm someone ) or fictitious ( such as belief in a certain person 's power ) . the power exists because of the possible use of sanction : an action who harms a person who 's not obeying the authority or threatening it in order to conduct a social power . authority may exists in a direct way by virtue of an actual power ( such as a threat of imprisonment ) , which is called `` forcing '' , or by legitimization that the subject gives to the authority ( such as recognition of aristocratic authority ) . in most cases both types exist .
