Cytoplasm     the cytoplasm ( also known as cytosol ) is the protoplasm of a cell outside the cell nucleus . it is the gel-like material plus the organelles outside the nucleus , and inside the cell membrane . many important functions of a cell take place in organelles , which are like bits of machinery for doing jobs . the cytoplasm is highly structured : it is not some kind of soup , even though it is made out of 7580 % water . the cytosol contains a complex mixture of cytoskeleton filaments , including the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus . it includes dissolved molecules , and water that fills much of the cell . due to this network of fibres , membranes and the many dissolved macromolecules such as proteins , the cytosol does not act like a simple liquid .
