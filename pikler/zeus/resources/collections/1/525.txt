Mammal     mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class mammalia . they have fur or hair and a very precise kind of temperature regulation . the females bear live young , and produce milk for the young . parental care of the young is universal among mammals , and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring . most marsupial and eutherian mammals have a reproductive cycle known as the oestrous cycle ( u.s : estrous cycle ) . females are sexually active only during the oestrous stage , when they are 'on heat ' for a few days each month . if an ovum is not fertilized , the endometrium ( uterus lining ) is resorbed . oestrus cycles may occur once or twice a year , or many times a year . each group of mammals has its own frequency . humans and primates , are quite different . they have a menstrual cycle . in this case , females are sexually receptive at any time , but only fertile when an ovum is released from an ovary . in this case , the endometrium ( if not needed for an fertilised egg ) is discarded . the endometrium is shed , and takes with it a certain amount of blood . in this system , eggs are released from the ovaries mostly in the middle of the cycle , away from the menstrual period . this ovulation is 'concealed ' , meaning , it is not obvious when it occurs . this process , so it is thought , tends to keep the male and female together , which is unusual in mammals with the oestrous cycle .
