Brittle star     brittle stars are echinoderms of the class ophiuroidea . the adults are superficially like starfish , but they are a different group , with different larvae . like other echinoderms , they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates , and radial symmetry . there are about 1500 different species . usually they have 5 `` arms '' , which can grow long , up to 60 cm , in the largest species . the central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter . unlike starfish , they live deeper in the ocean . there seem to be brittle stars even at depths below 6000m , what scientists call abysmal depth . generally , brittle stars live below 500m of depth . there are two related groups of ophiuroids : the `` ophiurida '' ( brittle stars ) and the basket stars ( `` eurialida '' ) . basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range . brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores , able to catch some small prey on occasion . many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish , which is how they got their name . when they are picked up , their arms may fall off . this might make the animal seem brittle , but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators .
