Volcanism     volcanism ( or vulcan activity ) is the eruption of magma onto the surface of the earth . magma under the crust is under very great pressure . when folding and faulting occur , cracks or fractures appear . these are lines of weakness . when these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma , they will release the pressure in the magma . this allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust . some magma may even reach the earth 's surface . volcanoes are places where magma reaches the earth 's surface . the type of volcano depends on the location of the eruption and the consistency of the magma . intrusive volcanism is when magma is forced into the rocks that make up the earth 's crust . when it cools and become solid while still underground , different features called plutons are formed . the rock formed is intrusive igneous rock . these plutons will be exposed at the surface of land when the overlying rocks are removed after a long time of denudation ( laid bare by erosion ) .
