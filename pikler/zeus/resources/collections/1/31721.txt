Homemaker     a homemaker is a person whose main job is to take care of his or her own family home and children . traditionally , the job of homemaker is done by women and the job of provider is done by men . because it has been the traditional job of a woman to be a `` homemaker '' , a woman who spends most of her time caring for the family home has been called a `` housewife '' . many women still use this word on government forms , because they see the value in homemaking . for many thousands of years , men have been thought of by society as the main `` breadwinners '' in families . this means that it has been the job of men to do work in which animals were hunted for food by one or more men , or the men grew food crops or earned money to pay for food , while the women have cared for children , prepared food for eating , cleaned the home , and made and cared for clothes . in societies where people are `` hunters and gatherers '' , for example the traditional society of the australian aboriginal people , it is the men who do the hunting of animals for meat , and the women who do the gathering of other types of food such as grain , fruit and vegetables . one of the reasons is that a married woman usually had children and babies for a large part of her life . it is much easier to gather fruit with a baby on your hip or back than to hunt a fast-moving animal . so the men were able to raise up sons and daughters and the life of the community could continue into another generation . even in a society where homes were very simple and people did not own very many things , men and women did different jobs . in the extreme conditions of the arctic north the hunters must know how to hunt in extreme cold ( among ice and snow ) ; the women must maintain home life in huts made of ice ( `` igloos '' ) and clothing needs to be made out of animal skin and insulated with moss and other plants . babies live very close to their mothers so that they can be kept warm .
