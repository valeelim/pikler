Sex     sex is a type of reproduction common among living things . sex is used by plants and animals , and also by fungi and various single-celled organisms . it usually needs two individuals which are different sexes from the same species . it works by combining genes from more than one source . organisms may have more than one kind of reproduction : 1. asexual reproduction : an example is the binary fission of an amoeba . sometimes jellyfish , and many insects split or produce eggs without fertilisation . these are all methods of asexual reproduction . 1. sexual reproduction : most plants and animals reproduce by a union of two different sexes . each sex makes the special cells used for reproduction . the new organism is made when both types of cells are united in a fertilised egg or zygote . organisms that can make both kinds of cells for reproduction are called hermaphrodites . for example , most snails are hermaphrodite . - those organisms that produce sperm are called `` male '' , those that produce ova ( eggs ) are called `` female '' .
