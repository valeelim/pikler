Ravana     ravana was king of lanka . he had ten heads . he took away goddess sita , wife of lord rama ( an avatar of lord vishnu ) . lord rama attacked him . he and his army fought with ravana , with the help of the monkey army of king bali and his army . at last , ravana was killed . when lord rama returned to ayodhya ( his native place ) , someone told that a woman who lived with other men should not stay with her husband . so lord rama sent goddess sita away to the forest . this tells us that lord rama did n't give respect to his wife who had made many sacrifices for him .
