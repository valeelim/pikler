Antidote     an antidote is a chemical or medicine that will reverse the effects of some poisons . an antidote will make some or all of the effects of the poison go away . each antidote only works for certain poisons . not every poison has an antidote . for example , the poison aconitine has no known antidote . aconitine is a very poisonous toxin that comes from the `` aconitum '' plant . if enough of the poison enters a person 's body , the person often dies . activated charcoal can be used as an antidote for many poisons , but only poisons that were swallowed . for example , activated charcoal can be used for some drug overdoses , and for some poisonings . the charcoal attaches to the poison and keeps it from being taken into the bloodstream through the stomach . activated charcoal will not work for every kind of poison . for example , it will not work for alcohol , strong acids , and products made of petroleum ( like paint thinner and fuel oil ) . antivenoms will fight the poisonous effects of bites from venomous animals ( animals that make venom ) , like some snakes and spiders .
