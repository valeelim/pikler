Pencil     a pencil is a hexagonal prism or cylinder-shaped writing utensil that is also used to draw , usually on paper . a pencil is usually made with a piece of carbon mixed with clay that has a wood case around it . colored pencils are a type of pencil that instead of greyish silver , the tip is colorful . colored pencils or crayons are usually meant for drawing rather than writing . an important difference between pens and pencils is that the tip of a pencil is made of graphite ( or lead ) and pens have tips made of metal with ink coming out of the bottom . pencil writings do not smudge or wash away if the paper gets wet , unlike pens which have ink . writing with a pen will usually smudge . writing from a pencil can be erased , but writing from a pen usually can not . finally , while pencils have been around for thousands of years , pens have only been around for about three hundred . an early writing tool was the reed pen used by ancient egyptians , who wrote with ink on sheets of papyrus paper . another early writing instrument was the stylus , which was a thin metal stick , often made from lead . it was used for scratching onto wood covered with was , a method used by the romans . the word `` pencil '' comes from the latin word which means `` little tail '' . it is an invention of the 16th century in england .
