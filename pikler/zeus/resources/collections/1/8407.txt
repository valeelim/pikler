Atomic number     the atomic number ( symbol : z ) of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom . the atomic number of an atom identifies which element it is . in a neutral atom , the atomic number is equal to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus . the elements of the periodic table are listed in order of increasing atomic number . atomic number is not the same as : - atomic mass ( symbol : `` m '' ) , which is the mass of a single atom , commonly expressed in unified atomic mass units - mass number ( symbol : a ) , which is the sum of the number of protons and number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom - relative atomic mass ( also called atomic weight ; symbol : `` a '' ) , which is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom . atomic number is not changed by the number of electrons or neutrons ; it is simply the proton number .
