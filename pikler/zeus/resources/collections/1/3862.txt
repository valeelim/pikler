Ladder     a ladder is a tool which is made for people to climb up or down . ladders have two vertical supports that go along the whole length of the ladder . between these supports are the horizontal rungs . the rung is what the climber can put his foot on . the climber can use his hands to hold on to the rungs above him , or to the supports at the side . ladders can be made of metal , wood or even rope . there are different types of ladders . some ladders are made in one piece . they can be carried around and made to lean against something such as the wall of a house . there should be a good distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall so that the ladder is not too vertical , otherwise the ladder might fall backwards and the climber would fall off . sometimes these ladders are extension ladders . extension ladders are made in two or more sections so that the ladder can fold up to make it easier to carry about and to store . to open up the ladder , each section slides up almost to the top of the next section .
