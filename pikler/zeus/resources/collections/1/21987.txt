Euclidean algorithm     the euclidean algorithm is an algorithm . it can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers ( the greatest common divisor of two numbers ) . euclid solved the problem graphically . he said start out with two positive integers `` m '' and `` n '' . 1. if the value of `` m '' is less than the value of `` n '' , switch the values of `` m '' and `` n '' 1. find a number `` r '' equal to `` m '' modulo `` n '' 1. let `` m '' have the same value as `` n '' 1. let `` n '' have the same value as `` r '' 1. if `` n '' does not have the value of 0 , go to step 2 1. the wanted value is in `` m '' . note : this pseudocode uses modular arithmetic instead of subtraction . it does the same thing as above , but gets the answer faster . precondition : two positive integers `` m '' and `` n '' postcondition : the greatest common integer divisor of `` m '' and `` n '' iterative ( non-recursive ) : recursive :
