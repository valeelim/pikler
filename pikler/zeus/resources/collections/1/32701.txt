Crete     crete is the largest of the greek islands . like the fertile crescent , crete had rich soil , a warm , and plenty of water . with less time spent fighting to live , the cretans began to make complicated things . from the wild crocus flowers which covered their island , the cretans collected saffron used in yellow dye , in food , and in medicine . from the egyptians , they received rich cloth and jewels . from the hittites , they learned how to use iron . from the wealty lydians , they learned to use money . from phoneicia , the cretans received the alphabet which is used today . cretans chose kings to rule over them for seven years each . the king was known as `` minos '' , and the people `` minoans '' . the capital of crete was knossos ( nos ' us ) . beautiful friezes ( decorating bands ) were on the walls . the symbol of the double-ax was used , and is thought to represent the power of a king . the throne was only a seat with a high back , and the nobles had only benches to sit on . however , the benches were covered with red and white . on the walls were painted fish , dolphins , and seaweed . the queen had her own private staircase so she could go upstairs without bothering the men . several rooms in the palace had jars which were six feet tall , and were used to keep wheat , oil , dye and other things .
