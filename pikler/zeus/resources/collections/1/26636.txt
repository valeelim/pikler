Alaska plaice     alaska plaice ( `` pleuronectes quadrituberculatus '' ) are salt water fish that live in the north pacific ocean . like most flatfish , they live on the bottom of the continental shelf , up to 600 metres deep . their geographical range is from the gulf of alaska in the east , to the chukchi sea in the north , to the sea of japan in the west . alaska plaice feed mostly on polychaetes , but also eat amphipods and echiurans . most commercial fisheries do not want to catch alaska plaice ; but many are caught by trawlers trying to catch other bottom fish . so many alaska plaice get caught anyway that , for example , the 2005 total allowable catch in the bering sea and aleutian islands management area ( bsai ) was reached before the end of may of that year . alaska plaice can live for up to 30 years , and grow to 60 centimetres ( 24 inches ) long , but most that get caught are only seven or eight years old , and about 30 cm ( 12 in ) . related pages . - american plaice - european plaice references . - 1998 marine fisheries review article
