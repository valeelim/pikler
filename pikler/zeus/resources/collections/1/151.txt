Crime     a crime ( or misdemeanor or felony ) is an act done by a person which is against the laws of a country or region . a person who does this is called a criminal . the basic idea of what things are called `` crimes '' is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person . things like killing another person , injuring another person , or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries . also , it can be a crime to have or sell contraband such as guns or illegal drugs . when some criminals make money from crime , they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering . men and boys commit way more crimes than women and girls . there are various levels of crimes . in some jurisdictions they are : - misdemeanor - a minor crime , typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in jail . - felony ( or high crime ) - a major crime , typically punished by 1 year or longer in prison . different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes , and which ones are the worst . some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries . many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created . for example , a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime . when automobiles became numerous , they killed or hurt many people in road accidents , so new laws were made for them .
