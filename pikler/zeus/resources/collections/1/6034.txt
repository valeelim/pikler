Lymphocyte     lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell ( or `` leukocyte '' ) . they help an organism to fight infections . they occur in the immune system of all vertebrates . all lymphoctes have a large , blob-like nucleus . lymphocytes can be divided into three main types : - large granular lymphocytes : these are part of the innate immune system , and are natural killer cells . - small lymphocytes : these lymphocytes are the main agents of the acquired immune system . the two main types are : - t cells and - b cells . natural killer ( nk ) cells are a part of the immune system a person is born with . they protect the organism from tumours and from cells infected by viruses . natural killer cells are made active by chemicals released by damaged cells called interferons . natural killer cells can tell the difference between infected cells , tumours , and normal cells . they recognise changes in the level of a surface molecule called mhc ( major histocompatibility complex ) class i. the nk cells then release cytotoxic ( cell-killing ) granules which then destroy the altered cells .
