Chemical equation     a chemical equation is a way to predict the way that two or more chemicals will work together . using what chemists know about the way chemicals act , we add the letter symbols together just like a math problem . in this way we can correctly guess if we will get a new chemical when we mix two or more chemicals together , and what that chemical will be . chemical equations are either worded or written using the elements ' symbols , how much of the element and in what state ( solid [ s ] , liquid [ l ] , gas [ g ] ) it is in . for example : an aqueous solution of sodium chloride ( nacl [ aq ] ) and another aqueous solution of silver nitrate ( agno [ aq ] ) . these mixed together form sodium nitrate ( nano [ aq ] ) and silver chloride ( agcl [ s ] ) which in symbols is : nacl ( aq ) + agno ( aq ) â†’ nano ( aq ) + agcl ( s ) the solutions formed the solid agcl . this formation can be called a precipitate and the reaction between the two solutions a precipitation reaction , because the solid produced is not dissolved , whereas all the other products are dissolved .
