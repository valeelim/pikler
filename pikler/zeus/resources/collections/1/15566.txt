Fur     fur is the hair of mammals . different species may have quite different styles of hair , making them more or less suitable to the fur trade , but many are as follows : fur usually consists of two main layers : - down hair ( known also as undercoat or ground hair ) — the bottom layer . they are wool hairs , usually wavy or curly without straight portions or sharp points ; down hairs tend to be shorter , flat , curly , and more numerous than the top layer . its principal function is thermoregulation ; it keeps a layer of dry air next to the skin and repels water , thus providing thermal insulation . - guard hair — the top layer is longer , coarser , nearly straight shafts of hair . this protrudes through the down hair layer . the top ends of the guard hairs are visible . this top layer displays the most colour and gloss , including coat patterns adapted to display or camouflage . it is also adapted to shedding water and blocking sunlight , protecting the undercoat and skin from external factors such as rain and ultraviolet radiation . many animals , such as domestic cats , erect their guard hairs as part of their threat display when agitated .
