Value     value is how much something is worth . often the best way to find the value of something is to use the price that it can be sold for . however oscar wilde wrote that 'people know the price of everything but the value of nothing'- in other words true value does not depend on money alone . in math , a value is a number which is concrete , something everyone can agree upon . however people may disagree on the value of water , depending if you live in a desert or next to a river . disagreements on the value of things can create fights between nations , political parties , religions , etc .
