Asteroid belt     the asteroid belt or main belt is a ring of small and large rocks and dust between the orbits of mars and jupiter . the biggest object in the asteroid belt is ceres , a dwarf planet . the kirkwood gaps separate the asteroid belt into several groups . most asteroids orbit at 2 to 3 times the distance between earth and the sun . planets that are `` inside '' - or before - the asteroid belt ( which means they are closer to the sun ) are called `` inner planets . '' planets that are `` outside '' - that is , after - the asteroid belt are called `` outer planets '' : so mercury , venus , earth , and mars are `` inner planets , '' while jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune are the `` outer planets . '' in 1802 , shortly after discovering 2 pallas , heinrich olbers suggested to william herschel that ceres and pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the marsâ€“jupiter region , this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before . this hypothesis has fallen from favor . the large amount of energy needed to destroy a planet , and with the belt 's low combined mass ( only about 4 % of the mass of the moon ) do not support the hypothesis . also , the significant chemical differences between the asteroids are difficult to explain if they come from the same planet . today , most scientists accept that the asteroids never formed a planet at all .
