Caesium     caesium ( or cesium ) is the chemical element with the atomic number 55 on the periodic table . its symbol is cs . caesium is an alkali metal . its melting point is low ( 28 °c ) . it is extremely reactive . because of its high reactivity , it is a dangerous chemical . it may set itself on fire ( ignite ) in air . it explodes on contact with water . it reacts more violently than the other alkali metals with water . because of this , caesium is stored in mineral oil . caesium is a rare element . since there is little caesium on the earth , it is rather expensive . the human body does not need caesium . in large amounts , it is mildly poisonous because it is close to potassium , which the body does need . caesium was first described in 1861 , by gustav robert kirchhoff and robert wilhelm bunsen . they were testing mineral water , from bad dürkheim . after they separated calcium , strontium , magnesium and lithium , they saw two lines in the `` blue '' range of the spectrum . because of these lines , they concluded that in addition to the elements already found , there must be another unknown substance in the mineral water . they named this substance caesium , after the color blue .
