Improvisation     improvisation is the art of performing without a script or rehearsal . in music , improvisation is the art of playing an instrument ( or singing ) in which the musician or musicians make up the music as they play . improvising is inventing at the same time as one does something . some musicians only play music when they have written music in front of them , but it can be great fun to improvise music . it is a way of composing . improvisation is common during a jam session . in baroque times all musicians were taught to improvise because composers often did not bother to write all the notes down . musicians would have improvised lots of ornaments , and even whole sections . many great composers such as johann sebastian bach , wolfgang amadeus mozart , ludwig van beethoven and franz liszt were famous for their keyboard improvisations . organists are often expected to improvise during a service . in this way they can fill in gaps in the service when there would otherwise be silence , they can make a smooth link between one piece of music and the next , and they can create the right atmosphere . in baroque times in the lutheran church organists would improvise a chorale prelude . this was a piece of music which uses the melody of the chorale ( hymn ) that the congregation sang . bach was one of many composers who wrote many of his chorale preludes down . in more recent times some famous concert organists often finish an organ recital by playing an improvisation . this might be quite a long piece with several linked movements , finishing with a fugue . somebody may give them the theme written on a piece of paper , so that it is quite unprepared .
