Outer space     space , also known as outer space , is the near-vacuum between celestial bodies . it is where everything ( all of the planets , stars , galaxies and other objects ) is found . on earth , space begins at the kármán line ( 100 km above sea level ) . this is where earth 's atmosphere is said to stop and outer space begins . this is not a natural boundary but is a convention used by scientists and diplomats . however , the space near earth is quite crowded by astronomical standards . a list of spaces goes like this : 1. geospace is the region of outer space near earth . geospace includes the upper region of the atmosphere and the magnetosphere . the van allen radiation belt lies within the geospace . the space inside the magnetosphere is protected from radiation from the sun . it has a low level of electrically charged particles . 1. interplanetary space is the space around the sun and planets of the solar system . it has the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles from the sun . this stream creates a very thin atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of miles or kilometers into space . interplanetary space has the magnetic field generated by the sun . planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth also have magnetospheres . these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources , creating belts of magnetic particles such as the van allen radiation belt . planets without magnetic fields , such as mars , have their atmospheres gradually stripped off by the solar wind .
