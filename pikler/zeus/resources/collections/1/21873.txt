Landlocked     a country is landlocked if it has no access to any oceans or seas . as an example , austria is landlocked . france is not landlocked because it has access to the mediterranean and the atlantic ocean . a sea is also landlocked if does not have access to an ocean . this is also called an endorheic basin as an example , the caspian sea is landlocked . the gulf of mexico is not landlocked because it has access to the atlantic ocean . examples of landlocked countries : - armenia - austria - luxembourg - chad examples of landlocked water : - caspian sea - lake baikal - the black sea is not entirely landlocked if a country is landlocked by landlocked countries ( surrounded by landlocked countries ) , then it is doubly landlocked . liechtenstein and uzbekistan are the only two doubly landlocked countries in the world .
