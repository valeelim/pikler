Graph theory     graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs . a graph is an abstract representation of : a number of points that are connected by lines . each point is usually called a `` vertex '' ( more than one are called `` vertices '' ) , and the lines are called `` edges '' . graphs are a tool for modelling relationships . they are used to find answers to a number of problems . some of these questions are : - what is the best way for a mailman to get to all of the houses in the area in the least amount of time ? the points could represent street corners and lines could represent the houses along the street . ( see chinese postman problem ) - a salesman has to visit different customers , but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible . the problem is to find a way so they can do it . this problem is known as travelling salesman problem ( and often abbreviated `` tsp '' ) . it is among the hardest problems to solve . if a commonly believed conjecture is true ( described as p â‰  np ) , then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest .
