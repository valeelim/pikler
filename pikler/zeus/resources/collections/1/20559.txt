California Gold Rush     the california gold rush started when james wilson marshall was building a water powered sawmill for john sutter in 1848. when he finished building the sawmill , he went to the river to fetch some water . he saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river . he immediately went to tell john , and they tried to keep it a secret . but word soon got out , and the gold rush started . some people became rich but most did not . besides trying to find gold , some people started selling things . this gave them benefits and popularity . sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband . men like levi strauss also sold things . he invented and sold jeans made from denim . the california gold rush ended in 1855. at that time many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find .
