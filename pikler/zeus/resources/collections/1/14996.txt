Random-access memory     random access memory ( or simply ram ) is the memory or information storage in a computer that is used to store running programs and data for the programs . data ( information ) in the ram can be read and written quickly in any order . normally , the random access memory is in the form of computer chips . usually , the contents of ram are accessible faster than other types of information storage but are lost every time the computer is turned off . non-volatile random-access memory ( nvram ) keeps its data without using power , but is more expensive and works more slowly , so it is used in smaller amounts . since the late 20th century , ram uses transistors , usually mosfets , to store data . before that , magnetic memory was the usual kind . dynamic random access memory ( dram ) is the majority in computers . modern computers use several types of dram . before 2002 , most computers used single data rate ( sdr ) ram . most computers made since then use either double data rate ( ddr ) , ddr2 , ddr3 , or ram . the later types allow stored data to be moved and used more quickly , so that the computer 's processor can keep working quickly without having to wait for data as long or as often .
