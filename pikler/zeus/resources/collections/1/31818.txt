Hezbollah     hezbollah ( , meaning `` party of god '' ) is an islamic political party and paramilitary organization in lebanon . it was formed in lebanon in 1982 , during the lebanese civil war . the leader of hezbollah is currently hassan nasrallah . hezbollah 's main goals during the civil war were to fight against western influences and create an islamic state in lebanon . its members are shia muslims , which are the largest islamic denomination in lebanon . it is also supports arab nationalism . it wants freedom for the palestinian people in palestine . because of this , it believes that the state of israel should not exist , and fights against it . over the years , the hezbollah militia has fought a guerrilla war against the israeli army along the border in southern lebanon . it often attacks israel 's military positions by firing rockets across israel 's northern border . hezbollah is supported by syria and iran . to destroy hezbollah bases , israel has responded in different ways ; for example , air strikes on sites in lebanon and sending ground troops into southern lebanon . in 2000 , israel withdrew its troops from the `` security zone '' in southern lebanon , but not from a sliver of land called shebba farms . this fertile area was kept under israeli occupation . the border stayed relatively quiet until july 2006 , except for targeted assassinations and kidnappings by israel . in july , hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers . this led to the 2006 lebanon war , in which hezbollah rockets reached deep into israel .
