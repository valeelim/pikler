Scale (music)    scale ( music ) in music , a scale is a set of notes in order of their pitch . if the pitch is becoming higher , it is called an ascending scale . if the pitch is becoming lower , it is called a descending scale . in some scales , for example a melodic minor scale , the pitches in the ascending scale are different to the pitches in the descending scale . the steps between the pitches , measured in tones ( also called a `` whole step '' ) and semitones ( also called a `` half step '' ) , are different in different types of scales . on a piano , there are white keys and black keys . if we start on the note `` c '' and play each white key going up until we come to the next `` c '' , we have played the `` c major '' scale . there were eight notes . in order going up , they are `` c '' ( middle ) , `` d '' , `` e '' , `` f '' , `` g '' , `` a '' , `` b '' and `` c '' ( high ) , or can be octaves higher or lower . scales can also go up , then down , like `` c '' ( middle ) , `` d '' , `` e '' , `` f '' , `` g '' , `` a '' , `` b '' , `` c '' ( high ) , `` b '' , `` a '' , `` g '' , `` f '' , `` e '' , `` d '' , `` c '' ( middle ) . click below to listen to a `` c major '' scale .
