Syllable     a syllable is a unit of pronunciation uttered without interruption , loosely , a single sound . all words are made from at least one syllable . `` monosyllables '' are words that have have only one vowel sound ; `` polysyllables '' have more than one . if a syllable ends with a consonant , it is called a `` closed syllable '' . if a syllable ends with a vowel , it is called an `` open syllable '' . patterns of syllables can be shown with c and v ( c for 'consonant ' , v for 'vowel ' ) . closed syllables are often shown as `` cvc '' ( such as `` got '' ) , and open syllables as `` cv '' ( such as `` go '' ) . some languages like english have many kinds of closed syllables . other languages , like japanese , have few kinds of closed syllables . other languages still , like hawaiian and swahili , have no closed syllables . notice that the consonant ( c ) and vowel ( v ) notation does not match the letters of english spelling in a one-to-one relationship ( e.g . 'th ' is one sound ) , but rather individual sounds . there are many words in english that have only one syllable .
