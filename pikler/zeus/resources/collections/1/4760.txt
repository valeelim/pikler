Tuberculosis     tuberculosis ( tb ) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria . in the past , people called it consumption . tb is caused by several types of mycobacteria , usually `` mycobacterium tuberculosis '' . the disease usually attacks the lungs , but it can also affect other parts of the body . the bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next . this happens when infected people cough , sneeze , or spit . of every 100 people with tb , between five and ten people show symptoms . in these people , the disease is called `` active '' . tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment . diagnosis of active tb relies on radiology . doctors often look at an x-ray of the chest . in addition , they check body fluids . these fluids have microbes in them , which are grown in cell cultures . the cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with tb . if the patient has tb but does not show symptoms , the disease is 'latent ' . doctors use a skin test , called the mantoux test , to detect latent tb . they often do blood tests too .
