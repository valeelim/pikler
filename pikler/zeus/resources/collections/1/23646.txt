Dachshund     the dachshund is a breed of dog . it is usually short ( small in height ) , but long from front to back and with short legs . “ dachshund ” is a german word that is used in english , and it means “ badger dog. ” ( in german , dachshunds are called `` dackel '' or `` teckel '' . ) the breed was developed to use its sense of smell to find , chase , and hunt badgers and other animals that live in holes . a dachshund has a long , narrow body , so it is sometimes called a `` wiener dog '' , `` hot dog '' , or `` sausage dog '' . some people believe that using those words does not show respect . today , dachshunds have crooked legs , loose skin , and a barrel-like chest . over time , breeders selected dogs so that those features would appear in puppies . that way , dachshunds could do a better job of burrowing into tight spaces . another feature is a long tail . the coat or fur of a dachshund comes in three kinds – smooth or short-haired , long-haired , and wire-haired . the wire-haired dachshund usually is shorter front to back than the other two .
