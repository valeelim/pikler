Aluminium     aluminium ( american spelling : aluminum ) is a chemical element . the symbol for aluminium is al , and its atomic number is 13. aluminium is the most abundant metal . aluminium is a very good conductor of electricity and heat . it is light and strong . it can be hammered into sheets ( malleable ) or pulled out into wires ( ductile ) . it is a highly reactive metal , although it is corrosion resistant . aluminium prevents corrosion by forming a small , thin layer of aluminium oxide on its surface . this layer protects the metal by preventing oxygen from reaching it . corrosion can not occur without oxygen . because of this thin layer , the reactivity of aluminium is not seen . pure aluminium is made from bauxite , a kind of rock that has aluminium oxide and many impurities . the bauxite is crushed and reacted with sodium hydroxide . the aluminium oxide dissolves . then the aluminium oxide is dissolved in liquid cryolite , a rare mineral . cryolite is normally produced artificially though . the aluminium oxide is electrolyzed to make aluminium and oxygen .
