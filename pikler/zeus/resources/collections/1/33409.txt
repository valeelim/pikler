Congruence     two geometrical shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is . if one of the object has to change its size , the two objects are not congruent : they are just called similar . if two figures or objects are congruent , they have the same shape and size ; but they can be rotated , moved , mirror imaged ( reflected ) or translated , so that it fits exactly were the other one is . examples . - all squares that have the same length of their sides are congruent . - all equilateral triangles that have the same length of their sides are congruent . tests for congruency . - two angles and the side between them are the same on two triangles ( asa congruence ) - two angles and a side `` not '' between them are the same on both triangles ( aas congruence ) - all three sides of both triangles are the same ( sss congruence ) - two sides and the angle between them makes 2 triangles congruent ( sas congruence ) we have quite a few possibilities , a few rules to make new shapes congruent to the original one .
