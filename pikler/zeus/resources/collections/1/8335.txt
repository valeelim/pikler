Equation     a mathematical equation is an expression containing at least one variable ( =unknown value ) and an `` equals sign '' ( = ) with a mathematical expression on each side of it . the equals sign says that both sides are exactly the same value . an equation can be as simple as x=0 , or as hard as 4 ( 3y^99 ) +76=42รท3x or harder . there are two kinds of mathematical equations : - the kind of equation that is either true or false ; these are also called identities . for example : - the kind of equation that lets you calculate the value of one or several variables . the equation is only true if the variable ( s ) have that value . for example : the second kind is often used to solve problems in which you have to know the value of some variables . for example , the second kind of equation is used in algebra . for example , to solve the equation 2x = 8 by finding x you would follow an algebraic rule . then you can work out that x = 4. equations can be classified by the types of operations and quantities involved . some types of equations are :
