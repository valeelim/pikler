Aruba     aruba is an island in the caribbean sea , just a short distance north of the venezuelan paraguaná peninsula , and it forms a part of the kingdom of the netherlands . unlike much of the caribbean region , it has a dry climate and an arid , cactus-strewn landscape . this climate has helped tourism , because visitors to the island can reliably expect warm , sunny weather . the island broke off from the netherlands antilles in 1986 , hoping to gain its independence by 1996. in 1990 , that effort stopped at the request of the island people . aruba is one of the four countries that form the kingdom of the netherlands . the other nations are the netherlands , curaçao and sint maarten . the citizens of these countries all share a single nationality : dutch . about three quarters of the aruban gross national product is earned through tourism or related activities . the island came into the news after u.s. high school student natalee holloway disappeared on a graduation trip on may 30 , 2005. aruba is a generally flat , riverless island . it is in the southern part of the caribbean sea . the western and southern beaches have white sandy beaches . they are generally protected from the ocean currents . this is one of the reasons aruba is a popular tourist location .
