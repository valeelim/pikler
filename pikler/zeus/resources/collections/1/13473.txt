Bioinformatics     bioinformatics or computational biology is the study of large amounts of biological information . mostly , it focuses on molecules like dna . it is done mostly with the help of computers . as species of living things change over time , the dna contained in their cells change , from evolution . if we can extract the information from living things today , and compare them to each other , we can see which living things are most closely related , much like comparing two editions of a book , the most similar can be thought to be the most closely related in time . doing this , biologists can construct family trees , or phylogenies . by stitching together all the trees , a grand tree connecting all living things can be made , this is called the `` tree of life '' . bioinformatics is integration of mathematical , statistical and computational method to analyze biological , biochemical and biophysical data . anything a cell could possibly want is stored in its dna . when a cell wants to build a protein , it finds the appropriate piece of dna , makes a copy of it ( called rna ) , and uses the instructions in the copy to make the protein .
