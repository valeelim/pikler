Learning English     learning english is what people do when they want to learn how to speak and understand the english language . people learning english often learn to read and write english at the same time . a lot of people learn english at school , where english is a common subject . many people also want to spend their own personal time to learn english . some of these people may not know any english , where others will have learned some english in school , and will want to advance their knowledge of it . there are two ways to learn english outside of school : - institutional learning - individual learning many people join for spoken english institutes in hyderabad or any other lessons like school lessons but at learning centres where any people can go , no matter their age . in such a centre they will join a class fitting their existing level of learning of english , so that they will be in a group for the teacher to help them learn . an example of this type of learning is at the classes by the british council . here is their website .
