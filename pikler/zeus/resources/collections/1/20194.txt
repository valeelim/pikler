Linguistics     linguistics is the study of language . people who study language are called linguists . there are five main parts of linguistics : phonology ( the study of sounds , or phonemes ) , morphology ( the study of parts of words , like `` un- '' and `` -ing '' ) , syntax ( the study of word order and how sentences are made ) , semantics ( the study of the meaning of words ) , and pragmatics ( the study of the unspoken meaning of speech that is separate from the literal meaning of what is said ; for example if you were to say `` i 'm cold '' when what you actually want is for someone to turn off the fan ) . there are many ways to use linguistics every day . some linguists are theoretical linguists , meaning they study the theory and ideas behind language , such as historical linguistics ( the study of the history of language , and how it has changed ) , or sociolinguistics ( the study of how different groups of people may use language differently ) . some linguists are applied linguists , meaning they use linguistics to do things , such as forensic linguistics ( which is used in crime investigations ) , or computational linguistics ( which is used to help make computers understand languages , such as the iphone 's siri application ) .
