Sea urchin     sea urchins are the class echinoidea of the phylum echinodermata . like the rest of the echinoderms , literally `` spike-skinned '' , they are entirely marine . they are usually globe-shaped , and protected by calcareous plates and spines . `` urchin '' is an old word for hedgehog , and in many foreign languages these animals are called `` sea hedgehogs '' . like other echinoderms they have five-fold symmetry ( called pentamerism ) and move by means of hundreds of tiny , transparent , adhesive 'tube feet ' . the symmetry is not obvious in the living animal , but is easily visible in the dried test . sea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals . they have a special chewing apparatus called `` aristotle 's lantern '' , after the greek philosopher aristotle who was fascinated by sea urchins . with this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving . the spines are long and sharp in some species , and protect the urchin from predators . the spines inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin , but are usually not dangerous . echinoids also have pincer-like pedicellaria all over their body between the spines . the job of these is to deal with anything ( like larvae ) settling on the test ( outer shell ) . it is not known if the spines are venomous ( unlike the pedicellariae between the spines , which are venomous ) .
