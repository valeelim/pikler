Energy     energy is a word with more than one meaning . - mostly it is used in science to describe how much potential a physical system has to change . in physics , energy is a property of matter . it can be transferred between objects , and converted in form . it can not be created or destroyed . - it may also be used in economics to describe the harnessing and sale of energy itself , as in fuel or electric power distribution . - in ordinary language , the word is used to describe someone acting or speaking in a lively and vigorous way . in science energy is something that can do work . basic forms of energy include : - kinetic energy - energy which is in moving objects . - potential energy - stored energy . - heat - thermal energy - electrical energy energy can not be made or destroyed , it is changed from one form to another . the amount of energy in a closed system is always the same . this rule is called the `` conservation law of energy '' . in the early 20th century scientists discovered that matter can be made into energy , and energy into matter , through processes like nuclear fission and nuclear fusion . the law of conservation of energy has therefore been extended to become the law of conservation of matter and energy . albert einstein was the first to mathematically derive this in the formula e = mc .
