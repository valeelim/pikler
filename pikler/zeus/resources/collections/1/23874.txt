Mutant (Marvel)    mutant ( marvel ) a mutant is a type of fictional character in a fictional universe created by marvel comics . in this world , mutants can be either heroes or villains . a mutant is someone who has different dna than its parents . these mutations often lead to superpowers . they may also cause physical changes such as wings , blue skin , or a tail . mutants were created in the marvel universe in the 1960s with the comic book `` the x-men '' . it was a way for them to tell stories that dealt with racism . racism , hatred and fear of mutants are an important part of their history . two main teams of mutants have been around since the 1960s : the x-men ( heroes ) and the brotherhood of mutants ( villains ) . sometime a human is born with a certain kind of dna change . this `` x-gene '' is passed to their children . this genetic change may not create any noticeable difference . it could pass for generations without anyone knowing about it . mutants may be born to human or mutant parents , though the odds of a mutant birth are much better for the latter . likewise , it is rare but possible for mutant parents to have human children , termed `` baseline '' by characters within the marvel universe . some baseline humans are genetically predisposed towards having mutant descendants such as the guthrie family ( see cannonball , husk , and icarus ) . mutant children born to mutant parent ( s ) will not necessarily have the same power ( s ) as their parent ( s ) , nor will they necessarily have the same power ( s ) as any mutant siblings they may have ; however , examples of children with the same power ( s ) as their parents and/or siblings are not uncommon .
