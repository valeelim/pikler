Influenza pandemic of 1918     the influenza pandemic of 1918 was a heavy pandemic of influenza . it lasted from january 1918 to december 1920. about 500 million people were infected across the world . the pandemic spread to remote pacific islands and the arctic . it killed 50 million to 100 million peopleâ€”3 to 5 percent of the world 's population at the time . this means it was one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history . to maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in germany , britain , france , and the united states ; but papers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in neutral spain ( such as the grave illness of king alfonso xiii ) . this situation created the false impression of spain being especially hard-hit . it also resulted in the nickname spanish flu . in most cases , influenza outbreaks kill young people , or the elderly , or those patients that are already weakened . this was not the case for the 1918 pandemic , which killed predominantly healthy young adults . modern research , using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims , has concluded that the virus kills through a cytokine storm ( overreaction of the body 's immune system ) . the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body , whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups .
