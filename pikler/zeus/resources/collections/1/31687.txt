European colonization of the Americas     european colonization of the americas started with the vikings who came from scandinavia , the north end of europe around the year 1000. they settled in what was later called newfoundland and called their colony vinland , but abandoned it . in 1492 columbus rediscovered america . soon spanish conquistadores and many other europeans went to stay . different european countries took different territories , and fought over who should get which land . natives died in great numbers . the survivors lost most of their land , and most learned the language of their conquerors . after a series of wars in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , most of the colonies became independent countries . in 1300s - 1400s people in western europe searched for trading routes between the indies and europe , because the old spice trade route was too hard and too long . prices were also high because groups of merchants controlled the trade and could charge whatever they wished . some geographers thought the world was so small , ships could sail west around the world to reach east asia . the genoese sea captain christoforo columbo persuaded queen isabella of castile to finance an expedition to do this .
