Research     research is the process of solving problems and finding facts in an organised way . sometimes , research is used for challenging or making contribution to generalizable knowledge . we may have to find some new algorithms , methods or replicate existing method to against others by proving the facts . research is done by applying what is known ( if anything ) , and building on it . additional knowledge can be discovered by proving existing theories , and by trying to better explain observations . research should be systematic , organized and objective . researchers take part in field or laboratory experiments , reading relevant books , journals or websites , taking notes and making conclusions . teaching and lecturing is only part of the job of a professor or researcher . when they are not directly teaching classes they are often working on academic research . learning institutions can vary widely in what they expect from members of their faculty . most expect faculty members to set up their own laboratories . they hire their own lab employees and obtain their own funding , often from more than one source . academic researchers often compete for grants to fund research at their own university . the more money researchers can attract , the higher the prestige of that university .
