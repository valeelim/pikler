Igneous rock     igneous rock is one of the three main rock types , the others being sedimentary and metamorphic rock . igneous rocks are rocks formed from molten magma . the material is made liquid by the heat inside the earth 's mantle . when magma comes out onto the surface of the earth , it is called lava . lava cools down to form rocks such as tuff and basalt . also , the magma may slowly cool down to form rocks under the surface . an example is granite . the upper 16 km ( 10 miles ) of the earth 's crust is composed of about 95 % igneous rocks with only a thin , widespread covering of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks . igneous rocks are geologically important because : - their absolute ages may be got from various forms of radiometric dating . this gives information about the dating of adjacent non-igneous geological strata ; - their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment ( see plate tectonics ) ; - in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits ( ores ) : for example , tungsten , tin , and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites , whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros .
