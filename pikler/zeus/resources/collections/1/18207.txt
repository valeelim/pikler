Epididymis     the epididymis is the part of the human male reproductive system . it is the tube that holds the testicles in place . it stretches from the back of each testicle to the van deferens . the dinges is made up of three parts : - the head ( `` caput '' ) - the body ( `` corpus '' ) - the tail ( `` cauda '' ) sperm made in the testis go into the head ( `` caput '' ) of the epididymis , go through the body ( `` corpus '' ) and stop at the tail ( `` cauda '' ) , where they are stored . when sperm are first made and travel to the head , they are not yet ready to be ejaculated . they can not swim or fertilize an egg . by the time they reach the tail , the sperm can fertilize an egg . the sperm are transferred to the seminal visicle through the vas deferens . the sperm can not swim yet , so muscle contractions push the sperm to the seminal vesicle where final development is finished . . when the sperm are ejaculated , they move through the tail of the epididymis . there are so many sperm that they can not swim , but use peristalsis from muscles in the vas deferens .
