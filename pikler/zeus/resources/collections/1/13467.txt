Ethical tradition     an ethical tradition is a group of things that one group of people think are right and wrong . people believe that these things are right and wrong because other people think that way and they have thought that way for a long time . an ethical tradition can be like a set of laws because most people agree with it and only do what it says is right . however an ethical tradition is not normally written down and is not enforced by a police force . the branch of philosophy called ethics is not the same as an ethical tradition . this is because ethics is about asking questions and not just thinking what other people think . however some ethical philosophers want to know why people follow ethical traditions . they also want to know what ethical traditions are the same for different groups of people . this type of ethics is sometimes called the science of morals .
