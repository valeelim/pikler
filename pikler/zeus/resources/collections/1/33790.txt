Johannes Kepler     johannes kepler ( 27 december 1571 â€“ 15 november 1630 ) was a german mathematics teacher and astronomer . he was tycho brahe 's apprentice . tycho brahe looked at the way the planets moved in the sky . johannes kepler found a simple way to say how the planets move . kepler also studied other things like kepler 's supernova . a planet moves along a path called an orbit . kepler used three laws to say what form the path has and how fast the planet moves 1. kepler 's first law says that the form of the path is an ellipse , an oval or flattened circle that has two centres . the sun is in one of the centers of the ellipse . before kepler , astronomers thought that planets moved in circles within circles ( epicycles ) according to the system of claudius ptolemaeus with earth at the middle of the biggest circle . 1. kepler 's second law says how fast the planet moves around the ellipse . when the planet is closer to the sun , it moves faster . when it is farther from the sun , it moves slower . if there is a line between the planet and the sun , the line sweeps out an area as it follows the planet . the area it sweeps out in one day is always the same . before kepler , astronomers thought that planets always moved at the same speed along the circles .
