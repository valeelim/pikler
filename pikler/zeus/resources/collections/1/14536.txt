Cellular respiration     cellular respiration is the process of breaking sugar into a form that the cell can use as energy . this happens in all forms of life . cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create atp , a chemical which the cell uses for energy . usually , this process uses oxygen , and is called aerobic respiration . it has four stages known as glycolysis , link reaction , the krebs cycle , and the electron transport chain . this produces atp which supplies the energy that cells need to do work . when they do n't get enough oxygen , the cells use anaerobic respiration , which doesn ’ t require oxygen . however , this process produces lactic acid , and is not as efficient as when oxygen is used . aerobic respiration , the process that does use oxygen , produces much more energy and doesn ’ t produce lactic acid . it also produces carbon dioxide as a waste product , which then enters the circulatory system . the carbon dioxide is taken to the lungs , where it is exchanged for oxygen . the simplified formula for aerobic cellular respiration is :
