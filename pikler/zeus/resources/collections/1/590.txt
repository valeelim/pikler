Philosophy     philosophy is a way of thinking about the world , the universe , and society . it works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought , the nature of the universe , and the connections between them . the ideas in philosophy are often general and `` abstract '' . but this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world . ethics , for example , asks about the ideas underlying our everyday lives . metaphysics asks about how the world works and of what it is made . sometimes people talk about how they have a `` personal philosophy '' , which means the way a person thinks about the world . this article is `` not '' about people 's `` personal philosophies '' . this article is about the ideas that have discussed by philosophers ( people who think and write about ways of thinking ) for a long time . one philosophical question is this : `` is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it ? '' . other questions asked by philosophers are these : - what is good ?
