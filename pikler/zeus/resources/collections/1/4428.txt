List of tallest structures in the world     this is a list of tallest structures in the world , past and present of any type . most of the structures are television broadcasting masts . there are also the taller tower-type structures ( like the cn tower ) and the taller high rise buildings ( like the sears tower ) . the list also includes some other structures like oil platforms , electrical towers , bridge towers , etc . list is organized by absolute height since it includes many different classes of structures . this list includes quite a few masts . a mast is a man-made support structure , commonly used on sailing ships as support for sails , or on land as radio masts and towers used to support telecommunication equipment such as radio antennas ( `` aerials '' in the uk ) . there is often ambiguity between the terms `` tower '' and `` mast '' . a tower is a self-supporting or cantilevered structure , while a mast is held up by stays or guys . both towers and masts have limited floor space and are non-building structures , as opposed to regular buildings which have greater floor space for occupancy . the terminology is further confused through misuse . skyscrapers are often referred to as `` towers '' and some towers use the term `` mast '' . ironically , `` skyscraper '' has some etymology from references to high sailboat masts .
