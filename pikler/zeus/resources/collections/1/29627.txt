Symphony     a symphony is a piece of music written for an orchestra to play . it may be quite a long piece . usually it is divided into parts , usually 3 or 4 parts , which are called movements . the first movement of a symphony can be a fast movement , often in sonata form . the second movement can be a slow movement . the third movement can be a minuet or scherzo and a trio . the fourth movement may be called “ finale ” ; it can be in rondo form or sonata form or a combination of these . there are lots of different ways of writing a symphony , but this is the pattern that was used by joseph haydn who is known as the “ father of the symphony ” , and many composers since have used his pattern of movements for their symphonies . the word “ symphony ” comes from the greek words “ sym ” ( together ) and “ phone ” ( sound ) . “ symphonic ” means “ like a symphony ” . it is often used to describe music which is quite long and develops tunes over a long period . a large orchestra is often called a “ symphony orchestra ” . this is to distinguish it from a small orchestra called a “ chamber orchestra ” .
