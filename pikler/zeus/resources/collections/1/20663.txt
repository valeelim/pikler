Fundamental theorem of arithmetic     the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( also called the unique factorization theorem ) is a theorem of number theory . the theorem says that `` every '' positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers ( or the integer is itself a prime number ) . the theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number . if two people found two different ways to write the number , the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written . for example , we can write : and if somebody else finds `` another '' way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers , we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here . finding the prime numbers is called factorization . this theorem can be used in cryptography . the first person who proved the theorem was euclid . the first detailed and correct proof was in the `` disquisitiones arithmeticae '' by carl friedrich gau√ü . some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere . however , the theorem is `` not '' true in more general number systems , like algebraic integers . this was first mentioned by ernst kummer in 1843 , in his work on fermat 's last theorem . for more information about that : read algebraic number theory .
