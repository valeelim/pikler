Cheese     cheese is milk made into a solid form that is edible . there are many types of cheese , such as cheddar , swiss , and provolone . many things affect the form , texture , color and flavor of a cheese . these include the milk ( cow or goat ) , if the milk has been pasteurized , the amount of butterfat , bacteria and mold in the cheese , how the cheese is made , how much fat is in the cheese , and how old the cheese is . for some cheeses , the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice . most cheeses are acidified by bacteria . this bacteria turns milk sugars into lactic acid . rennet is then used to finish the curdling . vegetarian alternatives to rennet can also be used . most of these are made by fermentation of a fungus called `` mucor miehei '' . other alternatives use species of the `` cynara '' thistle family . people have been making cheese since before history was written down . it is not known when cheese was first made . it is known that cheese was eaten by the sumerians in about 4000 bc .
