The Passion of the Christ     the passion of the christ is the title of a movie that was produced and directed by mel gibson based on sister catherine emmerich 's visions . it was released in 2004. the movie shows the last 24 hours in the life of jesus of nazareth ( called by his followers jesus christ ) as told in the gospel accounts contained in the new testament that christians regard as a part of the holy bible . `` the passion of the christ '' was unusual and controversial for many reasons . all of the speech was in three languages that were spoken at the time of jesus : latin , greek and hebrew . the movie spent a lot of time showing details of the suffering and death of jesus , with lots of violent scenes . mel gibson said that this was a realistic showing of what happened , though others thought it showed too much violence . jewish groups objected to the movie because it showed the jewish leaders arranging to have jesus killed . they said that this would cause people to think that modern-day jews were guilty because of this and increase antisemitism , however this did not happen . the movie makers said that this was not their intention , but this did not stop the objections .
