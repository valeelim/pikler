Alcoholic proof     alcoholic proof is a measure of how much ethanol there is in an alcoholic drink . it is commonly used in the united states , where it is about double the percentage of alcohol by volume ( abv or alc/vol ) . this system was introduced in the 18th century . it might have happened earlier , when spirits were tested with gunpowder : a mixture of water and alcohol `` proved '' itself when it could be poured on a small amount of gunpowder and still light up the wet powder . if the powder did not ignite , the mixture had too much water in it and the proof was considered low . this process led to the nickname `` firewater '' , given by native americans . a `` proven '' solution was defined as 100 degrees proof ( 100° ) . people have found out that this takes 57.15 % ethanol . this value is still used as the british definition . a simpler ratio to remember is `` seven to four '' : 70° proof is 40 % alcohol by volume . a hydrometer can be used to measure the precise proof of a spirit . this test has gone through many formal changes .
