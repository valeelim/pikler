Computer science     computer science is the study of how to manipulate , manage , transform and encode information . there are many different areas in computer science . some of the areas consider problems in an abstract way . some areas need special machines , called computers . a person who works with computers will often need mathematics , science , and logic in order to make and use computers . this is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things , and the way to approach problems with this information . computers can do some things easily ( for example : simple math , or sorting out a list of names from a-to-z ) . but computers can not answer questions when there is not enough information , or when there is no real answer . also , computers may take too much time to finish long tasks . for example , it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the usa - so instead a computer will try to make a close guess . a computer will answer these simpler questions much faster . algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task . think about playing cards , for example . a computer scientist wants to sort these cards . first he sorts them by suits . then he orders them by number ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , jack , queen , king , and ace ) . there are many ways to sort the cards . by deciding on a set of steps of how to sort the cards , he has created an algorithm . after making the algorithm , the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm works . then , the scientist can see how well his algorithm sorts the cards .
