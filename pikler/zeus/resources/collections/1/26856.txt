Voodoo     the word voodoo , which has many different names and spellings ( like `` vodun , vodou , voudou , vudu , vodoun '' ) is the name of a west african animist , spiritual folkway . some contemporary advocates wish to enhance the credibility of voodoo by calling it a religion . however , the essence of voodoo is precisely that it is a spiritual folkway , passed from generation to generation via oral tradition and the modeling of rituals and routine spiritual practices . voodoo evolved across the centuries ; has variations from tribe to tribe ; and as `` folkway '' is the essential nature of voodoo , it could not be destroyed by white people who enslaved west africans in the new world . religion , the faith mode of white people in the new world , on the other hand is based on formal organization , myths and dogma encoded in texts , buildings constructed for worship , and an hierarchy of ordained leaders . voodoo is animist . that is , all aspects of the natural world are seen as having spiritual identity that is immune to physical death . voodoo animism includes belief in each person 's spirit surviving the death of the body , so ancestors are called upon for inspiration , protection or other influences over the material world . in the new world , most voodoo believers became christian in order to enhance their welfare under the control of christian owners ; and now most of those christian-voodoo faithful happen to identify as catholic . but the roots of voodoo are from the fon , ewe , and yoruba people of africa . the word vod√∫n is the fon-ewe word for spirit .
