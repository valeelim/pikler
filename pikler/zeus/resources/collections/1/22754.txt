Capillary     a capillary is a blood vessel . it does not have the muscular/elastic tissue of other blood vessels . it has a single celled wall to help substances be transported through organisms . capillaries are small , and smaller than any other blood vessels . they are about 5-10 μms big , which connect arteries and venules , and enable the moving of water , oxygen , carbon dioxide , as well as many other nutrients and waste chemicals between blood and surrounding tissues . blood moves from the heart to arteries , which branch and narrow into smaller arteries , and then branch more into capillaries . after oxygen has been moved to the tissue , capillaries join and widen to become small veins and then widen more to become veins , which return blood to the heart . the `` capillary bed '' is the network of capillaries supplying an organ . the more metabolically active the cells , the more capillaries it will require to supply nutrients and carry away waste products . special arteries connect between arterioles and venules and are important in bypassing the flow of blood through the capillaries . true capillaries come from mainly from metarterioles and provide movement between cells and the circulation . the width of 8 μm forces the red blood cells to partly fold into bullet-like shapes in order to bypass them in single file .
