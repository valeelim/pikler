Perfect number     a number is called a perfect number if by adding all the positive divisors of the number ( except itself ) , the result is the number itself . 6 is the first perfect number . its divisors ( other than the number itself : 6 ) are 1 , 2 , and 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6. other perfect numbers include 28 , 496 and 8128. euclid discovered that the first four perfect numbers are generated by the formula 2 ( 2 - 1 ) : euclid saw that 2 - 1 is a prime number in these four cases . he then proved that the formula 2 ( 2 - 1 ) gives an even perfect number whenever 2 - 1 is prime ( euclid , prop . ix.36 ) . ancient mathematicians made many assumptions about perfect numbers based on the four they knew . most of the assumptions were wrong . one of these assumptions was that since 2 , 3 , 5 , and 7 are precisely the first four primes , the fifth perfect number would be obtained when `` n '' = 11 , the fifth prime . however , 2 - 1 = 2047 = 23 Ã— 89 is not prime and therefore `` n '' = 11 does not give a perfect number . two other wrong assumptions were :
