River     a river is a stream of water that flows through a channel ( or passage ) in the surface of the ground . the passage where the river flows is called the river bed and the earth on each side is called a river bank . a river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground , because of gravity . a river begins as a small stream , and gets bigger the farther it flows . the water in a river is called fresh water . it comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely , unless it has been polluted . the water in a sea can not be drunk safely because it is salt water . both people and animals often live near rivers . they need water to survive and , for humans , rivers were once the only means of fast transport . the start of a river is called the `` source '' or `` head water '' . the part of the river that is near the source is called a 'young ' river . a young river is often in a v-shaped river bed , and flows quickly downhill over stones , and around big rocks . young rivers often have lots of small waterfalls and rapids .
