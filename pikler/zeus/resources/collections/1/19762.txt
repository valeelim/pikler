Offside rule     the offside rule is one of the oldest football rules , but is still a much discussed rule . this is because it is difficult for the referee or assistant referee to watch the ball , the player playing the ball and also the attacker who are seeking to receive the ball at the same time . offside is an offence committed by the team which has the ball and is punished with an indirect free kick . it is a common misconception that the ball must be played forward for an offside offence to be committed . this is incorrect however , as an offside offence is related to the position of the ball and the player receiving it rather than the direction it is played . if the player is in front of the ball when it is played and has not got at least two defending players closer to the defending goal line than they are , she or he is in an offside position . but there are some exceptions : - players can not be offside in their own half of the field . - it is not possible to be offside from a throw-in , corner kick or goal kick .
