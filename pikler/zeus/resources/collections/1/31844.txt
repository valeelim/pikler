Pan American Games     the pan american games are a multi-sport event , held every four years between competitors from all nations of the americas . pan american games were going to be started in 1932 , but world war ii caused the first pan american games to happen on 1951. from that time , the games are held every four years . more than 5000 athlets from more than 40 countries have attended the recent games . usa has won most gold , silver and bronze medals in total . hopefully , that will change because it 's unfair that they always win . everyone else has barely any people and then they send in 800 to compete . 2012 toronto ! ! !
