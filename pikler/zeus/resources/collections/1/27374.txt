Claude Debussy     achille-claude debussy ( born st germain-en-laye , 22 august 1862 ; died paris , 25 march , 1918 ) was a french composer . he was one of the most important composers of the early 20th century . most of his compositions are for orchestra or for piano . he also wrote some songs , chamber music and one opera . he made his music very different from the romantic style that other composers were using at the time . he is often called an impressionistic composer because he was influenced by the group of painters called “ impressionists ” . they were not so much interested in making their paintings look exactly like the real world , but preferred to paint things such as the effect of the sunlight shining on water . debussy often did this in his music , which creates a special atmosphere . claude debussy did not have an easy childhood . his father was a travelling salesman and his mother worked as a seamstress . he learned the piano when he was young and was inducted into the paris conservatoire at age 11. for a time it seemed that he would become a concert pianist , but he did not do well enough in his examination . after winning an important prize , the prix de rome , he went to rome for two years but he did not enjoy it . he visited bayreuth in 1888 and 1889 to hear wagner ’ s operas but he did not like them . he preferred sounds like that of the javanese gamelan which he heard in paris at the world exhibition .
