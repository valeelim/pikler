Asexual reproduction     asexual reproduction is reproduction without sex . in this form of reproduction , a single organism or cell makes a copy of itself . the genes of the original and its copy will be the same , except for rare mutations . they are clones . the main process of asexual reproduction is mitosis . this type of reproduction is common among some single-cell organisms , for example , amoeba . many plants also reproduce asexually . some organisms like bacteria reproduce using binary fission . they split in two , so one bacterium becomes two bacteria . this always leads to daughter cells , and the offspring will be identical to the parent . budding is similar to binary fission , but it is used by plants and some animals , which can not simply split in half as bacteria can . it is when a small part of a plant or animal breaks off and then , while they are separated from their `` mother '' , they start to grow until both the `` parent '' and the `` offspring '' are the same size and both are capable of budding again . this may happen many more times .
