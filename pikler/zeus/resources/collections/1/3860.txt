Shovel     a shovel is a tool used for moving loose material . shovels have a flat bottom head which is angled slightly from the handle to enable scooping and moving of material . although a shovel can be used for digging , it is much less efficient than a spade . spades are straight , and transmit force straight downwards . shovels move loose material , such as coal , snow , gravel etc . they are usually made of metal at the bottom , and wood is sometimes used for the handle .
