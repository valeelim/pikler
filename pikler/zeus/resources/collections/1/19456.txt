Harp     the harp is a musical instrument . it is the second biggest string instrument in an orchestra . it dates back to 4000 bc when the egyptians used them in holy places . christian artists often draw angels playing harps in heaven . harps have strings that are tied to the frame , which is usually a triangle made of wood . each string is tight , and the frame must be strong so that the many tight strings do not break it . the side of the triangle that leans on the player 's body is called the `` sound box '' . the top side of the triangle has a lot of pegs in it . there is one peg for each string on the harp . the top of each string is tied to one peg , and twisted around the peg . the player turns the peg to make the string more tight or less tight . this is how the player makes each string make the right note . the bottom of each string is tied to the sound box . the last side of the triangle is called the pillar . many of the oldest harps did not have them . if the strings were too tight , they would break the harp . adding a pillar to a harp frame makes the frame very strong , so that the strings will not break it .
