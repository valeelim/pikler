'hits ' can only be scored by hitting the target area with the point of the sword . the target area is the torso . the épée is the heaviest of the three weapons . to score a hit , the push-button on the end of the weapon must remain fully down for 2-10 milliseconds , and must arrive ( hit ) with a force of at least 7.35 newtons . the target area for épée is the entire body . this includes the feet and the head . the sabre is the `` cutting '' weapon , with a curved guard ( to protect the hand ) and a triangular blade . however , in modern electric scoring , a touch with any part of the sabre , ( point , flat or edge , as long as it is on target ) will count as a hit . the target area in sabre is everything from the waist up , except for the hands .
