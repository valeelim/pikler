Ecosystem     an ecosystem is a large community of living organisms ( plants , animals and microbes ) in a particular area . the living and physical components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows . ecosystems can be of any size , but usually they are in particular places . each ecosystem has its own community . an aquarium community , for example , can have small fishes and other organisms . a desert community may have cacti , small snakes , and scorpions . a pond community can have frogs , insects , snakes , and plants , and a forest community may have rabbits , foxes and pine trees . the species in a community are divided into populations according to the particular habitats in the ecosystem . ecosystems are stable , but not rigid . they react to major changes in the environment , especially climate changes . for example , the major rainforests have lasted for a long time ( perhaps 50 million years or more in some cases ) . as the rainfall and temperature changes , they change . we know that the amazon rainforest shrank in size during ice ages , and expanded in the warmer periods .
