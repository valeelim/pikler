Greenhouse gas     greenhouse gases reflect radiation that the earth emits , and stop it from being lost into space . this causes the earth 's temperature to be higher than it would be without greenhouse gases . the name for this is the `` greenhouse effect . '' most greenhouse gases are natural - water vapor is the most common , and causes most of the greenhouse effect on earth . other greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , chlorofluorocarbon and ozone . without greenhouse gases , the earth would be on average 33 degrees celsius colder . life as we know it would probably not be possible on earth , for heat is important for life . natural emissions of greenhouse gases vary . for example , the great volcanic eruptions that created the siberian traps a quarter billion years ago may have released enough gases to partly cause the permian–triassic extinction event which killed most life on earth . however , humans are adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere . mainstream science believes that this has caused the planet 's average temperature to rise by increasing the greenhouse effect . the most important greenhouse gas that humans add to the atmosphere is carbon dioxide which is less than 0.4 % of the atmosphere . carbon dioxide is released when people burn fossil fuels , like oil , coal , and natural gas . carbon dioxide emissions come mostly from transportation , energy and industries . among these , the largest contributor is from meat production . the food and agriculture organization said emissions associated with livestock added up to 7.1 gigatonnes ( gt ) of carbon dioxide equivalent ( co-eq ) per year – or 14.5 % of all human-caused greenhouse releases . this exceeds the 13 % that comes from global transport ( including all cars and planes ) each year .
