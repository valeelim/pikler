Bias     bias means that a person prefers an idea and possibly does not give equal chance to a different idea . bias can be influenced by a number of factors , such as popularity ( for example , a newspaper might be biased towards a particular political party due to their employees sharing the same political beliefs as that party ) . bias in an article or editorial would show one point of view , using selected facts and quotes to support that point of view . facts or opinions that do not support the point of view in a biased article would be excluded . for example , an article biased toward riding a motorcycle would show facts about the good gas mileage , fun , and agility . an article biased against motorcycle riding would show facts about risk of injury and noise , and ignore positive facts about motorcycles . an article biased against guns would show only facts and information that support the author 's position . they would list suicides , accidental shootings and other facts showing guns in a negative way . an article biased for guns should show only information that supports the author 's position . the positively biased article would list out 'lives saved ' by guns , numbers of crimes prevented by civilian gun use , and other facts and data that put gun ownership and guns in a good light .
