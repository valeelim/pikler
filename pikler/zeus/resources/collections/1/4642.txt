Square     a square is a shape with four equal sides and four corners that are all right angles ( 90 degrees ) . the diagonals of a square also cross at right angles . the angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees . a square has rotational symmetry of four . it has four lines of regular symmetry . a square is a type of rectangle with all sides of equal length . however note that while a square is a type of rectangle , a rectangle does not necessarily need to be a square . a square is also the 2-dimensional analogue of a cube . formulas . - area : w² where w represents the length of any side . - area : ½d² where d represents the length of the diagonal , meaning the length of the line segment from one corner of the square to another . - perimeter : 4w where w represents the length of any side . - perimeter : 4d÷sqrt ( 2 ) where d represents the length of the diagonal , and sqrt ( n ) means the square root of n. - the diagonal is equal to the square root of two , multiplied by the length of any side .
