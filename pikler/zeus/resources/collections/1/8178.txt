Embryo     an embryo is the earliest stage in the development of a fertilised egg ( the zygote ) . it is the term used for any animal or plant , from the first cell division until birth , or hatching , or germination in plants . in humans , it is called an embryo until about eight weeks after fertilization , and from then until birth it is called a foetus ( us : fetus ) . the development of the embryo is called embryogenesis , and the study of embryos is called embryology . the development of an embryo passes through various stages : the blastula , a hollow ball of cells ; the gastrula , migration of cells ; morphogenesis ; tissue differentiation , and so on . in organisms that reproduce sexually , once a sperm fertilizes an egg cell , the result is a cell called the zygote , which has dna from each of the two parents . in plants , animals , and some protists , the zygote divides by mitosis to produce an embryo .
