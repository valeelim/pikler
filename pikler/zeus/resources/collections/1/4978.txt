Republic     a republic is a type of government that has no king , queen , or other monarch and where the people are sovereign . this means that people can choose leaders to represent them and make the laws . the word republic comes from the latin language words `` res publica '' , which means `` public thing '' . however , in practice some nominal republics are actually dictatorships , such as the russian soviet republic and the other republics of the ussr from 1922 before it was dissolved in 1991. countries with a king or other monarch and free elections is called a constitutional monarchy . this includes the united kingdom and the other commonwealth realms . what makes a republic different , is that the people do not need the permission of a king , or other higher power , to choose leaders and the type of government they want . laws are made and enforced in the name of the people . the head of state in a republic is generally a person who has been chosen by the citizens , either by direct election or by a group of elected representatives to act as the top representative of the people . in most republics , the head of state is called the president . in some countries , the president is elected and has a lot of political power . in others , the president does not hold a lot of direct power , but is important in the legal system for other reasons .
