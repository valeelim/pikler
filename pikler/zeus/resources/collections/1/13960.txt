Well     a well is a hole that is dug into the earth to get water ( or crude oil or natural gas ) . a qanat is an ancient complex water well system used in the middle east . wells can be as simple as a hole that a bucket on a rope can be lowered into , or very complex with pipes and high-powered pumps to get the water out . most cities that are not close to fresh water lakes or rivers get their water from wells . it is important to be careful what rubbish is put into the ground near a well . if something toxic is put in the ground , it could end up in the water from the well and make people sick . water is a problem for many african countries . many charities are helping to build wells in local villages to help stop lengthy travel to distant water supply . a well only works if underneath there is an aquifer which feeds it .
