Mind     the mind is a general term for the way a person that thinks , reasons , perceives , wills , and feels . for science , what others call the mind is `` entirely '' caused by workings of the brain . the philosopher gilbert ryle called mind the `` ghost in the machine '' . he said the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken `` official doctrine '' . however , some think that mind is separate from the body and is called a soul ( see dualism ) . many people argue about what makes up the mind . some say that only reason and memory are part of the mind , because they are conscious . in this view the emotions like love , hate , fear and joy are different from the mind . some people with this view say the emotions are part of the heart . others argue that our rational and emotional states can not be separated and should all be part of what we call the mind . people often use `` mind `` to mean the same as `` thought '' : the way we talk to ourselves `` inside our heads '' . this is where the sayings `` make up our minds , '' `` change our minds '' and `` of two minds '' come from . one of the important things of the mind in this sense is that it is private . no one else can `` know our mind .
