Conceptual metaphor     a conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain ( group of ideas ) in terms of another . for example , treating quantity in terms of direction : 1 . `` prices are rising '' . 1 . `` i attacked every weak point in his argument '' . ( argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth ) . 1 . `` life is a journey '' . 1 . `` love '' talked about as if it were `` war '' or `` competition '' . 1 . `` time '' talked about as if it were a `` path through space '' , or a `` quantity '' that can be saved or spent or wasted . the idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by george lakoff and mark johnson in 1980 : `` metaphors we live by '' . a convention is to write conceptual metaphors in small capital letters , e.g . , with the target domain ( idea being referred to ) first , here `` money , '' and the source domain ( terms used to refer to it ) second . political metaphors . - eminence grise : literally , `` grey man , '' from french . colloquially , the power-behind-the-throne . an official close to the president or monarch who has so much power behind the scenes that he or she may double or serve as the monarch .
