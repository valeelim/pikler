Falcon     falcons are small birds of prey and are related to hawks and eagles . they usually have pointed wings and long tails . most falcons eat small mammals that they hunt using eyesight , although some species hunt other birds , which they take in flight . like hawks , most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings , with white undersides . the peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 km/h ( 200 mi/h ) . it was nearly wiped out in north america by the use of pesticides , but has since made a recovery . in some countries falcons are used in falconry . this means people catch the birds and make them hunt for them . long ago this was a way for people to get more food but today it is a sport . on the moroccan island of mogador , falcons seem to imprison small birds by trapping them in crevasses , presumably saving them to eat later . mogador has the ruins of a fortress , a mosque and a prison . today the island is a nature reserve , where eleonora â€™ s falcons nest among the ruins . they hunt migrating warblers , hoopoes and other birds . researchers came across small birds trapped in deep cavities , their flight and tail feathers removed . the birds were unable to move their wings or use their dangling legs .
