Eye     the eye is a round organ for sensing light so animals can see . about 97 percent of animals have eyes . image-resolving eyes are present in cnidaria , molluscs , vertebtates , annelids and arthropods . in mammals , two kinds of cells , `` rods '' and `` cones '' , allow sight by sending signals through the optic nerve to the brain . some animals can see light that humans can not see . they can see ultraviolet or infrared light . the `` lens '' on the front part of the eye acts like a camera lens . it can be pulled flatter by muscles inside the eye , or allowed to become rounder . as some people get older , they may not be as able to do this perfectly . many people are born with other small problems or get them later in life , and they may need eyeglasses ( or `` contact lenses '' ) to fix the problem . today , ten different types of eyes are known . most ways of capturing an image have evolved at least once . one way to categorize eyes is to look at the number of `` chambers '' . `` simple eyes '' are made of only one concave chamber , perhaps with a lens . compound eyes have many such chambers with their lenses on a convex surface .
