Moment of silence     a moment of silence is a short time when people do not make noise . a moment of silence shows respect for people who have died . many countries observe a minute of silence after a tragic event . moments of silence often last one minute , but other amounts of time may be chosen . on november 11th , many countries observe a two minute silence to remember those who have died in world wars . the tradition was started in 1919 exactly one year after the end of world war i. it became an official part of the annual service on armistice day . during the moment of silence , people often bow their heads , remove their hats , and do not speak or move . a person in charge of a group will tell everyone when the moment begins and ends . a moment of silence may come before or after other events with symbolic meaning . examples of these events are the ringing of bells , the release of doves or balloons , or a bugle playing the `` last post '' . in the united states , some people say that allowing prayer as part of a moment of silence means that moments of silence can make it hard to keep the separation of church and state ( the idea that religion and government should not affect each other ) .
