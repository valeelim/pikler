Snow leopard     the snow leopard ( `` panthera uncia '' ) is a feline , which lives in central asia . it used to be thought not closely related to the smaller leopard , which is why they are put in different genera before . however , recent research has discovered this is not correct . the cat is closely related to the other big four in the genus `` panthera '' . snow leopards are about 2-5 meters long in the body , and have a 90-100 centimeter long tail . they weigh up to 75 kilograms . they have grey and white fur with dark rosettes and spots , and their tails have stripes . its fur is very long and thick to protect it against the cold . their feet are also big and furry , which helps them to walk on snow easier . they use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill . they are one of the cats which can not purr : `` in five cat species ( lion , tiger , jaguar , leopard and snow leopard ) the epihyoideum is an elastic ligament , whereas in all other species of the felidae the epihyal is completely ossified ( bony ) ... those felids with an elastic epihyoid are able to roar but not purr , while species with a completely ossified hyoid are able to purr but not to roar '' . despite this , it seems now that snow leopards can not roar , though they can make a number of other sounds .
