Homo sapiens     homo sapiens ( latin : `` wise man '' ) is the scientific name for the human species . `` homo '' is the human genus , which also includes neanderthals and many other extinct species of hominid ; `` h. sapiens '' is the only surviving species of the genus `` homo '' . modern humans are sometimes called `` anatomically modern humans '' . `` homo sapiens '' considers itself the most influential species on the planet , but many species of life , mostly plants and protists , have had a much greater effect on the outside of earth and its air . the recent african origin of modern humans is the mainstream model describing the origin and dispersal of anatomically modern humans . the hypothesis that humans have a single origin was published in charles darwin 's `` the descent of man '' ( 1871 ) . the concept is supported by a study of present-day mitochondrial dna , and with evidence based on physical anthropology of fossil humans . according to genetic and fossil evidence , older versions of `` homo sapiens '' evolved only in africa , between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago , with members of one branch leaving africa by 60,000 years ago and over time replacing earlier human populations such as neanderthals and `` homo erectus '' .
