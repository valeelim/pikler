Celtic languages     the celtic languages are a language family inside of the indo-european languages . there are six celtic languages still spoken in the world today , spoken in north-west europe . they are divided into two groups , the goidelic ( or gaelic ) and the brythonic ( or british ) . the three goidelic languages still spoken are irish , scottish , and manx . scottish is the main language spoken in parts of north-west scotland and irish is the main language spoken in the gaeltacht in ireland . manx is spoken mainly by people interested in the language . the three brythonic languages are welsh , cornish , and breton . of these cornish became extinct in the 18th century but people have started speaking it again now . welsh is spoken everywhere throughout wales , but is mainly the first language for people in the western part of wales , in the area some people call the bro gymraeg . breton is spoken mainly in west brittany , and is the only celtic language not mainly spoken in the british isles . because brittany is part of france , the language is in danger of becoming extinct , just like cornish , and there are ongoing efforts to prevent this from happening .
