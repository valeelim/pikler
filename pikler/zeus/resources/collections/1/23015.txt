Gymnosperm     the gymnosperms are a group of seed plants which includes conifers , cycads , `` ginkgo '' and gnetales . they have naked seeds , in contrast to the seeds or ovules of flowering plants ( angiosperms ) which are enclosed during pollination . gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scale- or leaf-like appendages of cones , or at the end of short stalks ( `` ginkgo '' ) . the gymnosperms and angiosperms together make up the spermatophytes or seed plants . by far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers ( pines , cypresses , and relatives ) , followed by cycads , gnetales ( `` gnetum '' , `` ephedra '' and `` welwitschia '' ) , and `` ginkgo '' ( a single living species ) . fossil gymnosperms include many that do not belong to the four modern groups , including the so-called `` seed ferns '' ( pteridosperms ) and the `` cycadeoids '' ( bennettitales ) . most of the gymnosperms became extinct in the cenozoic era ( from 65 million years ago to present day ) . related pages . - seed other websites . - gymnosperm database
