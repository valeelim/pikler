Cuckoo clock     a cuckoo clock is a kind of clock . cuckoo clocks have a case made of wood that looks like a small house . it gets its name because at the start of every hour , a small door on the clock open up and a little wooden bird comes out . the clock then makes a noise which sounds like a bird call ( `` koo-koo '' or `` cuckoo '' ) . the clock makes the sound one time for each hour it is , and there may also be a bell that rings when the sound is made . whether it is morning or night does not change the number of times this happens . for example : - 1 o'clock in the afternoon = 1 `` cuckoo '' - 8 o'clock in the morning = 8 `` cuckoos '' - 8 o'clock at night = 8 `` cuckoos '' like many other clocks , cuckoo clocks can work using weights , springs , or electricity . every clock is different , both in how it looks , how it works , and what it does . the sound of the `` cuckoo '' usually comes from bellows in mechanical clocks , or from a speaker in electric clocks . the clock may do more than just make this sound ; some clocks also have figures that move around as music is played .
