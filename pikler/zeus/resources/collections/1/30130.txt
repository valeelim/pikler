Particle physics     particle physics is a category of physics that studies really tiny pieces of things , known as particles . these particles are the really small pieces that build up the world around us . particles can carry fundamental forces . for example , the electromagnetic force is carried by photons . the four fundamental forces are responsible for almost everything in all of physics . these fundamental forces are : gravity , magnetism , weak interaction and strong interaction . one of the important concepts of particle physics is called the standard model . the standard model is a theory which tries to explain the fundamental forces . the standard model combined with general relativity is currently the most accepted explanation of how the universe works . the standard model is known to have problems . for example , there is not much in it that explains gravity . this is why general relativity , a different theory to explain how things have gravity , needs to be included in order for physicists to explain the universe . there is a lot of work to improve the theory and/or find a better theory that is being done . this work is often called theoretical particle physics , because none of it has been actually proven . theoretical particle physicists make theories to try to improve the standard model . one example of this is how there are many theories that predict undiscovered particles .
