Dome     a dome is a feature of architecture that usually looks like the upper half of a sphere on top of a building . it is a feature that makes many religious and government buildings stand out , because if someone is speaking to others inside or under a dome , the voice sounds louder . also a dome makes it easier to identify an important building , for example a temple or a palace . a large stadium with a roof over the playing field is often called a `` dome '' . one example of that usage is the metrodome .
