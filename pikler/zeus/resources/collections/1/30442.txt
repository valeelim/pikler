Whaling     whaling is the practice of hunting whales . this is done to get meat and oil , called blubber . hunters of whales are called whalers . whaling has been done at least since 3000 bc . many communities on the coast have done whaling for food for a long time . they have also killed stranded whales . industrialisation started in the 17th century and also affected whaling . special ships were built for whaling , and whales were hunted until they were almost extinct . as technology improved and demand for the seemingly vast resources remained high , far more whales were killed than were born . in the late 1930s more than 50,000 whales were killed each year . by the middle of the 20th century , there were not enough whales and they were at risk of becoming extinct . in 1986 , the international whaling commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling so that whales might recover . this moratorium was successful , and whale stocks recovered . there is a debate about whaling in general . countries which are in favor of whaling want to do away with the moratorium , so they can again hunt whales as they did before . countries and environmental groups say that whaling is immoral and should be banned , and that stocks have not yet recovered sufficiently .
