Erinyes     the erinyes ( or eumenides ) were the goddesses of revenge in greek mythology . they are also known as the furies . these three female divinities were named alecto , tisiphone , and megaera . the erinyes were born from mother earth and the blood of uranos . they avenged family crimes such as matricide and parricide . they also tormented evil men in the `` hell '' of the underworld , tartarus . the erinyes forever followed a person who did a crime . they even could make the person go mad . they are often shown with snakes on their heads , blood coming out of their eyes , and looking horrific . a well known story about the erinyes is that of orestes . orestes ' mother klytaimnestra , and her lover aegisthos , killed orestes ' father agamemnon . the god apollo told orestes to kill the murderers of his father , which he did . orestes was then pursued by the erinyes for his crime . with the help of athena and apollo orestes went to a court in athens . it was decided that orestes acted correctly and nobody should hurt him . even the erinyes accepted the decision , and from then on they were also called eumenides , which means `` the kind ones '' , because they could also let people go in peace if their crime was done for a good reason .
