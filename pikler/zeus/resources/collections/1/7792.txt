Central Intelligence Agency     the central intelligence agency ( cia ) is a part of the federal government of the united states . the agency was formed after world war ii . the cia is made up of four groups that each do different things . their goal is to protect the us people . many people feel that the cia does more bad than good . some people feel that the cia does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the united states . others think those secrets should remain secret . american law makes it illegal for the cia and other agencies to kill foreign leaders . in 1992 , saddam hussein tried to kill former president george h.w . bush , who used to be director of the cia , during a visit to kuwait . the assassination plot was not successful . in retaliation , then-president clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the iraqi equivalent to the cia . this occurred at night so only the janitors were killed , not those who planned the assassination . cia has many clandestine , or secret , operations . some cia employees have been killed while working . their names are on a cia memorial but some of the names are stil secret . the memorial has a star for them , instead .
