Macroeconomics     macroeconomics studies large-scale economic decisions . for example , a whole country 's economy ( or , its economic output ) is summarised by the gdp ( gross domestic product ) . many governments use macroeconomic ideas to decide how much tax to collect and what interest rates should be . it also considers the amount of unemployment , the rate that prices go up ( inflation ) , and the exchange rates of its currency . the exchange rate affects the amount of imports and exports . exchange rates and taxation are `` levers of the economy '' . less dramatic , but also very important , are decisions about government spending inside the country . such policy decisions are politically controversial due to differing political ideas on government spending . another factor in macroeconomics is the make-up of the population . a growing population is economically different from a stable population ( one which is not growing ) . sources . - blanchard , olivier 2011 . `` macroeconomics updated '' . 5th ed , englewood cliffs : prentice hall . isbn 978-0-13-215986-9
