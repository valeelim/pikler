RNA     rna is an acronym for ribonucleic acid , a nucleic acid . many different kinds are now known . rna is physically different from dna : dna contains two intercoiled strands , but rna only contains one single strand . rna also contains different bases from dna . these bases are the following : adenine often forms bonds with uracil , and guanine often forms bonds with cytosine . in this way , we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine . the first three bases are also found in dna , but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine . rna also contains ribose as opposed to deoxyribose found in dna . these differences result in rna being chemically more reactive than dna . this makes it the more suitable molecule to take part in cell reactions . rna is the carrier of genetic information in certain viruses , especially the retroviruses like the hiv virus . this is the only exception to the general rule that dna is the hereditary substance . the main function of rna is to carry information of amino acid sequence from the genes to where proteins are assembled on ribosomes in the cytoplasm .
