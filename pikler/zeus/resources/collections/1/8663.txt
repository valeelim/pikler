Sticky note     a sticky note is a small piece of paper with a strip of glue along one edge that make it `` sticky , '' so you can stick it to things . the most common sticky note is the post-it , which is made by a company called 3m . in 1974 a man named arthur fry came up with the idea for the sticky note . he used a glue that was originally too weak to be used for anything else , so the notes would come off easy . 3m started to sell post-its in 1980. in 2001 , the patent for the glue that 3m uses on post-it notes expired , so many other companies now make similar sticky notes . other websites . - official post-it notes website - post-it notes generator
