Indian subcontinent     the indian subcontinent is a term mainly used for the geographic region surrounded by the indian ocean : the republic of india , afghanistan , pakistan , kashmir ( disputed region ) , nepal , sikkim , bangladesh , sri lanka ( ceylon ) , bhutan and myanmar ( burma ) and few other countries . the subcontinent was once part of gondwana , the ancient southern supercontinent . geologically , the origin of the himalayas is the impact of the indian tectonic plate travelling northward at 15 cm per year to slowly hit the eurasian continent , about 40-50 million years ago . the formation of the himalayan arc resulted since the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time were easily uplifted into mountains . an often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of mount everest is made of marine limestone . about 50 million years ago , this fast moving plate had completely closed the tethys ocean . the existence of the tethys has been proved by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor , and the volcanoes that fringed its edges . since these sediments were light , they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sank to the floor . the indian plate is still driving horizontally below the tibetan plateau , which forces the plateau to move upwards .
