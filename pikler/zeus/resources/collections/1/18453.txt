Zombie     a zombie or zombi is a mythical dead person who has returned to life as a walking corpse . mythical things that have been `` re-animated '' are called `` undead '' , and a group of them can be called `` the living dead '' . the zombie myth came from the caribbean . zombies have become very popular in horror movies . they are dead creatures that have been brought back to life by science or by magic , and eat the flesh or brains of living people ! in haiti people believe that voodoo sorcerers or 'bokor ' can bring dead people back to life , making a zombie . the zombie is under the control of the sorcerer because zombies have no free will . a zombie is a trapped human soul . if a sorcerer can catch the trapped soul , the sorcerer becomes more powerful . wade davis , a canadian ethnobotanist ( someone who studies what effect plants have on people ) , wrote about zombies in two books , the serpent and the rainbow ( 1985 ) and ( 1988 ) . davis went to haiti in 1982 and wrote about how a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being rubbed into a wound . the first powder brings a 'deathlike ' state because of a certain poison in it , called tetrodotoxin ( the same deadly poison found in the japanese blowfish ) . at just the right amount , it can make a person almost die , but not quite . the second powder puts the person in a zombie-like state where they seem to have no free will of their own .
