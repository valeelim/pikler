Chief Joseph     chief joseph ( 1840 â€“ september 21 , 1904 ; whose real name was hinmaton-yalaktit ) was the chief of the nez perce native americans , a tribe that lived in what is now the pacific northwest of the united states . his father was the leader of the nez-perce before him , and his mother was a member of this tribe too . when joseph was young , his father always told him not to trust white men , he actually had problems with settlers . when his father died , joseph became chief of the tribe , who resided in plateaus in northeast oregon , southeast washington and western idaho . the turning point in their relationship to white men was the gold rush in 1863. it gave the us government the opportunity to reduce their reservation to a small area in idaho . then , with the new waves of white men settling in the west , the government wanted to drive nez-perces away from their territory . chief joseph was extremely sad : this place was the tribe 's territory where their ancestors were buried . in spite of that , he wanted to avoid conflict and remain in peace . in 1873 he decided to negotiate with the us government . he travelled all the way to washington d.c. and spoke to president ulysses s. grant . but he only got mean looks and little attention .
