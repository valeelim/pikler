Harpsichord     harpsichords are keyboard instruments that make sound by having the strings plucked with a plectrum . they are thought to have originated when a keyboard was attached to a psaltery . this makes them different from a clavichord where the strings are hit . the piano is therefore closer to a clavichord than a harpsichord . on a piano it is possible to play louder or quieter by playing the keys with more or less force . on a harpsichord the volume ( playing louder or softer ) can not be controlled by the way it is played . however , some large harpsichords have several `` stops '' , each one giving a different kind of sound . the largest harpsichords have two manuals ( keyboards ) which gives more variety . it makes it possible for the right hand to play the tune on one manual while the left hand plays an accompaniment more quietly on the other . some small harpsichords were called `` virginals '' , perhaps because they were played by young girls . there are also spinets which were very small and sometimes wing-shaped . they could be picked up and put on a table .
