Scuba diving     scuba diving is a sport where people ( called `` scuba divers '' , or simply `` divers '' ) can swim underwater for a long time , using a tank filled with compressed air . the tank is a large metal cylinder made of steel or aluminum . the word scuba is an acronym from underwater breathing apparatus . in the 1600s , a diving bell would be lowered that had trapped air in it . a diver would breathe that air and swim in an and out of the bell until the air became bad . then a heavy suit was made that had a hose attached to an air compressor on land . it was difficult to swim and not get tangled , but it was safer than the diving bell . the first scuba systems used a heavy diving helmet with windows . divers would walk on the seafloor instead of swimming . the regulator would send air to the helmet by hand control . jacques cousteau was a very famous frenchman who developed several important parts of the scuba system and made it useful . one part was a better regulator that only sent air when the diver breathed in . this let the divers go farther on one tank . it was light enough to use with fins and easily swim . he also took many underwater movies and showed people what was under the water and why it needed to be protected .
