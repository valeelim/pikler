Sufism     sufism ( also known as tassawuf ) is a group or branch in islam with a mystic path or system . someone who practices sufism is called a sufi , a `` dervish '' or a `` fakir '' . at first , sufism only meant making islam more personal and internal . some say it first came from constantly reciting the qur'an , meditating , and through experience . others believe that sufism is trying to live as the holy prophet muhammad did , to be closer to god . this is how the prophet taught his disciples . additionally , the muslim conquests had brought large numbers of christian monks and hermits , especially in syria and egypt , under muslim rule . they believed in a deeply spiritual and mystical ( even 'platonic ' ) way of life and many of their ways became part of early sufism . some of these teachings were then summarized in texts ( in arabic initially ) . important contributions in writing are attributed to uwais al-qarni , harrm bin hian , hasan basri and sayid ibn al-mussib , who are regarded as among the first sufis in the earliest generations of islam . harith al-muhasibi was the first one to write about moral psychology . rabia basri was a sufi known for her love and passion for god , expressed through her poetry . bayazid bastami was among the first theorists of sufism .
