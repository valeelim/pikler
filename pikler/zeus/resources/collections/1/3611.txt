Ice     ice is the common name for frozen water . other liquids , such as ammonia or methane or milk could be called ice when they freeze but they are called 'milk ice ' , for instance , instead of just 'ice ' . liquid water becomes solid ice when it is very cold . the freezing point is 0° [ [ celsius ( 32° fahrenheit or 273 kelvin ) . ice is commonly made in a home refrigerator or freezer . if water is put in a freezer and left for a while , the water gets very cold and will freeze solid , creating ice . water can be placed into a copper ( or other metal ) container to cause it freeze into ice faster . metals are good conductors of heat , so water can freeze faster than in a plastic ice tray . unlike other liquids , water expands as it freezes to become ice ; so ice floats on water because ice has less density than water . this is very unusual - just about every other liquid gets more dense as it cools ; water ice , however , is an important exception . liquid water expands by about 9 % as it becomes ice - it takes up more space . this is because the water molecules are actually farther apart instead of being closer together . the molecules in an ice crystal are arranged in a way that makes it less dense than liquid water .
