Devil     in some religions , the devil is a bad spirit that tries to create problems for people . some people also use the words `` the devil '' or `` satan '' for the most powerful devil . the word `` devil '' comes from the greek word `` diabolos '' which means `` someone who tells lies to hurt you '' . ( `` diabolos '' is translated to the english word `` slanderer . '' ) the new testament uses `` diabolos '' as a title for satan , and so `` the devil '' became another name for satan in english . in the old testament , there is the serpent and the shaitan , who may be two different characters . `` shaitan '' in hebrew means `` adversary '' , an enemy or opponent . shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the koran , who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing . in christianity the devil was originally an angel in heaven called lucifer . but he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against god . after a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven . some other angels who helped him were also thrown out .
