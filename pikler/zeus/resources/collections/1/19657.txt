Estuary     an estuary is where a river meets the sea . there , saltwater mixes with freshwater . the river becomes wider and wider and flows slowly to the ocean . bays , marshes , swamps , and inlets can all have estuaries . a view of an estuary from the air is usually an interesting sight : many estuaries meander ( curve and bend ) to find their way to the sea . estuaries come in all sizes and shapes , each according to its location and climate . where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water , the mixture is called brackish water . some estuaries are very large . they may be large ocean bays that have more than one river flowing into them . for example , chesapeake bay is a large estuary , and several different rivers meet the atlantic ocean there . estuaries are usually filled with shallow waters , and sunlight reaches all levels of the water . marsh grasses , algae , and other kinds of plants live in estuaries and provide food for a variety of fish , crabs , oysters , and shrimp . estuaries are especially important since they act as nurseries for many different types of young fish and other animals before they head out toward the open ocean . many sea birds also nest in estuaries .
