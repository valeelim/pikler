Teufelsbrücke     the teufelsbrücke ( bridge of the devil ) is a bridge over the river reuss in the swiss canton of uri . the valley called `` schöllenenschlucht '' is an important access route to the st.gotthard alpine pass . however , the valley is very narrow , featuring a dangerous river reuss . the first bridge across the river was built in 1230. this was a wooden bridge . this meant that due to bad weather it had to be replaced often . in the 16th century , it was replaced by a bridge of stone . that stone bridge was heavily damaged in the napoleonic wars in 1799. nobody could use the bridge because of the damage . trade with italy was done over the alpine pass at splügen . the first bridge was completely destroyed in a stormy night in 1888. only in 1820 could the order to build a new bridge be given . the construction of the bridge took 10 years . in the middle of the 20th century , the second bridge was no longer able to handle the traffic . a third bridge , featuring two lanes , one for each direction , was built in 1958 .
