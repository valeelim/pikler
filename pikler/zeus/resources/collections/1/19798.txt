Ethernet     ethernet is a way of connecting computers together in a local area network or lan . it has been the most widely used method of linking computers together in lans since the 1990s . the basic idea of its design is that multiple computers have access to it and can send data at any time . this is comparatively easy to engineer . if two computers send data at the same time , a collision will occur . when this happens , the data sent is not usable . in general , both computers will stop sending , and wait a random amount of time , before they try again . a special protocol was developed to deal with such problems . it is called carrier sense multiple access with collision detection or csma/cd . there are different ethernet standards . today , ethernet cables look like thick telephone cables . they connect to boxes called hubs or switches . each cable runs from a computer 's network interface card ( nic ) to such a box . this cable is called 10baset or 100baset , or 1000baset cable . all cable types : - 10base2 and 10base5 : these coaxial cables are like those used in television , but they are a bit thinner . they are also called `` thinnet '' or `` coax '' . each computer has a `` t '' plugged into it , and cables plug into each side of the `` t '' . sometimes , instead of a `` t '' , a `` vampire tap '' is used which goes through the skin of a cable . it supports 10mbits per second transfer speed , and was the first to be adopted .
