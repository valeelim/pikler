Chemical element     a chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom . if a substance contains more than one type of atom , it is a compound . an element can be a solid , liquid or gas . the smallest particle of such an element is an atom . atoms are made up of protons , neutrons , and electrons . each element contains only one kind of atom . the number of protons in an atom is called the atomic number . for example , all atoms with 6 protons are of the chemical element carbon , and all atoms with 92 protons are of the element uranium . the number of protons in the nucleus causes its electric charge . this fixes the number of electrons in its normal ( unionized ) state . the electrons in their atomic orbitals determine the atom 's various chemical properties . elements are the basic building blocks for all types of substances . when they are combined with each other , they can form molecules . 118 different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry . 92 of these elements can be found in nature , and the others can only be made in laboratories . the human body is made up of 26 elements . the last natural element discovered was uranium , in 1789. the first man-made element was technetium , in 1937 .
