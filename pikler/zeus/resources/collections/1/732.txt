Site     a site is a real fixed physical location where something will or has happened or a place where something is . it is used very often in building trades to mean the place where a building will go up . a gravesite is a place where a person will be buried after they die . the words onsite and offsite refer to work that must take place on the site , or which can take place somewhere else . for instance , a prefabricated building can be `` built offsite '' and then `` moved onsite '' . `` site '' is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for `` website '' . in this case no real physical location exists other than the place where the computers are , and one `` goes to the site '' simply by using a web browser to `` go to '' that url . this is a conceptual metaphor . it can be confusing . someone who uses it is also likely using other jargon .
