Infrared     infrared ( ir ) radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation ( a wave with electricity ) . the wave is longer than light which humans can see and shorter than microwaves . the word `` infrared '' means `` below red '' . it comes from the latin word `` infra '' ( meaning `` below '' ) and the english word `` red '' . ( infrared light has a frequency `` below '' the frequency of red light . ) red light has the longest wavelength that human eyes can see . infrared waves can not be seen by the eye . the infrared wave is between 800 nm and 1 mm . people sense infrared as heat . most remote controls use infrared to send the control signals . many missiles for anti-aircraft warfare find their target by infrared . before bluetooth was invented , some computers , personal digital assistants , and mobile phones were using the infrared technology to send files to other devices . bluetooth replaced infrared in the early 2000 's . infrared is limited by the need to have both devices in a `` line of sight '' with each other . infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems . infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330 nm ( least dispersion ) or 1,550 nm ( best transmission ) are the best choices for standard silica fibers .
