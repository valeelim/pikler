Human development theory     even though economics is all about choice on the basis of what is available rather than what should be available , the big question relates to who decides how resources should be distributed and how economics can embrace a trade-off between different groups which each seek to make the most of their allocation of resources . if `` what should be '' can not be incorporated , the subject of economics will be as dry as desert as described by ayn rand . the challenge therefore is to construct a model combining `` what is '' to `` what should be '' and make the same acceptable to common man as well as politicians . not being able to sell the idea as such is a defeat to the discipline . the issue is that of influence and not of theory , as adam smith perceived that no group of business men ever met other than to exploit the consumer .
