Phrasal verb     phrasal verb is the name given to an english verb which is composed of two or three words . one verb is combined with a preposition ( like `` on , in , under ) '' or an adverb ( like `` up , down , away '' ) . sometimes a phrasal verb can have a meaning that is very different to the meaning of at least one of those two or three words separately . some text books call these verbs multi-word verbs . phrasal verbs are used more frequently in everyday speech than in formal , official writing or speaking . here are some examples : `` maria did n't know the word , so she '' looked it up `` in the dictionary . '' `` oh no , we 've '' run out of `` milk ! i 'll have to buy some more . '' `` farmers have to '' get up `` early in the morning . '' `` the rocket '' took off `` with a loud roar . '' often these phrasal verbs have a one-word equivalent in other languages . in spanish , to get up can be translated as `` levantarse '' , in french as `` se lever '' etc . many students of english as a foreign language panic when they hear the term `` phrasal verbs '' , but in fact phrasal verbs are just vocabulary to memorize , and not some strange , secret grammatical formula . in fact many native speakers of english do not know the term `` phrasal verb '' at all , even though they probably use them very often !
