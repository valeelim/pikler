Sky     the sky is what we call the appearance of a hemisphere over our heads . on a clear day it appears blue . the deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the horizon , and up to the point above us . the sky , which is made up of gas molecules , is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules . rayleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays . since all colors of the rainbow create a white light we should see a white sky , but blue light scatters much more than red . that is why the sky appears blue ( on a cloudless day ) . other websites . - day sky images - night sky images - sky photo gallery - why is the sky blue ?
