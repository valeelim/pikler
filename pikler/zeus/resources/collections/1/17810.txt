Cell wall     a cell wall is the wall of a cell in plants , bacteria , fungi , algae , and some archaea . animal cells do not have cell walls , nor do protozoa . cell walls protect the cells from damage . it is also there to make the cell strong , to keep its shape , and to control the growing of the cell and plant . the cell wall is the tough , usually flexible but sometimes fairly rigid layer that surrounds some types of cells . it is outside the cell membrane and gives these cells support and protection , as well as acting as a filter . the cell wall also acts as a pressure vessel , preventing over-expansion when water enters the cell by osmosis . the material in the cell wall varies . in plants and algae , the cell wall is made of long molecules of cellulose , pectin , and hemicellulose . the cell wall has channels which let some proteins in and keeps others out . water and small molecules can go through the cell wall and the cell membrane . the cell wall has mechanical strength , and supports cell shape . this mechanical strength is its main function :
