Navassa Island     navassa island , or la navase in haitian creole , is a small island without anyone living on it in the caribbean sea . it is located ninety miles south of guantanamo bay , cuba . the united states government claims the two-square-mile island as a territory of the united states , and it is under control of the u.s. fish and wildlife service . the island is also claimed by haiti . some sailors sailing with christopher columbus named navassa in 1504 , because no fresh water could be found there . a captain named peter duncan gave it to the u.s. in the late 1850s , for the purpose of guano mining . after a rebellion in 1889 , and the spanish-american war of 1898 , the mining was put to an end . with the opening of the panama canal in 1914 , navassa became important again , because of a lighthouse being built there . after world war ii , no one lived on it again . in 1996 , navassa 's light was put out of use , and the island was transferred to the u.s. department of the interior . three years later in 1999 , the fish and wildlife service received ownership of the island .
