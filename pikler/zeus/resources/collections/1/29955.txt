Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb     halima sadia ( ) was an arabic beduin woman . she was a wet-nurse and took care of the prophet muhammad for the first two years of his life . she was his foster-mother . halimah and her husband were from the tribe of sa 'd b. bakr ( a large north arabian tribe ) . wet nurses came to mecca to feed children . it was the custom at that time in makkah that families send their children to live for a while with a beduin nurse who lived in the desert . this was healthier for their bodies to be around a natural environment instead of living in the city . they preferred that the fathers of the children they fed were still alive . although muhammad 's father was dead , halimah took him just eight days after he was born . he grew up in hudaybiyah , then in medina before he was returned to his mother , aminah bint wahb . years after muhammad 's mother died and he became married to khadijah , halimah came to him complaining of her poverty . he asked khadijah to give her 40 sheep . after muhammad got his first revelation , halimah and her husband came to muhammad and embraced islam . when she came to muhammad on the day of hunayn , he took off his robe and put it on the ground for her to sit .
