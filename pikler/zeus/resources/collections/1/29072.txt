Achilles     achilles ( or achilleus ; ancient greek : ἀχιλλεύς ) was a hero in greek mythology . in homer 's `` iliad '' , achilles was the son of peleus and the nereid thetis . he was the greatest warrior of the achaean greeks in their struggle against the trojans in the trojan war . his story is at the centre of the iliad , which starts with the dispute between achilles and agamemnon , the greek king . achilles , believing that agamemnon had dishonoured him , did not wish to bow to the king 's leadership . he sat out the battle until the trojans had almost won the war . then he entered the battle . he killed the great hektor , the son of priam , and the trojans ' greatest hero . the tide of battle turned against the trojans , and many were slaughtered . it is believed that achilles was killed at the end of the war , but this is not said in the iliad . the iliad ends with the funeral of hektor . achilles could not be hurt . in some versions of the myths , thetis , his mother , dipped him into the river styx , holding the baby by his left heel . because of that , his heel was still vulnerable . however , the `` iliad '' does not say this .
