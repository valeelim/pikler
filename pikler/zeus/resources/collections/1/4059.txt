Evaporation     evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas without forming bubbles inside the liquid volume . if bubbles are formed we are talking instead about `` boiling '' . for example , water left in a bowl will slowly disappear . the water evaporates into water vapor , the gas phase of water . the water vapor mixes with the air . the reverse of evaporation is condensation . when the molecules in a liquid are heated , they move faster . this makes them full of energy and so the particles collide with each other , and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas . during evaporation only the molecules near the liquid surface are changing from liquid to vapor . during boiling the molecules inside the volume of the liquid are also changing to vapour . for this reason during evaporation no bubbles are formed , instead they are formed during boiling . evaporation can happen at any temperature , while boiling happens only at a specified temperature called the `` boiling point '' . evaporation happens slowly , but boiling happens quickly .
