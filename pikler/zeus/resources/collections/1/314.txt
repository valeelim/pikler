Galaxy     a galaxy is a group of many stars , along with gas , dust , and dark matter . the name 'galaxy ' is taken from the greek word `` galaxia '' meaning milky , a reference to our own galaxy , the milky way . gravity holds galaxies together against the general expansion of the universe . in effect , the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies , not inside those groups . this is because the mass of a galaxy holds the galaxy together , and the same applies to the groups of galaxies , such as our local group . the gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies . everything in a galaxy moves around a centre of mass , which is also an effect of gravity . there are various types of galaxies : elliptical , spiral and lenticular galaxies , which can all be with or without bars . then there are irregular galaxies . all galaxies exist inside the universe . there are probably over 170 billion ( 1.7x10 ) galaxies within the observable universe . there are galaxies of different sizes . typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million ( 10 ) stars up to giants with a hundred trillion ( 10 ) stars , all orbiting the galaxy 's center of mass . galaxies may contain many multiple star systems , star clusters , and various interstellar clouds . the sun is one of the stars in the milky way galaxy ; the solar system includes the earth and all the other objects that orbit the sun .
