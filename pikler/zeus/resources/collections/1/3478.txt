Waxed paper     waxed paper ( or wax paper ) is a type of paper which has been coated on both sides with wax . this gives it a translucent look . it is used for wrapping food because grease , oil , and water can not pass through it . it is also used to line food containers because many kinds of food which would stick to normal paper will not stick to wax paper . many kinds of dry foods were once stored in wax paper because of its resistance to water . wax paper has been replaced by plastic wrap for most purposes .
