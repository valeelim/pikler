Concrete     concrete is an important material for making different buildings and structures . it is a composite made of portland cement , sand , gravel or aggregate , and water in varying proportions depending on the task . concrete is used more than any other man-made material in the world . as of 2006 , about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each yearâ€”more than one cubic meter for every person on earth . the ingredients are mixed together into a paste , a bit like making dough for bread . the concrete is then poured into a frame . after a few hours it sets hard . concrete solidifies due to a chemical reaction known as hydration . the water reacts with the cement , which bonds the other components together , eventually creating a strong stone-like material . concrete is used to make pavements , pipe , architectural structures , foundations , motorways , bridges , multi-story parking , walls , footings for gates , fences and poles and even boats . its biggest advantage is that it bonds together bricks and stones better than any other method known to mankind .
