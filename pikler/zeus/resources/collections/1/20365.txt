Gunpowder Plot     the gunpowder conspiracy of 1605 was a plan to kill king james i of england and vi of scotland . other names for the plot are the powder treason or the gunpowder plot . a group of catholics wanted to blow up the houses of parliament during the state opening of parliament on 5 november 1605. this would have killed the king , and most of the protestant aristocracy . the conspirators also planned to kidnap the royal children , and lead a popular revolt in the midlands . robert catesby led the planning of the conspiracy , which started in may 1604. the people who helped him were either rich catholics , or gentry families who had a lot of influence . catesby may have come up with the plot when he saw that there was little hope that great britain would become more tolerant to roman catholics , under king james i. many catholics were disappointed about the situation . it is more likely though that catesby simply wanted to give the catholics in england a chance : the plot was to be the first step of a rebellion . afterwards , james ' nine-year-old daughter ( princess elizabeth ) could be put in as a catholic head of state .
