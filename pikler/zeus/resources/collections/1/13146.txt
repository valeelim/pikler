Samurai     the samurai ( or bushi ) were japanese warriors . they were members of the important military class before japanese society changed in 1868. the word `` samurai '' comes from the japanese verb `` saburai '' , which means `` to serve ( someone ) '' . the samurai first became important in the warring states period ( 467-1573 ) . at that time , there were many independent areas in japan . those areas fought each other all the time , so japan needed many samurai . many of the famous samurai movies by akira kurosawa were about this time . in the 12th century , two military clans , the minamoto and the taira , were very powerful . they controlled much of japan . they fought wars against each other . in 1192 , minamoto no yoritomo became the first shogun . he became the ruler of all of japan . he started a new government in kamakura . this “ kamakura ” government was from 1185-1333. it made the samurai the ruling class of japanese society . toyotomi hideyoshi won many wars against other clans . when he made japan one country , he developed a social caste system . this caste system was completed by tokugawa ieyasu and the rulers after him . between the wars , many samurai had always worked on farms . hideyoshi said that all samurai must either live on farms or live in castle towns with other warriors . hideyoshi also made a law that only samurai could have swords .
