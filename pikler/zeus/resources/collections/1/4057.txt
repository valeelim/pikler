Water vapor     water vapor is water that is in the form of a vapor , or gas . it is a part of the water cycle . when liquid water is heated to boiling point , 100 degrees celsius ( 212 f ] ] , it all turns into vapor . water vapor can also be produced directly from ice ; this is called deposition . steam is water vapor , but clouds are liquid water . water vapor affects weather conditions . water vapor is found in most of the air . in the cold , breathing out causes the water vapor breathed in to freeze . water vapor weighs less than air , thus slightly reduces the lift produced by an aircraft wing . water vapour is transparent . the small droplets that look white like mist are actually liquid . water vapour is a big cause of the greenhouse effect .
