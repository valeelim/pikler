Light     light is a type of energy . it is a form of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye . it is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and radiation given off by stars like the sun . animals can also see light . the study of light , known as optics , is an important research area in modern physics . light is electromagnetic radiation that is shows properties of both waves and particles light exists in tiny energy packets called photons . each wave has a wavelength or frequency . the human eye sees each wavelength as a different color . rainbows show the entire spectrum of visible light . the separate colors , moving in from the outer edges , are usually listed as red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo and violet . other colors can be seen only with special cameras or instruments : wavelengths below the frequency of red are called infrared , and higher than of violet are called ultraviolet . the other main properties of light are intensity , polarization , phase and orbital angular momentum .
