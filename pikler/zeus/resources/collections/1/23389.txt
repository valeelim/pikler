Wavelength     a wavelength is the length of the shortest repeating part of a `` sine wave '' . all waves can be formed by adding up sine waves . that is , every wave is a total of sine waves , which may be identified by fourier analysis . waves are everywhere . examples of waves include : - sound - electromagnetic spectrum including - light - water waves such as ocean surface waves - earthquake waves the sine wave has a pattern that repeats . the length of this repeating piece of the sine wave is called the wavelength . the wavelength can be found by measuring the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave and the next peak . the wavelength can be found in many other ways too . there are other properties of waves and sine waves , such as their frequency , amplitude , phase , and speed . a symbol used for wavelength most often is the greek letter `` lambda '' ( Î» ) .
