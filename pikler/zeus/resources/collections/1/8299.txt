Steel     steel is a mixture of several metals ( this is called an alloy ) but most of it is iron . steel is harder and stronger than iron . steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02 % and 1.7 % percent carbon by weight . alloys with more carbon than this are known as cast iron . steel is different from wrought iron , that has little or no carbon . there are some newer steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials . steel has a long history . people in india and sri lanka were making small amounts of steel more than 2,500 years ago . it was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives . in the middle ages , steel could be made only in small amounts since the processes took a long time . in the time since , there have been many changes to the way steel is made . in about the year 1610 steel started to be made in england , and the way it was made got better and cheaper over the next 100 years . cheap steel helped start the industrial revolution in england and in europe . the first industrial converter ( metallurgy ) for making cheap steel was the bessemer converter , followed by siemens-martin open-hearth process .
