Natural resource     a natural resource is anything that people can use which comes from the natural environment . people do not make natural resources , but gather them . examples of natural resources are air , water , wood , oil , wind energy , iron , and coal . refined oil and hydro-electric energy are not natural resources because people make them . we often say there are two sorts of natural resources : renewable resources and non-renewable resources . - a renewable resource is one which can be used again and again . for example , soil , sunlight and water are renewable resources . however , in some circumstances , even water is not renewable easily . wood is a renewable resource , but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else . soil , if it blows away , is not easy to renew . - a non-renewable resource is a resource that does not grow and come back , or a resource that would take a very long time to come back . for example , coal is a non-renewable resource . when we use coal , there is less coal afterward . one day , there will be no more of it to make goods . the non-renewable resource can be used directly ( for example , burning oil to cook ) , or we can find a renewable resource to use ( for example , using wind energy to make electricity to cook ) .
