Natural satellite     a natural satellite in astronomy is a smaller body which moves around a larger body . the smaller body is held in orbit by gravitation . the term is used for moons which go around planets , and it is also used for small galaxies which orbit larger galaxies.sma , kys bodies which orbit planets are called moons . they vary in size , and are ball-shaped . the earth has only one moon . some other planets have many moons , and some have none . when people write just `` '' the '' moon '' , they are usually talking about the moon of the earth . earth 's moon is written with a capital letter , `` moon '' . the latin word for the moon is `` luna '' , which is why the adjective used to talk about the moon is `` lunar '' . for example , lunar eclipse . anything that goes around a planet is called a satellite . moons are natural satellites . people also use rockets to send machines into orbit around the earth . these machines are called artificial ( man-made ) satellites . moons do not make their own light . we can see the earth 's moon because it acts like a mirror , and reflects the light of the sun . the same half of the moon faces toward earth at all times , no matter where it moves . but different parts of the moon are lit up by the sun , so it looks different at different times of the month . this change as seen from earth is called the phases of the moon , or lunar phases .
