Tyrannosaurus     tyrannosaurus was a large predatory dinosaur from the upper cretaceous , 67 to 65.5 million years ago . `` tyrannosaurus '' was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long , heavy tail . compared to the large and powerful hind limbs , its forelimbs were small , but powerful for their size . they had two clawed digits . there is discussion as to whether it was a hunter or a scavenger . like most dominant meat-eaters of today , such as lions and hyenas , `` tyrannosaurus '' might have been both . it had a very strong jaw , and its bite power could snap the bones of other dinosaurs . more than 30 specimens of `` tyrannosaurus rex '' have been found . some of them are nearly complete skeletons , and soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of these specimens . research is done on its biology , life history and biomechanics . the feeding habits , physiology and potential speed of `` tyrannosaurus rex '' are some topics . some scientists think `` tarbosaurus bataar '' from asia is a second species of `` tyrannosaurus '' , but others think `` tarbosaurus '' is a separate genus .
