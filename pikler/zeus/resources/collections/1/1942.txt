Africa     africa is the second largest continent in the world . it makes up about a fifth of the world 's land . it is surrounded by large areas of water . there are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in africa , and 14.7 % ( 1.216 billion ) of the world 's population lives there . it is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved . the history of africa begins from the first modern human beings and leads to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent . africa 's ancient historic period includes the rise of egyptian civilization , the further development of societies outside the nile river valley and the interaction between them and civilizations outside of africa . in the late 7th century north and east africa were heavily influenced by the spread of islam . that led to the appearance of new cultures such as those of the swahili people . this also led to an increase in the slave trade that had a very bad influence for the development of the whole continent until the 19th century .
