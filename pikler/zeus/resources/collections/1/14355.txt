Hippopotamus     the hippopotamus ( `` hippopotamus amphibius '' ) , or hippo , ancient greek for `` river horse '' ( `` ιπποπόταμος '' ) , is a large mammal in africa that usually eats plants . it is one of only two species in the family hippopotamidae that are still alive . the other is the pygmy hippopotamus . the hippopotamus is the second largest land animal in size , and the third largest land animal in weight . the elephant is the heaviest , and the white rhinoceros is the second heaviest , but a bit smaller than the hippo . the hippo is also the heaviest artiodactyl . the hippopotamus is semi-aquatic . this means that even though it usually lives on the land , it spends a great amount of time in rivers and lakes where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young . in the daytime , they keep cool by staying in the water or mud . they give birth to baby hippos in the water , too . at dusk , they come out to graze on grass . hippopotamuses rest together in the water , but they like to graze by themselves . the hippopotamus has a torso that is shaped like a barrel , a very big mouth and teeth , an almost hairless body , short legs and great size . it is the third largest land mammal , judging by its weight , which is between between 1½ and 3 tonnes . the white rhinoceros weighs 1½ to 3½ tonnes , and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes . even though it has short , fat legs , it can run more quickly than a human . some hippos have run at 30 km/h ( 19 mph ) for short distances . the hippopotamus is one of the fiercest animals in the world . it is often called one of the most dangerous animals in africa . there are about 125,000 to 150,000 hippos in sub-saharan africa . zambia ( about 40,000.001 ) and tanzania ( 20,000 – 30,000 ) have the most hippos . they are threatened because they are losing their habitats and being poached for their meat and ivory teeth .
