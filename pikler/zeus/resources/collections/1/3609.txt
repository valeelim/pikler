Information     the word `` information '' is used in many different ways . originally , it comes from a word that meant to give a form to something . information is something that people can learn , know about , or understand . for example , a newspaper contains information about the world . this article contains information about `` information '' . people who use computers often use the words `` information '' and `` data '' in the same way . there are special fields of study called `` information science '' and `` information technology '' ( it ) . in the 1970s and 1980s , some people gave a new , specific meaning to `` information '' . at that time , the first computer databases were built . in computer science , `` data '' often means a kind of information that has not been checked . that means `` data '' has not been changed or fixed , and you may not be able to trust it . with the new meaning , `` information '' means data that has been checked and passed tests for what it must be . a person can trust that `` information '' is correct . information can only be correct and good enough to trust if there are very good and complete ways to check the data ( data checking , validation or verification ) and decide it is good enough ( acceptance process ) . a person must know rules were used to check the data or trust the person who checked the data . if a person can not tell that this was done , the information still seems to be data for that person , so that person must check the data again , in that general view about data .
