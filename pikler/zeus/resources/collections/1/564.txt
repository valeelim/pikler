Now     now is the time span between the past and the future . it can be long ( like an eon in geologic time ) or short ( like a picosecond ) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some time horizon when a decision must be made . it can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay . `` i want to know what you think , now . '' `` what do you think now ? '' `` now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country . '' mathematics and measurement assume that everything used in one equation equals the same quantities at the beginning of calculation or axiomatization as at the end . that means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of `` equal '' means `` equal from the time the process starts to the time it ends . '' in general semantics and e prime the words equal , remain ( for the past until now ) and become ( for now into the future ) replace the verb `` to be '' for this reason . algebra is now often called snapshot algebra or algebra of seeing because of this dependence on time . if any action or event were possible between steps in algebraic analysis , then , in theory , one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all . for these reasons the idea of statistics and also knowledge and knowledge management are sometimes questioned , for instance , in the book `` lies , damn lies , and statistics '' . a major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past , and now , after some key conditions change .
