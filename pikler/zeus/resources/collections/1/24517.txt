Advaita Vedanta     advaita vedanta is a type of hinduism . people who believe in advaita believe that their soul is never really different from god . the sanskrit word for soul is `` atman '' and the sanskrit word for god is `` brahman '' . the most famous hindu philosopher who taught about advaita vedanta was adi shankara who lived in india more than a thousand years ago . adi sankara learned the sacred texts of hinduism , like vedas and upanishads under his teacher govinda bhagavadpada and later wrote extensive commentaries of hindu sacred texts called upanishads . in these commentaries , he proposed the theory of advaita , saying that the upanishad actually teach that the individual soul ( called atman ) is not different from god ( called brahman ) . he also taught that there is only one essential principle called brahman ( means god ) and everything else is a kind of expression of that one brahman . because of this theory of one being , his teachings became popular as the `` advaita '' ( `` a '' = not , `` dvaita '' = two , means no-two or non-dual ) . the way he said this to people was `` atman is brahman .
