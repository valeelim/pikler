Apostrophe     the apostrophe ( ’ ) is a punctuation mark used in writing . it is a diacritic ( a mark used with letters ) . in english , it has two jobs : - to show where one or more letters have been left out ( as in the abbreviation ( contraction ) of `` do not '' to `` do n't '' ) . - to show the possessive case ( as in `` the cat ’ s whiskers '' ) . the most common grammatical mistake in written english is to put `` it 's '' where `` its '' is correct . its : a possessive adjective and pronoun of the personal pronoun `` it '' . - `` the cat chased its tail '' . correct . - `` the tyre lost it 's grip '' . wrong . `` it 's '' : a contraction of the verbal phrase `` it is '' or `` it has '' . - `` it 's mine '' . correct ; check : `` it is mine '' . - `` it 's been here '' . correct ; check : `` it has been here '' . - `` the cat chased it 's tail '' . wrong ; can not be expanded to `` it is '' . the same applies to `` yours '' , `` theirs '' and `` ours '' because these are also possessive adjectives of personal pronouns . - `` the colour is ours '' . - `` that book is hers '' ( or `` his '' ) . - `` theirs was the responsibility '' .
