Television     a television is a machine with a screen . televisions receive broadcast signals and turn them into pictures and sound . the word `` television '' comes from the words `` tele '' ( greek for `` far away '' ) and `` vision '' ( `` sight '' ) . sometimes a television can look like a box . older tvs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture . newer tvs are much lighter and flatter . a tv can show pictures from many television networks . computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs . at first , all televisions used an antenna ( or aerial ) . this would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations . a tv station could be many miles or kilometers away , and still be received . tvs can also show movies from vcd and dvd players or vcrs . cable tv and satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can . video game consoles connect to most modern tvs . some computers can also use a tv as a computer monitor . all tvs have screens where the picture is viewed . before the 1950s these were usually `` black and white '' , which made everything look grey , but all modern tvs show colors . most 20th century screens also had rounded corners . that is because television screens were cathode ray tubes . these are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen .
