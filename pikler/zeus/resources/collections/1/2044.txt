General semantics     general semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning . it was created by alfred korzybski during the 1920s and early 1930s . the goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something , either mentally or in language , that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified . how people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality . general semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen , heard , felt , or believed .
