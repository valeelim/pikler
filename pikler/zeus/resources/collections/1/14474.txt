Breathing     breathing is moving air in and out of the lungs . the air going in and out is called `` breath '' . if a person can not breathe , they will die . breathing helps people do two very important things : 1. get oxygen into the body . every part of the body needs oxygen to survive . the only way humans can get oxygen is to breathe it in . 1. get carbon dioxide ( co ) out of the body . when the body makes energy , carbon dioxide gets left over . the body needs to get rid of extra carbon dioxide , because too much of it is poisonous . the only way humans can get rid of carbon dioxide is to breathe it out . when a person breathes in , they bring air into their lungs . air has oxygen in it . the oxygen goes from the lungs into the person 's bloodstream . when oxygen goes into the bloodstream , extra carbon dioxide comes out and goes into the lungs . this is called gas exchange : basically , oxygen and carbon dioxide are changing places . oxygen is now in the bloodstream , which can carry that oxygen around to every part of the body . also , carbon dioxide is now in the lungs , where it can be breathed out .
