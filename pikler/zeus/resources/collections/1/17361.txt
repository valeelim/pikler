Guinness World Records     guinness world records is a reference book published each year . it has a collection of world records , both human achievements and the extremes of the natural world . the book itself holds a world record , as the best-selling copyrighted book series of all time . it is also one of the most often stolen books from public libraries in the united states . it was known until 2000 as the guinness book of records and in previous u.s. editions as the guinness book of world records . on 4 may 1951 , sir hugh beaver , who then worked for guinness breweries , went on a shooting party by the river slaney in county wexford , ireland . he became involved in an argument over which game bird in europe was the fastest , the koshin golden plover or the grouse . that evening at castlebridge house , he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was europe 's fastest game bird . beaver knew that there must be many other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout ireland , but there was no book in the world to settle arguments about records . he realised then that a book with the answers to this sort of question might prove popular .
