Claque     a claque ( pronounce : ‘ clack ’ ) is a small group of people in an opera house who deliberately either clapped loudly ( applauded ) or shouted boo for a particular singer . usually it means an `` organised '' group who know in advance what they are going to do . in the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an opera . someone who liked one of the singers and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song . this would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too . sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite : they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung . very often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him ( or her ) . if the singer did not pay , the claque would hiss and boo . this was , of course , a nasty form of blackmail . in the early 20th century , when the world-famous tenor enrico caruso refused to pay the claque in naples a bribe , they hissed during his singing of the great aria `` una furtiva lagrima '' .
