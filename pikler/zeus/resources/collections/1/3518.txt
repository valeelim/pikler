Photosynthesis     photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other things make food . it is a chemical process that uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into sugars the cell can use as energy . as well as plants , many kinds of algae , protists and bacteria use it to get food . photosynthesis is very important for life on earth . most plants either directly or indirectly depend on it . the exception are certain organisms that directly get their energy from chemical reactions ; these organisms are called chemoautotrophs . photosynthesis can happen in different ways , but there are some parts that are common . photosynthesis has two main sets of reactions . light-dependent reactions need light to work ; and light-independent reactions , which do not need light to work . light energy from the sun is used to split water molecules ( photolysis ) . the sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant , causing an enzyme to break apart the water . water , when broken , makes oxygen , hydrogen , and electrons . hydrogen , along with electrons energized by light , converts nadp into nadph which is then used in the light-independent reactions . oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis , and atp is synthesized from adp and inorganic phosphate . this all happens in the grana of chloroplasts .
