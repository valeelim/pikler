Binoculars     binoculars are a kind of tool that lets people see far-away things more clearly , using a technology called optics . they are made of a pair of matched telescopes that are held in front of the user 's eyes . the two telescopes have lenses that focus light and magnify the image , a process called magnification . this way , when someone looks through the binoculars at a far-away object , it looks much closer . they have prisms inside , which bend the light so to shorten the length of the tubes . that is why a binocular is shorter than standard telescopes of similar power . binoculars were invented in the 17th century . they allow a telescope user to use both eyes . the royal navy used single telescopes , but now all ships have heavy binoculars . heavy ones can be mounted on swivels to scan the horizon . binoculars are also standard issue in all armies . night vision binoculars use photocathode electronics to intensify the image . binoculars are also used for theatre ( opera glasses ) , birdwatching and amateur astronomy .
