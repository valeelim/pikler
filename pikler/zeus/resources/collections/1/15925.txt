Lucifer     lucifer is another name for `` satan '' . this is because people interpret a passage in the book of isaiah of the bible in a certain way . lucifer is latin . it is made of two parts , `` lux-lucis '' ( light ) and `` ferre '' ( to bring ) . there are two mentions of `` lucifer '' in the latin vulgate . it is used to refer to the morning star , the planet venus that appears at dawn : once in to translate the greek word `` φωσφόρος '' ( phosphoros ) , which has exactly the same literal meaning of `` light-bringer '' that `` lucifer '' has in latin ; and once in to translate `` הילל '' ( hêlēl ) , which also means `` morning star '' . `` lucifer '' is the latin name for the `` morning star '' , both in prose and poetry , as seen in works by marcus terentius varro ( 116–27 bc ) , cicero ( 106-43 bc ) and other early latin writers cicero wrote : and pliny the elder : poets also used the word `` lucifer '' . ovid has at least eleven mentions of the morning star in his poetry . virgil wrote : and statius : lucifer is very evil in the christian religion . he is also the symbol for not obeying . lucifer is believed by some to be satan 's name when he was still an angel , but it is latin for 'light bringer ' and not originally in the bible .
