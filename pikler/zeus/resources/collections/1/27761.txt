Collision     a collision occurs when two objects come in contact with each other . all collisions have the same momentum before and after a collision . examples of collisions include car crashes , bouncing a ball , and playing pool . collisions are made from two smaller sections called elastic and inelastic collisions . in the case of playing pool or bouncing a ball , an elastic collision occurs . an elastic collision generally occurs when an elastic or hard object experiences a collision that bounces off another elastic or hard object , where the kinetic energy and momentum are the same before and after the collision . in an experiment , a small amount of energy will still be lost because of the friction between the surface and the objects . in the case of a car crash , an inelastic collision occurs . an inelastic collision generally occurs when a soft object experiences a collision that does not result in a bounce . kinetic energy is lost during this type of collision because the energy is transformed into other forces . the momentum is the same before and after the collision .
