Bat     bats are mammals in the order chiroptera . they are the only mammals that can fly . other mammals like flying squirrels , or flying possum , can glide but not fly . bats are nocturnal – they are active during the night , dusk , or dawn . most use echolocation to catch prey and to find their way about . as nighttime animals , bats avoid direct competition with birds , few of which are nocturnal . bats are a successful group . they are the second largest order of mammals : there are more than 1,100 species of bats . this means that 20 % of all living mammal species – one in five – are bats . about seventy percent of bats are insectivores , which is the basal form of life for this group . the common pipistrelle is a successful example . most of the rest are fruit-eaters ( fruit bats ) . a few species suck blood , and a few large ones are carnivorous . bats live almost everywhere , except the arctic , antarctic and a few oceanic islands . they usually roost in caves , old buildings , or trees . traditionally , bats are divided into two groups . microbats mostly use echo-location and catch insects , but just a few eat fish or drink blood . megabats do not echolocate , but instead eat fruit or nectar .
