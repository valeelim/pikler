Cold fusion     cold fusion is nuclear fusion at room temperature and normal pressure . nuclear fusion is the process by which many nuclei , the center of an atom , containing protons and neutrons , are forced to join together to form a heavier nucleus ( singular of nuclei ) and during that process , energy is released . some scientists hope that this may be earth 's future energy source , but most scientists do not agree . for nuclear fusion to take place , a large amount of energy is needed . with this energy , the atoms are pushed together , which are repelled by the electrostatic force ( a force between protons which are particles in the nucleus of the atom and have a positive electrical charge ) . but once this force is overcome and the nuclei are pushed close enough together , another much more powerful force will take over : the strong nuclear force . it only operates at short distances , so when the nuclei are close enough , they attract each other because of the strong nuclear force which is stronger than the electrostatic force . it is hoped that the energy released by cold fusion is much greater than the energy used to push the atoms together .
