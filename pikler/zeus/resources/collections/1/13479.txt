Testicle     testicles are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures . male mammals , including men , have two testicles , supported in a sac of skin below the penis called the scrotum . along with the penis , testicles are called reproductory organs or `` sex organs '' . only males have testicles ; females have ovaries . testicles are a type of organ called glands . like other glands , testicles make `` chemical substances '' , called hormones that keep the body working . testicles also make sperm , which can join with ova to make new life . most glands , like women 's ovaries , are inside the body , but testicles are outside the main part of the body . this is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body . in cold weather , testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm . the testicles are firm , oval-shaped glands . most testicles match in size , but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others . normal sized testicles are between 14 cm³ to 35 cm³ . most men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one . scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other . it is usually , but not always , the left testicle that hangs lower .
