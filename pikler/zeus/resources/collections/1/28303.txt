Strong interaction     the strong interaction ( or strong nuclear force ) is one of the four fundamental forces in particle physics , which are forces which ca n't be made even simpler . despite being the most powerful fundamental force , being 10 ( 1 followed by 38 zeros ) times as strong as gravity , it only works over lengths of a few femtometres ( fm ) , which is about 10 ( 0.000000000000001 ) metres long . scientists often divide it into two parts : the colour force and nuclear force . at distances of 0.8 fm and less , the colour force is responsible for holding subatomic particles , like protons and neutrons together . at distances of 1 to 3 fm , the nuclear force binds subatomic particles into atom nuclei . the strong interaction is often thought to be controlled by gluons , which 'glue ' quarks together through the strong force . gluons can be exchanged ( moved ) between quarks , antiquarks and other gluons . all of those particles are said to carry a 'colour charge ' , a property of elementary particles which is like electric charge . particles with colour charge exchange gluons , like how particles with electric charge exchange electrons .
