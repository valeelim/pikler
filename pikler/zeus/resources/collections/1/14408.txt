Bass guitar     a bass guitar ( also called an `` electric bass '' or `` bass '' ) is a string instrument which is related to the electric guitar . the bass guitar is shaped like an electric guitar , except that it is longer than an electric guitar . the electric bass has many of the same parts as an electric guitar . however , the bass guitar produces lower tones than the electric guitar . the bass guitar is used to play low musical sounds called `` bass lines '' in many styles of music such as rock , pop , country , jazz fusion and many more . the bass guitar was first made in the 1930s by inventor paul tutmarc from seattle , washington . however , very few musicians were interested in the instrument that tutmarc made . the need for a new instrument developed in the 1950s . at that time , the double bass was the main bass instrument in jazz , blues , folk , early rock music and bluegrass . the problem was that the double bass was big , heavy , hard to carry around , hard to play precise notes on , and it was hard to make it louder with a bass amplifier . musicians wanted a smaller instrument that weighed less and was easier to play and amplify . inventors tried to think of ways of building a smaller and lighter bass instrument . one of these inventors was a man named leo fender in the united states . leo fender developed a bass guitar in the 1950s using the ideas developed by tutmarc .
