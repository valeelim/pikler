Adware     adware is an advertising computer program that can be put there by other people on someone 's computer , sometimes without their permission . it is controversial because sometimes businesses put the program there so they can see what people are doing or what web pages they are browsing . they then put an advertisement that is of the same subject as the web-page the person is looking at . this can be good if the person is trying to buy something , but many people do not want advertisements . many people also do not want other people to find out what they are doing or what web pages they are looking at . an example is in the popular peer-to-peer file sharing program , kazaa . when someone downloads it , it installs adware on their computer that then sends advertisements to the computer . some people do not like this so they use an illegally changed version of this program called kazaa lite . removal tools have been developed to assist users in clearing out these unwanted programs . like many programs that people use for security , the program must be changed often . updating allows the removal tool to recognize new types of adware . this can be done by downloading files over the internet using the 'update ' option in the program .
