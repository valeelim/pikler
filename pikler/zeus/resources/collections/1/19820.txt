Profit     profit is how much money somebody ( normally a company ) makes . this is found by subtracting how much money they have spent ( `` expenditure '' ) from how much money they have brought in ( revenue ) . if john spends $ 15 on some ice cream cones , and then sells them for $ 20 , he has made a profit of $ 5 . this is because 20 minus 15 is 5 .
