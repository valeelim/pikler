Angle     an angle is the space between two lines that meet each other . when two lines meet at a point , an angle is formed . the two lines are called the `` arms '' of the angle . to measure the size of an angle , we use degree . degree is a standard unit . degree is denoted by the symbol '° ' . a degree can be divided into 60 minutes ( 1° = 60 ' ) , and a minute can be also be divided into 60 seconds ( 1 ' = 60 '' ) . in mathematics , angles are usually measured in radians . an acute angle is an angle less than 90° . a right angle is an angle equal to 90° . an obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90° but less than 180° . a straight angle ( or straight line ) is an angle equal to 180° . a reflex angle is an angle greater than 180° but less than 360° . supplementary angles are two angles with the sum equal to 180° . two angles that sum to one right angle ( 90° ) are called complementary angles . two angles that sum to one full circle ( 360° ) are called explementary angles or conjugate angles . people usually use a protractor to measure and draw angles . sometimes , people use an angle ruler or a 360° protractor to measure angles .
