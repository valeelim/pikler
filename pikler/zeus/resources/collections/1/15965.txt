Ballerina     a ballerina is a name given to a female ballet dancer . only very good female ballet dancers are called ballerinas . a ballerina is a principal dancer in a classical ballet company . the topmost female dancer in a company was usually called the prima ballerina . today the term 'ballerina ' has gone rather out of fashion . now they are simply called 'principal dancers ' . dancers in a company are ranked by the company , and paid accordingly . they have to prove themselves in lesser parts before they can get promoted . example of the ranks in a modern dance company : 1. corps de ballet ( these do not dance named individual parts ) 1. coryph√©es ( minor soloists ) 1. principal character artists ( dance roles with significant acting ) 1. second soloists ( dancers who take named solo roles ) 1. first soloists ( one rank up from the previous ) 1. principal dancers ( if female , same as 'ballerinas ' ; they dance leading roles ) 1. principal guest artist ( a well-known and sometimes famous dancer , usually from abroad )
