El Niño–Southern Oscillation     el niño-southern oscillation ( enso in short ) is a term for a natural event that takes place in the pacific ocean . it is also called el niño and la niña . in spanish they mean `` little boy '' and `` little girl '' . el niño is also used in spanish for the infant jesus . el niño happens when the sea water temperature rises in surface waters of the tropical pacific ocean . every two to five years the pacific ocean has this event . a weak , warm current starts around christmas along the coast of ecuador and peru . it lasts for only a few weeks to a month or more . every three to seven years , an el niño event may last for many months . this can change the weather and have important effects around the world . australia and southeast asia can have drought but the deserts of peru have very heavy rainfall . east africa can have both . in a la nina event the weather patterns are reversed . the southern oscillation was discovered by sir gilbert walker in 1923. it is a `` seesaw '' of atmospheric pressure between the pacific and indian oceans . there is an inverse relationship between the air pressure measured at two sites : darwin , australia , in the indian ocean and the island of tahiti in the south pacific . the southern oscillation index ( soi ) is the difference in sea-level pressure measured at tahiti and darwin . the cold tongue ( ct ) index measures how much the average sea-surface temperature in the central and eastern pacific near the equator varies from the annual cycle . the two measurements are anti-correlated , so that a negative soi is usually together with an unsual warm ocean wind known as el nino .
