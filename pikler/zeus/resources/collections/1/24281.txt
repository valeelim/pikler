Rabat     rabat ( , transliterated ar-rabāṭ or ar-ribāṭ , literally `` fortified place '' ) , population 577 827 hab . ( `` 2014 estimate '' ) , is the capital of the kingdom of morocco . it is also the capital of the rabat-salé-kénitra region . the city is on the atlantic ocean at the mouth of the river bou regreg . on the other side of the river is rabat 's bedroom community . together the two cities with temara have a population of 1.8 million . silting problems have lowered the city 's role as a port . however , rabat and salé still maintain somewhat important textile , food processing and construction industries . some are from sweatshop labor by major businesses . in addition , tourism and being home to all foreign embassies in morocco help to make rabat the second most important city in the country after the larger and economically more significant casablanca . rabat 's history began with a settlement , known as chellah on the banks of the oued bou regreg in the third century bc . in 40 ad , romans took over chellah and changed it to the roman settlement of sala colonia . rome held the colony until 250 ad . they gave it up to local rulers . in 1146 , the berber almohad ruler abd al-mu'min turned rabat 's ribat into a full scale fortress . it was used as a starting point for attacks on spain . in 1170 , due to its military importance , rabat acquired the title `` ribatu l-fath '' , meaning `` stronghold of victory , '' from which it gets its current name .
