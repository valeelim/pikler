Town     a town is usually a place with a lot of houses , but not a city . as with cities , there is more than one way to say what a town is in different countries . in some places , it is a kind of local government . in english , people also use the word `` town '' as a general word for places with a lot of houses ( cities too ) . when they say `` town '' they are normally thinking of a big , important place . for example , london is a city , but people often call it `` london town '' ( `` the city of london '' is a part of london where there are a lot of banks ) . also , going from the outside to central london is to `` go into town '' . generally , the difference between towns and villages or hamlets is the sort of economy they have . people in towns usually get money from industry ( factories etc . ) , commerce ( shops etc . ) and public service ( working for the town ) , not agriculture ( growing food ) . the number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village . in many areas of the world , like india , a big village can have many more people than a small town . it is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today , some towns are becoming bigger .
