Learning     learning is getting new stuff into your brain . there are a number of different types of learning : 1. classical conditioning : where two stimuli come together , the organism learns they are related . 1. operant conditioning : an organism changes its behaviour when behaviour has consequences . 1. play : an inherited mechanism whereby mammals speed up learning in the young . 1. gestalt learning : learning by insight 1. imitation , emulation or observational learning : mimicking the behaviour of others 1. implicit learning or unconscious learning : learning which is done without conscious awareness of the learning process . 1. imprinting : a very rapid type of early learning . learning may occur as a result of habituation or classical conditioning , seen in many animal species , or as a result of more complex activities such as play , seen only in relatively intelligent animals . learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness . there is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally , in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation , indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development . according to james zull , professor of biology and biochemistry at case western university , `` learn­ing is phys­i­cal . learn­ing means the mod­i­fi­ca­tion , growth , and prun­ing of our neu­rons , connectionscalled synapsesand neu­ronal net­works , through expe­ri­ence '' .
