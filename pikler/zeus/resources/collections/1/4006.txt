Electron     an electron is a very small piece of matter and energy . its symbol is e. the electron is a subatomic particle . it is believed to be an elementary particle because it can not be broken down into anything smaller . it is negatively charged , and may move almost at the speed of light . electrons take part in gravitational , electromagnetic and weak interactions . the electricity that powers radios , motors , and many other things is many electrons moving through wires or other conductors . electrons have the smallest electrical charge . this electrical charge equals the charge of a proton , but has the opposite sign . for this reason , electrons are attracted by the protons of atomic nuclei and usually form atoms . an electron has a mass of about 1/1836 times a proton . one way to think about the location of electrons in an atom is to imagine that they orbit at fixed distances from the nucleus . this way , electrons in an atom exist in a number of electron shells surrounding the central nucleus . each electron shell is given a number 1 , 2 , 3 , and so on , starting from the one closest to the nucleus ( the innermost shell ) . each shell can hold up to a certain maximum number of electrons . the distribution of electrons in the various shells is called electronic arrangement ( or electronic form or shape ) . electronic arrangement can be shown by numbering or an electron diagram . ( a different way to think about the location of electrons is to use quantum mechanics to calculate their atomic orbitals . )
