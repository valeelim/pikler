International System of Units     the international system of units is the standard modern form of the metric system . the name of this system can be shortened or abbreviated to si , from the french name `` système international d'unités '' . the international system of units is a system of measurement based on 7 base units : the metre ( length ) , kilogram ( mass ) , second ( time ) , ampere ( electric current ) , kelvin ( temperature ) , mole ( quantity ) , and candela ( brightness ) . these base units can be used in combination with each other . this creates `` si derived units '' , which can be used to describe other quantities , such as volume , energy , pressure , and velocity . the system is used almost globally . only myanmar , liberia , and the united states do not use si as their official system of measurement . in these countries , though , si is commonly used in science and medicine . the metric system was created in france after the french revolution in 1789. the original system only had two standard units , the kilogram and the metre . the metric system became popular amongst scientists .
