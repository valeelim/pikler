Electromagnet     electromagnets are temporary and artificial magnets.they are magnets that are only magnetic when there is a coil of wire with electricity running through it . the coil of wire is called a solenoid . the strength of the magnet is proportional to the current flowing in the circuit . the electricity running through the wire is called a current . the current is the flow of electrons , which are negatively charged particles . electromagnets are used for a variety of purposes . in a simple example , an electromagnet can pick up pieces of iron , nickel , and cobalt . electromagnets can be made stronger by adding more coils to the copper wire , or adding an iron core through the coils ( for example a nail ) . the current can also be increased to make the magnetism stronger . british electrician william sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1825. an electromagnet is very beneficial because it can be turned on and off easily ( using an electric current ) , whereas a permanent magnet can not be turned off and will continue to affect its immediate environment . iron stops being an electromagnet very quickly , but steel takes time to wear off . to make an electromagnet , copper wire is wound around a steel rod . the two ends of the wire are connected to the + ( positive ) and - ( negative ) side of the battery .
