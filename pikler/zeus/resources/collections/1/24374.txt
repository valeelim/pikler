North Star Computers     north star computers was one of the earliest manufacturers of microcomputers . before they started making their first computer , the `` north star horizon '' , they made floppy disk drives for s-100 bus computers . they included a disk operating system called `` north star dos '' ( or `` n*dos '' ) . the horizon used the north star disk controller and operating system . it was one of the first microcomputers that had multi-user features . their second computer , called the `` north star advantage '' , ran cp/m , and had the keyboard and monitor built-in . the graphics were very powerful for their time . when the ibm pc came out , north star made an ms-dos compatible processor card that could be added to the `` advantage '' . their third computer , the `` north star dimension '' , was multi-user like the `` horizon '' , but ms-dos based . because their products in the early 1980s were only ms-dos compatible , not fully pc compatible , they never sold very many , and the company went out of business .
