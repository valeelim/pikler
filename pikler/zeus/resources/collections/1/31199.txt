Superpower     a superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world . it is more powerful than a major power . and right now , only the united states is a superpower . in the years following world war ii , the united nations was formed . the 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs – those who would be able to start a nuclear war – were all given `` permanent '' seats on the security council . this means they are on the security council forever . they were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the security council . these five countries were : united states , united kingdom , china , france , and the soviet union . for most of the 1900s , the soviet union was a superpower . after the soviet union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991 , it was not a superpower anymore . russia got most of the soviet union 's nuclear weapons , and also its permanent seat in the security council . some other countries also have nuclear weapons now , and can also start a nuclear war just as well , but they are not permanent members with veto power . the republic of india , north korea and pakistan are a few countries like this .
