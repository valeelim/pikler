Panama Canal     the panama canal is a waterway ( a canal ) in the country of panama in central america , that connects the atlantic ocean and the pacific ocean . because of the way panama twists , the entrance to the pacific ocean is farther east than the entrance to the atlantic ocean . this is the opposite of what one would expect . the panama canal is 77 km ( 48 miles ) long and cuts across the isthmus of panama . at each end it uses three pairs of `` locks '' for lifting and lowering ships on different water levels . this saves ships 15,000 km ( 10,000 miles ) compared to going around south america . each year , about 14,000 ships come through the canal . by 2002 , around 800,000 ships came through . the biggest ships that can go through the panama canal are called panamax . new locks opened in 2016 to allow ships more than twice as big , called new panamax . the french people tried building it in 1880 , but could n't finish it . the project was started again in 1904 by the united states , under the presidency of theodore roosevelt , who spent ten years and 375 million dollars building it . the panama canal was finally finished in 1914 , but at the cost of approximately 25,000 lives .
