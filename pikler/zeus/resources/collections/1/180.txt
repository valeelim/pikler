Cube     a cube is a block with all right angles and whose height , width and depth are all the same . a cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space . something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as `` cubic '' . the basic difference between a cube and a square is , a cube is a 3d figure ( having 3 dimensions ) i.e . length , breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e . length and breadth . the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) shape ( like a circle , square , triangle , etc . ) that a cube is made of is squares . the sides ( faces ) of a cube are squares . the edges are straight lines . the corners ( vertices ) are at right angles . a cube has 8 corners , 12 edges and 6 faces , as in the most usual kind of dice . a tesseract carries this idea into the fourth dimension ( 4d ) and is made of 8 cubes . volume . - the volume of a cube is the length of any one of the edges ( they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used ) `` cubed '' . - this means you multiply the number by itself , and then by itself again .
