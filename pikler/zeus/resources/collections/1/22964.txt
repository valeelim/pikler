Division by zero     in mathematics , a number can not be divided by zero . observe : 1. formula_1 if `` b '' = 0 , then `` c '' = 0. this is true . but look : 2. formula_2 which is the same as : 3. formula_3 the problem is that a could be any number . it would work if a were 1 or if it were 1,000,000,000 . 0/0 is said to be of `` indeterminate form '' for this reason , because it has no single value . numbers of the form a/0 , on the other hand , where a is not 0 , are said to be `` undefined . '' this is because any attempt to define them will result in a value of infinity , which is itself undefined . usually when two numbers are equal to the same thing , they are equal to each other . that is not true when the thing they are both equal to is 0/0 . this means that the normal rules of maths do not work when the number is divided by zero . it is possible to disguise a special case of division by zero in an algebraic argument . this can lead to invalid proofs , such as 1=2 , as in the following : with the following assumptions : the following must be true :
