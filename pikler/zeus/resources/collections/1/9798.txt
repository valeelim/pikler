Leopard     a leopard ( `` panthera pardus '' ) is a big feline of the genus `` panthera '' . it lives in africa and asia . unlike lions , they do not live in groups . the adult males live separately , and the females live only with their cubs . they only come together to mate . they live in habitats where there are some trees . they climb trees well , and do so regularly . they can carry prey up a tree and keep it safe from hyaenas and lions . trees are its main escape from attacks by lions or packs of dogs . it is an ambush predator , and operates best where it has some cover . the most similar cat in its lifestyle is the jaguar , which lives in central and south america . leopards generally have yellow fur with dark rosettes and spots , and a lighter colored underside . but there can be a lot of differences in the different leopard subspecies . there are also often leopards who are completely black , those are also called black panthers . male leopards are about 30 % larger than female leopards . originally the leopard lived in all of africa ( but not in the sahara ) and southern asia . but today many leopard subspecies , especially in asia , are endangered . leopards live in a lot of different environments : rainforests , forests , mountains and savannas .
