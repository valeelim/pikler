Hash function     the hash function is a function . when a computer program is written , very often , large amounts of data need to be stored . these are normally stored in tables . in order to find the data again , some value is calculated . this is like when someone reads a book , and to remember , they put what they read into their own words . hash values are much the same , except that care is taken that different sets of data do not get the same hash value ( this is called a `` hash collision '' ) . a cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input ( or 'message ' ) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string . the string is called the 'hash value ' , 'message digest ' , 'digital fingerprint ' , 'digest ' or 'checksum ' . hash table
