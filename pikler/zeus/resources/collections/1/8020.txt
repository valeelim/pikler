Boycott     a boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product or give money to a company . instead of buying a certain product , they might also buy another , very similar product from a different company . the word was made during the `` irish land war '' ' . it comes from the name of captain charles boycott . boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in county mayo , ireland . in 1880 , the tenants ( those who rented ) wanted their rent lowered . boycott refused , and threw them out of the land they had rented . the irish land league then proposed that instead of becoming violent , everyone in the community should stop doing business with captain boycott . the captain was soon isolated . no one helped him with the harvest , no one worked in his stables or his house . local businessmen no longer traded with him , the postman no longer delivered his post . to get his harvest done , he had to hire 50 people from other counties , the counties cavan and monaghan . they were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen . of course , this cost far more than what the harvest was worth .
