Black hole     a black hole is a region of space from which nothing , including light , can escape . according to the general theory of relativity , it is the result of the curving of spacetime caused by a very dense mass . around a black hole there is a position of no return , called the event horizon . it is called `` black '' because it absorbs all the light that hits it , reflecting nothing , just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics . under the theory of quantum mechanics black holes have a temperature and emit hawking radiation , which makes them slowly get smaller . a black hole is found by its interaction with matter . the presence of a black hole can be inferred by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit a region in space . alternatively , when gas falls into a black hole caused by a companion star or nebula , the gas spirals inward , heating to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of radiation . this radiation can be detected from earthbound and earth-orbiting telescopes .
