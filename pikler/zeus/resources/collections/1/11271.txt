Paul the Apostle     paul the apostle , previously known as saul of tarsus and now often called st paul ( ad 9â€“67 ) , was a messianic jewish-roman , turkish writer and rabbi . it is believed that he wrote thirteen books of the bible , together called the pauline epistles , which are letters to churches and christians , encouraging them , helping them to understand christian teaching and helping them to live christian lives . paul 's name was originally saul ( not to be confused with king saul from the books of samuel in the old testament ) . he grew up learning both the jewish law and the greek ways of discussing things . we are first introduced to saul in the bible near the end of acts 7. the christian movement had begun with the resurrection and ascension of jesus . saul was strongly against this , and he was happy as he watched saint stephen , the first martyr of jesus , being killed by stoning after giving a speech that made the jewish court angry . then he worked for the roman government and helped lead the arrests and killing of many christians in israel and the nearby area .
