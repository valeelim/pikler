Concertmaster     the concertmaster ( american english ) or leader ( british english ) is the most important violinist in an orchestra . he or she will sit in the front seat , by the conductor 's left . the word `` concertmaster '' comes from the german `` konzertmeister '' . the leader will be the highest paid member of the orchestra . he has to decide how the violins will play the music and write in the bowing . he will decide where each member of the violins should sit . he will probably also interview them and offer them the job in the orchestra . he will talk to the conductor about anything the orchestra are not happy about ( he may have to remind the conductor when it is time to stop the rehearsal ! ) . if part of the music is marked `` solo '' then he will play it as a solo while the other violins stop playing . in the united states it is usual for the concertmaster to be on the platform before the concert and to tell the orchestra to tune their instruments , playing on his a string to give them the correct pitch . in european orchestras it is usually the oboe that gives an a for tuning . in britain the leader usually comes on stage after the orchestra have tuned , and gets an applause .
