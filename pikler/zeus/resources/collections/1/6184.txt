Mount Arafat     mount arafat or mount arafah ( transliterated `` jabal ‘ arafāt '' ) is a granite hill east of mecca in the plain of arafat . arafat is a plain about southeast of mecca . mount arafat reaches about in height and is also known as the mount of mercy ( `` jabal ar-rahmah '' ) . according to islamic tradition , the hill is the place where the islamic prophet muhammad stood and delivered the farewell sermon to the muslims who had accompanied him for the hajj towards the end of his life . on the 9th of the month of dhu al-hijjah pilgrims go to arafat from mina , for the most important part of the hajj . the khutbah of hajj is narrated and zuhr prayer and asr prayer are prayed together . the pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain to supplicate to allah to forgive their sins and to pray for personal strength in the future . arafah rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to muzdalifah for a shortened maghrib prayer and isha prayer and for a short rest . the level area surrounding the hill is called the plain of arafat . the term mount arafah is sometimes applied to this entire area . it is an important place in islam because during the hajj , pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of dhul hijjah ( ذو الحجة ) . failure to be present in the plain of arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage .
