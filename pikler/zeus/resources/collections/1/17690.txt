Maxwell's equations    maxwell 's equations in the 1860s james clerk maxwell published equations that describe how charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic force per unit charge . the force per unit charge is called a field . the particles could be stationary or moving . these , together with the lorentz force equation , provide everything you need to calculate the motion of particles in electric and magnetic fields . maxwell 's equations describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric and magnetic fields . further , they describe how an electric field can generate a magnetic field , and vice versa . the first equation allows you to calculate the electric field created by a charge . the second allows you to calculate the magnetic field . the other two describe how fields 'circulate ' around their sources . magnetic fields 'circulate ' around electric currents and time varying electric fields , amp√®re 's law with maxwell 's correction , while electric fields 'circulate ' around time varying magnetic fields , faraday 's law .
