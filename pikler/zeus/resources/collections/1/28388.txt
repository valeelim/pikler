Econometrics     econometrics is a branch of economics . it is the use of statistical and mathematical methods to describe the relation between economic forces such as capital ( any of the tools , work , or other things needed to make something useful ) , interest rates ( the price of borrowing money ) , and labor . much of econometrics is making models which are simple pictures of the real world . these models then can be used to predict what will happen in the real world . an example of econometrics would be looking at the prices of houses in a town . an economist ( someone who studies economics ) can try to make a simple picture of the house prices in the town . this picture might show that houses close to the market are worth more . an economist could then say that if a new market is made in another part of the town , home prices there might go up . the economist also might say that the new market could make prices less than before near the old one , because the new market will make it so that more houses are near a market . this would make the people who sell houses near a market sell them for less , since there could be more sellers than buyers .
