Whale     whales are large marine mammals which live in the ocean . like other mammals , they breathe oxygen from the air , have a small amount of hair , and are warm blooded . there are two basic kinds of whales , and about 100 species . people use the word `` whale '' in different ways . some use it for all cetaceans including dolphins and porpoises . these people say that dolphins and porpoises were also whales , because they are also cetaceans . others separate out the dolphins and porpoises : common english-speaking people have never called them or thought of them as whales unless they are very large . actually , there is no clear line between whales and dolphins . whales have been killed for meat and oil by whalers . however , many countries have laws saying not to kill whales anymore . some countries , such as iceland and japan , do not have these laws . in other countries , such as the usa , only eskimos and some american indians may legally kill whales . baleen whales eat plankton : clouds of very small things floating in the water , and krill . the whales ' mouths are very large . they open their mouths very wide and hold a big mouthful of sea water . their throats stretch very wide to make the space inside their mouth even bigger . then they close their mouth and squeeze out the seawater . the food does not escape because , instead of teeth , these whales have filters called `` baleen '' . baleen is long , hard strips that act like a strainer . the water goes through the baleen . animals and plants in the water are trapped and swallowed , while the water goes back out . this is very different from the way that toothed whales eat .
