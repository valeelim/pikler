Artificial intelligence     artificial intelligence ( ai ) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn . it is also a field of study which tries to make computers `` smart '' . john mccarthy came up with the name `` artificial intelligence '' in 1955. in general use , the term `` artificial intelligence '' means a machine which mimics human cognition . at least some of the things we associate with other minds , such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers , though not in the same way as we do . an ideal ( perfect ) intelligent machine is a flexible agent which perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of success at some goal . as machines become increasingly capable , mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition . for example , optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of `` artificial intelligence '' : it is just a routine technology . at present we use the term ai for successfully understanding human speech , competing at a high level in strategic game systems ( such as chess and go ) , self-driving cars , and interpreting complex data . some people also consider ai a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly .
