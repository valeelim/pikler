Alcohol     in chemistry , alcohol is a general term which refers to many organic compounds used in industry and science as reagents , solvents , and fuels . alcohols are carbohydrates which are made of an alkyl group with one or more hydroxyl ( - '' oh '' ) groups bound to its carbon atoms . alcohol is colorless , and also transparent . there are two ways of naming alcohols : common names , and iupac names . - common names often are made by taking the name of the alkyl group , and adding the word `` alcohol '' . for example , `` methyl alcohol '' or `` ethyl alcohol '' . - iupac names are made by taking the name of the alkane chain , removing the last `` e '' , and adding `` ol '' . examples of this are `` methanol '' and `` ethanol '' . the hydroxyl ( oh ) group makes alcohols polar . alcohols are very weakly acidic . most alcohols are highly flammable . the simplest two alcohols are methanol ( or methyl alcohol ) and ethanol ( or ethyl alcohol ) , which have the following structures : iupac nomenclature is used when describing more complex alcohols .
