Cancer     cancer is a type of disease where cells grow out of control , divide and invade other tissues . in a person without cancer , cell division is under control . in most tissues , healthy cells divide in a controlled way and copy themselves to create new healthy cells . with cancer , this normal process of cell division goes out of control . cells change their nature because mutations have occurred in their genes . all the daughter cells of cancer cells are also cancerous . if the abnormal cells do not invade , but just divide and swell up their original tissue , this is not called `` cancer '' . it is called a tumour . tumours are usually not a threat to life because they can be cut out . however , some tumours occur in places where they can not be cut out , and they can be fatal . some brain tumours are of this type . the symptoms of cancer are caused by the cancerous cells invading other tissues . this is called metastasis . metastasis is a process in which cancer cells move through the bloodstream or lymphatic system . when this happens , a person 's cancer can be spread throughout his body . eventually those other tissues can not work as well , and the whole body begins to get worse , and may die .
