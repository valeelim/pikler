Karma     karma ( car-ma ) is a word meaning the result of a person 's actions as well as the actions themselves . it is a term about the cycle of cause and effect . according to the theory of karma , what happens to a person , happens because they caused it with their actions . it is an important part of many religions such as hinduism and buddhism . the theory of karma can be thought to be an extension to newton 's third law of action and reaction where every action of any kind including words , thoughts feelings , the totality of our existence , will eventually have a reaction , same type of energy coming back to the one that caused it . it implies that absolutely nothing exists , which does not comply with the law of cause and effect . on the scale of the universe it would imply absolute determinism of all actions , feelings , thoughts and developments for the past and for the future making both calculable , if the current state of the universe would be known fully . in terms of spiritual development , karma is about all that a person has done , is doing and will do . karma is not about punishment or reward . it makes a person responsible for their own life , and how they treat other people .
