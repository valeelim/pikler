Physical change     a physical change is a change in which no new substances are formed . physical changes affect the `` form '' of a chemical substance , but not its chemical composition . mixtures can be separated into their parts by physical methods , such as spinning in a centrifuge . but can not usually be used to separate compounds into chemical elements or simpler compounds . most physical changes are reversible and their mass does not change . examples : changes of shape , changes of states , passing electricity through a copper wire . some physical changes are melting , freezing , boiling .
