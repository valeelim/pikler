Poster     a poster is a large piece of printed paper that has a picture of something . posters are made to be shown on a wall or other flat surface . posters may be used for advertising , education , propaganda , and decoration . they may also be copies of famous works of art . chromolithography ( colour lithography ) was invented by engelmann and son , who were granted a patent in 1837. after that , it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development . because of its low production costs , over the 50 years after the american civil war , millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $ 10 . louis prang , a bostonian , produced fine-art subjects , such as still lifes , landscapes , and classical subjects . nevertheless , it was only after the jules ch√©ret posters , in 1847 , that the potential of this technical process for creation of artistic posters was realized . posters were used for war propaganda , to encourage young people to enlist in the army , and to sell government war bonds . from a strictly artistic view the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters . the posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home .
