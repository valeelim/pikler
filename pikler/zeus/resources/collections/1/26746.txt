Watercolour     watercolours ( uk ) , also called watercolor ( us ) or aquarelle ( french ) , are paintings whose colours are water-based pigments . pigments are coloured materials from rocks , plants , or chemicals , that dissolve in water . they are made in the form of cakes or tablets . when water is added , the powdered pigment becomes liquid again . the pigment is applied to white paper or white card by brush or cloth or cotton wool , and allowed to dry . unlike painting in oil-based pigments ( coloured materials dissolved in oil ) , a watercolour can not be painted over without spoiling the colour , whose purity depends on the white backing below . therefore each area of a watercolour painting is painted only once , and looks fresh and original rather than worked over . watercolour painting is often used in chinese , korean , and japanese paintings . fingerpainting with watercolours came from china .
