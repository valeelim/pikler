Mirror     a mirror or looking-glass is something that reflects light . one common `` plane mirror '' is a piece of special flat glass that a person can look into to see a reflection of themselves or what is behind them . sometimes , a flat piece of metal or the surface of water can act like a mirror . the reason you are able to see yourself in a mirror is because light comes in and gets reflected , and that 's how you are able to see your reflection . mirrors can have magnification properties , making images appear smaller or larger than their actual size . they can also be concave ( curved inward ) or convex ( curved outward ) , making the reflected angle and view to be smaller or larger , respectively . special mirrors can make a person 's appearance look quite strange . also , in a mirror , writing appears backwards , as a `` mirror image '' of the original writing . mirrors are usually made out of glass with metal on the back , called `` silvering '' even if the metal is not silver . some mirrors are made of polished metal , which is less breakable .
