Lightning     lightning is a powerful electrical discharge made during a thunderstorm . the electric current makes the air very hot . the suddenly heated air expands very quickly , which in turn makes thunder . sometimes lightning happens between clouds . sometimes ( in the rain ) it goes from cloud to ground . if it goes from cloud to ground , it can strike a person . around 2000 people are struck by lightning each year . about 50 to 100 lightning bolts strike the earth every second . lightning has hit the empire state building as many as 500 times a year . benjamin franklin was interested in lightning . he discovered many things about it , and in 1772 , he was the first to show that a thunderstorm lets out electricity . in his book he suggested an experiment to test it . franklin did not really go out in a thunder storm and fly a kite in an attempt to prove the presence of electricity in the storm . if that had happened franklin may have been killed , though it is possible to conduct electricity through the kite , and down the string .
