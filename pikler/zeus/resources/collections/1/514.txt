Mercury (planet)    mercury ( planet ) mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system . it is the closest planet to the sun . it makes one trip around the sun once every 87.969 days . mercury is bright when it is visible from earth , ranging from −2.0 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude . it can not be easily seen as it is usually too close to the sun . because mercury is normally lost in the glare of the sun ( except during a solar eclipse ) , mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight . compared to what is known about the other planets in the solar system , little is known about mercury . telescopes on the earth show only a small , bright crescent . the first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was mariner 10 , which mapped only about 45 % of the planet ’ s surface from 1974 to 1975. the second is the messenger spacecraft , which finished mapping the planet in march 2013. mercury looks a lot like earth 's moon . it has many craters with areas of smooth plains , no moons around it and no atmosphere as we know it . however , mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere , known as an exosphere . unlike earth 's moon , mercury has a large iron core , which gives off a magnetic field about 1 % as strong as that of the earth . it is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core . surface temperatures can be anywhere from about 90 to ( −183 °c to 427 °c , −297 °f to 801 °f ) , with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest .
