Earthquake     an earthquake ( or quakes , tremors ) is shaking of the surface of earth , caused by sudden movement in the earth 's crust . they can be extremely violent . earthquakes are usually quite brief , but may repeat . they are the result of a sudden release of energy in the earth 's crust . this creates seismic waves , which are waves of energy that travel through the earth . the study of earthquakes is called seismology.seismology studies the frequency , type and size of earthquakes over a period of time . there are large earthquakes and small earthquakes . large earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury . earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers . the magnitude of an earthquake , and the intensity of shaking , is usually reported on the richter scale . on the scale , 3 or less is scarcely noticeable , and magnitude 7 ( or more ) causes damage over a wide area . an earthquake under the ocean can cause a tsunami . this can cause just as much death and destruction as the earthquake itself . landslides can happen , too . earthquakes are part of the earth 's rock cycle .
