Circle     a circle is a round , regular , two-dimensional shape , shaped like a 2d sphere the centre of a circle is the point in the very middle . the radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side . all points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the centre . in other words , the radius is the same length all the way around the circle . mathematicians use the letter `` r '' for the length of a circle 's radius . the diameter ( meaning `` all the way across '' ) of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle . mathematicians use the letter `` d '' for the length of this line . the diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius ( `` d '' equals 2 times `` r '' ) . the circumference ( meaning `` all the way around '' ) of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle . mathematicians use the letter `` c '' for the length of this line . the number `` π '' ( written as the greek letter `` pi '' ) is a very useful number . it is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter ( `` π '' equals `` c '' divided by `` d '' ) . as a fraction the number π is equal to about or 335/113 ( which is closer ) and as a number it is about 3.1415926535 .
