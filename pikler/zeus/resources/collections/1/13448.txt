Malaria     malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite : it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito . people catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood . the parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year . the parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'plasmodium ' . protozoa are organisms with only one cell , but they are not bacteria . bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans . people usually get malaria from the `` anopheles '' or `` culex '' mosquitoes : they are the vectors of the disease . the `` plasmodium '' gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes . the `` plasmodium '' is in the mosquito 's special saliva . the mosquito 's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting . the person is then infected with `` plasmodium '' as a by-product . this makes the person have the disease we call malaria . only the female mosquito gives people malaria , because only the female mosquito consumes blood . the male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers . the female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs .
