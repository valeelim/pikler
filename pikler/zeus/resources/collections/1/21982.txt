Boiling point     the boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance boils , or enters a state of rapid evaporation . for pure water this is 100째 celsius or 212째 fahrenheit . this is measured at one atmosphere , that is , the air pressure at sea level . boiling points can be changed in several ways . the addition of solutes or other substances usually changes the boiling point . changing the pressure on a liquid changes its boiling point . the boiling point of a liquid depends on the pressure of the surrounding air . an increase in air pressure increases the boiling point ; a decrease decreases the boiling point . in the low pressure environment at the top of mt everest for example , water boils at only 69 째c . ( 156.2 째f ) . it can also be defined in terms of vapour pressure as the temperature at which vapour pressure of liquid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure if you add sugar , salt or any other impurities to the water , it will usually make the boiling point higher . an exception is alcohol , this lowers the boiling point of the water .
