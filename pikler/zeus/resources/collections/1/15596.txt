Antibiotics     an antibiotic ( or antibacterial ) is a chemical compound that kills bacteria or slows their growth . they are used as medicine to treat and cure diseases caused by bacteria . the first antibiotic discovered was penicillin , a natural antibiotic produced by a fungus . production of antibiotics first began in 1939 , and in the modern day , they are made by chemical synthesis . antibiotics can not be used to treat viruses . today , people worry that bacteria will not be affected by antibiotics . bacteria do evolve , and already many strains of bacteria resist regular antibiotics . when exposed to antibiotics , most bacteria die quickly , but some may have mutations which make them slightly less susceptible . these bacteria then multiply and make a large colony which is less affected by the antibiotic . part of this problem is caused by the over-use and misuse of antibiotics . if someone is sick with a virus , antibiotics will not affect the virus . some doctors will still prescribe an antibiotic so the patient feels as though they are being treated for their illness .
