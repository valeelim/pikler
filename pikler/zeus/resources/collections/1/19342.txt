Distillation     distillation is a chemical process where a mixture made of two or more liquids ( called `` components '' ) with different boiling points can be separated from each other . the mixture is heated until one of the components boils ( turns to a vapor ) . the vapor is then fed into a condenser , which cools the vapor and changes it back into a liquid that is called `` distillate ' . what remains in the original container is called the `` residue '' . a fractionating column ( that is a distillation column with more than two outlets ) can be used to improve the separation . an oil refinery uses fractional distillation to purify crude oil , separating several different liquids for different uses . this has been used for a long time , to distill alcohol and produce distilled beverages . distillation is a commonly used operation in many industries . distillation can be done anywhere , whether it 's in a house or a laboratory , but in most countries it is illegal to distill alcohol without a license . illegally distilled alcoholic drinks are in some places called `` moonshine '' .
