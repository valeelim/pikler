Kidney     kidneys are two organs in the abdomen of vertebrates that are shaped like beans . they make urine ( the yellow waste water that comes out of the urethra . ) they are part of the urinary system . when medical professionals discuss the kidneys , they typically refer to the word `` renal '' . for example , `` renal failure '' is when the kidneys are sick and do not work . the prefix `` nephro- '' is also used in words to mean `` kidneys '' . for example , a `` nephrologist '' is a doctor who studies kidneys . the kidney makes hormones . the two most important ones that it makes are erythropoetin and renin . erythropoetin is made by the kidneys if there is less oxygen in the kidney . erythropoetin tells the bone marrow to make more red blood cells . so this means there will be more oxygen carried in the blood . renin is made by the kidney if there is low blood pressure , low volume of blood , or too low salts in the blood . renin makes the blood vessels smaller and tells the adrenal gland to make aldosterone ( which tells the kidneys to save salts ) . it also makes a person feel thirsty . all of this makes the blood pressure go up .
