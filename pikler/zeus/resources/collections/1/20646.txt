Lucid dream     a lucid dream is a dream where the person knows that they are dreaming . the person can then try to control things in the dream because it is not real . in a lucid dream , it is possible to do anything the dreamer wants , such as flying . some people have lucid dreams for spiritual reasons , but they can also be used for fun or to stop bad dreams . although some people can have lucid dreams without trying , most people do not have them often . it is important to be able to remember dreams , because if the dreamer does not remember them , he or she will not know if they were lucid dreams or not . remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up . there are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely . stephen laberge , a psychologist who studies lucid dreams , made the mild ( mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming ) technique . to do this , the dreamer must wake up after having a dream , and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again , except now knowing it is a dream . the dreamer should think `` the next time i am dreaming , i want to remember i am dreaming '' , and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep .
