Gun     a gun ( also called a firearm ) is a weapon used to shoot one or more metal projectiles called bullets . guns guns made of wood or bamboo are thought to have been invented in china around 1000 ad . in the next few centuries they spread to other parts of asia and to europe where they were made of metal . guns largely replaced catapults and bows and arrows when they became strong enough to reach out over longer distances to kill . they are of many different sizes . some are small enough to hold in one hand . others are large enough to sink a warship . guns that are small enough to be carried and used by one person have the same basic parts : a trigger , a barrel , and a handgrip or stock . the trigger is pulled by a finger to fire the weapon which releases a bullet . the barrel guides the bullet which then flies to the target . the handgrip is held by the human who will fire the gun . in military terms , the more correct word `` firearm '' is used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry : pistols ( known as 'shorts ' ) and rifles ( 'longs ' ) . guns can be very effective weapons . some guns fire bullets at a very high speed , which is much more deadly than an arrow or spear . they are also more effective at greater distances than arrows or spears . bullets are usually non-explosive pieces of metal .
