Pi     pi ( or π ) is a mathematical constant . it is the ratio of the distance around a circle to the circle 's diameter . this produces a number , and that number is always the same . however , the number is rather strange . the number starts 3.141592 ... and continues without end . numbers like this are called irrational numbers . the diameter is the longest straight line which can be fitted inside a circle . it passes through the center of the circle . the distance around a circle is known as the circumference . even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles , the number pi remains constant : its value never changes . this is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same . pi is often written formally as formula_1 or the greek letter π as a shortcut . pi is also an irrational number , meaning it can not be written as a fraction ( formula_2 ) , where 'a ' and 'b ' are integers ( whole numbers ) . this basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the decimal go forever without repeating in a pattern , and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number . pi can only be approximated , or measured to a value that is close enough for practical purposes .
