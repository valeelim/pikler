Foot (unit)    foot ( unit ) the foot is a unit for measuring length . it is one of the imperial units and u.s. customary units . the shortest way of writing the unit `` foot '' is by the abbreviation `` ft '' ( or `` ft. '' ) , or by an apostrophe ( ' ) . one foot contains 12 inches . this is equal to 30.48 centimetres . it is called a foot , because it was originally based on the length of a foot . the foot was a common unit of measurement throughout europe . it often differed in length not only from country to country but from city to city . because the length of a foot changed between person to person , measurements were not even consistent between two people , often requiring an average . henry i of england was attributed to passing the law that the foot was to be as long as a person 's own foot . this was one of the first times a standard unit of measurement was put into place . in 1959 , the united states , canada , new zealand , south africa , australia and the united kingdom all signed a treaty known as the 'international yard and pound agreement ' . this standardised the avoirdupois weight and length of all nations . those standards are still officially used in both the imperial system and u.s customary units .
