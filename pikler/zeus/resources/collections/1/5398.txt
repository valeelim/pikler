Matrix (mathematics)    matrix ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a matrix ( plural : matrices ) is a rectangle of numbers , arranged in rows and columns . the rows are each left-to-right ( horizontal ) lines , and the columns go top-to-bottom ( vertical ) . the top-left cell is at row 1 , column 1 `` ( see diagram at right ) '' . there are rules for adding , subtracting and `` multiplying '' matrices together , but the rules are different than for numbers . as an example , formula_1 does not always give the same result as formula_2 , which is the case for the multiplication of ordinary numbers . a matrix can have more than 2 dimensions , such as a 3d matrix . also , a matrix can be one-dimensional , as a single row or column . many natural sciences use matrices quite a lot . in many universities , courses about matrices ( usually called linear algebra ) are taught very early , sometimes even in the first year of studies . matrices are also very common in computer science . the horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns . a matrix with `` m '' rows and `` n '' columns is called an `` m '' -by- '' n '' matrix ( or `` m '' Ã— '' n '' matrix ) and `` m '' and `` n '' are called its dimensions .
