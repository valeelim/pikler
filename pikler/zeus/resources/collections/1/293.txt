Fruit     in botany , a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plant 's seeds . to a botanist , the word `` fruit '' is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary . it is an extra layer round the seeds , which may or may not be fleshy . however , even in the field of botany , there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified . many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower . in general speech , and especially in cooking , fruits are a sweet product , and many botanical fruits are known as vegetables . this is how ordinary people use the words . on this page , we describe what botanists call a fruit . the fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp . it is between the fruit 's skin ( exocarp ) and the seeds . the white part of an apple , for example , is the `` fleshy '' part of the apple . usually , when we eat a fruit , we eat the `` fleshy '' part . if the entire fruit is fleshy , except for maybe a thin skin , we call the fruit a berry . a berry might contain one seed or many . grapes , avocados , and blueberries are berries . they all have a thin skin , but most of the fruit is fleshy . strawberries , however , are actually `` not '' berries , because the seeds are on the outside : on a real berry , the seed or seeds must be inside .
