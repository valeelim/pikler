Queen     in a country whose system of government is a monarchy , the ruler , or head of state , is decided by inheritance . that is , when a ruler dies their child , or nearest relative , takes over . for much of history most countries were governed in this way , especially in europe . some countries elect their monarch instead of using inheritance , like the holy roman empire and malaysia . the wife of a king is also called a queen . however the husband of a female ruler is not called a king . the last king of britain ( george vi ) had a wife ( elizabeth ) who was called queen elizabeth . he had no sons , so he was followed by his elder daughter . she is also called elizabeth and became queen elizabeth ii . she is married to the duke of edinburgh ; but when she became queen he did not become king . many people do not think it is good to have a queen , because she is not elected , though most people in the uk want to keep the royal family . a `` queen regnant '' is head of state , and has all the powers of a sovereign . a queen regnant does not keep the title of queen if she `` abdicates '' ( resigns ) . no queen has ever abdicated in the history of the united kingdom , but two abdications have occurred in the kingdom of the netherlands :
