Thermodynamics     thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the movement of heat between different objects . thermodynamics also studies the change in pressure and volume of objects . a branch of math called statistics is often used in thermodynamics to look at the motion of particles . thermodynamics is useful because it helps us understand how the world of the very small atoms connects to the large scale world we see everyday . thermodynamics also has two main branches called classical thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics . an important idea in thermodynamics is that of a thermodynamic system . an example of a thermodynamic system is a brick . a brick is made up of many atoms which all have their own properties . all thermodynamic systems have two kinds of properties , `` extensive '' and `` intensive '' . for the brick , the extensive properties are the ones you get by adding up all the atoms . things like the volume , energy , mass , and charge are extensive because two of the same brick put together have twice as much mass as one brick . the intensive properties of the brick are the ones you get by looking at the average over all atoms . things like temperature , pressure , and density are intensive because two of the same brick still has the same temperature as one brick alone .
