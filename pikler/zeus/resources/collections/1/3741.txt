Data compression     data compression is a set of steps for packing data into a smaller space , while allowing for the original data to be seen again . compression is a two-way process : a compression algorithm can be used to make a data package smaller , but it can also be run the other way , to decompress the package into its original form . data compression is useful in computing to save disk space , or to reduce the bandwidth used when sending data ( e.g. , over the internet ) . lossless compression packs data in such a way that the compressed package can be decompressed , and the data can be pulled out exactly the same as it went in . this is very important for computer programs and archives , since even a very small change in a computer program will make it unusable . this type of compression works by reducing how much waste space is in a piece of data . for example , if you receive a data package which contains `` aaaaabbbb '' , you could compress that into `` 5a4b '' , which has the same meaning but takes up less space . this type of compression is called `` run-length encoding '' , because you define how long the `` run '' of a character is . in the above example , there are two runs : a run of 5 a 's , and another of 4 b 's .
