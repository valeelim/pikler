Paragraph     a paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence . paragraphs are often made up of many sentences . they are usually between four to eight sentences . paragraphs can begin with an indentation ( about five spaces ) , or by missing a line out , and then starting again ; this makes telling when one paragraph ends and another begins easier . in most organized forms of writing , such as essays , paragraphs contain a topic sentence . this topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about . essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement , which is the central idea of the essay . a pilcrow mark ( Â¶ ) is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins . paragraphs are important to essays , papers , columns , whatever you are writing . paragraphs help separate ideas and let the audience know when you change partial topics . each paragraph has maybe an average of 3 - 7 sentences , depending on the topic and how much information is required .
