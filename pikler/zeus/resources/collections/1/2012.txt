Tone language     a tone language or tonal language is a language in which saying words with different `` tones '' ( which are like pitches in music but with a smaller number ) changes the meaning of a word even if the pronunciation of the word is otherwise the same . many asian languages are tone languages , such as chinese , vietnamese , thai , and punjabi . most languages , including those that come from europe like english , are not tone languages . in some languages , it is pitch accent that is important instead . that means that a word 's meaning can be different if a different syllable is stressed . examples include swedish , norwegian , serbo-croatian , lithuanian , and some asian languages like japanese . however , pitch accent is not the same as tones . some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language . they are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people . in mandarin , the sentence `` ma ma ma ma '' ( ) includes four different words . if numbers identify the tones , they can be written `` ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3 '' , which means `` the hemp 's mother scolds the horse . '' some ways of romanization write each tone with a different spelling ; `` ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3 '' in pinyin would be written `` ma mha mah maa '' in gwoyeu romatzyh romanization . most use numbers or accent marks ( `` mā má mǎ mà '' in pinyin ) . there is a poem called ( ) . it has 92 characters ; all read the same way in mandarin ( `` shi '' ) but with different tones .
