Vaccine     a vaccine is given by a doctor or nurse and makes a person less likely to get a disease . it gives immunity to an infectious disease caused by a particular germ ( bacteria or virus ) . for example , the flu vaccine makes it less likely that a person will get the flu . vaccines are usually made from something that is alive , or was alive . the word `` vaccine '' comes from the latin words `` vaccÄ«n-us '' ( from the word `` vacca '' , meaning `` cow '' ) . in 1796 , edward jenner used cows infected with cowpox ( `` variolae vaccinae '' ) to protect people against smallpox . the use of vaccines is called vaccination . edward jenner created the first vaccine in the 1770s . at this time , smallpox was a deadly disease . jenner noticed that people who had already had cowpox ( a disease that is related to smallpox ) usually did not get smallpox . he thought that getting cowpox protected people against smallpox . to test this idea , jenner gave a boy cowpox . then he infected the boy with smallpox . the boy did not get sick because he had already had cowpox . jenner was right : having cowpox protected people against smallpox .
