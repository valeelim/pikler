Skull     a skull , or cranium , is a set of bones that make up the head of a vertebrate and keep in place all body parts in the head . it supports the structures of the face and forms a protective cavity for the brain . as well as protecting the brain , the skull fixes the distance between the eyes and between the ears . this allows stereoscopic vision , and helps help the brain judge direction and distance of sounds . in some animals , the skull also has a defensive function ( e.g . horned ungulates ) . the frontal bone is where horns are mounted . the skull is made of a number of joined ( fused ) flat bones . in humans , the adult skull is normally made up of 28 bones .
