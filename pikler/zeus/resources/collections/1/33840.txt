Ellipse     an ellipse is a shape that looks like an oval or a flattened circle . in geometry , an ellipse is a plane curve which results from the intersection of a cone by a plane in a way that produces a closed curve . circles are special cases of ellipses , obtained when the cutting plane is perpendicular to the cone 's axis . an ellipse is also the locus of all points of the plane whose distances to two fixed points add to the same constant . a circle has one center , called a focus , but an ellipse has two foci . an ellipse is simply all points on a graph that the sum of the distances from 2 points are the same . for example , an ellipse can be made by putting two pins into cardboard and a circle of string around those two , then putting a pencil in the loop and pulling as far as possible without breaking the string in all directions . the orbits of the planets are ellipses , with the sun at one focus and nothing at the other . the equation of an ellipse is : formula_1 where the center of the ellipse is ( h , k ) . 2a is the length from each end of the longer skinnier side . 2b is the length of the 2 ends of the short side . a²-b²=c² for c is the length between the foci and the center .
