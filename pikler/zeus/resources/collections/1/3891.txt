Oesophagus     the oesophagus ( or esophagus ) is also called the gullet . it is the part of the gastrointestinal system between the mouth and the stomach . it connects the pharynx and the stomach . it is about long . the oesophagus is lined with muscle . this muscle pushes food down into the stomach . the oesophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food . the muscular movement that pushes the food down the oesophagus is called peristalsis . at the entrance to the stomach there is a ring of muscle called a sphincter . this is usually closed , but relaxes as food approaches , allowing it to enter the stomach . in the stomach , the food is churned until it turns into a soupy mixture called chyme .
