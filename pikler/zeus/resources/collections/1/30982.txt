Sunlight     sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the sun . when this energy reaches the earth 's surface , it is called insolation . what we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation . it is the radiation and heat from the sun in the form of electromagnetic waves . the atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received . when solar radiation travels through the atmosphere , some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere ( 16 % ) . some of it is scattered to space ( 6 % ) . some of it is reflected by clouds ( 28 % ) . about 47 % of it reaches the earth 's surface . without sunlight , there could be no life on earth . plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis . during photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight , water , and carbon dioxide , to create glucose ( sugar ) . the glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it . plants need sunlight to grow green . without enough sunlight but with enough water , the plant grows very tall very quickly , but looks yellow and dehydrated , although when touched , the leaves are very moist .
