Foot     a foot ( one `` foot '' , two or more feet ) is a body part on the end of a leg . we use it when walking , and it is important for balance : it helps us stand straight . we also use it to kick , in both fighting and sports , football being an example . people 's hands and feet have the same shape : they both have five `` digits '' ( the fingers and toes ) . many other animals with backbones also have five digits . the part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the `` heel '' . the bottom of the foot is called the `` sole '' . half the bones in our body are in the foot . doctors who work with people 's feet are `` podiatrists '' or `` chiropodists '' . many animals have feet , and there are many different sorts of foot . the feet of monkeys are much like the hands . the hard foot of an ungulate is a hoof . when an animal has soft feet , or feet with soft parts on the underside , we often call it a `` paw '' . in many societies , people like to cover the foot when they are with others , especially outside . in many cultures ( for example north american , european , japanese and others ) people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe . this footwear has special names , for example `` sandals '' , `` shoes '' , and `` boots '' . when people always wear footwear , especially in hot places or when they are very active , their feet can smell badly ( `` foot odour '' ) . if footwear is too big or small , it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe because it can cause long term damage . people who have foot , leg , and back problems can also get help from special shoes .
