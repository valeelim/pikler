Biochemistry     biochemistry is the study of chemical reactions in living beings , and of biological molecules in general . it is important to cell biology and physiology . the study of biochemistry involves enzymes , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , sugars , proteins , and lipids . in the body , most of the molecules are polymers built of long chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen , oxygen and other atoms added . the four types of large biological molecules ( called macromolecules ) are listed here . nucleic acids are long-chain carbon molecules which make dna and rna . their building blocks are called nucleotides . dna is a common type of nucleic acid , which is usually joined up in a `` double helix '' . it is the substance of heredity and holds the information for life which passes from generation to generation . rna is the other main type of nucleic acid . it acts to make the information from dna work inside the cells of the body . there are many different types of rna , each of which has a function inside cells .
