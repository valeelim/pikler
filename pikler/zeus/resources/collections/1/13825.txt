Intersexuality     intersex variations occur ( though rarely ) in species which use sexual reproduction . intersex people are born with sex characteristics that lie between those of typical males and typical females . older terms include the word hermaphrodite , but this term is now only used for animals which have both natural male and female organs . the clinical term 'disorders of sex development ' ( dsds ) is very controversial . an individual 's genitalia may be atypical in some way . it can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is genetically male or female ( with xy chromosomes or xx chromosomes ) . they may also have male and/or female secondary sex characteristics ( such as body shape ) . however , there is a wide range of variation in sexual anatomy . there are many more subtle forms of sex anatomy , or sex chromosome differences . these do n't even show physically . some wo n't show up until later in life . sometimes , the variation may appear when the baby reaches puberty or becomes an adult . up to 1.7 % of people may be born with an intersex variation . a child born with genitalia atypical enough to call in an expert occurs in about 1 of 1,500 births . more information on the frequency of different causes is available .
