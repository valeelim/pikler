Transposition (music)    transposition ( music ) transposition or transposing in music means playing or writing music in a different key . transposing music means making it sound higher or lower . transposing is a useful skill for people who play an instrument , especially the piano or organ . if a pianist is accompanying a singer and the song is a little too high for the singer â€™ s voice it is very useful if he is able to transpose it down so that the music sounds in a lower key . for example : if the music is written in the key of c major it could be transposed down a whole tone so that it sounds in b flat major . it is a good idea for people who play keyboard instruments or transposing instruments to practise transposing . there are three ways to do this : 1 ) transpose each note . for example : when transposing from c to b flat each note has to be one tone lower : an a becomes a g , a g becomes an f , an f becomes an e flat etc . 2 ) by watching the shape of the music and thinking in the new key . for example : when a note leaps up a major third the same needs to happen in the new key . this is a better way of transposing .
