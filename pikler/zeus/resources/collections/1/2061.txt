Nitrogen     nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element . the atmosphere contains more than 78 percent of nitrogen . it has the chemical symbol n and atomic number 7. its stable inside typically contains 14 nucleons ( 7 protons and 7 neutrons ) . it has 5 electrons in its outer shell . nitrogen is a colorless odorless gas at normal temperature . it is normally attached to another nitrogen atom , making a nitrogen molecule ( n ) . this bond is very strong . that is why many explosives contain nitrogen . the bond is broken when the explosive is made . when it explodes the bond forms , releasing a lot of energy . it turns into a liquid at -195.8°c and turns into a solid at -210°c . if it is compressed , it can be turned into a liquid without making it cold . it usually does not combine with other atoms because its strong bond prevents it from reacting . lithium is one of the few chemical elements that react with nitrogen without being heated . magnesium can burn in nitrogen . nitrogen also makes blue electric sparks . the blue color is caused by the atoms being excited . when they get normal again , they release light . when nitrogen is excited , it reacts with many things that it does not normally react with .
