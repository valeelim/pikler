Grand unification theory     grand unification theory or gut is a model that tries to describe the universe . it was formed by combining three forces - electromagnetic , weak and strong forces . these are three of the fundamental four forces of nature , which are responsible for all of the pushes and pulls in the universe . if gravity is also combined with these forces , then the gut will become the proposed theory of everything . because gut models have more dimensions than currently known , there has not been a single gut . particle accelerators , like the large hadron collider have been built to test these guts indirectly , as it is too complex to observe effects on particles without them . gut was first proposed by researchers from cern in the 1970s . the discovery of the higgs boson and other such recent discoveries will get scientists closer to knowing which gut is correct , and ultimately know the theory of everything . this theory was given by pakistani scientist abdus salam , who won a noble prize for it .
