University     an university is an institution where teaching and research is done . the word `` university '' comes from the latin `` universitas magistrorum et scholarium '' , roughly meaning `` community of teachers and scholars . '' people can attend university to get a degree . unlike the schooling they have done before , the courses at university are specialized . a person studying biology at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields , like languages or history . to get a higher degree , people must do some research . the universities were born in europe during the middle ages . the first institution of this type was the university of bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education . this term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought , although their creation was often well before the middle ages . at first , the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the middle ages , they remained tied to the catholic church . at the beginning , they had worked to teach the so-called `` seven liberal arts '' ( the `` trivium '' and the `` quadrivium '' ) :
