Yenisei     the yenisei ( `` енисе́й '' ) is a river in siberia . it belongs to the greatest river system that flows into the arctic ocean . the yenisei is the fifth-longest river in the world . it is a little shorter than the mississippi river , but with 1.5 times the flow . it comes from mongolia and follows a northern course to the kara sea . the river drains a large part of central siberia . the longest stream following the yenisei-angara-selenga-ider is about 5539 km long . its watershed , which includes the world 's largest ( by volume ) lake , lake baikal , holds more water than any other river system . the upper parts of the system have rapids and flooding , and pass through areas where very few people live . the middle section is controlled by a series of large hydroelectric dams . the dams were built to supply a major russian primary industry . partly built by gulag labor in soviet times , industrial contamination is a big problem in the area . the area is very hard for the police to watch . moving on through sparsely populated taiga , the yenisei grows with many tributaries and finally reaches the kara sea in desolate tundra where it is covered with ice for more than half the year . as with other siberian rivers , the flow has increased lately . people think this is because of global warming . a concern was also raised that a change in the salt in the arctic may have a global impact on ocean currents .
