Metallurgy     metallurgy is the study of metals . alloys ( mixtures of metals ) are also studied . people who study or work with metals are called `` metallurgists '' . ores are rocks that have a chemical compound of a metal with oxygen , called an oxide . separating the oxygen from the metal is called smelting . this is done with chemistry or electricity , usually at very high temperatures . this is the first step in metallurgy . a rock containing enough metal to be profitable is called `` ore '' . iron is smelted from iron ore in large reactors called blast furnaces . a blast furnace is a tall vertical structure which is fed with coke , iron ore and limestone . when hot air is blown in the blast furnace , the coke will burn and reduce the oxygen off the ore , producing bare iron and carbon dioxide . the limestone will bind off any remaining bedrock . the iron melts in the hot temperature and is tapped off in liquid phase at the bottom . it is then worked into steel . the limestone and bedrock form a compound called slag . it can be used for making bricks , concrete or road topping .
