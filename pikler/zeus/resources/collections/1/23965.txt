Colonialism     colonialism occurs when a country or a nation takes control of other lands , regions , or territories outside of its borders ( boundaries of the country ) by turning those other lands , regions , or territories into a colony . usually , it is a more powerful , richer country that takes control of a smaller , less powerful region or territory . sometimes the words `` colonialism '' and `` imperialism '' are used to mean the same thing . in the 1700s and 1800s , many of the richer , more powerful european countries ( such as britain , france , spain , and the netherlands ) established colonies in the continents of africa , south america , and the caribbean . some countries use colonialism to get more land for their people to live in . they helped settlers move to the new area . the local people living in the land or territories were usually moved away by using force and violence from armies . to protect these settlers from the local residents who were pushed aside , colonial nations often set up a military fort or colonial police system .
