Iodine     iodine is a chemical element . its atomic number ( which is the number of protons in it ) is 53 , and its atomic mass ( the number of protons plus neutrons ) is 127. it is part of the group 7 ( halogens ) on the periodic table of elements and its electronic configuration is 2,8,18,18,7. it is a nonmetal . iodine is a dark purple-black solid . it is also a nonmetal and a halogen . it sublimes when heated to make a bright purple vapor . this vapor is very irritating , although colorful . iodine does not dissolve in water , but it does dissolve in a solution of an iodide in water . it dissolves easily in organic solvents . iodine is at the bottom of the halogens and is the least reactive of the halogens . iodine is an oxidizing agent , though not as strong as bromine or chlorine . it can become the colorless iodide ion if another atom or molecule gives an iodine atom one of its electrons . this is called reduction . iodine reacts with hydrogen sulfide or hydrazine to make hydriodic acid . iodine dissolves in oleum to make a bright blue solution of i and sulfur dioxide . this cation is also made when iodine reacts with antimony pentafluoride .
