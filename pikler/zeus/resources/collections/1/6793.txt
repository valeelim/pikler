Rocket     a rocket may be a missile , spacecraft , aircraft or other vehicle which is pushed by a rocket engine . some rockets are manned ( e.g . saturn v ) . other rockets , for example missiles , are unmanned . ( `` manned '' means that a person is in it ; `` unmanned '' means that the machine can go without a person . ) most rockets can be launched from the ground because exhaust thrust from the engine is bigger than the weight of the vehicle on earth . some are used to bring satellites into orbit . some rockets such as ion thrusters are too weak and heavy to lift themselves . they work after other rockets bring them to outer space . the rocket was invented by the chinese while using gunpowder . the first rockets were shaped like arrows and were not very fast . most rockets still work by fire . the fire makes hot exhaust gases that expand and shoot out the back . this makes the rocket go forward . most rockets still use solid fuel to make the fire . the biggest ones use liquid fuel because it makes a hotter fire so the rocket is more powerful . however , handling the liquid fuel safely is difficult and expensive . some satellite launch vehicles use both .
