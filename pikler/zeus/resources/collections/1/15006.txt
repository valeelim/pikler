Function (mathematics)    function ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a function is a prescription that assigns to every object of one set an object of another ( or the same ) set . in many cases the objects are numbers . a function may be seen as producing an output - the assigned object - , when given an input - the object from the first set . so a function is like a process . each input `` x '' that is in the set `` x '' of inputs is paired with one output `` y '' in the set `` y '' of outputs . the set `` x '' of inputs is called the `` domain '' and the set `` y '' of possible outputs is called the `` codomain '' . then it is said that `` y '' is a function of `` x , `` and we write `` y '' = '' f '' ( `` x '' ) . `` f '' is the name of the function and one writes formula_1 ( function from x to y ) to represent the three parts of the function , the domain , the codomain and the pairing process . an example of a function is the factorial : formula_2 . one gives a natural number formula_3 as the input and gets a natural number formula_4 as the output with the property that formula_5 . the idea of a function has been set up to cover all sorts of possibilities . it is not necessary that the pairing is given by an equation . the main idea is that inputs and outputs are paired up somehow even if the process is very complicated or not obvious .
