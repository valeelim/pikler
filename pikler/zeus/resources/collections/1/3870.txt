Gene     genes are forms of dna . dna is a collection of chemical information that carries the instructions for making all the proteins a cell will ever need . each gene contains a single set of instructions . these instructions usually code for a particular protein . half of a person 's genes come from the mother . the other half come from the father . originally : a hereditary unit which occupies a specific position ( `` locus '' ) on a chromosome . other definitions are ways the gene showed itself : modern definitions must take note of later discoveries . there are now two classes of genes : genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides how children look and act ( their biological properties ) . genes affect the way our bodies work , including how we look . our eye , hair and skin color are decided by genes . it is said that genes cause `` genetic '' effects in our bodies . a gene may be `` dominant '' or `` recessive '' . these terms refer to the effect a gene has on the offspring who carry it in their genome .
