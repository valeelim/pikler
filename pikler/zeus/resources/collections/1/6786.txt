Icelandic language     icelandic is the language spoken by the people of iceland . it is a germanic language . it comes from the old norse language , the language spoken by the vikings . because iceland is far away from other countries , the language has not changed much . icelandic people can still read words from hundreds of years ago . icelandic uses four characters that are not used in english : þ ( thorn ) , ( like 'th ' in thin ) , ð ( edh ) , ( like 'th ' in this ) , æ ( pronounced like i ) and ö ( pronounced like the french u ) . it can also be said that ð is a `` softer '' version of þ. some linguists say there are only two nordic languages , eastern-nordic and western-nordic , which includes icelandic and faroese because of their similarity . icelandic is also one of the most difficult languages to learn .
