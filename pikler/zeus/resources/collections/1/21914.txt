Algae     algae ( one alga , but several algae ) are a type of plant-like living things that can make food from sunlight by photosynthesis . the study of algae is called phycology or algology . the term lumps together many different kinds of organisms . they have in common only that they are autotrophic : they use natural sources of energy and simple inorganic materials to build their forms . as non-vascular plants they do not have the kind of cell and tissue structure of land plants . they are a convenient but very loose term . only in recent years has it become clear how different the many kinds of algae are . algae are a large and diverse group of simple , typically autotrophic organisms . some have one cell and others have many cells . the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds . they are like plants , and `` simple '' because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants . for that reason they are `` not '' classified as plants . though the prokaryotic `` cyanobacteria '' ( formerly referred to as `` blue-green algae '' ) were included as `` algae '' in older textbooks , it is not now . the term `` algae '' is now used for eukaryotic organisms . all true algae have a nucleus within a membrane and chloroplasts inside one or more membranes . however , algae are definitely `` not '' a monophyletic group , as they do not all descend from a common algal ancestor . modern taxonomists propose splitting them up into monophyletic groups , but not everyone agrees how to do this .
