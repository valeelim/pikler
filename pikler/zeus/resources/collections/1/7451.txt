Penguin     penguins are sea-birds in the family spheniscidae . they use their wings to 'fly ' underwater , but they can not fly in the air . they eat fish and other sea food . penguins lay their eggs and raise their babies on land . penguins live only in the southern hemisphere of the world : antarctica , new zealand , southern australia , south africa and south america . the furthest north they get is the galapagos islands , where the cold humboldt current flows past . all penguins have a white belly and a dark ( mostly black ) back . penguins can not fly , but they can swim very well . their wings have become stiff and small swimming flippers . they have good hearing and can see underwater . the white and black colors are for camouflage ( to help them hide ) when they swim . so , when a predator looking from underwater sees the white belly and wings of the penguin , they can not see it well with the light coming from above . seen from above , the penguin 's black back blends in with the dark water . penguins have webbed feet used for paddling in the water . they can not walk well , so they waddle .
