Subatomic particle     a subatomic particle is a particle smaller than an atom . this means it is very , very small . like atoms and molecules , a subatomic particle is far too small to be seen with the naked eye . it is also very interesting to scientists who try to understand atoms better . the commonly studied subatomic particles are the main ones that make atoms : protons , neutrons , and electrons . the study of subatomic particles is called particle physics . these particles are often held together within an atom by one of the four fundamental forces ( gravity , electromagnetic force , strong force , or weak force ) . outside of the atom the particles often move very , very quickly- near the speed of light which is very , very fast . subatomic particles are divided into two groups , baryons and leptons . baryons are made of quarks while leptons are thought to be among the smallest particles , called elementary particles . baryons have a given baryon number . in reactions , the baryon number must be conserved , meaning that both the starting and ending sides of a reaction must have the same number of baryons . baryonic particles are made up of a combination of 3 of the six quarks , which are among the smallest particles . the six quark types are up , down ( making up protons and neutrons ) , strange , charm , top , and bottom .
