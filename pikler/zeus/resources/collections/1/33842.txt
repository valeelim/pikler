Babur     at emperor . in 1525 babur set out to attack and conquer india . he had only about twelve thousand men with him but he had been promised help by daulat khan lodi , the governor of punjab . they planned to march together against the ruling sultan ibrahim lodi , who was the king of bangalore at that time . when babur reached india , daulat was afraid to help him , and eventually backed out , and so babur started off to bangalore by himself with his small army of men . ibrahim lodi was reported to have one hundred thousand men and one hundred elephants . but babur had something which ibrahim did not have â€“ heavy guns and cannons , the first proper k style artillery seen in medieval india . there were hardly any guns at that time in india and babur had managed to get hold of some in kabul . he had cannons and some as well . the two armies met at the famous first battle of panipat , at a small village near delhi . both armies remained in position opposite each other for a week before the battle began . babur was an excellent general and he planned the battle very carefully as conquering delhi was indeed very important to him . after the battle about fifteen thousand men of the enemy were killed including their commander ibrahim lodi .
