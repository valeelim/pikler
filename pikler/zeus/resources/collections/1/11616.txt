Pottery     pottery is the ceramic material which makes up potteryware . major types include earthenware , stoneware and porcelain . the place where such wares are made is also called a `` pottery '' ( plural `` potteries '' ) . pottery also refers to the art or craft of a potter or the making of pottery . a dictionary definition is simply clay fired in a kiln . pottery objects are made from damp clay mixed with other materials . they are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures . firing makes the clay hard . the potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again . the fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny , decorative and water-tight . some potters make objects which are not useful and are really artistic objects or sculpture . bare pottery objects without a glaze are called `` bisque '' or just earthenware . the finest pottery objects , made of porcelain or bone china are quite strong , yet are translucent . pottery originated before the neolithic period . the earliest example we have is from eastern europe , dating to 25,000 years ago or earlier . it is a female figurine known as the venus of dolní věstonice , from a palaeolithic site in moravia , czech republic . it may have been made as part of a fertility ritual . there are some similar figures from other nearby sites .
