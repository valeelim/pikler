Missile     in general , missile may refer to anything thrown or launched object at a target like a javelin or darts . nowadays , it means , mostly , a self-propelled guided weapon system . missiles are used in war to destroy military targets . missiles can carry explosives or other destructive loads . the loads a missile may carry are called a `` payload '' . this payload is not always harmful to people : for example in the 1991 gulf war , missiles threw reels of wire at electric power stations , causing the power to go out . the two main kinds of missiles are simple `` rockets '' and `` guided missiles '' . a rocket is no longer controlled once it has been launched . most guided missile are also propelled by a rocket engine but can be controlled after it has been launched . some missiles used in anti-aircraft warfare , such as the aim-9 sidewinder , guide themselves with temperature . others guide themselves by radar or are under radio control . the v-1 flying bomb was an early cruise missile , a little airplane with a bomb , propelled by a jet engine instead of a rocket .
