Population density     the population density of a country or city or other place is a number showing how crowded that place is . it is calculated by dividing the population by the area . for example , france has a population of 60,561,200 , and an area of 551,695 square kilometres , so its population density is about 109.8 persons per square kilometre . a number of factors can affect population density . for example , the climate . greenland has a very low population density because it is very cold there , so not many people want to live there . many cities were built near rivers , because the first settlers wanted somewhere close to water to start a society , so areas around rivers often have a high population density . some places , such as cities , have very high population densities , so they are quite crowded . the population density of new york city is 10,292 persons per square kilometre . other places , such as large countries , can have very low population densities . the population density of canada is only 3.5 persons per square kilometre because it is such a big country .
