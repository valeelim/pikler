Variable     a variable is a special type of amount or quantity with an unknown value . they are often used in programming computers or in mathematical equations . a number such as 5 or 200 can not change its value . for example , if a person stands 5 feet away from a building , the `` distance '' variable compared to the building does not change over time . 5 feet is called a `` fixed amount '' , which is the opposite of a variable amount . but if a person walks away from the building , the distance variable compared to the building is increasing . so it does not have the same value and we can not use the same number for it , as the distance might be 1 foot now , but 2 feet a second later . in mathematics , a variable is usually given a letter , such as `` x '' or `` y '' . in some equations , variables are used to show numbers that are unknown . using a type of math called algebra , one can find the value of the variable . in computer science , a variable does not have to be a numberâ€”it may be a string ( text ) value , or a date , or an amount of money , or even an object such as a picture .
