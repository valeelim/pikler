Blink-182     blink-182 is a popular pop-punk band formed in 1992. the original band name was blink . they later had to add on the `` 182 '' suffix due to an irish techno band who had the same name that had been around longer and threatened to sue the band . although the change , fans still refer the band as just `` blink '' . tom delonge , who played guitar , had been friends with ann hoppus while living in san diego . he had often complained about wanting to start a band . ann then introduced tom to her younger brother , mark hoppus , who played bass . they later found drummer scott raynor to complete the trio . in 1998 , midway through a north american tour , raynor left the band to continue his education . raynor was also rumoured as having been forced to leave the band by its remaining members , due to his drinking problem . travis barker , who had been drumming for the aquabats at the time , filled in for blink 182 on the drums to finish out the rest of the tour . tom and mark were so impressed that they had barker become the bands full-time drummer . blink-182 can be known for their catchy pop-punk songs and toilet humor ( their live album especially , which contained a song consisting entirely of swear words ) . in february 2005 , the band announced that they were going on an `` indefinite hiatus '' . they stated that they were going to take a break for a while . however now all three members have confirmed that they have no plans of getting back together in the future , due to delonge going on to create the band angels & airwaves and hoppus and barker to create the band +44 .
