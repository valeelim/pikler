GNU General Public License     the gnu general public license ( gpl ) is a computer software copyleft license . this license lets the user of the software use a program in many of the same ways as if it were public domain . they can use it , change it , and copy it . they can also sell or give away copies of the program with or without any changes they made to it . the license lets them do this as long as they agree to follow the terms of the license . the gpl was created by richard stallman . the current version is version 3 , created in 2007 , although some software still uses version 2 , created in 1991. there are two main terms to the license . both apply to giving the program away or selling it . - a copy of the source code or written instructions about how to get a copy must be included with the software . if the software is able to be downloaded from the internet , the source code must also be available for downloading . - the license of the software can not be changed or removed . it must always use the gpl .
