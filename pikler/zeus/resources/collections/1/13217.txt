Architect     an architect is a person who designs buildings and prepares plans to give to a builder . what he or she designs is called architecture . architects make drawings with pens , pencils , and computers , and this is also called drafting . sometimes they first make small toy-sized buildings called models to show what the building will look like when it is done . some of these models survive for hundreds of years , such as st paul 's cathedral , london . architects decide the size , shape , and what the building will be made from . architects need to be good at math and drawing . they need imagination . they must go to university and learn how to make a building 's structure safe so that it will not collapse . they should also know how to make a building attractive , so that people will enjoy using it . although there has been architecture for thousands of years , there have not always been architects . the great european cathedrals built in the middle ages were designed by a master builder , who scratched his designs on flat beds of plaster . paper did not exist in europe at this time and vellum or parchment were very expensive and could not be made in large sizes .
