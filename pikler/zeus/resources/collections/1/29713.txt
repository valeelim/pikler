'' `` shinkansen '' means `` new trunk line '' in japanese because it was built with all new bridges , tunnels through mountains and water , and special tracks for high speed trains so it could go directly ( straight ) from city to city . before the shinkansen , trains in japan were slower because they were old and had to go around many mountains , or share the track with cars on road crossings .
