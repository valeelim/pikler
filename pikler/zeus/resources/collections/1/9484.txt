Five solas     in europe in the 16th century there was a big change in the christian religion . in this protestant reformation , hundreds of thousands of people left the catholic church to form protestant churches all over europe.. `` the five solas '' are an important part of the reformed theology of these protestant leaders : - sola scriptura . this means `` the bible only '' . the protestants believed that they should only read the bible to find out what god wants them to believe . they did this instead of listening to the pope or the priests in the catholic church . - solus christus . this means `` jesus christ only '' . the protestants believed that the only way to heaven is by jesus dying on the cross . they did this so they did not have to pray to mary or saints or angels . - sola gratia . this means `` grace only '' . this talks about going to heaven . it means that god lets people into heaven who do not deserve it . it also means that no one deserves to go to heaven . - sola fide . this means `` faith only '' . protestants believed that people must trust jesus . they have to trust that jesus lets people into heaven . only people who trust jesus can get to heaven .
