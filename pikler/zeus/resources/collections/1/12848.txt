Volkswagen     volkswagen is a car company from germany . the word `` volkswagen '' means `` people 's car '' in german . its headquarters are in wolfsburg , lower saxony . it was started in the 1930s , at the request of the country 's leader , adolf hitler to produce a car designed by ferdinand porsche . in the 1930s adolf hitler was looking for someone who could make a cheap car that the common german worker could afford . at the same time , ferdinand porsche had been working for years on a cheap car that could hold a family and would drive like a real car , not a micro car . he had already designed and built small cars with rear engines and shaped like a beetle ( for better aerodynamics ) . at this time , owning a car in germany was something only for the rich people , and most car companies were not interested in making a low-cost car . porsche 's company , also called porsche , only made designs for others at that time . so porsche could not find anyone to make the small car that he wanted . though hitler never learned to drive , he was very interested in cars ( he also created the autobahn , which led to the u.s. interstate highways ) . hitler wanted the car to hold four people . it was to be cooled by oil instead of water . the car needed to be able to travel at least 100 km/h , or about 60 mph , and use no more than 7 liters of gasoline for 100 kilometers ( about 40 mpg ) . the car companies in germany at the time did n't want to make this new low-cost car , so hitler formed a new company , run by the government . the first name given to the car was `` kdf-wagen . '' `` kdf '' stood for `` kraft durch freude '' , or `` strength through joy . '' some were made , but by the time the factory was finished in 1938 , world war ii started . the factory then built jeep-like cars for the german military instead .
