Xenon     xenon is a non-metal chemical element . it has the chemical symbol xe and atomic number 54. it is one of the few elements that are a gas at standard temperature and pressure . sir william ramsay and m. w. travers discovered this element in 1898. the element 's name came from the greek word `` xenos '' , which means 'stranger ' . xenon belongs to the group of the noble gases . noble gases are very unreactive . however , in 1962 , chemists have found that xenon can react with fluorine under special conditions , such as high pressure and high temperature . it is not known why xenon behaves differently under these circumstances . there are also some compounds with oxygen . the gas is not very reactive , because if fulfills the octet rule . this means that a lot of energy is needed to remove an electron from xenon . this activation energy for xenon is 1172 kj/mol . to remove a second electron from xenon , an energy of 2046.4 kj/mol is needed . known oxidation states of xenon are 0 , +1 , +2 , +4 , +6 and +8 . however , the most stable form is pure xenon , or the xenon 's oxidation state of 0. xenon has 8 stable isotopes and more than 30 unstable isotopes .
