Mechanistic paradigm     the mechanistic paradigm , also known as the newtonian paradigm , assumes that things in the environment around humans are more like machines than like life . it was more common in the 19th century . this is a set of loosely related beliefs that affects all sciences : - in physics it presents atoms as made of particles in preference to say the wave theory of light . in fact , both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does , but are rarely presented as equals . many physics students graduate fully understanding the hydrogen bomb but having no clear idea of how musical instruments work . - in astrophysics it assumes that the universe is like clockwork and works on its own without our choice making any difference - this fits relativity but is not easy to combine with quantum mechanics . - in cosmology it accepts models of our universe more easily if reject the continuous creation of matter , energy or any new `` other universes '' . - in chemistry it assumes that molecules are like building blocks , and have no unpredictable or strange and unique effects when combined . this is the basic assumption of mechanosynthesis which some scientists think will create a molecular assembler .
