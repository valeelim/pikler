Earth's orbit    earth 's orbit all planets in our solar system follow an elliptical path . this path is known as an orbit . earth 's orbit is not a perfect circle . if you were to draw the earth 's orbit on a sheet of paper as a perfect circle , the width of the line would be larger than the elliptical path of the earth . the earth 's orbit takes about 365 days , this is also called a year . this means that in 365 days ( a year ) the earth has gone completely around the sun . from this we can find that the earth is actually moving at about 67,000 miles per hour through space . the closest distance earth is to the sun , or perihelion , is 146 million km ( 91 million miles ) and the farthest or aphelion is 152 million km ( 94.5 million miles ) . it takes light ( or any other electromagnetic radiation ) just over eight minutes to travel from sun to earth . the seasonal changes on earth are because of the 23.4 degree axial tilt of its rotation and slightly elliptical path around the sun . the orbit varies over long periods of time according to the milankovitch cycles . these cycles are one of the main causes of climate change .
