Second     the second ( symbol : s ) , sometimes abbreviated sec. , is the name of a unit of time . it is one of the seven si base units . it is the time taken by 9,192,631,770 cycles of radiation that comes from electrons moving between two energy levels of the caesium-133 atom . other ( non-si ) units of time are defined in terms of the second . there are 86,400 seconds in one day , 3,600 seconds in one hour , and 60 seconds in one minute . si prefixes are frequently combined with the word `` second '' to denote subdivisions of the second , `` e.g . `` , the millisecond ( one thousandth of a second ) and nanosecond ( one billionth of a second ) . though si prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second ( such as “ kilosecond ” , or one thousand seconds ) , such units are rarely used in practice . more commonly encountered , non-si units of time such as the minute , hour , and day increase by multiples of 60 and 24 ( rather than by powers of ten as in the si system ) . under the international system of units , the second is currently defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom . this definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 k ( absolute zero ) . the ground state is defined at zero magnetic field . the second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second .
