Microwave oven     a microwave oven ( commonly called a microwave ) is a machine that cooks food using microwaves , a type of radio wave . the idea was invented when a scientist who was experimenting with radio waves saw his chocolate bar , which he was holding at that time , melt . he then knew that radio waves could cook food and invented the microwave oven . food is placed inside the oven , and buttons on the screen or on the outer surface of the appliances are pressed to set how long the food should be cooked.these days a microwave oven is one of the fastest ways of cooking , it is in great trend . metals tend to spark in microwaves , rather than heating . the reason why is that metals like to give away electrons , so when the microwaves `` push '' at their magnet-like electrons , instead of turning , they just give the electrons away . a bunch of electrons running off on metal is called electricity , and we see it in the form of sparks . the microwave oven uses a magnetron . this is similar to a radio transmitter . it makes very short radio waves which go into the food to a depth of about 2.5cm ( one inch ) . this makes water molecules swing to and fro at about 2.5 billion times a second . this heats up the molecules around it . as they heat up the heat goes to the inside of the food . this process is called conduction . this also happens in a normal oven , but microwave energy goes deeper so that the food cooks much faster . in an ordinary oven the energy stays mostly near the surface
