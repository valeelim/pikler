Probability     probability is a part of mathematics . it has to do with chance , the study of things that might happen or might not happen . for example , using probability , you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land , half of the time it will land with one side facing up , and half the time with the other side facing up . many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side , and something else on the other side . often people call the side with the face `` heads '' , and the other side `` tails '' . the probability ( p ) of an event is always between zero ( impossible ) and one ( certain ) . if we roll a die ( plural : dice ) , then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 ( this is because there are 6 numbers on a die ) . also , the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6 . this is because it can land on 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6. the chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. every time we roll the die , it will always land on a number between 1 and 6. probability can be figured out using mathematics . for example if you roll six dice , the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious , but can be figured out using math and science .
