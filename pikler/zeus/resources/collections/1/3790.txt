Election     an election is a way people can choose their candidate or their preferences in a representative democracy or other form of government . most democratic countries hold new elections for their national legislature every few years . in a parliamentary system the legislature chooses the leaders of the government . some democracies elect other national officials ( such as a president ) . many democratic countries also have regional , provincial or state elections . there are different ways to organize an election in different countries . voters might vote for an individual , or they might vote for a political party ( party list ) . this is because different countries use different voting systems . countries that are not democracies can also hold elections . this is usually done to let the people choose a local representative ( like a mayor ) . also many countries call themselves democracies , but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of government . psephology is the study of elections .
