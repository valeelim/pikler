Civil war     a civil war is a war that takes place between two or more groups in one country . while civil wars can take place for many of reasons , there are two common reasons . the first is because the different groups disagree about who should be in charge , or how the country should be run . if two political parties disagree about the result of an election , this might lead to a war if the two sides can not or would not come to an agreement . the second is because one group of people does not want to be part of the country anymore . this is known as a war of secession . lots of people living in a certain area might decide that they want independence to make their own country . very few national leaders would be happy to give up land that is part of that country , and a war could result . sometimes the people who want to break away do not necessarily want to form a whole new country , but they might want more autonomy over their affairs . this happens sometimes when different ethnic groups belong to the same nation .
