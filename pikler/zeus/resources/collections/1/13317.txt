Gender identity     in sociology , gender identity describes the gender that a person sees themselves as . most people see themselves as a man or woman ; a boy or girl . for almost everyone , the gender they identify as , matches what the doctor said they were when they were born . for a few people , however , they were called one thing when they were born , but they feel like the other gender ; people in this group are called transgender . sometimes , other people are called transgender , too , when they do not fit society 's expectations about gender rolesâ€”that is , how a male or female of a certain age and culture should look and act . the vast majority of adults in society think of themselves as being a man or a woman . almost all children can identify themselves as a boy or a girl by age two or three . society tends to think of gender as an either-or situation : that is , that everyone must be man or woman ; boy or girl , a view that scholars call `` the gender binary '' . and while that fits most people , it does n't fit everyone .
