Statistics     statistics is the science of data . it enables the collection , analysis , understanding , and presentation of data . it helps in the study of many other fields , such as medicine , economics , psychology , and marketing . someone who works in statistics is called a statistician . statistics provides ways to get the data needed for a study without waste , such as surveys and controlled experiments . once the data has been collected , there are two basic ways that data can be analysed : 1. first , statistics can help `` describe '' the data . this is known as `` descriptive statistics '' . descriptive statistics is about finding meaningful ways to summarize the data , because it is easier to use the `` summary '' than having to use the whole set of data all the time . summarizing the data also allows to find common patterns . in statistics , such patterns are called probability distributions . the basic idea is to look at the results of an experiment , and look at how the results are grouped . 1. once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for prediction . this is called `` inferential statistics '' . as an example , the size of an animal is dependent on many factors . some of these factors are controlled by the environment , but others are by inheritance . a biologist might therefore make a model that says that there 's a high probability , the offspring will be small in size if the parents were small in size . this model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random . testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a placebo .
