Counterpoint     counterpoint is the art of composing music by combining different parts ( voices ) in a way that sounds nice . music composed like this is called contrapuntal . if the tune of `` twinkle , twinkle little star '' is played on the piano and then some chords are added , this is harmony , not counterpoint . instead , if the tune of `` twinkle , twinkle little star '' was played while another melody was played , this would be considered counterpoint . a different way of playing it would be to start the tune with the right hand . then , in the second bar ( measure ) , as the fifth note is played , the left hand starts to play the tune an octave lower . this works well for a time , but in the fifth bar ( on the word “ up ” in the right hand part ) it starts to get dissonant ( sounding unpleasant ) , so changes need to made to the left hand to make it sound nicer . this way of writing with a particular number of parts ( in this case : two ) is called `` contrapuntal music '' . in that example the left hand imitated the right hand at first . this is called imitation .
