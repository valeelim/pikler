Sleep paralysis     when people are dreaming , their muscles do not move , even if in their dream they are moving . this is a natural process which prevents that people actually perform the movements they do in their sleep . in general , people are not aware of this inability to move , as it usually stops as soon as they wake up . people suffering from sleep paralysis wake up and find that they are unable to move . this is because the paralysis has not stopped . usually it lasts for only a few minutes , and people have said they feel a `` presence '' or `` ghost '' during it . little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis . however , some have suggested that it may be linked to post-synaptic ( neurons sending signals to other neurons ) inhibition ( restraint ) of nerves in the pons ( back ) region of the brain . in particular , low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves , which stops stimulation of the muscles . hallucinations of ghosts , demons and out of body experiences during sleep paralysis may be caused by a part of the brain called the parietal lobe ( top-middle part of the brain ) , and by neurons known as mirror neurons .
