Trabant     the trabant ( or `` trabi '' ) was a series of cars built in the german democratic republic . when the first cars were released , people saw them as being innovative . the cars were also easy on fuel , they did not need much fuel . trabant had a two-stroke engine . the outside of the trabant was not made with steel or iron , because the german democratic republic did not want to import steel and iron for the cars , because that would have been too expensive . instead , the trabant was made of duroplast , a special kind of plastic , made by mixing formica and bakelite , and made stronger with fibres of cotton . they could afford some steel from russia , and this was used for the engine and the floor , and to give the plastic strength . after the berlin wall was opened the trabant did not sell as much as before , because the people wanted bigger cars that they could get after the wall was opened . trabants can still be found in east europe , for example in hungary . the trabant was a small car , good for driving in the city . the two-stroke engine created lots of air pollution , but because of the plastic body , it was stronger and safer than western cars of the same time . it was famous for being better in a crash test than a vw polo .
