Salt water     saline water ( also called salt water , salt-water or saltwater ) is water with salt in it . it often means the water from the seas ( sea water ) and oceans . salt water used for making or preserving food , is usually saltier than sea water and is called brine . drinking sea water alone is dangerous . a summary of 163 life raft voyages showed the risk of death at 39 % for those who drank seawater , compared to 3 % for those who did not . experiments on rats showed the danger . when scientists measure salt in water , they usually say they are testing the salinity of the water : salinity is measured in `` parts per thousand '' or `` ppt '' . most sea water is about 35 ppt salt . salt lakes can be up to ten times as salty . above that level precipitation creates a salt plain . brackish water , in contrast , is less salty than seawater . salt water is more dense than fresh water . this means that it has more matter per its volume . fresh water has a density of 1 g/ml , while salty seawater has an average density of about 1.025 g/ml .
