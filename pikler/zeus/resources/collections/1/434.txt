Leap year     a leap year is a year in which an extra day is added to the gregorian calendar , which is used by most of the world . while an ordinary year has 365 days , a leap year has 366 days . the extra day , february 29 , is added to the month of february . in an ordinary year , february has 28 days , but in a leap year , it has 29 days . the extra 29th day , called a leap day , is the same day of the week as the first day of the month , february 1. also , in a leap year , the months of january , april , and july all start on the same day of the week . a leap year comes once every four years . because of this , a leap year can always be evenly divided by four . for example , 2012 was a leap year . but a year is rather a common year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but not by 400. this is why 1600 , 2000 , and 2400 are leap years , but 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 were rather common years . we have leap years because instead of 365 days , the earth really takes a few minutes less than 365-1/4 days ( 365.24219 ) to go completely around the sun . without leap years , the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years . after 360 years , spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere ( which usually begins on march 21 ) would begin on december 21 ( which is when winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere presently begins ) .
