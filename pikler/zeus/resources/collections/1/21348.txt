Longitude     longitude is a way to say where a place is on the earth . it is measured starting from an imaginary north-south line called the prime meridian . ( a meridian is an imaginary line drawn from the north pole to the south pole . ) longitude says how far east or west of the prime meridian any place is . longitude is measured using degrees , the same way an angle is . the prime meridian is 0° ( zero degrees ) , and the farthest away is +180° eastward and -180° westward . unlike latitude , which has the equator as a natural starting position , there is no natural starting position for longitude . other meridians have been used in the past , but most scientists now agree to use the prime meridian . for centuries navigators at sea were seldom able to know their longitude . the problem was solved in the early 19th century . longitude , as opposed to latitude does not maintain a constant distance between degrees since the primary measurement is time , not distance . this means if you are near the north pole , you can gain many degrees of longitude west by travelling a relatively short distance .
