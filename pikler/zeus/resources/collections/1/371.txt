Idiom     an idiom is a word or phrase which means something different from its literal meaning . idioms are common phrases or terms whose meaning is changed , but can be understood by their popular use . because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly . some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times . the idiom `` shape up or ship out '' , which is like saying `` improve your behavior or leave if you do n't '' , might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee , but not to other people . idioms are not the same thing as slang . idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known to almost everyone . slang is usually special words , or special meanings of normal words that are known only to a particular group of people . to learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language , and how and when to use them . but people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings . in order to understand an idiom , one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from .
