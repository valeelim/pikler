Genus     a genus is a rank in the biological classification ( or taxonomy ) . it stands above species , and below families . a genus can include more than one species . when biologists talk about a genus , they mean one or more species of animals or plants that are closely related to each other . as with other taxons , the plural is different from other english words because it is a latin word . 'genus ' is the singular , and 'genera ' is the plural form of the word . when printing the scientific name of an organism , the name is `` always in italic '' . a name of species has two parts , with the genus first . for example , in `` '' felis silvestris '' '' , `` felis '' is the genus . the genus name always begins with a capital letter . in `` '' felis silvestris catus '' '' , the third word is the subspecies , which is not often used . in writing , genus names in latin may be 'anglicised ' to form a common name . for example , the genus `` pseudomonas '' is `` pseudomonad '' ( plural : `` pseudomonads '' ) . in practice , most really common animals and plants already have a common name . so instead of saying 'felids ' , or 'felines ' , one says 'cats ' both for the family pet , and for all the cat family ( felidae ) .
