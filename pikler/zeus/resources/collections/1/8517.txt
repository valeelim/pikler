Birth control     birth control , also known as contraception or family planning , is a way for a man and woman to have sexual intercourse and avoid pregnancy . some contraceptives , such as condoms , will also protect a person from sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) . when people use contraception to prevent stds and pregnancy , it may be called `` safe sex '' . birth control is also sometimes called `` family planning '' . it means people can have babies or not as they wish . that way , babies and families do not happen by accident . birth control lets a man and woman have sexual intercourse but makes pregnancy less likely . during intercourse , a man places his penis within a woman 's vagina and moves it in and out while the woman moves her hips . the vagina is warm and soft , and it places pressure on the man 's penis . these sensations , combined with the in-and-out movements , stimulate the penis , which causes the man to have an orgasm and to ejaculate ( to release semen into the vagina ) . the semen can make the woman pregnant . because intercourse is usually very enjoyable , men and women often want to have intercourse a lot more often than they want to have a baby . birth control lets them have intercourse while greatly reducing the chances of the woman getting pregnant .
