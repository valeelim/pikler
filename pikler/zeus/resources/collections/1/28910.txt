Materialism     materialism is the philosophical belief that the world is made of material , and that there are no other types of entity ( things ) . everything is composed of material . things that are not made of material , such as consciousness , are the result of actions by material . in other words , matter is the only real substance . `` physicalism '' is a related term . especially , a materialist does not believe in gods or other supernatural entities . the materialist thinks the idea of a spirit is either meaningless , or not scientifically proven . therefore , by definition , materialists are also atheists , though not all atheists are materialists . modern philosophical materialists extend the definition to include other basic entities proven by science . such as energy , forces , and the curvature of space . matter and energy are known to be interchangeable , and much else , such as gravity , is caused by matter . however , the concept of matter is itself not entirely clear . other types of philosophy share some of the aims of materialism . examples would include reductionism , logical positivism and empiricism .
