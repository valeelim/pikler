Sexual reproduction     sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce . some protists and fungi also reproduce this way . organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes : male and female . offspring is made by a sperm fertilising an ovum from the female . different steps are involved in the process . the cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes : they are diploid . when gametes ( sex cells ) are produced , they have only one set of chromosomes : they are haploid . they have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis . two things happen during meiosis , each of which makes the offspring more variable . that means they are different from the parents and from each other . assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete . in each pair of chromosomes , `` which one goes into a single gamete is random '' . because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same , this means that there is genetic variation between gametes . this process was mendel 's 'first law ' , the law of segregation .
