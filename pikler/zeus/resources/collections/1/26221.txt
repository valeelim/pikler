Ramadan     ramadan ( sometimes spelled ramadhan ) is the ninth month of the islamic calendar , during which muslims fast or do not eat or drink during the daytime . the date for the start of ramadan is slightly different each year , depending on the position of the moon . once ramadan starts , muslims should not eat or drink between dawn and sunset . this usually continues for thirty days , but sometimes twenty-nine days . fasting is supposed to teach muslims about patience and spiritual things . it is a time for muslims to think about how the poor and homeless suffer without lots of food , it helps muslims to be more obedient , and less greedy . during ramadan , muslims ask to be forgiven for their sins , and they pray for help in stopping them from doing bad things . muslims believe ramadan is the month in which the first verses of the qur'an were revealed to the prophet muhammad . not everyone has to observe ramadan . children do not have to fast . they should start when they reach the age of puberty , so long as they are healthy . people who are travelling long distances do not have to fast . pregnant women do not have to if they think it might harm their unborn baby . sometimes sportsmen do not observe the fast , although there are disagreements about this . for example , the olympic games in 2012 fell in the middle of the holy month . this made it very difficult for the sportsmen who could not eat or drink during daytime .
