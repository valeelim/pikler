Adjective     an adjective is a kind of word that modifies a noun . nouns are words that name a place , a person , a thing , or an idea . an adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it . it is a part of speech . adjectives are something that describes something and makes the thing sound better . often , the adjective is before the noun it describes . sometimes an adjective is not followed by a noun : - the sky is blue . - the joke she told was so funny , i could not stop laughing all day . - it 's still an adjective , because we could have `` the blue sky '' , `` the funny joke '' , and `` the crazy man '' . the adjective is still describing the noun though they are not side by side . - there is a tall man . an adjective is a word that gives instant information about a noun to make a clear picture of the noun in the mind of the reader and create a feeling to the writer . sometimes there are different forms of the same adjective . if one joke makes a person laugh more than another joke , then that joke is funnier . this is called the comparative form . the day that is colder than any other is the coldest day . this is the superlative form of `` cold '' . some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them . for instance , one car may be cheaper than another , but the second car may be more reliable . ( we use `` more reliable '' , instead of `` reliabler '' . ) reliable means worthy of trust .
