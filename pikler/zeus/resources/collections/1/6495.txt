Graph     a graph is a picture designed to express words , particularly the connection between two or more quantities . you can see a graph on the right . a simple graph usually shows the relationship between two numbers or measurements in the form of a grid . if this is a `` rectangular graph '' using cartesian coordinate system , the two measurements will be arranged into two different lines at right angle to one another . one of these lines will be going up ( the `` vertical '' axis ) . the other one will be going right ( the `` horizontal '' axis ) . these lines ( or `` axes '' , the plural of axis ) meet at their ends in the lower left corner of the graph . both of these axes have `` tick marks '' along their lengths . you can think of each axis as a ruler drawn on paper . so each measurement is indicated by the length of the associated tick mark along the particular axis . a graph is a kind of chart or diagram . however , a chart or a diagram may not relate one quantity to other quantities . `` flowcharts '' and `` tree diagrams '' are charts or diagrams that are not graphs .
