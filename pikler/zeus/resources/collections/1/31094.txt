Gunpowder     gunpowder ( or gun powder ) is a mix of chemical substances ( charcoal , sulfur and saltpeter ) . it burns very quickly , and creates gases . those gases use up more space than the gunpowder they come from , so they push outward . if the gunpowder is in a small space , the gasses will push on the walls of the space , building up pressure . in a gun , the pressure pushes against a bullet , causing it to fly out at high speeds . the pressure is not high enough , though , to destroy the gun barrel . gunpowder was invented by the chinese , the first references of black powder , which is a form of gun powder date to the 9th century , when roger bacon described the formula of black powder . according to legend , chinese alchemists were looking for a formula to create the elixir of life , or the mythical potion that causes whoever drinks it to become immortal , when they accidentally created gunpowder . because the powder was highly flammable , or burned very easily , they decided to call it `` fire medicine '' ( simplified chinese : 火药 / traditional chinese : 火藥 ) . shortly after the discovery , the chinese weaponized the substance , or made weapons out of it , and throughout the centuries they would make many weapons using gunpowder , including rockets , bombs , flamethrowers , and land mines before making cannons and guns . the oldest weapon that uses gunpowder dates back to a bronze handheld cannon made in northeastern china in 1288 .
