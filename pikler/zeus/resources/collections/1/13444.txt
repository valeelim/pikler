Ancient Greece     ancient greece was a large area in the northeast of the mediterranean sea , where people spoke greek . it was much bigger than the greece we know today . it was the civilization of greece , from the archaic period of the 8th/6th centuries bc to 146 bc . the period ended with the roman conquest of greece in the battle of corinth . for most of this time the greeks did not have a single government or ruler . there were a number of city states , each with its own constitution . athens , sparta and corinth are examples . some had kings , and some , like athens , had a form of democracy . as time went on , the most powerful cities collected other cities into confederations known as `` leagues '' . this applied to many of the greek colonies in asia minor , most of which had close ties to one or other of the big three cities . in the middle of this period was classical greece , which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries bc . athenian leadership successfully repelled the threat of persian invasion in the greco-persian wars . the athenian golden age ends with the defeat of athens at the hands of sparta in the peloponnesian war in 404 bc .
