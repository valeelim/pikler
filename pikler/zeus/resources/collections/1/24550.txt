Jackal     jackals are canids found in africa and asia . they are nocturnal carnivorous and eat small mammals , birds and reptiles . to hunt , they can run at speeds of 16km/h ( 10mph ) . jackals are monogamous ( each male lives with only one female ) . a pair defends its territory from other pairs : they mark the territory with urine and feces . the territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who live with their parents until they have their own territory . sometimes , jackals join small packs , for example to hunt a big animal , but normally they hunt alone or as a pair . jackals are not a clade . they have several times developed from canid ancestors . there are four species of jackals : - black-backed jackal ( `` canis mesomelas '' ) - the common jackal , live in many african habitats ; - golden jackal ( `` canis aureus '' ) - live in northern and central africa and southern asia ; - side-striped jackal ( `` canis adustus '' ) - live in central and southern africa ; a canid from ethiopia and eritrea , the ethiopian wolf ( `` canis simensis '' ) , is sometimes called simian jackal , but it is really a wolf . the ethiopian wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canids .
