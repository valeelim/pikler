Creator     a creator is a person who creates something . in some religions ( judaism , christianity , islam ) god ( or allah meaning the god in arabic ) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including man who is made `` in his image '' ( see genesis ) to observe it and control it like god . the idea that anything that a person is creating , like an idea , can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions . in other traditions ( buddhism , native american mythology ) anyone has this potential for creating , and can become part of the greater creating of the universe . stewardship of home , land and all of earth is a test for participating in this , or just good sense .
