General relativity     general relativity is a theory of space and time . the theory was published by albert einstein in 1915. the central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime . spacetime is curved when there is gravity , matter , energy , and momentum . the links between these forces are shown in the einstein field equations . a central idea in general relativity is the `` principle of equivalence . '' an example is that two people , one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth , and the other in an elevator in outer space accelerating at 9.8 m/s , will each observe the same behavior of an object they drop from their hand . the object will accelerate to the floor at 9.8 m/s in either case , making it impossible for either to distinguish whether or not they are at rest in a gravitational field or accelerating upward at one . other versions of this type of `` thought experiment '' were used to show that light would curve in an accelerating frame of reference . there are several forms of the equivalence principle . these include : newton 's equivalence principle , the weak equivalence principle , the gravitational weak equivalence principle , einstein 's equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle .
