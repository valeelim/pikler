Small intestine     the small intestine is between the stomach and the large intestine . in humans over 5 years old , a small intestine may be five to six meters long . it is where most of the digestion and absorption happens . the small intestine has three regions â€“ the duodenum , jejunum and ileum . - the duodenum receives bile and juice from the pancreas . it is where most digestion takes place . secretions neutralise the stomach acidity , and enzymes digest the food . - the jejenum : the products of digestion ( sugars , amino acids , and fatty acids ) are absorbed into the bloodstream here . - the ileum : absorbs vitamin b12 and bile salts and any products of digestion which were not absorbed by the jejunum .
