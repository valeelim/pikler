Crushing by elephant     in the past , many rulers in south and southeast asia had people crushed by elephants as a death penalty . this was common for more than 4000 years . the romans and carthaginians also sometimes did this . the elephant would step upon the head of the condemned , the one commanded to die . usually , handlers trained the elephant to put its large foot gently on the person 's head . at this point , witnesses looked under the elephant 's foot to make sure the prisoner was the one who committed the crime . often , the condemned would scream and beg the witnesses to say it was not him . if a witness stated this was not the criminal , they would probably commit perjury . perjury means lying at a trial . in those days rulers could punish perjury with death . few witnesses denied the condemned was the criminal , because then the elephant may crush them instead . then the mahout , or elephant driver , gave the order , and the elephant would push down with its weight . the skull broke and the foot crushed the head flat .
