Concert     a concert ( as in a `` concert tour '' ) is a performance in which a musician or many musicians play music together to a group of listeners ( an audience ) . in the case of a concert of classical music there may be an orchestra . there is often an important visual element to the performance , such as with a rock concert . however , if acting out a story is an important part of the performance , then this is called `` theatre '' or `` opera '' but some concerts have dramatic , theatrical music , with lights and special effects . informal names for a concert include `` show '' or sometimes , `` gig '' for musicians who play in lots of different concerts , with different groups . a `` concert tour '' is a set of concerts where the performers travel to different cities or towns . the performers at a concert are usually raised above the level of the audience on a stage . concerts may be held in concert halls which are built for the purpose , or they may be held in any other suitable large building such as a school hall , a nightclub , a barn or a large house or castle . some concerts are given to very large audiences in the open air . they may take place in a field or in a stadium . the music for these “ open-airs ” is usually amplified by loudspeakers so that large audiences can hear it .
