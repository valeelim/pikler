Microscope     a microscope is a scientific instrument . it makes small objects look larger . this lets people see the small things . people who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include doctors and scientists . students in science classes such as biology or chemistry also use microscopes to study small things . the earliest microscopes had only one lens and are called `` simple microscopes '' . `` compound microscopes '' have at least two lenses . in a compound microscope , the lens closer to the eye is called the `` eyepiece '' . the lens at the other end is called the `` objective '' . the lenses multiply up , so a 10x eyepiece and a 40x objective together give 400x magnification . microscopes make things seem larger than they are , to about 1000 times larger . this is much stronger than a magnifying glass which works as a simple microscope . there are many different types of microscopes . the most common are compound light microscopes and electron microscopes . in a compound light microscope , the object is illuminated : light is thrown on it . the image formed by the object is looked at . light passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger .
