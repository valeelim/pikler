Refugee camp     when there is a war or some other armed conflict in a country , many people will try to flee ( run away ) from that country . they will go to other countries , around the country where there is no war . because they fled , they are called refugees . if there are just a few refugees coming into a country it is generally no problem to get housing for them somewhere . however , if there are many ( or if the government of a country expects many ) refugees , it may build what is called a refugee camp . this is usually done by putting many tents , and a few toilets and showers on an unused plot ( stretch ) of land . this is usually land where no one wants to live . usually the governments hope that conflicts get resolved soon , and that those camps are only temporary . this has not been the case for the refugee camps in the gaza strip , for example . those camps have existed since the mid 1970s . related pages . - tent city - burj el-barajneh refugee camp in the lebanon - transitional shelter - united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr )
