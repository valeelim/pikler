Cretaceous     the cretaceous period was the longest period in the phanerozoic eon , lasting 80 million years from 145 to 66 million years ago ( mya ) . it followed the jurassic period , and is the latest period of the mesozoic era . after it came the cainozoic era . though famous for its land fauna , the cretaceous sea level rose much higher than today . north america was partly covered by an epicontinental sea , and half of britain was under water . in the upper cretaceous , chalk , a type of limestone , was laid down in warm shallow seas . chalk is 95 % to 99 % made up of coccoliths , the calcium carbonate ( caco3 ) plates which tiny single-celled algae ( coccolithophorids ) produce . at its end came the famous meteorite strike which , with the volcanic flood basalts spewed out in the deccan ( india ) , ended so many of the dominant life-forms : see k/t extinction event . the cretaceous period has just two very long epochs : - upper cretaceous 100.5 million years ago ( mya ) to 66 mya - lower cretaceous 145.5 mya to 100.5 mya .
