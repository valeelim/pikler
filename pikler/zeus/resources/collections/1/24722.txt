Approximation     an approximation is a version of a piece of information that does not describe it exactly , but is close enough to be used . an approximation may be used either when the exact piece of information is not known , or when it 's too long or complicated and people need something simpler . for example , if you wanted to add 2.0002 and 2.0003 , you can add 2 and 2 , and it would be an approximation . if you are left with a balance of dollar 78.23 you might want to say you are left with 80 dollars . archimedes used polygons to approximate a circle , and to calculate an approximation for formula_1 as shown below :
