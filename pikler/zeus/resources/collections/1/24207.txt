Nickel     nickel ( chemical symbol ni ) is a chemical element . it has an atomic number of 28 and an atomic mass of about 58.69amu . it has 28 protons . it is a transition metal . nickel is a silver-white metal . it is a little golden colored . it is easily polished ( made shiny ) . it is magnetic . it is not magnetic when heated above . it is not soft like many other metals . it can be stretched into wires easily . it is not radioactive . nickel is not a reactive metal . it dissolves slowly in acids . it does not rust like iron . it makes a thin coating of nickel ( ii ) oxide which stops more corrosion . aluminium does a similar thing . nickel is found in two oxidation states : +2 , nickel ( ii ) ; and +3 , nickel ( iii ) . nickel ( ii ) is more common . nickel ( iii ) also is common . nickel in its +2 oxidation state is green . nickel ( ii ) chloride is a common +2 oxidation state compound . nickel ( ii ) oxide is normally dark green , but sometimes it is gray . this is because some of the nickel is in the +3 oxidation state ( nickel ( iii ) . nickel ( iii ) compounds are oxidizing agents . they also are grayish . nickel compounds can be green , blue , gray , or black .
