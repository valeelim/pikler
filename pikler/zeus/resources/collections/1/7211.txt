Bryophyte     bryophytes are simple plants ; they are the simplest plants that grow on land . there are three types of bryophyte . these are mosses , liverworts and hornworts . bryophyta is the traditional term for this division of non-vascular plants . in some modern classifications the term is restricted to the mosses . however , as the group shares some key features ( such as an alternation of generations with the haploid plant body dominating ) the term is still useful . the non-vascular plants are , in any event , related . it is thought that liverworts evolved from green algae . then other plants , including moss and hornworts , evolved from liverworts . a person who studies bryophytes is called a bryologist . the study of bryophytes is named bryology . like all land plants ( embryophytes ) , bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations . in a haploid gametophyte each cell has a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes . the green gametophyte gives rise to a diploid sporophyte , which is reddish . each of the gametophyte cells has twice the number of paired chromosomes .
