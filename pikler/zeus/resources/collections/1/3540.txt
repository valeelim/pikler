Phases of the Moon     the phases of the moon are the different ways the moon looks from earth over about a month . as the moon orbits around the earth , the half of the moon that faces the sun will be lit up . the different shapes of the lit portion of the moon that can be seen from earth are known as phases of the moon . each phase repeats itself every 29.5 days . the same half of the moon always faces the earth , so the phases will always occur over the same half of the moon 's surface . there are 8 phases that the moon goes through . - a `` new moon '' is when the moon can not be seen because we are looking at the unlit half of the moon . the `` new moon '' phase occurs when the moon is directly between the earth and sun . a solar eclipse can only happen at new moon . - a `` waxing crescent moon '' is when the moon looks like crescent and the crescent increases ( `` waxes '' ) in size from one day to the next . this phase usually is only seen in the west . - the `` first quarter moon '' ( or a `` half moon '' ) is when half of the lit portion of the moon is visible after the `` waxing crescent '' phase .
