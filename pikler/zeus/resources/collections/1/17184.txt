Skeleton     a skeleton is the hard structure that supports the body of a living thing . skeletons can be inside the body or outside the body . in mammals , which include humans , the skeleton is made of bones . all the bones , when they are joined together , make the `` skeletal system '' of a body . the skeletal system or `` skeleton '' is under the skin , the muscle and the tissue of the body . the skeleton supports the skin , muscle and tissue , and all the organs that are inside the body . the skeleton protects important internal organs like the brain , heart and lungs . if humans did not have a skeleton then the body would be flat as the skeleton gives the body its frame . - creatures that have skeletons inside their bodies are mammals , birds , reptiles and fish . a skeleton that is on the inside is called an endoskeleton . - some creatures , called arthropods , have skeletons outside their bodies . these are insects ( like ants and bees ) , arachnids ( spiders and scorpions ) , and crustaceans ( sea creatures like crabs and lobsters ) . these creatures all have skeletons made of hard plates or shells . this kind of skeleton is called an exoskeleton .
