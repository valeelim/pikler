Mule     a mule is a horse-donkey hybrid ( a mix of two different animals ) . it is the child of a female horse and a male donkey . they are used mostly for pulling carts and transportation . although it is extremely unlikely for a mule to become pregnant ( less than 300 reported cases worldwide ) , it is possible . they will tend to be cautious which may lead people to think that they are stubborn . they must know what they are walking on or what they are about to cross . they will be scared of anything that is not normal . as trucks with four-wheel drive have become common , mules are little used for transport except in places without roads . they are shown in show against horses or other mules . they are used in western riding and english riding , and really good for high-jumping .
