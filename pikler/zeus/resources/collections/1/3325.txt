States of matter     there are four common states of matter ( or `` phases '' ) in the universe : solid , liquid , gas , and plasma . the state of matter affects a substance 's properties , such as density , viscosity ( how well it flows ) , malleability ( how easy it is to bend ) , and conductivity . in a `` solid '' , the positions of atoms are fixed relative to each other over long time . that is due to the cohesion or `` friction '' between molecules . this cohesion is provided by metallic , covalent or ionic bonds . only solids can be pushed on by a force without changing shape , which means that they can be resistant to deformation . solids also tend to be strong enough to hold their own shape in a container . solids are generally denser than liquids . solid becoming a gas is sublimation . in a `` liquid '' , molecules are attracted to each other strongly enough to keep them in contact , but not strongly enough to hold a particular structure . the molecules can continually move with respect to each other . this means that liquids can flow smoothly , but not as smoothly as gases . liquids will tend to take the shape of a container that they are in . liquids are generally less dense than solids , but denser than gases .
