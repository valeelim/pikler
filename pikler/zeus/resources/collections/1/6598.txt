Karel Doorman     karel willem frederik marie doorman ( april 23 1889 - february 28 1942 ) was a dutch admiral ( dutch : `` schout-bij-nacht '' ) during world war ii . in 1942 he was made commander of the combined american , british , dutch and australian fleet in the dutch east indies . in february 1942 , he led his fleet against a much stronger japanese fleet in the java sea . this battle became a disaster for the allies . doorman became a hero in the netherlands , partly of his last words to the fleet : `` ik val aan , volg mij ! '' ( i am attacking , follow me ) . karel doorman died when his ship `` de ruyter '' ( named after the famous dutch admiral michiel de ruyter ) was hit by a torpedo and sank . there was enough time to escape , but doorman rather went under with his ship , according to old tradition .
