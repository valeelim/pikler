Sneeze     a sneeze is a reaction in the nose in which air and mucus ( the liquid found in the nose ) are forced out quickly . it often happens after breathing dust or other small things into the nose . when people sneeze , their eyes close . this is a natural reflex which keeps the eyes from being bulged by the great pressure of air which is being released through the sinus cavity ( the area the nostrils lead into ) . a common thing to say to people when they sneeze is `` bless you ! '' or in the united states sometimes `` gesundheit ! '' ( from german , meaning `` good health '' ) . there is a story that the blessing started with pope gregory vii ( 540â€“604 ad ) . he said a blessing might stop people from getting the bubonic plague which was killing people in rome at the time . when people sneeze the speed is about 150 kilometers per hour or more . there is a myth that when you sneeze your heart and all internal organs stop functioning .
