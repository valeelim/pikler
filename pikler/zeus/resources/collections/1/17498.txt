Egg (biology)    egg ( biology ) an egg results from fertilization of an ovum . the egg is a container for the zygote . it protects the zygote , and feeds the embryo . the animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own , at which point the egg hatches . most vertebrates , arthropods and molluscs lay eggs outside the mother 's body . they are always in some kind of container , a shell or covering . reptiles , birds and monotremes lay cleidoic eggs : bird eggs are an example . these are a special kind of egg with a good supply of food and water . they have an outside covering which lets through gases so that carbon dioxide can get out , and oxygen can get in . fish , amphibia , insects and arachnids lay simpler eggs in greater numbers , but with much less protection and nourishment . some animals , mostly mammals , keep the zygote inside their body where the embryo grows until it is ready to be born . these are also cleidoic eggs , but all the development is done inside the mother 's body , as with humans . most mammals , and a number of marine reptiles , give live birth . also , there are some invertebrates , such as scorpions , where the eggs develops inside the mother . they also give birth to live young .
