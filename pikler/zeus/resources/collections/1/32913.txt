Tolkāppiyam     tolkaapiyam ( தொல்காப்பியம் ) is a book on grammar of the tamil language . tol ( தொல் ) means old and kappiyam ( காப்பியம் ) means a literary work . the name of the author could not be identified ( usually referred as `` tholkappiyar '' ) and the work apparently relates to grammar in tamil . it is learnt that the author was one of the 12 disciples of sage agastya the father of tamil grammar . this sage was living in the south near madurai , during the visit of lord ram to the south in search of his wife , abducted by the lankan king ravan . the age of lord ram precedes that of lord krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 bc ( the ideal period of mahabharat yudh ) . lord shiva and his son murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the tamil language , probably long long time before sage agastya could compile the same .
