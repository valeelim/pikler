Bird flu     bird flu ( also called avian influenza , avian flu , bird influenza , or grippe of the birds ) , is an illness caused by a virus . the virus , called `` influenza a '' or `` type a '' , usually lives in birds , but sometimes infects mammals , including humans . it is called influenza when it infects humans . there are many types of influenza a , which was first found in a bird in italy in 1878. most types have weak symptoms , such as breathing problems , similar to the common cold . but some types kill birds , and a few kill humans and other mammals . one type of bird flu , called `` spanish flu '' , killed 50 to 100 million people in 1918/1920 . another type , called `` asian flu '' killed one million in 1957 , and another one , called `` hong kong flu '' , also killed one million people in 1968. a subtype , called `` h5n1 '' , killed six people in hong kong in 1997 , but did not kill again until 2003 , this time in china . until the middle of 2005 , it was primarily found in southeast asia but since then has spread to parts of africa and europe . it has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread . so far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans . the concern about h5n1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate and could create a human flu pandemic that could kill many millions of people . governments around the world are spending billions of dollars to deal with this problem : studying h5n1 , creating vaccines , conducting pandemic practice exercises , stockpiling useful flu medication , and many other important activities .
