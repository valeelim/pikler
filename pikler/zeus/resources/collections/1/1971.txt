Fold (geology)    fold ( geology ) the term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat , level surfaces , such as sedimentary strata , are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature . the basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics . when two forces act towards each other from opposite sides , rock layers are bent into `` folds '' . the process by which folds are formed due to compression is known as folding . folding is one of the endogenetic processes ; it takes place within the earth 's crust . folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds . they occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes , on a variety of scales . a set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a `` fold belt '' , a common feature of orogenic zones . there are large-scale and small-scale folds . large-scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates . the upfold is called an anticline . the downfold is called a syncline .
