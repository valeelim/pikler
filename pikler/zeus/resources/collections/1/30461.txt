Transposing instrument     a transposing instrument is a musical instrument that does not play the notes you might think it will play . but all the notes differ from the real notes by the same musical interval . so a song played on the transposing instrument will sound familiar , but played in a different key . that is because the transposing instrument is tuned above or below what the usual notes would be , and always above or below by the same number of notes on a scale . the usual notes are called `` concert pitch '' . most non-transposing instruments , like pianos , are tuned to play in the key of c. when writing music for a transposing instrument , or teaching how to play the notes , the entire series of notes is written and described as notes moved up or down a number of semitones . for example : playing the note that is called `` c '' on a b flat clarinet , produces the note that is called `` b♭ '' when played on a piano . all transposing instruments such as `` horn in f '' or `` alto saxophone in e♭ '' mean f and e♭ in normal notes ( `` concert pitch '' ) . the note `` c '' as written and played on the horn in f will sound like an `` f '' , and the same `` c '' written for the alto saxophone in e♭ will sound like `` e♭ '' .
