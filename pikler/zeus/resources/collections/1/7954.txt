Length     length is a property of a thing that can be measured . one of the methods of measurement is either using a ruler or a geometric square . we generally measure the length of small shapes but we have made a range of sizes so you can either have an 'easy to go ' degree of accuracy or an close to exact measurement in millimeters , or even more accurate ways of saying that length , the more longer the object seems the lesser the degree of accuracy we tend to measure it . the length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing . short means of small length . long means of much length . short and long are opposites . for two dimensional things , length is usually the longer side of measurement . measuring . - a line has one size measurement . this one measurement is the length . - a circle 's length is called its circumference . - a rectangle has two measurements that show its size . these two measurements are the length and the width of the rectangle . - the length and width of a square are the same .
