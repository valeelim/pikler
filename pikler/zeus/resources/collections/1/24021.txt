Order of the Bath     the most honourable order of the bath is a british order of chivalry . it was founded by george i , on 18 may 1725. the name comes from an old ceremony , first mentioned in 1128. in the ceremony , men participated in a vigil of fasting , prayer , and taking a bath . they did this on the day before they were made a knight . the ceremony was abolished in 1815. the order is made up of the sovereign ( the british sovereign ) , the great master ( charles , prince of wales ) , and three classes of members : ( highest to lowest ) - `` knight '' or `` dame grand cross '' ( gcb ) - knight or `` dame commander '' ( kcb or dcb ) - `` companion '' ( cb ) originally founded as a military order of chivalry , the star ( or pip ) is worn as army officers ' rank insignia . the insignia is that of the order of the bath . members of the order now belong to either the civil or the military division . the order 's motto is `` tria juncta in uno '' ( latin for `` three joined in one '' ) . this is a reference to either the union of england , scotland and ireland , or to the holy trinity . a symbol of the order that is seen over and over has three crowns in it . another motto , `` ich dien '' ( german for `` i serve '' ) is used occasionally , but only by members of the order who serve in the military .
