Contract     a contract is an agreement or promise that the law can enforce . the law will enforce some agreements but not others . for example , in most places , if a parent promises to take a child to get ice cream , the law will not enforce that promise as a legal contract . the legal rules about which promises are enforced by the law can be different in different places ( or jurisdictions ) , but a contract is usually enforced only if it is made by people or groups who want it to be enforced and who know what they are doing . sometimes , a contract is written down and signed by the people agreeing to it , but it does not always need to be . people usually sign a contract when something important or costly is being done . for example , when people take a job , they will sometimes sign a contract with their employers . the contract will show what the person must do as part of his job , how much they will be paid , and so on . the person and the employer will sign the contract , and it will become a legal promise .
