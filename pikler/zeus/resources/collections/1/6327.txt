Pythagorean theorem     in mathematics , the pythagorean theorem or pythagoras 's theorem is a statement about the sides of a right triangle . one of the angles of a right triangle is always equal to 90 degrees . this angle is the right angle . the two sides next to the right angle are called the legs and the other side is called the hypotenuse . the hypotenuse is the side opposite to the right angle , and it is always the longest side . the pythagorean theorem says that the area of a square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs . in this picture , the area of the blue square added to the area of the red square makes the area of the purple square . it was named after the greek mathematician pythagoras : if the lengths of the legs are `` a '' and `` b '' , and the length of the hypotenuse is `` c '' , then , formula_1 . there are many different proofs of this theorem . they fall into four categories : 1. those based on linear relations : the algebraic proofs . 1. those based upon comparison of areas : the geometric proofs .
