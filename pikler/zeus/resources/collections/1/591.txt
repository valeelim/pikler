Physics     physics is a branch of science . it studies matter , and all forces and their effects . modern physics connects ideas about the four laws of symmetry and conservation of energy , momentum , charge , and parity . the word `` physics '' comes from the greek word ἡ φύσις , meaning `` nature '' . physics can also be defined as `` that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature , or , in other words , to the regular succession of events '' . one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves . physics is a very old discipline because astronomy , a part of physics , is the oldest natural science . in the past it was a part of natural philosophy with other fields of science , such as chemistry and biology , but during the scientific revolution , these fields became separate , and physics became a distinct field of knowledge . physics is very important in the development of new technologies , such as airplanes , televisions , computers and nuclear weapons . mechanics , a branch of physics , helped develop the mathematical field of calculus .
