Ancient Greek language     ancient greek was the language spoken by the people of ancient greece from the 9th to 4th century b.c . ancient greek and latin are the most important extinct languages ( languages which are no longer spoken ) for speakers of english today . this is because the majority of english words come from greek and latin . the greek language had many different dialects , but the “ attic greek ” which was spoken by the people of athens is thought to be the purest of the forms . because the greeks became very powerful in the countries around the mediterranean sea their language spread very quickly . alexander the great even took it into asia . later , in the roman world , children were taught greek as a second language in the same way that many non-english speakers today learn english as their second language . they used a version called `` koine '' which mixed the attic dialect with several others . the great poems of the ancient greek poets like homer were written in greek . the poems of the `` iliad '' and the `` odyssey '' tell exciting stories about warfare , travel and the greek gods . in the 5th century b.c. , some great plays were written by aeschylus , sophocles and euripides . this was the `` golden age '' of ancient greece . these works of ancient greek literature inspired people for centuries and are still read today .
