Saint Peter     peter ( , `` rock '' ) also called simon ( kephas ) peter is one of the twelve apostles of jesus . he is often talked about in the new testament . most of what we know about peter comes from the bible . it is not known when peter was born . but the date of his death is about the year 64 c.e . he died by being nailed to a cross in rome . this type of death is called crucifixion . there is a legend that says that peter asked to be crucified upside down , as he felt unworthy to die as jesus did . most historical sources only say he was crucified . the roman catholic church , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , lutheran church and anglican communion , consider simon peter a saint . roman catholics believe that the pope is peter 's successor . for this reason , he is the rightful head of all other bishops . eastern and oriental orthodox also recognise the bishop of rome as the successor to saint peter and the ecumenical patriarch sends a delegation each year to rome to participate in the celebration of his feast . in the `` ravenna doumernt '' of 13 october 2007 the representatives of the eastern orthodox church agreed that `` rome , as the church that 'presides in love ' according to the phrase of st ignatius of antioch ( to the romans , prologue ) , occupied the first place in the `` taxis '' ( order ) , and that the bishop of rome was therefore the `` protos '' ( first ) among the patriarchs . they disagree , however , on the interpretation of historical evidence from this era regarding the rights of the bishop of rome as `` protos '' , a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium .
