Outback     the outback is the remote areas of australia . the outback is not a defined area , it is only a term used to refer to locations that are far away from big cities . the fertile parts are known as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle farming . agriculture , tourism and mining are the main economic activities in this vast and sparsely settled area . because of the expanses and remoteness in the outback a unique service , the flying doctor , was created in 1928. the aim of the service is to provide medical care to people who can not reach hospitals or other doctors . consultations are carried out via radio or telephone and for serious situations , doctors are flown out to the patients . organised travels with a guide to the outback is popular , although some australian and international tourists travel in their own cars . such a trip , especially off the few big roads in the outback , requires very good planning and a suitable vehicle ( usually four wheel drive ) . on remote routes considerable supplies and equipment are required . some big trips can not be undertaken safely without a convoy of several vehicles . deaths of tourists are a regular occurrences because many people are not well-prepared for their outback trip .
