Sea level     the sea level is the average height of the ocean ( informally called the `` sea '' ) . the word 'average ' must be used because the height of the sea changes with the tides . the height of mountains , countries , and so on , is almost always given as `` above sea level '' . sea level is generally used to refer to mean sea level ( msl ) . this is the an average level for the surface of one or more of earth 's oceans . msl is a type of standardised geodetic reference point . it is used , for example , as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation . in aviation it is the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured . this is used to calibrate altitude , which influences aircraft flight levels . a common mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular place . sea levels can be affected by many factors . they have varied greatly over geological time scales . the careful measurement of variations in msl offers insights into ongoing climate change . the present slight rise in sea levels is offered as proof of ongoing global warming .
