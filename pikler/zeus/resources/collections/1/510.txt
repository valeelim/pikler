Metaphor     metaphor is a term for a figure of speech . it does not use a word in its basic literal sense . instead , it uses a word in a kind of comparison . we run , and we also say rivers run . we may run into trouble , especially if we run up a bill at the bar . so a metaphor uses words to make a picture in our mind . it takes a word from its original context , and uses it in another . metaphors are an essential part of language : it is not possible to speak or write without them . a simple example is the word `` run '' . this has a basic meaning of `` moving quickly '' or `` go with quick steps on alternate feet , never having both feet on the ground at the same time '' . the `` concise oxford dictionary '' then gives 34 other uses as a verb ; 21 uses as a noun ; about 50 uses in short phrases . all of these are metaphors , although we do not usually notice this . we use metaphors to make `` indirect '' comparisons , but without using 'like ' or 'as ' â€“ because that would be a simile . a simile is a `` direct '' comparison : `` jane is like a child '' .
