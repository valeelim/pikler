Continent     a continent is a large area of the land on earth that is joined together . in general it is agreed there are seven continents in the world : africa , antarctica , asia , europe , north america , australasia or oceania , and south america . some sources say that australia is one of the seven continents . others say that australia is part of oceania . oceania is a region which includes australia , new zealand and the pacific islands . the third alternative is the term australasia , which includes at least all countries on the australian continental plate . this includes the islands of new guinea , tasmania , new zealand and a number of smaller islands . it is on the south-eastern side of the wallace line , with distinct differences in its biology from the asian side of the line . north america and south america are often described as `` the americas '' . this has the advantage of including central america and the caribbean islands . otherwise , central america is counted as part of north america . eurasia is not really an alternative , it is a recognition that the landmass of europe and asia are continuous , and some of its largest countries are in both continents . russia extends from eastern europe to the far east of asia without a break . the ural mountains , which run roughly north/south , are the traditional dividing-line between europe and asia . for many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent , eurasia .
