Franco-Prussian War     the franco-prussian war was a war between france and prussia . some german allies of prussia also joined . this war was 'designed ' by otto von bismarck , the prussian chancellor . he wanted to unite germans by making them fight together against a common enemy . bismarck did this by irritating the emperor of france , louis-napol√©on bonaparte ( napoleon iii ) . the war started when france declared war on 19 july 1870. it ended on 10 may 1871. prussia won this war . the causes of the franco-prussian war are mostly due to france being scared of a protestant country on their border . france had helped prussia beat austria in the austro-prussian war ( 1866 ) , but would not let the north german confederation and south german states unify . in 1869 , the throne of spain was offered to a prince of the catholic branch of the prussian hohenzollern royal family . france found out about the offer , and demanded that prussia reject it , since france did not want to be surrounded by hohenzollerns . the prince said no , but the french wanted prussia to say no also . the prussian king wilhelm i sent the ems telegram assuring the french emperor , napoleon iii , that the prince would not become king of spain . otto von bismarck , the chancellor of prussia , publicly released a version that he edited or doctored to make it seem that his king had insulted the emperor 's ambassador . this was part of his plan to unify the german states . the two sides exchanged angry words , france declared war , and on july 19 1870 the war started . prussia was fully supported by the south german states .
