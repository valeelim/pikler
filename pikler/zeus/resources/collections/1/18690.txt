Venus flytrap     the venus flytrap , `` dionaea muscipula '' , is a carnivorous plant ( a plant that feeds on small animals , such as insects ) . carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen . they get nitrogen from the insects they trap . the venus flytrap is one of a very small group of plants that can snap shut very quickly . when an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair , the trap closes `` only if a different hair is touched within twenty seconds of the first touch '' . the two-touch trigger means that little energy is wasted on things that are not food . the venus flytrap is a small plant , with small leaves . its clam-shaped leaves look rather like flowers , and so they attract insects . when they are open , they are red and smell sweet . they have stiff hairs on each edge . inside the leaves , there are very sensitive , tiny hairs which cause the leaves to snap shut when they are touched . two hairs must be touched to make the leaves close . this makes it more likely that the thing that touched its hair is living .
