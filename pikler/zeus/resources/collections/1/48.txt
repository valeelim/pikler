Astronomy     astronomy is a natural science . it is the study of everything outside the atmosphere of earth . it studies celestial objects ( such as stars , galaxies , planets , moons , asteroids , comets and nebulae ) and processes ( such as supernovae explosions , gamma ray bursts , and cosmic microwave background radiation ) . this includes the physics , chemistry of those objects and processes . a related subject , physical cosmology , is concerned with studying the universe as a whole , and the way the universe changed over time . the word astronomy comes from the greek words `` astron '' which means star and `` nomos '' which means law . a person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer . astronomy is one of the oldest sciences . ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate , and to find when was the best time to plant crops . astronomy is very similar to astrophysics . since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy , `` observational '' and `` theoretical '' astronomy . observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to `` observe '' or look at stars , galaxies and other astronomical objects . theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen . the two often work together , the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works .
