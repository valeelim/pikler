Shade     a place is called in the shade when the sun is shining , and some object , a tree for example , blocks the direct sunlight . so the sunlight can not reach the spot . the dark image , which the object casts on the ground ( or on another object ) is called shadow , not `` shade '' . shade can also mean a darker or lighter color of the same base color . for example : in a picture of a tree 's shadow , the grass in the shade will be a darker `` shade '' of green than the grass out of the shade .
