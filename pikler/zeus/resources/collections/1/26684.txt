Bronze     bronze is a metal alloy . bronze is mostly copper , with some tin added ( usually between 5 % and 20 % tin ) . bronze was the first alloy that was used by humans . the first nation that used bronze was egypt about 3500 years b.c . this gave the name for the bronze age . bronze is stronger than copper or tin alone . bronze lasts longer than copper . pure copper can be oxidized by air and also by water . when copper is oxidized by air or water , it turns green ( the color of `` copper oxide '' ) , and falls apart . when people learned how to make and work iron , the bronze age ended , and the iron age started . iron can be made harder than bronze , but is susceptible to corrosion ( see rust ) . iron also wears away faster than bronze , when different pieces are moving against each other . iron is very common , and easy to make . for this reason , iron costs less than bronze . this is the reason why iron is now used where bronze used to be used . bronze is still used to make many parts of machines . we use bronze when the part must last for a long time around water and air , or must not wear away . the main things that are made out of it are pump parts , bearings , bells , electrical components , gears , valves , and other things .
