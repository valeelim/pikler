Prejudice     prejudice means preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience . the word comes from the latin `` pre '' ( before ) and `` judge '' . it most often refers to an opinion about a person or group of people . the word `` prejudice '' is often used when people dislike another group of people that are different from them . they may decide they do not like them because of their skin color ( this is `` racial prejudice '' ) , religion ( religious prejudice ) or nationality . these are all serious prejudices which can lead to discrimination , hatred or even war . judges in a court of law should not be prejudiced when deciding whether someone is guilty . they should have an `` open mind '' so that they can make a fair decision . for example , if that person is the judge 's friend then the judge would be prejudiced because he ( or she ) would not want his ( or her ) friend to get into trouble . in many other situations it is important not to be prejudiced , such as serving as an adjudicator in a competition or a juror in a trial .
