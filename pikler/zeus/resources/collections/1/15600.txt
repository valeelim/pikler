Go     go is a board game , called `` i-go '' in japanese , `` wei-chi '' in chinese and `` baduk '' in korean . it is played on a board , with pieces of two colors ( black and white ) called stones . players take turns placing a stone of their color on intersections of the 19x19 square grid . a normal go board has 19 rows and columns of lines . sometimes go is played on smaller 9x9 or 13x13 boards instead of 19x19 . rules are simple , but they vary slightly . stones do not move after they are placed , but stones with no liberties ( access to empty space ) are captured and removed from the board . the goal of this game is to have more points when the game ends by placing pieces around the board to surround areas . you can place stones on any clear intersection you want , as long it is n't taken off right after , or the board looks the same all over as it did before . the second rule is called `` ko '' ( eternity ) and is one of the things that is often changed between rule sets . at the end of each game each player 's space ( territory ) , prisoners or stones ( depending on the rule set ) are counted to see who has more points .
