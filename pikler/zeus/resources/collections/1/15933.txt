Castle     a castle ( from the latin word `` castellum '' ) is a fortified structure made in europe and the middle east during the middle ages . people argue about what the word `` castle '' means . however , it usually means a private structure of a lord or noble . this is different from a fortress , which is not a home , and from a fortified town , which was a public defence . for about 900 years that castles were built they had many different shapes and different details . castles began in europe in the 9th and 10th centuries . they controlled the places surrounding them , and could both help in attacking and defending . weapons could be fired from castles , or people could be protected from enemies in castles . however , castles were also a symbol of power . they could be used to control the people and roads around it . many castles were built with earth and wood at first often using manual labour , and then had their defences replaced by stone instead . early castles often used nature for protection , and did not have towers . by the late 12th and early 13th centuries , though , castles became longer and more complex .
