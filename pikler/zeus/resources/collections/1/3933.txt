Thermometer     a thermometer is an instrument for measuring or showing temperature ( how hot or cold something is ) . one type of thermometer is a narrow , concealed glass tube containing mercury or alcohol which extends along the tube as it expands . another type is a digital thermometer , which uses electronics to measure temperature . early thermometers measured the expansion and contraction of air . after the middle 17th century many used alcohol or mercury . in the 19th century a mechanical thermometer was in invented that used a bimetallic strip to move a pointer . this kind is still popular where people like to read temperature from a distance . in the past , the traditional thermometer was a mercury-in-glass thermometer . people put the end of this in their mouth ( `` oral '' temperature ) , under their arm , or in their rectum ( `` rectal '' temperature ) . it is only possible to find oral temperatures on patients who can hold the thermometer correctly in their mouth . so small children can not use this method . it is also a problem for people with a cough or people who are vomiting . in the past it was a big problem because mercury thermometers needed a long time to measure the temperature . today 's digital thermometers are faster . if a person drinks something hot or cold , one needs to wait before testing their oral temperature .
