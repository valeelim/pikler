Writing     writing is the act of recording language on a visual medium using a set of symbols . the symbols must be known to others , so that the text may be read . a text may also use other visual systems , such as illustrations and decorations . these are not called writing , but may help the message work . usually , all educated people in a country use the same writing system to record the same language . to be able to read and write is to be literate . writing differs from speech because `` the readers need not be present at the time '' . we can read writing from long ago , and from different parts of the world . text stores and communicates knowledge . writing is one of the greatest inventions of the human species . it was invented after people settled in towns , and after agriculture started . writing dates from about 3,300 , which is over 5000 years ago , in the middle east . writing today is usually on paper , though there are ways to print on almost any surface . television and movie screens can also display writing , and so can computer screens . many writing materials were invented , long before paper . clay , papyrus , wood , slate and parchment ( prepared animal skins ) have all been used . the romans wrote on waxed tablets with a pointed stylus ; this was popular for temporary notes and messages . the later invention of paper by the chinese was a big step forward .
