Communism     communism is an ideological and a social political movement . its aim is to set up a communist society . this society would be based on the common ownership of the means of production and would have no social classes , money , or state . no large society has ever achieved this . according to communist writers and thinkers , the goal of communism is to create a classless society . communist thinkers believe this can happen if the people take away the power of the bourgeoisie ( the ruling class , who own the means of production ) and create a dictatorship of the proletariat ( the working class ) . communism is not anti-individualist . however , it does say that decisions should be good for the population as a whole , instead of just being good for one or two people . in 1848 , karl marx and friedrich engels wrote `` the communist manifesto '' . it was a short book with the basic ideas of communism . most socialists and communists today still use this book to help them understand politics and economics . many non-communists read it too , even if they do not agree with everything in it .
