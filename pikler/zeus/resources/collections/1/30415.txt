Chamber music     chamber music means music written for small groups of instruments . a “ chamber ” is a “ room ” ( from the french word “ chambre ” ) . usually the word “ chamber ” in english means a room in a large house or castle . in the days when people with big houses or castles kept their own musicians , they might have their own private orchestra which played in the large hall . sometimes there would be a concert in a small chamber . this was called “ chamber music ” . chamber music can be any group of instruments from two up to about eight or nine . each player will be playing something different from the others ( “ one to a part ” ) . compare that to an orchestra where there may be , for example , several violins all playing the same notes . the word “ chamber ” is also used for a “ chamber orchestra ” meaning : a small orchestra . by contrast : a large orchestra is often called a “ symphony orchestra ” . a small choir may be called a “ chamber choir ” . but these examples are not usually thought of as “ chamber music ” . these words are used to show how many people are playing . they can also be used for groups of singers ( vocal solo , duet etc . ) :
