American Revolutionary War     the american revolutionary war was a war fought between great britain and the original 13 british colonies in north america . the war took place from 1775 to 1783. the continental army ( army of the colonies ) , led by george washington , defeated the armies of the british empire . after the war ended , the thirteen colonies became independent , which meant that the british empire was no longer in charge of them . they together became the first 13 states of a new country called the united states of america . the war started after years of problems between the british empire and the colonists of north america after the french and indian war . people in the thirteen colonies disliked many of the actions of the british government . for many years the british government decided which countries could trade with the colonies , instead of the colonies deciding it themselves . many colonists wanted free trade . in 1765 , the british parliament needed money for the french and indian war , and passed a law called the stamp act . this law said that colonists had to buy stamps for legal papers , newspapers , and even playing cards , as other british people did . the money from the stamps went to the king . the colonies did not follow this law . the colonies kept refusing to do what the king wanted . the boston tea party and boston massacre caused people to become more angry about the situation . the british sent more soldiers ( red coats ) to keep control of the colonies and they sometimes had to fight . in 1774 , the british passed the intolerable acts .
