Electrical conductivity     electrical conductivity is the measure of a material 's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge . its si is the `` siemens per meter '' , ( asmkg ) ( named after werner von siemens ) or , more simply , sm . it is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength . it is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test . - the symbol for electrical conductivity is κ ( kappa ) , and also σ ( sigma ) or γ ( gamma ) . electrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge ( such as electrons ) , which can carry electricity . when a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor , its electrons flow , and an electric current appears . a conductor such as a metal has high conductivity , and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity . a semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions .
