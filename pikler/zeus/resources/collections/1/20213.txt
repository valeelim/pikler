Manganese     manganese is chemical element 25 on the periodic table . its symbol is mn . ( some people get it confused with magnesium , the symbol is mg ) . it has 25 protons . its mass number is 54.94. manganese is a silvery-gray metal and is part of the group known as the transition metals . it is similar to iron . it is hard to melt , but easy to oxidize . manganese forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states : +2 , +4 , and +7 are the most common . manganese compounds can be black , brown , pink , red , green , blue , and purple . manganese ( ii ) compounds are pink or light brown . they are unreactive . manganese ( ii ) chloride is a common example . manganese ( iii ) compounds are weak oxidizing agents . manganese ( iv ) compounds are stronger oxidizing agents , but they are rarer . they are normally black in colour . manganese ( iv ) oxide is an example . manganese ( v ) compounds are not stable and disproportionate easily . they are bright blue . they are very rare . hypomanganates are the most common manganese ( v ) compounds . manganese ( vi ) compounds are made in the process used to make permanganates . they disproportionate too . manganates are weak reducing agents and moderate oxidizing agents . they are bright green .
