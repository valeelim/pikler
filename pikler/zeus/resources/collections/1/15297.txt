Starfish     starfish , or sea stars , are echinoderms of the class asteroidea . all live in the ocean , on the sea floor . some live in deep water , others in shallow water . some live in the intertidal zone , between low and high tide . they have five or more arms and can be quite large . the sunflower sea star ( `` pycnopodia helianthoides '' ) is the largest : fully grown , its arm-span is about a metre . this is a bit larger than the famous crown-of-thorns starfish , which lives on coral polyps . although starfish are invertebrates , they do have a kind of skeleton . the bodies of starfish are composed of calcium carbonate plates , known as 'ossicles ' . these form the endoskeleton , which takes on a variety of forms such as spines and granules . they have a primitive nervous system , but not a brain . they also do not have blood , instead they use sea water to pump things around their bodies . there are over 1500 different species of sea star . most sea stars are predators . they eat mussels , clams , and other bivalves . occasionally , they catch small fish .
