Hail     a piece of hail ( called a hailstone ) is a lump of ice that falls out of a storm cloud . about 5,000 hailstorms a year in the united states of america make hail 3/4 of an inch or bigger . a hailstone begins as a small water drop or a round snow pellet in a cloud . the drop grows by collecting many cloud drops . the little drop is blown by a strong wind inside the cloud to where it meets with some extremely cold water drops . these supercooled drops are still liquid water even though the temperature is below freezing . when the little drop mixes with these extremely cold drops , they join , and the little drop has now become a hailstone . the little hailstone is thrown up inside the cloud , still collecting other cold drops . the hailstone gets bigger and bigger until it goes to the top of the cloud . then , because there is no more wind , it falls back down through the cloud . while it is falling it gets even bigger as it bangs into more supercooled drops . if it goes down very fast it can hit the earth at up to 90 mph ( 144 kph ) , bouncing like popcorn . if the hailstone hits dirt , it can actually bury itself .
