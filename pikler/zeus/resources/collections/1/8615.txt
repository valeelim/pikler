Amazon River     the amazon river ( also named `` rio amazonas '' in portuguese and spanish ) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries . it flows through the tropical forests of south america , mainly in brazil . its headwaters are in the andes mountains in peru , on the western edge of south america and flows eastward into the atlantic ocean near the equator . the amazon moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world . it accounts for about one fifth of the world 's total river flow . during the wet season , parts of the amazon exceed in width . because of its size , it is sometimes called `` the sea '' . it is not the world 's `` longest '' river system . the world 's longest river is the nile river , with the amazon being second-longest . it is one of the longest rivers in the world . there have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length . as the studies have come up with different numbers , it is therefore difficult to give an exact number . the length also changes in the rainy season . several studies from brazil , spain and chile say it is the longest river in the world , longer than the nile . the nile has a length of 6,571 km . the amazon may have a length of 6,937 kilometres . the spanish daily newspaper el pa√≠s gives its length at 6.850 kilometres . in 2007 , scientists from peru and brazil calculated a length of 6,800 km .
