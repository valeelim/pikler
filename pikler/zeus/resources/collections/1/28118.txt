Inbreeding     inbreeding is a term in genetics , meaning the crossing ( mating ) of closely related animals or plants . self-fertilisation in plants is the most extreme kind of inbreeding . it is quite widespread in plants which carry both male and female flowers on the same plant . inbreeding is the opposite of outcrossing , which is the mating of unrelated members of the same species . other terms are inbred strain , a group of organisms so inbred that they have little or no genetic variation , and inbreeding depression , which is the decreased fitness ( usually lack of fertility and early illness and death ) brought about by inbreeding . for human beings , inbreeding is a very destructive trait , and almost all cultures in the world have attempted to restrict inbreeding e.g . by prohibiting marriages between first cousins . the ultimate form of inbreeding is called incest . it is mating with blood relatives within the nuclear family . loss of genetic variation means that many gene loci that were heterozygous are now homozygous . the result of both genes at a locus being mutant can be serious .
