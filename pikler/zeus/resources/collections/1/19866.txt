Hydrogen peroxide     hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound . its molecular formula is ho . it is used as a cleaner , and as hair bleach . in a concentration of 3 % ( meaning that there are 3 grams of hydrogen peroxide for 100 grams of a water solution ) , it can be used to treat wounds . over time it will slowly become oxygen gas and water through decomposition . chemists often use hydrogen peroxide in chemical reactions . it is a very strong oxidising agent when used with acid and water . `` oxidising agents '' take electrons from other compounds . here hydrogen peroxide takes an electron from the fe2+ ions and becomes water . it can also be a reducing agent when used with other compounds . when it acts as a reducing agent , oxygen gas is also produced . `` reducing agents '' give electrons to other compounds . this method is often used to make oxygen in laboratories . hydrogen peroxide can be bought in shops when mixed with lots of water but is very dangerous when the concentration is higher . it is flammable and causes burns .
