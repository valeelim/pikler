Chemical compound     a chemical compound is a chemical formed from atoms of different chemical elements . the different atoms are joined by chemical bonds . the elements stick together so strongly that the compound behaves like one substance . the chemical that is made depends upon what atoms it is made of and how they are joined together . chemical compounds can be liquids , like water which is made from atoms of hydrogen and oxygen joining together . they can also be solids , like sodium chloride that contains sodium and chlorine atoms . we get compounds from natural sources such as plants or make them in laboratories . compounds can be made from others by scientists and these are called `` synthetic chemicals '' . when different compounds are mixed together they can have a chemical reaction . the compounds may join together to make one compound or change into several new compounds . chemists are people who study compounds and find new ways to do chemical reactions . they make chemicals in order to find new ways to do things , like to make a better glue , or to make new medicines , or to make things clean , for example . they also use compounds to find out more about the laws of chemistry .
