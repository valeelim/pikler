Graffiti     graffiti is marks , scratchings or drawings made on a surface on a public place . it is often created with paint or spray paint ( paint that is sprayed from a can ) . a single mark could be called a graffito but the word graffiti is usually used , meaning that there is more than 1 mark . graffiti can take the form of art , drawings or words . when done without a property owner 's permission it is considered vandalism . sometimes it is just a person 's name or a rude word . sometimes it is as a public political protest . graffiti has been found in very old cities . for example , in the roman empire , people wrote messages and drew caricatures on walls . graffiti is also found in many places . some of people do murals of graffiti rather than just writing one mark in a location . it was used for good instead of vandalism . probably the simplest graffiti is when a person cuts ( or carves ) the name of a lover on a tree with a knife . today , many graffiti are very complicated mixtures of writing and pictures . they are sometimes made by gangs and applied with spray-paint to buildings , bridges , street signs , and other areas . these are often signed with a `` tag '' ( in graffiti slang , a signature ) , which is a shape special to an artist or group .
