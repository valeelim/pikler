Urethra     the urethra is a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body . it allows people and animals to remove urine from the body . people and animals control urination using the urethral sphincter . the urethra is part of the urinary system in mammals . because humans are mammals , they have urethras . in male mammals , the urethra is also a part of the reproductive system , because males use it as a tube for sperm during sex . in human anatomy , men have longer urethras than women . this means that women have bladder infections more often , because their bladders are closer to the outside . because the male urethra is longer and is not straight , inserting a catheter ( tube to help urination ) is more difficult in men . in women , the urethra is 2.5-4 cm ( 1-1.5 in ) long . its opening to the outside of the body is part of the vulva ( the area between a woman 's legs ) . the female urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina . in men , the urethra is about 20 cm ( 8 in ) long and its opening to the outside of the body is at the end of the penis .
