Alkali metal     alkali metals are the chemical elements in group one of the periodic system . they are silver-coloured when pure , soft and have only one valence electron . they like to make reactions in which they give up this single electron and then have a charge of +1 . they react strongly with water and because of this , they have to be stored in petrol . alkali metals are the first group in the periodic table . they are never found in nature uncombined because they are unstable and they react fast to other elements . they bond well with all elements except the noble gases . when they are in air , they quickly turn black . the alkali metals are lithium ( li ) , sodium ( na ) , potassium ( k ) , rubidium ( rb ) , caesium ( sometimes written `` cesium '' , although `` caesium '' is preferred ) ( cs ) , and francium ( fr ) . lithium is the least reactive . although it was thought before that francium would be the most reactive , although it is very rare , it was more recently predicted that caesium is in fact more reactive than francium due to relativity .
