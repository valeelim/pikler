Comet     a comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space . comets are often described as `` dirty snowballs '' . they are very different from asteroids . the orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found . most of them are long-period comets and come from the kuiper belt . that is very far away from the sun , but some of them also come near enough to earth for us to see at night . they have long `` tails '' , because the sun melts the ice . a comet 's tail does not trail behind it , but points directly away from the sun , because it is blown by the solar wind . the hard centre of the comet is the `` nucleus '' . it is one of the blackest things ( lowest albedo ) in the solar system . when light shone on the nucleus of halley 's comet , the comet reflected only 4 % of the light back to us . `` periodic '' comets visit again and again . `` non-periodic '' or `` single-apparition '' comets visit only once . comets sometimes break up , as comet biela did in the 19th century . comet shoemaker-levy 9 broke up , and the pieces hit jupiter in 1994. some comets orbit ( go around ) together in groups . astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object .
