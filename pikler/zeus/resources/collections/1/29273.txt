Pulley     a pulley is a simple machine that is used to lift heavy objects . it is sometimes called a block and tackle . pulleys are usually used in sets designed to make the amount of force needed to lift something smaller . types of pulleys . - static a `` static '' or `` class 1 '' pulley has an axle that is `` staticed '' or is stationary , meaning that it can not be moved . a fixed pulley is used to redirect the force in a rope ( called a belt when it goes in a full circle ) . a fixed pulley has a mechanical advantage of 1. the static pulley has a wheel and an axle . - movable a `` movable '' or `` class 2 '' pulley has an axle that is `` free '' to move in space . a movable pulley is used to transform forces . a movable pulley has a mechanical advantage of 2. that is , if one end of the rope is anchored , pulling on the other end of the rope will apply a doubled force to the object attached to the pulley . - compound a `` compound pulley '' is a combination fixed and movable pulley system . - block and tackle - a `` block and tackle '' is a compound pulley where several pulleys are mounted on each axle , further increasing the mechanical advantage . plutarch reported that archimedes moved an entire warship , laden with men , using compound pulleys and his own strength .
