Programming language     a programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do in order to work . programming languages are used to make all the computer programs and computer software . a programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something . a programmer writes source code text in the programming language to create programs . usually the programming language uses real words for some of the commands , so that the language is easier for a human to read . many programming languages use punctuation just like a normal language . many programs now are `` compiled '' . this means that the computer translates the source code into another language ( such as assembly language or machine language ) , which is much faster and easier for the computer to read , but much harder for a person to read . computer programs must be written very carefully . if the programmer makes mistakes , or the program tries to do something the programmer did not design it to do , the program might then `` crash '' or stop working . when a program has a problem because of how the code was written , this is called a `` bug '' . a very small mistake can cause a very big problem . .
