( see below ) wildebeest can live for more than 20 years . like other members of the same family ( antelopes , deer and goats , amongst others ) , they mainly eat grass ( scientists call such animals `` herbivores '' , which means : `` eating grass '' ) . but since in the african grasslands , there is not always grass , wildebeest are forced to wander ( scientists speak about `` migrations '' ) to find food all year round . in may , about 1.5 million animals move from the grasslands to the woods . in november they move back ; there is grass in the plains in summer .
