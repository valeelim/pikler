E Prime     e prime ( it means english prime ) is a way of speaking english without using the verb `` to be '' in any way ( `` be , is , am , are , was , were , been , and being '' ) . instead , an e prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like `` to become , '' `` to remain , '' and `` to equal '' or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the `` thing '' does not actually `` act '' . for example , in e prime , a writer would change the statement `` mistakes were made '' to `` joe made mistakes . '' this change in wording reveals an actor ( joe ) where the previous form concealed the actor . users of e prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate . d. david bourland , jr. first suggested e prime in 1965. bourland had studied the discipline ( way of thinking ) of general semantics . the main idea of general semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see , hear , touch , taste , smell , think , and feel , and furthermore , that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future . because each person has different experiences throughout their lives , they interpret their experiences differently .
