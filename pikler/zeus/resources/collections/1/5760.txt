Microprocessor     a microprocessor is an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work . it is a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit chip containing millions of very small components including transistors , resistors , and diodes that work together . microprocessors help to do everything from writing to searching the web . everything a computer does is described by lots of precise instructions , and microprocessors carry out these instructions at incredible speedâ€”many millions of times a second . microprocessors were invented in the 1970s for use in embedded systems . the majority are still used that way , in such things as mobile phones , cars , military weapons , and home appliances . some microprocessors are microcontrollers , so small and inexpensive that they are used to control very simple products like flashlights and greeting cards that play music when you open them . a few especially powerful microprocessors are used in personal computers . like other central processing units , microprocessors use three steps commonly called fetch , decode , and execute . in the fetch step , an instruction is copied from the computer memory into the microprocessor . in the decode step , the microprocessor figures out what operation the instruction is meant to do . in the execute step , this operation is performed .
