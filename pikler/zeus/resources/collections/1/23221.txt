J. M. W. Turner     joseph mallord william turner ( covent garden , london , 23 april 1775 â€“ chelsea , london , 19 december 1851 ) was an english painter and artist . he was one of the greatest artists of landscape painting , with a great mastery of light and colour . his father was a maker of wigs . his mother was ill with mental problems , and the young turner was sent to live with his uncle in brentford , where he first started to paint . turner became a student at the royal academy of art school in london when he was 14 years old . he was accepted into the academy a year later . he had a watercolour painting in 1790 in the academy 's important art show . he had only been studying for a year . in 1802 , at the age of only 28 , he was elected a member of the royal academy , and later became its professor of perspective . in 1802 , turner travelled around europe , visiting france and switzerland . he also went to the louvre in paris . during his life , he often travelled across europe , visiting venice in italy several times . as his personal style developed , he began to produce paintings that were generalised or exaggerated in form and colour , rather than realistic or detailed . these caused much argument as to their artistic value , but nowadays are his best loved works . on his death , he left 300 oils and 20,000 watercolours to the british nation . some of his watercolours are the most abstract or generalised of his paintings .
