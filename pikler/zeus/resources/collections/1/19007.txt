Pituitary gland     the pituitary gland ( or `` hypophysis '' ) is an important part of the endocrine system . it is at the base of the brain between the eyes . the pituitary is attached to the hypothalamus , which is also a gland . the pituitary controls a whole range of vital functions by secreting hormones . the pituitary gland consists of two parts : the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary . it is functionally linked to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk ( also called the `` infundibulum '' ) . the hypothalamus releases factors down the pituitary stalk to the pituitary gland where they cause the release of pituitary hormones . although the pituitary gland is known as the 'master ' endocrine gland , both of the lobes are under the control of the hypothalamus . endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory hormones released by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus . the gland releases several kinds of hormones . the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by neurosecretion from the hypothalamus . the anterior pituitary cells synthesizes and secretes these important endocrine hormones :
