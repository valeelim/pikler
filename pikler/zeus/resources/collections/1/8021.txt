Artificial     when something is artificial ( or man-made ) , it has been made by humans , not nature . for example , an artificial satellite is one made by humans , while a natural satellite is a satellite that was not made by humans . many artificial things imitate or copy things found in nature . the imitation may use the same basic materials as those in the natural object ; or it may use quite different materials . these are concepts in defining reality . there are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural . the word `` artificial '' comes from the latin words `` art '' ( meaning `` skill '' ) and `` fex '' ( `` to make '' ) . artificial does not necessarily mean `` synthetic '' ( that is , created by synthesis ) . an artificial sweetener imitates sweetness using a chemical formula that is not found in nature ; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic . related pages . - artifact ( disambiguation ) - ontology
