Giro d'Italia     the giro d'italia , or tour of italy , is a famous bicycle race held in italy , every spring . it is one of the most famous , and best paid bicycle races . the first race was in 1909. it started because the editor of a newspaper called `` la gazzetta dello sport '' wanted more people to read his newspaper . he planned a race similar to the tour de france , which had started in 1903. the leader of the race wears a pink jersey called the `` maglia rosa '' . this is because pink is the colour of `` la gazzetta dello sport '' . for many years , the leader of the mountain climbing competition wore a green jersey ( called the `` maglia verde '' ) , but a change in the sponsor for that competition led to a jersey change in 2012. the mountains leader now wears a blue jersey ( called the `` maglia azzurra '' ) . similarly , the leader of the sprinters ' competition wore a mauve jersey ( called the `` maglia ciclamino '' ) for many years . however , a sponsorship change in 2010 also led to a jersey change . the sprints leader now wears a red jersey ( called `` maglia rosso passione '' ) . the leader of the young riders ' competition , for riders under age 25 , wears a white jersey ( called the `` maglia bianca '' ) . this is the same as the young riders ' competition in the tour de france .
