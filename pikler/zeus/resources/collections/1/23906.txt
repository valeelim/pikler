Treaty of Versailles     the treaty of versailles ( ) was a peace treaty between the nations , japan , the united states , france , austria-hungary , germany and britain after world war i. the treaty was made in 1919. germany , austria and hungary did not participate writing it . germany had the choice between signing it or facing the occupation of germany by allied troops . this was known as a diktat frieden . this angered the german people as they believed that they did not start the war . the french made the treaty hard for the germans so that germany would not be able to start a new war . thus , germany had to reduce its armed forces from 6 million to 100,000 men , and get rid of its submarines , military aircraft and most of their artillery . their navy battleships were limited to only six small ones . germany also had to give back french territories it had occupied , as well as large territories of its own to poland , for instance , and all of its colonies . a heavy economical burden for germany was to pay back the very big world war i reparations for the damage done to allied countries , mostly france , during world war i by german troops . this sum was not fixed . 132 billion gold marks had to be paid only as a first part of the german debt .
