Siren     a siren is a creature in greek mythology . the sirens were living on an island surrounded by rocks . sailors would try to go to them because of their singing , and their ships would get destroyed on the rocks , and they would drown . originally they looked like bird-women , but in modern time they are often shown to look like fish-women or mermaids . many people said they were naiads ( spirits of the sea ) . they also appear in homer 's `` odyssey '' . there odysseus and his ship have to pass the siren 's island . odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears , so they will not hear the song of the sirens . he also tells his men to bind him to the ship 's mast , so he can not go to the sirens when he hears their song . when odysseus and his men pass the sirens , odysseus wants to go towards them , but his men pull the rope tighter to hold him down . his men can then look at odysseus and see when he can not hear the sirens anymore , because he is calm again . then they can take the wax out of their ears , and free odysseus .
