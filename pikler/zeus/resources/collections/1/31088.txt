Slug     slug is a general term for a gastropod mollusc which has no shell , or just a small internal shell . slugs belong to several different families which also include snails with shells . snails are gastropods with a coiled shell large enough for the animal to pull back inside . the families of land slugs are not very closely related , despite looking similar . the shell-less slug type is an example of convergent evolution , and so the category `` slug '' is not a taxonomic category . the name `` slug '' is used for air-breathing land slugs , while the marine forms are usually known as sea slugs . land gastropods with a shell that is too small to hide the body are sometimes called `` semislugs '' . like land snails , most slugs have four 'feelers ' or `` tentacles '' on their head . the upper two ( the `` optical tentacles '' ) see light and have eyespots at the ends , while the lower two ( the `` sensory tentacles '' ) are used for smelling . the tentacles are retractable , and can regrow if lost . on top of the slug , behind the head , is a body part called the `` mantle , '' and under this are the genital opening and anus . on one side ( almost always the right side ) of the mantle is a breathing hole , which is easy to see when open , but difficult to see when closed . inside the mantle in some species is a very small , flat shell .
