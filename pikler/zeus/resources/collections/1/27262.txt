Non-governmental organization     a non-governmental organization ( ngo ) is a group of people from different countries acting together , but not connected with the government of any country . usually non-governmental organizations are non-profit - that is , they are trying to do something other than make money for the people who run them . they include organisations such as 'oxfam ' and 'world vision ' . non-governmental organization ( ngo ) is a term that has become widely accepted as referring to a legally constituted , non-governmental organization created by natural or legal persons with no participation or representation of any government . in the cases in which ngos are funded totally or partially by governments , the ngo maintains its non-governmental status and excludes government representatives from membership in the organization . government funding of ngos is controversial , since , according david rieff , writing in `` the new republic '' , `` the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that ngos and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them , whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter .
