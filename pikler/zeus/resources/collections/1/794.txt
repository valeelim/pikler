Server     `` a server is also a person who serves , like a waiter at a restaurant or in a hotel '' in net jargon , a server is a computer that serves many kinds of information to user or client machines . usually a server will only do a few things for many clients . every type of thing a server does is called a service . services are used by other computers that are called clients . the relationship between client and server is called a client-server relationship . for example , wikipedia has web servers which have a service for sending web pages over the internet . your client computer talks to wikipedia 's web page service to get web pages for you . a server can also host internet games , share files , and give access to peripheral equipment such as printers . in simple words , the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers . these store files and information in the form of website . with an internet connection , different users anywhere in the world can access these files . so that servers and clients can talk to each other , they need to be connected to a network , and they need to use the same protocol . in networks , a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines . it is just like a language . for example , the wikipedia server runs the http to send web sites to your computer , and your computer uses the http protocol to ask wikipedia for pages .
