Duck     ducks are birds in the family `` anatidae '' . ducks are closely related to swans and geese , which are in the same family . the main difference is that ducks have shorter necks , and are smaller . other swimming and diving birds , like grebes and loons , are sometimes called ducks , but they are not . a baby duck is called a `` duckling '' , and a male duck is called a `` drake '' . most ducks are aquatic birds . they can be found in both saltwater and fresh water . ducks lay eggs once a year and are omnivorous , eating aquatic plants and tiny animals . dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land , or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging . along the edge of the beak there is a comb-like structure called a `` pecten '' . this strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food . the pecten is also used to preen feathers . diving ducks dive deep to get their food . many ducks are migratory . this means that they spend the summer months in a different place than the winter months . ducks show a cosmopolitan distribution , they can be found all over the world , except for antarctica . some duck species live on the south georgia and auckland islands , which are subantarctic . many species have established themselves on remote islands , such as kerguelen or hawaii .
