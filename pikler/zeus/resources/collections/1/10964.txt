Richard I of England     richard i of england ( 8 september 1157 â€“ 6 april 1199 ) was the king of england from 1189 to 1199. he is sometimes called richard the lionheart . richard was the son of henry ii of england and eleanor of aquitaine . as the third son and not expected to inherit the throne , he was a replacement child.in 1168 he became duke of aquitaine . richard was one of the leaders of the third crusade against saladin , which never actually succeeded . during his journey , he conquered sicily and cyprus . he fought in the battle of acre and the battle of arsuf . in the end , as he was unable to win back jerusalem from the muslims , he decided to return back home to england . on his way back from the crusade , richard was captured by the germans and the english people had to pay a huge ransom to set him free . he was considered a very brave and noble king , but he did not spend a lot of time in england - only six months of his eleven year reign were spent in his country . he died after being shot with a crossbow during a siege on a castle . his remains were buried at different places . his body was buried at fontevraud abbey near saumur in france , as are his father and mother . his internal organs were buried at chalus , near limoges in central france . his heart was buried in the notre dame cathedral at rouen . it was found in 1838 and was examined by scientists in 2012. they did tests for poisons , as one medieval story claimed richard had died from a poisoned arrow . there is no evidence to support this idea , and he probably died from gangrene or septicaemia from the arrow wound .
