Euclid     euclid of alexandria ( greek : ) ( about 325 bcâ€“265 bc ) was a greek mathematician who lived in alexandria , egypt and worked at the library of alexandria . little is known about this person , but people think he lived there when ptolemy i was pharaoh . it is not known where or when he was born . euclid collected together all that was known of geometry , which is part of mathematics . his `` elements '' is the main source of ancient geometry . textbooks based on euclid have been used up to the present day . in the book , he starts out from a small set of axioms ( that is , a group of things that everyone thinks are true ) . euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers , based on those axioms . the `` elements '' also includes works on perspective , conic sections , spherical geometry , and possibly quadric surfaces . apart from geometry , the work also includes number theory . euclid came up with the idea of `` greatest common divisors '' . they were in his `` elements '' . the greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers .
