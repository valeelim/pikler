Extinction     extinction is one of the major features of evolution . a species is extinct when no members of the species are still alive . all species become extinct sooner or later . the end of a species may happen for many reasons . it may be caused by habitat loss or by being overhunted , or by a major extinction event . an example of an animal that is now extinct is the dodo , from over-hunting . another quite different way for a species to end is by species-splitting , known as cladogenesis . probably , none of the species living today was living in the cambrian period , but their ancestors were . endangered species are those which may become extinct . a report from kew gardens suggests that one fifth of plant species may be at risk of extinction . fossil species sometimes reappear millions of years after they were thought to be extinct . these cases are called lazarus taxa . the average duration of species varies according to the groups studied . a study of benthic ( deep water ) foraminifera showed an average of 16 million years if they lived above 200 metres , but 25my if they lived below 200 metres . on the other hand , the average survival time for mammalian species over the past 20my has been 2.33my .
