Archaeopteryx     archaeopteryx is one of the most important fossils ever discovered . it is a bird from the upper jurassic , about 150 million years ago . it shows the evolutionary link between theropod dinosaurs and birds . the first `` archaeopteryx '' was found in 1860 near solnhofen in bavaria , germany . today , ten skeletons and one feather of `` archaeopteryx '' have been found . `` archaeopteryx '' looked like a small carnivorous dinosaur with wings and feathers . it had a mouth with teeth , claws on the hands and a long tail . today , it is known that dromaeosaurs , and possibly most theropods , looked like birds and that many had feathers . when they are born , today 's south american hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young , just like `` archaeopteryx '' . thomas henry huxley ( `` darwin 's bulldog '' ) , who was a comparative anatomist , made a study of this nearly 150 years ago . he compared `` archaeopteryx '' with a small theropod dinosaur , `` compsognathus '' . these two fossils came from the same place : solnhofen in bavaria , germany . the strata come from the end of the jurassic period , about 144 million years ago . he showed that the two were very similar , except for the front limbs and feathers of `` archaeopteryx '' .
