Wicca     wicca is a neo-pagan ( meaning `` new pagan '' ) religion that was created by a british man named gerald gardner in the mid-to-late 1940s . gardner popularized the new religion via books of his that were published in 1949 , 1954 , and 1959. those three books are `` high magic 's aid '' , `` witchcraft today '' , and `` the meaning of witchcraft '' . gardner called wicca the `` witch cult '' and `` witchcraft '' , and called its followers the `` wica '' , though in his 1959 book he also called them the `` wicca '' ( with two cs ) , which is where that word came from . the word `` wicca '' means `` witch '' in old english . people who follow wicca are called `` wiccans '' . before the name `` wicca '' was adopted , the religion was sometimes called simply `` the craft '' . some time from 1945 to 1949 , gerald gardner altered , and added content to , the rituals of an earlier group , called the new forest coven . in so doing , gerald gardner created wicca . the many elements from the grimoire ( old hand-written book ) called the `` key of solomon '' that are present in wicca , and are also in gardner 's 1949 book `` high magic 's aid '' , were most likely added by gardner himself , rather than by the new forest coven that came before him .
