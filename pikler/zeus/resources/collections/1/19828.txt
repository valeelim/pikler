Chlorophyll     chlorophyll is a chemical found in the chloroplasts of plants that allows the plant to absorb light . energy from the light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose . this contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release . it does this through respiration . this energy is then used for lots of different things like growing or repairing damaged parts of the plant . chlorophyll is also what gives the stem and leaf of the plant its green color . chlorophyll is a green pigment found in almost all plants , algae , and cyanobacteria . it absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum , followed by the red portion . however , it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum ; hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues . chlorophyll was first isolated in 1817. chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis , which allows plants to obtain energy from light . chlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around the membranes of chloroplasts . it serves two main functions . the function of most chlorophyll ( up to several hundred molecules per photosystem ) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy to reaction centres . these pigments are named after the wavelength ( in nanometers ) of their red-peak absorption maximum . these chlorophyll pigments can be separated in a simple paper chromatography experiment .
