Species     a species is a kind of organism . it is a basic unit of biological classification , and a formal rank in taxonomy . originally , the word was used informally in a rather vague way , but now there are at least 26 different ways it is used . all animals or plants that are the same kind belong to the same species . wolves ( `` canis lupus '' ) are one species . humans ( `` homo sapiens '' ) are another species . broadly , the idea is that ( say ) cats breed with cats and produce more cats . this is the basis for deciding to have a species called `` felis catus '' . however , to give a simple definition of 'species ' is difficult , and many people have tried . species is a word for a particular kind of living thing , for example , a jackdaw . jackdaws and ravens are similar , so they are together in a larger group ( taxon ) called a genus , in this case `` corvus '' . then there is a family ( such as the crow family , which includes crows and ravens as well as jays and magpies ) . families are put together into orders such as the songbirds , which includes many families of birds . the next group is the class ; all birds are in the same class . after that is the phylum , such as vertebrates , which is all animals with backbones . last of all is the kingdom , like the animal kingdom . these are ways to classify living things .
