Maggie Simpson     margaret `` maggie '' simpson is a fictional character shown in the animated television series `` the simpsons '' . she is a baby . like most babies , maggie copies what she sees around her . she once hit homer on the head with a mallet , shot a suction dart at his picture and attacked him with a pencil in imitation of `` itchy and scratchy '' . maggie is also very accurate with a gun , she shot mr.burns in `` who shot mr. burns '' . during the early episodes , maggie 's well-known feature would be to trip over her clothes and fall on her face causing a loud smack on the floor . throughout the early episodes , maggie fell down 39 times . maggie was named after matt groening 's sister maggie groening . she often sucked on a pacifier and wore a sleep suit like maggie . groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up , but showed any emotions that the scene needed . with few exceptions , maggie never speaks but is aware of what is going around her . maggie has spoken in `` good night '' , the first cartoon to air on `` the tracey ullman show '' . when the rest of the family falls asleep , she speaks and her voice is played by liz georges .
