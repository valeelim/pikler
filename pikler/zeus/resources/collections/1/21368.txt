Brassière     a brassière , commonly called a bra , is an undergarment for women . its main purpose is to support their breasts , but is sometimes also used for sexual attraction in the form of lingerie . the bra is a nineteenth century invention which took off as a fashion garment in the 20th century . brassière measurement ( also called bust size or bra size ) refers to the size of bra a woman wears . bra sizes were first introduced in the 1910s . the sizes vary from one manufacturer to another . bra size systems are often used to label off-shelf bras and not custom-made bras . the term `` cup '' , in relation to bras , began being used in 1916 when two patents were issued . cup sizes are given in letters such as a , b , c , etc . bra sizes in most countries have a number and a letter ( for example , 34b ) . the number comes from the measurement of the ribcage directly underneath the breasts . the letter is a measure of how much larger the breasts are than the ribcage . this is found by measuring the chest over the breasts ( across the nipples ) and subtracting the ribcage measurement from the breast measurement , then finding the matching letter of the alphabet . for example , someone with a 3-inch difference between the breast measurement and the ribcage measurement would have a c-cup bra . however , this does not always work , since different manufacturers have differently-sized bras . many women prefer to find a brand and size that works for them by trial and error .
