Noble gas     the noble gases are a group of elements that are all gases . these elements are all in group 18 of the periodic table . all of them are monoatomic , meaning each molecule is a single atom they almost never react with other elements . this is because they have a full 8 electrons outer electron shell . there are six noble gases : - helium - neon - argon - krypton - xenon - radon all of these gases are found in air . they make up around 0.96 % of the atmosphere . noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gases . when the noble gases are used in cold cathode tubes to produce light , each of them has a different colour . since radon is radioactive , it is usually not used for lighting . here are pictures of what the others look like : ununoctium ( element 118 ) is probably the next noble gas after radon because it is the next box down in the same group . however it has a half life of 0.89 ms , after which it decays to ununhexium ( element 116 ) . this means its use is probably limited . noble gases were discovered by lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay . rayleigh won the nobel prize in physics in 1904 for his work on noble gas . ramsay won the nobel prize in chemistry in 1904 for his work with noble gas .
