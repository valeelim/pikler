Limestone     limestone is a sedimentary rock , made up mostly of the mineral calcite , a form of calcium carbonate , caco . the calcium carbonate is originally produced by living organisms . later , some of it goes into solution in sea water . limestone rocks include mainly organic remains and precipitated carbonate . limestone makes up about 10 % of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks . limestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate . it is originally made by small photosynthetic protists like certain bacteria , coccolithophores , and algae . then the carbonate gets used by various animals , like bivalves and the polyps which make coral reefs . they build their shells or framework out of caco crystals . carbonates are rocks formed from these sources , plus any caco which is precipitated out of solution . some carbonate dissolves in the water . it gets precipitated when the physical condition of the water changes . for example , if the concentration of caco is high , then a temperature drop , or a ph ( acidity ) change , can cause precipitation .
