Fossil fuel     fossil fuels are fuels that come from very old life forms that decomposed over a long period of time . the three most important fossil fuels are coal , petroleum , and natural gas . oil and gas are hydrocarbons ( molecules that have only hydrogen and carbon in them ) . coal is mostly carbon . these fuels are called fossil fuels because they are dug up from underground . in the oil sands in alberta , about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas was used per day in 2007 to heat the soil so the oil would come out of the earth most of the fuels people burn are fossil fuels . a big use is to make electricity . in power plants fossil fuels , usually coal , are burned to heat water into steam , which pushes a fan-like object called a turbine . when the turbine spins around , magnets inside the turbine make electricity . crude oil can be separated to make various fuels such as lpg , gasoline , kerosene , jet fuel , and diesel fuel . these substances are made by fractional distillation in an oil refinery . they are the main fuels in transportation . that means that they are burned in order to move cars , trucks , ships , airplanes , trains and even spacecraft . without them , there would n't be much transport .
