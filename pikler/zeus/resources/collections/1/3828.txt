Pronoun     a pronoun is traditionally a part of speech in grammar , though many modern linguists call it a type of noun . in english , pronouns are words such as `` me , she , his , them , herself , each other , it , what '' . pronouns are often used to take the place of a noun , when that noun is understood ( has already been named ) , to avoid repeating it . for example , instead of saying - tom has a new dog . tom has named the dog max and tom lets the dog sleep by tom 's bed . it is easier to say - tom has a new dog . he has named it max and he lets it sleep by his bed . when a pronoun replaces a noun , the noun is called the antecedent . but , there are times when the pronoun has no antecedent . this is because generally , the antecedent ( what comes before ) refers grammatically to the use of the relative pronoun in particular . for example , in the sentence : `` the dog that was walking down the street '' , the relative pronoun is the word that referring back to the antecedent , the word 'dog ' . in the sentence `` the spy who loved me '' , the relative pronoun is the word 'who ' and its antecedent is the word 'spy ' .
