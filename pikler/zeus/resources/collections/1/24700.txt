RAID     raid is an acronym that stands for redundant array of inexpensive or redundant array of independent disks . raid is a term used in computing . with raid , several hard disks are made into one logical disk . there are different ways this can be done . each of the methods that puts the hard disks together has some benefits and drawbacks over using the drives as single disks , independent of each other . the main reasons why raid is used are : - to make the loss of data happen less often . this is done by having several copies of the data . - to get more storage space by having many smaller disks . - to get more flexibility ( disks can be changed or added while the system keeps running ) - to get the data more quickly . it is not possible to achieve all of these goals at the same time , so choices need to be made . there are also some bad things : - certain choices can protect against data being lost because one ( or a number ) of disks failed . they do not protect against the data being deleted or overwritten , though .
