Protist     protists are single-celled eukaryotes which are organisms with a nucleus . the term protista was first used by ernst haeckel in 1866. it is a rather old-fashioned term which includes microorganisms from several distantly related phyla . some are autotrophic ( which means they make their own food by photosynthesis ) , and others are heterotrophic ( which means they eat organic material ) . most protists are very small . they are made up of one or a few cells at most â€“ they are microscopic and usually invisible to the naked eye . some algae are protists , if they are single-celled . many protists are part of the plankton and are very important for the ecosystem . the cells found in protists may be extremely complex , and are often little understood . it is now possible to do dna sequencing , and a number of protists have been analysed . the results show that the protista is not a monophyletic group . it is paraphyletic , and not a single clade . the taxonomy of the protista is therefore rather confused .
