Backgammon     backgammon is a game played by two players . each player moves pieces around a board . players roll two dice to find out how far their pieces can move in one turn . the winner of one game is the first to get all pieces all the way around , and off , the board . the game is laid-out asymmetrically . white 's direction of travel is counter-clockwise , whereas black 's direction of travel is clockwise . ( there is no advantage whatsoever to either side due to this asymmetry . ) white moves from white 's far right to white 's home area on white 's close right , in the shape of a right-hand `` c '' from white 's point of view . black moves along the same `` c '' , beginning from black 's far left and ending at black 's home area on black 's close left . ( the `` c '' is the same for both sides - the `` c '' points to the right for white and points to the left for black . ) as shown in the image , some pieces ( for each side ) begin already in the home quadrant , and some pieces must make their way all the way around . pieces can be sent backwards to their starting position during play .
