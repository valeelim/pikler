Hangul     hangul or hangeul ( ) is the alphabet used for the korean language and cia-cia language . it was made by sejong the great , the 4th king of the joseon dynasty in 1443 , and it is still used by many people . when hangeul was spread out , king sejong published hunminjeong'eum haeryebon ( 훈민정음 해례본 ) which was chosen as the memory of the world by unesco in 1997. in this book , the design ideas of hangeul and information on its usage were written down in detail . the book hunminjeong'eum haeryebon states the 2 design ideas of hangeul . the first one is that the consonants of hangeul look like vocal organs . the second one is that the vowels of hangeul are based on cheonji'in ( 천지인 ) . cheonji'in refers to the three elements of philosophy which are sky ( 천 ) , earth ( 지 ) and human ( 인 ) . because of these ideas , hangeul is well-known for being easy to learn . although it was only used by the lower classes at first , hangeul became the official writing script of korea in the late 19th century . today it is the most used writing system of both north and south korea . north korea abolished the use of hanja , and today north koreans write only in hangeul . in south korea , people write mostly in hangeul , although in some contexts hanja is still used .
