Deism     deism is the belief that a higher being ( like the christian god ) exists , but does not tell people what to do . deism says that people should rely on logic and reason , and not traditions of a religion that is based on a holy book . people who follow deism are called deists . deists believe that a higher power created the world . they do not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event . they usually reject supernatural events like miracles , and believe that a god has set up natural laws and does not interfere with them . most deists also see holy books , such as the bible and qur'an , as writings made by people , rather than the writings of a god . famous deists from history include american political leader and scientist benjamin franklin , famed french conqueror napoleon bonaparte , the french writer and philosopher voltaire , british philosopher thomas paine , and actor marlon brando . many historians think thomas jefferson was a deist , though he did n't say so .
