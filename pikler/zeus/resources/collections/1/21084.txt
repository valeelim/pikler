Anger     anger is one of the basic emotions . it is an inherited response , and is common to all mammals and a number of other animals . it happens when we are threatened , offended , wronged , or denied something we really want or need . rage is the strongest form of anger . anger is a normal emotion . it involves a strong , uncomfortable and emotional response to a provocation . there is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression ( verbal or physical , direct or indirect ) . both influence each other . anger can start aggression or increase its probability or intensity . however , it is not necessary nor sufficient for aggression . anger is a bit like a pressure cooker : we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes . people show anger to others by their face , what they do with their body , not trying to understand or help other people 's problems , and sometimes acts of aggression or force in public ( e.g . punching a wall ) . animals and humans might try to scare- by making loud sounds , trying to make their bodies look bigger , by showing their teeth , or by staring .
