Newton's laws of motion    newton 's laws of motion isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) , the father of the study of dynamics – the study of motion – developed three sets of laws that are believed to be true because the results of tests done by scientists agree with the laws he produced . first law . - if a body is at rest it remains at rest or , if it is in motion , it moves with uniform velocity , until it is acted on by a net force . a `` uniform velocity '' means that an object moves at a constant speed without changing direction ( i.e . in a straight line ) . a `` net force '' means that the forces acting on the object are not balanced . in other words , the first law states two things : 1. a stationary object will only move if there is an unbalanced force acting on it . 1. a moving object will only change speed or direction if there is an unbalanced force acting on it . the first part states that a table resting on the ground will not move unless pushed . although gravity is acting on the table , pulling it down , there is a `` reaction force '' from the ground which is pushing it back . the forces acting on the table are `` balanced '' , so the object will not move .
