Goldfish     goldfish ( `` carassius auratus '' ) are a species of domesticated fish . goldfish belong to the carp family and were domesticated in china in the tang dynasty . they can reach up to 59 cm in size , and 3 kg in weight . however , most goldfish grow to only half that size . in captivity , goldfish can live for up to 30 years . in the aquarium , however , most will die earlier . this is because the aquarium is too small . goldfish need a lot of space so they have room to swim and so the water does not get dirty too fast . goldfish live best in temperatures between 10 degrees celsius and 30 degrees celsius . it was once thought that goldfish have short memories , but scientists have proven that this is not true . in experiments , a goldfish was trained to kick a small ball under water . another goldfish learned to swim through a maze . there are many kinds of goldfish . the most common kind is golden-colored , but goldfish come in many different shapes and sizes . many gold fish have fancy tails . another common kind is called a black moor , which is black colored . wild goldfish are called prussian carp and are silver-green in colour .
