Malleability     malleability is a substance 's ability to deform under pressure ( compressive stress ) . if malleable , a material may be flattened into thin sheets by hammering or rolling . malleable materials can be flattened into metal leaf . many metals with high malleability also have high ductility . malleability is a physical property of matter , usually metals . the property usually applies to the family groups 1 to 12 on the modern periodic table of elements . it is the ability of a solid to bend or be hammered into other shapes without breaking . examples of malleable metals are gold , iron , aluminum , copper , silver , and lead . gold and silver are highly malleable . when a piece of hot iron is hammered it takes the shape of a sheet . the property is not seen in non-metals . non-malleable metals may break apart when struck by a hammer . malleable metals usually bend and twist in various shapes . related pages . - ductility
