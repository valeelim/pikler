Chromium     chromium is a chemical element . its symbol on the periodic table ( a list of all the elements ) is cr . it always has 24 protons , so its atomic number is 24. its mass number ( number of protons and neutrons ) is about 54. most of the times it has 28 neutrons , but different isotopes have more or fewer neutrons . as a metal , it has 24 electrons . its ions have fewer electrons . chromium is a shiny metal . it is reactive , but it reacts with air to produce a very thin coating of chromium ( iii ) oxide , which prevents it from rusting any more . chromium occurs in several oxidation states ; +2 , +3 , and +6 are most common . it forms chemical compounds that are colorful . - chromium ( ii ) oxide , black , rare , reducing agent - chromium ( ii ) chloride , blue when dissolved in water , unstable - chromium ( iii ) oxide , dark green - chromium ( iii ) chloride , green when containing water ( hydrated ) , purple when not containing water ( anhydrous ) - chromium ( iii ) sulfate - chromium ( iv ) oxide , black , used in cassettes - chromium ( vi ) oxide , chromium trioxide , red , oxidizing agent , toxic . chromic acid is formed by dissolving chromium ( vi ) oxide in water .
