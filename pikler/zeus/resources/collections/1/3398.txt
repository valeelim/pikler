Milk     milk is a white liquid made by mammals , for example cows , dogs , and humans . it is made in the mammary glands ( breasts , udders , or teats ) of female mammals . because newborn babies have no teeth , they must be given milk before they can eat solid food . milk has many nutrients to help babies grow and be healthy . it is also a rich source of calcium which is good for your bones and teeth . if milk is not kept cold in a refrigerator , it will become sour after some time . when milk is warmed , it turns sour . fermentation makes this happen . lactic acid bacteria change the milk sugar into lactic acid . fermentation is used when making dairy products . milk is often pasteurised before humans drink it . it is made into dairy products like cream , butter , yoghurt , ice cream , or cheese . pasteurised cows ' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a refrigerator . milk should be stored between 1° and 4° celsius . if milk is treated with very high temperatures , it will last longer before spoiling . this means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened .
