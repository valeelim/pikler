Electrical resistance     the electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty of passing an electric current through that conductor . it explains the relationship between voltage ( amount of electrical pressure ) and the current ( flow of electricity ) . with more resistance in a circuit , less electricity will flow through the circuit . resistance , discovered by georg simon ohm in 1827 , is the ratio between voltage and current . ohm 's law said that the voltage between any two points in a conductor changes directly as the current between the two points , given the temperature remains the same . he described it with the equation : which models the ratio , where : the resistance of a wire increases as it becomes longer and decreases as it becomes wider . ( a simple analogy is a road - the more lanes there are , the less traffic there is . ) the resistance of a wire with a constant width , therefore , can be calculated as : where formula_6 is the length of the conductor , measured in meters [ m ] , formula_7 is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in square meters [ m² ] , and ( greek : rho ) is the electrical resistivity ( also called `` specific electrical resistance '' ) of the material , measured in ohm-meters ( ω m ) .
