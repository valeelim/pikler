Basque language     basque ( in basque : ' ) is the language spoken by the basque people in the basque country and diaspora . the standard basque name for the language is euskara . although it is surrounded by indo-european languages , basque is a language isolate . it is not related to the indo-european languages . the ancestors of basques are among the oldest residents of europe , and their beginnings are unknown , as are the origins of basque itself . many scholars have tried to link basque to etruscan , african languages , caucasian languages and so on , but most see basque as a language isolate . a connection with the iberian language gave some hope , but it is unclear whether similarities are due to genetic relations or mere vicinity . it was spoken long before the romans brought latin to the iberian peninsula . the region where basque is spoken is smaller than what is known as the basque country , or `` euskal herria '' in basque . basque used to be spoken over a larger area , but latin took over in some places .
