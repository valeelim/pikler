Genetics     genetics is a discipline of biology . it is the science of heredity . this includes the study of genes , and the inheritance of variation and traits of living organisms . in the laboratory , genetics proceeds by mating carefully selected organisms , and analysing their offspring . more informally , genetics is the study of how parents pass some of their characteristics to their children . it is an important part of biology , and gives the basic rules on which evolution acts . the fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been known since prehistoric times , and used to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding . however , the modern science of genetics seeks to understand the process of inheritance . this began with the work of gregor mendel in the mid-nineteenth century . although he did not know the physical basis for heredity , mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via discrete units of inheritance , which are now called genes . living things are made of millions of tiny self-contained components called cells . inside of each cell are long and complex molecules called deoxyribonucleic acid . dna stores information that tells the cells how to create that living thing . parts of this information that tell how to make one small part or characteristic of the living thing – red hair , or blue eyes , or a tendency to be tall – are known as genes .
