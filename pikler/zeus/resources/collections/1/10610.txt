Accent     an accent is the way a person speaks . sometimes people will talk about someone 's accent . they might say that the person has a german accent , or an australian accent . an accent is the way words are said . the way a person says words usually comes from where he or she was a child , and other people where he or she lives . people learn how to say words and sentences so that they sound the same as when others speak . people speaking the same language can have different accents . even people in the same country can have different accents . sometimes people can tell what city someone lived in when as a child , by the way that person speaks . ( e.g . a new york city accent ) when first trying to learn a new language , often a person will still have his or her old accent . people may be able to guess what country or place that person lived in before . if someone can learn another language well enough , he or she may not have the old accent anymore . these people may get a new accent in the new language . if someone studied german in austria , people in germany may think that person was austrian .
