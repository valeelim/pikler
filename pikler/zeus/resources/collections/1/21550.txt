Chemical formula     a chemical formula is a way that chemists describe a molecule . the formula says what atoms , and how many of each type , are in the molecule . sometimes the formula shows how the atoms are linked , and sometimes the formula shows how the atoms are arranged in space . the letter shows what chemical element each atom is . the subscript shows the number of each type of atom . for example , hydrogen peroxide has the formula ho . methane has one carbon ( c ) atom and four hydrogen atoms ; the chemical formula is ch . the sugar molecule glucose has six carbon atoms , twelve hydrogen atoms , and six oxygen atoms , so its chemical formula is cho . chemical formulas are used in chemical equations to describe chemical reactions . the 19th-century swedish chemist j√∂ns jacob berzelius worked out this system for writing chemical formulas . chemical formulas are another way to represent the number of atoms . chemical formulas are used to represent kinds of atoms in a combination . chemical formulas use subscripts to tell how many of each atom are present in a combination . subscripts are small numbers to the lower right of a symbol . they represent the number of atoms of that element in the equation . before writing chemical formulas , write down the symbol of each atom present in your equation . writing chemical formula is a way of informing the chemical figure . it is most easily found in the periodic table . the periodic table is a chart of all well-known parts . use the periodic table to reference the figure that can not be remembered .
