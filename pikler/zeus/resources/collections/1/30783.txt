Carolina parakeet     the carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot . it was the last parrot type to have lived before the european conquest in the eastern united states . it was found from the ohio valley to the gulf of mexico , and lived in old woods along rivers . the last wild carolina parakeet was killed in okeechobee county in florida in 1904 , and the last bird kept by people died at the cincinnati zoo in 1918. this was the male bird called `` incas '' , who died within a year of his mate `` lady jane '' . it was not until 1939 , however , that it was agreed that all the carolina parakeets had died . at some date between 1937 and 1955 , three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the okefenokee swamp of georgia . however , the american ornithologists union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets . additional sightings were recorded in okeechobee county in florida until the end of the 1920s . the carolina parakeet died out for a number of reasons . to make space for more farms , large areas of forest were cut down , taking away its living space . the colorful feathers ( green body , yellow head , and red around the bill ) were in demand as decorations in ladies ' hats , and the birds were kept as pets . even though the birds were bred easily in captivity , little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out . finally , they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests .
