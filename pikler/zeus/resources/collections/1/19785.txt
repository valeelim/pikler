Silicon     silicon is element 14 on the periodic table . its symbol is si . silicon looks like a metal , but does not do everything a metal does , like conduct electricity very easily . it is a metalloid . silicon is used as a great deal in today 's computers and virtually every electronic device . germanium can also be used in computers , but silicon is easier to find . there is a lot of silicon on the earth . at the beach , there is silicon in the form of sand . sand is a compound of silicon known as silicon dioxide or silica . glass is made by heating sand ( or silicon dioxide ) hot enough . the glass can have different colours by adding coloured compounds . silicon also makes up a lot of different rocks and minerals , and they are known as silicates . silicon is a semiconductor , and much used in computers . a super-pure isotope of silicon , silicon-28 , can now be made 40 times more pure than before . it is very important for the next big development in computers . this stores `` qubits '' in atoms of another element , like phosphorous , embedded in a tiny layer of ultra-pure silicon-28 . these qubits can simultaneously encode a one and a zero , for incredibly fast and complex calculations .
