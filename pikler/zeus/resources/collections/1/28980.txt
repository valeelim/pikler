Richard Wagner     richard wagner ( 22 may 1813 in leipzig – 13 february 1883 in venice ) was a german opera composer . he was one of the most important opera composers in germany during the romantic period . apart from some music that he wrote as a student he wrote ten operas which are all performed regularly in opera houses today . most of his operas are about stories from german mythology . he always wrote the words himself . wagner changed people ’ s ideas of what operas should be . he thought that the drama ( the story that is being told with all its tensions ) was very important , and he chose the singers for his operas himself , so that he could train them into his way of thinking . the music in his operas did not give the audience a chance to applaud after big solos as it had done in the 18th century : it continues throughout the whole act . he made his music tell the story by using what he called “ leitmotifs ” . these were melodies or short musical phrases which belonged to particular characters in the opera , or to particular ideas . he had more influence on other composers than anybody else in his time , largely because of his harmonies which became more and more chromatic ( using lots of sharps and flats ) , with many changes of key . he built an opera house to his own design in the german town of bayreuth . nearly all musicians in europe tried to make a journey to bayreuth to hear wagner ’ s music . the wagner festival still takes place every year there .
