South Pole     the south pole is the most southern point on the earth . it is in antarctica and is the center of the southern hemisphere . the geographic north and south poles are the poles the earth spins around , the ones people see on a globe where all the north/south lines meet . these poles stay in the same place , and are usually the ones we mean if we just say north or south pole . people can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars ( at the poles , a star just circles around at the same height , never dipping to the horizon ) . the sun rises once a year and gives the south pole half a year of summer but it is always cold . when the sun sets half a year later it makes half a year of winter which is even colder . the south pole is always cold because the sun never rises high in the sky . the south magnetic pole is something different . it is defined by the earth 's magnetic field , as roughly where a magnetic compass needle points . people can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass . from the south pole , everywhere is north ( but a compass is not reliable very close to the poles ) .
