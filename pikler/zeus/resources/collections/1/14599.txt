Boolean algebra     boolean algebra is algebra for binary ( 0 means false and 1 means true ) . it uses normal maths symbols , but it does not work in the same way . it is named after its creator george boole . the not operator is written with a bar over numbers or letters like this : it means the output is not the input . the and operator is written as formula_4 like this : the output is true only if one and the other input is true . the or operator is written as formula_9 like this : one or the other input can be true for the output to be true . xor basically means `` exclusive or '' , meaning one input or the other must be true , but not both . the xor operator is written as formula_14 like this : to make it more simple , one or the other input must be true , but not both . different gates can be put together in different orders : it is not the same as a not then an and like this : formula_20 which is called `` xor identity table '' , if formula_23 . or if formula_24=true , true. , augustus de morgan found out that it is possible to change a formula_9 sign to a formula_4 sign and make or break a bar . see the 2 examples below :
