Halley's Comet    halley 's comet halley 's comet ( comet halley ) is a comet which comes round every 75 or 76 years . when it is near , it can be seen with the naked eye . it will return in 2061. the comet is named after edmond halley ( 1656–1742 ) , an english astronomer , who predicted the comet 's return . halley 's comet was the first comet to be recognized as periodic . when the comet came close to the earth in 1986 , it was visited by several space-probes . the probe `` giotto '' from the european space agency managed the closest approach to the comet . the number of years that the comet finishes its full cycle can vary depending on the effect of another planet 's gravitational pull . in 1986 , halley 's comet was the first to be observed in detail by spacecraft . it gave the first data on the structure of a comet nucleus and how the `` coma '' ( nebulous envelope around the core or nucleus ) and the tail formed . these observations supported fred whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' model . this correctly predicted that halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water , carbon dioxide , ammonia , – and dust . the missions also adjusted these ideas . for example , it is now known that the `` surface '' of halley is mostly dusty , non-volatile materials , and that only a small portion of it is icy .
