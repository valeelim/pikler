Square root     a square root of a number is a number that , when it is multiplied by itself ( squared ) , gives the first number again . for example , 2 is the square root of 4 , because 2×2=4 . only numbers bigger than or equal to zero have real square roots . a number bigger than zero has two square roots : one is positive ( bigger than zero ) and the other is negative ( smaller than zero ) . for example , 4 has two square roots : 2 and −2 . the only square root of zero is zero . square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers – they are imaginary numbers . imaginary numbers are basically numbers that can not be square rooted and get a real result . every complex number except 0 has 2 square roots . for example : −1 has two square roots . we call them formula_1 and formula_2 . the sign for a square root is made by putting a bent line over a number , like this : formula_3 . we say `` the square root of 4 '' ( or whatever number we are taking the square root of ) . a whole number with a square root that is also a whole number is called a perfect square . the first few perfect squares are : 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 , 64 , 81 , 100 , 121 , 144 , 169 , 196 , 225 , 256 , 289 , 324 , 361 , 400 , 441 , 484 , 529 , 576 , 625 , 676 , 729 , 784 , 841 , 900 , 961 , 1024 , 1089 , 1156 , 1225 ...
