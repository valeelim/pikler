Uranium     uranium is a chemical element ( a metal ) on the periodic table . it has an atomic number of 92 , which means that a uranium atom has 92 protons in its center , which is called a nucleus . uranium that is dug out of the ground will be made from three different isotopes : three different types of uranium with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei . most of it is uranium-238 ; uranium-235 is less common ; uranium-234 is the rarest . pitchblende is the main ore that is mined for uranium . uranium-235 can be used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons by making a nuclear chain reaction . this turns the uranium-235 into uranium-236 and splits the nucleus into two smaller nuclei . this makes two completely different elements with smaller atomic numbers . this process is called nuclear fission and creates lots of heat . this heat makes it very useful for making steam in nuclear reactors , or for making explosions with nuclear weapons . but most such weapons use plutonium made from uranium-238 . uranium is a bit radioactive .
