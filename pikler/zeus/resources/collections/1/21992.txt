Unicellular organism     .- . unicellular organisms are organisms that have one cell . they are divided into two quite different types , from different classification kingdoms . - the prokaryotes , bacteria and archaea , have cells with no nucleus and a simple cell structure . - eukaryotes have a nucleus , and a more complex cell structure . the differences between the prokaryota and eukaryota are significant . eukaryotes possess a nucleus , while prokaryotes lack it , and eukaryotes possess a range of subcellular organs called organelles , which prokaryotes do not . you can observe the larger unicellular organisms by using a compound microscope . bacteria just appear as dark dots . to gather unicellular organisms for observation , one can place a cover slip on the surface of pond water , and leave it overnight . by the next morning , numerous unicellular organisms will have grown entire colonies on the bottom of the slip . they multiply fast : colonies can double their size in between 30 minutes and a few hours .
