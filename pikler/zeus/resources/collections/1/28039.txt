Geneva Conventions     the geneva conventions are a set of four treaties of international law . they were formulated in geneva , switzerland . all of the four treaties are about humanitarian issues . the swiss henri dunant was the person who started the creation of the conventions . he did this after he saw the unimaginable cruelty of the battle of solferino in 1859. some parts of the four geneva conventions say that all countries who signed must create national laws to make violations of the geneva conventions a crime . the conventions and their agreements are as follows : - first geneva convention `` '' for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field '' '' ( first adopted in 1864 , last revision in 1949 ) . this was to make things better for people which have been injured in battle . it basically says that the medical teams on the battlefield must help anyone who is injured , not just people from their own side . - second geneva convention `` '' for the amelioration of the condition of wounded , sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea '' '' ( first adopted in 1949 , came after looking over the 1907 hague convention x ) . similar to the first convention , but for battles that happen at sea .
