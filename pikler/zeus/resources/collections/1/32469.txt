Decolonization     decolonization is when a colony of any country becomes independent . thus , decolonization is opposite of colonization . sometimes , a colony may not get full freedom , but may become part of other country or even the part of the country which colonized it . this is also decolonization . in some , decolonization may result after non-violent discussion . in a relatively small number of cases , decolonization happens only after armed struggle and revolt . decolonization is different from the break-up of traditional empires like the mongol empire or the ottoman empire . decolonization generally means independence from the european rule . major decolonization occurred in the 20th century . it began with the independence of pakistan and india in 1947 from the british empire . soon thereafter , many countries of africa became independent from the rule of many countries of europe .
