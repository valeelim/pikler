Quark     a quark is a tiny particle which makes up protons and neutrons . the atom is made up of protons , neutrons and electrons . it was once thought that neutrons , protons and electrons were fundamental particles . fundamental particles can not be broken up into anything smaller . after the invention of the particle accelerator , it was discovered that electrons are fundamental particles , but neutrons and protons are not . neutrons and protons are made up of quarks , which are held together by gluons . there are six types of quarks . the types are called flavours . the flavours are up , down , strange , charm , top , and bottom . up , charm and top quarks have a charge of + , while down , strange and bottom quarks have a charge of - . each quark has a matching antiquark . antiquarks have a charge opposite to that of their quarks ; meaning that up , charm and top antiquarks have a charge of - and that down , strange and bottom antiquarks have a charge of + . only up and down quarks are found inside atoms of normal matter . two up quarks and one down make a proton ( + - = +1 charge ) while two down quarks and one up make a neutron ( - - = 0 charge ) . the other four flavours are not seen naturally on earth , but they can be made in particle accelerators . some of them may also exist inside of stars .
