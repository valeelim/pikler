Multicellular organism     multi-cellular organisms are organisms with more than one cell . this is the case for animals , plants and most fungi . in such organisms , cells are usually specialised . all the cells with the same function work together . such a group of cells is then called a tissue . multi-cellular organisms have a set of cells that specialize in reproduction . reproduction in such organisms is usually sexual . the sex cells are either sperm or ovum ( also named `` egg '' ) cells . if they are sperm cells , the organism is male , if they are egg cells it is female . if both are present , the organism is a hermaphrodite . we know , from their cell structure , that multicellularity has evolved independently many times in earth history , for example in plants and animals . the earliest forms of life in the fossil record are cyanobacteria from the archaean era at 3.5 billion years ago . they grew as single cells but lived in colonies as stromatolites . the first multicellular fossils have been found in 2.1 billion years old palaeoproterozoic rocks from the gabon in africa . these are eukaryotic cells which live colonially . the fossils are visible to the naked eye , and hence much larger than bacteria . the authors comment that one advantage of multicellularity is larger size , and that an adequate level of oxygen is required to support this kind of life .
