Pseudonym     a pseudonym ( soo-do-nim ) is a fake name a person uses instead of their real name . many people use pseudonyms , including authors ( pen names ) and performers ( stage names ) . people use pseudonyms for several different reasons : to hide identity , gender , and/or race . people ( such as rappers ) also use pseudonyms to match their stage personality better . pseudonyms can include stage names , screen names , ring names , pen names , nicknames , aliases , superhero identities and code names . `` pseudonym '' comes from the greek word ( `` pseudṓnymon '' ) , which means `` false name '' . there are three main types of pseudonyms : pen names , stage names and user-names . pen names are used by authors , usually to hide identity . many famous books , such as the outsiders and a series of unfortunate events , have been written by authors using a pseudonym . daniel handler wrote a series of unfortunate events under the pseudonym lemony snicket both because he wanted to make the author a character in the story and because he wanted to hide his real name . when she published the outsiders , susan eloise hinton decided to use her initials , s. e. , instead of her first and middle names , because she did not want readers to guess her gender . the brontë sisters ( anne , emily and charlotte ) used pseudonyms to hide the fact that they based many of their characters on their neighbors .
