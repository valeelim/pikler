Medical specialty     medicine is a very complex field . in the past , a doctor could learn almost all that we knew about medicine . now that is impossible . so after finishing medical school , young doctors choose what kind of doctor they wish to be . after school , they usually do more years of training to learn about the kind of medical specialty they want to do . some doctors try to learn `` some '' about all of the different subjects of medicine and how to treat all patients . these doctors are called 'primary care ' doctors or `` primary care physicians '' ( pcps ) . sometimes they are also called 'generalists ' or even 'general practitioners . ' in the united states , these kind of doctors are sometimes called family practitioners or family medicine doctors . when a problem is strange or complex , they give it to a specialist . there are other doctors who are also 'primary care ' doctors . pediatricians are primary care doctors , but only for children . internists are primary care doctors for adults . some gynecologists do primary care , but for women only .
