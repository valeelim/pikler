Arnold Schoenberg     arnold franz walter schoenberg ( originally written 'schönberg ' ) ( 13 september 1874 – 13 july 1951 ) was an austrian-born composer . he was known for his twelve-tone system of writing music . schoenberg came from a strict jewish family who had moved to austria from hungary . they were quite poor and schoenberg taught himself about music . when he was grown up he had to do a lot of teaching to try and earn enough money to live . in later life he went to live in the united states . it took a long time before he was recognized world-wide as a great composer . his two most famous pupils were alban berg ( 1885-1935 ) and anton webern ( 1883-1945 ) . he taught them how to write twelve-tone music and they became famous composers . when arnold schoenberg was a young man he was living in the late 19th century . if you look at the way composers wrote music at this time you will find that their compositions became more and more chromatic . this means that more and more sharps and flats were used during the piece , and the music went from one key to another ( modulated ) very quickly . richard wagner wrote very chromatic music , especially in his opera `` tristan and isolde '' .
