Railway track     a railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel . they are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another . ( in america , people say railroad as well as railway . it means the same thing . ) often , there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line . for example , trains go east on one track and west on the other one . the rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals ( called sleepers or ties ) , which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground . they also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart ( called the gauge ) . ties are usually made from either wood or concrete . these often rest on ballast , which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place . tracks are often made better by ballast tampers . the rails are inclined slightly towards each other , typically on a slope of 1 in 20 , and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way ( `` coning '' ) . this helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track . each wheel also has a flange , which sticks out from one edge all the way around . this makes sure the train does not `` derail '' ( come off the track ) and helps guide the train on sharp curves .
