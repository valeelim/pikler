Moss     mosses are bryophytes , which are non-vascular plants . they evolved from liverworts : evidence from mitochondrial dna suggests that this is the stem group from which mosses , hornworts and all other land plants evolved . mosses do not have cells that move water like other plants- water must soak into them , like a sponge . a patch of moss is made of many tiny moss plants packed together so that they can hold water for as long as possible . they do not have roots , and could not get water from them if they did . because they can not find water , they live in two ways . they can live in places that are always wet ; like near a spring , a river , or in a place where there is a lot of fog . they can also dry up when there is no moisture . this means they they can never live in dry places like deserts . they can not grow very large because they could not move water to the top of the moss . the largest moss grows in new zealand , and is about 30 cm tall . a moss does not make seeds . a moss does not have fruit . the green fuzzy part of a moss that is always there has only half of the moss dna . when the moss has made lots of food and there is enough water , cells from different moss plants swim inside a clump of moss . two cells combine to make a cell with a full set of moss dna . this cell grows into a different kind of moss plant- but it gets all of its food from a green fuzzy moss plant . when the cell grows , it makes tiny spores instead of seeds . the spores are like dust . they come from a little box that grows up out of the moss . the box has a lid that falls off . then the spores come out and float away . they will make more moss .
