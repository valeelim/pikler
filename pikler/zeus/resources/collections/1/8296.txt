RMS Titanic     the rms `` titanic '' was a british passenger ship . it was built by harland and wolff ship builders , in belfast , for the white star line company . she sank during her first trip at sea . before she sailed , many people thought it would be almost impossible for ships of this design to sink . at 11:40 on 14 april 1912 , during `` titanic ' `` maiden voyage , she hit an iceberg in the atlantic ocean . the iceberg broke the `` titanic '' ' hull ( bottom ) , letting water into the ship . the `` titanic '' sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 on 15 april . as she sank , the `` titanic '' split in two . the wreck killed over 1,500 people . only around 705 people survived . it was one of the worst shipwrecks that was not during a war . one reason why so many people died was because the ship did not have enough lifeboats for everyone on board . higher class women and children were allowed on the lifeboats first , and passengers who sailed in first class ( which meant that they paid for better rooms on the ship ) were allowed on before other passengers . few of the poorer people who had paid less ( called second class and third class passengers ) got out safely .
