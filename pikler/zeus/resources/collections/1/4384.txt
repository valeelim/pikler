List of telescope types     astronomical telescopes are divided into subgroups . all telescopes work by collecting electromagnetic radiation and focussing it into an image which may be seen or photographed . the purpose is to see things which are far away in the universe . the traditional types all work to collect visible light from the sky . recent types may work outside the visible spectrum . they all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of astronomy . dioptrics . telescopes which create their image with an objective that is a convex lens ( refractors ) are said to be `` dioptric '' telescopes . - achromatic : uses achromatic lens to correct for chromatic aberration . lens keeps colours together . - non-achromatic - apochromatic catoptrics . optical systems using mirrors : uses reflected light to form the image . - newtonian - gregorian - classical cassegrain - ritchey-chr√©tien - schiefspiegler catadioptrics . - schmidt-cassegrain - maksutov-cassegrain these types can be mounted on different types of mounts .
