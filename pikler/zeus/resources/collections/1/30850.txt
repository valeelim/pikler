Mercalli intensity scale     the mercalli intensity scale ( or more precisely the modified mercalli intensity scale ) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes . unlike with the richter scale , the mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly . rather , they classify earthquakes by the effects they have ( and the destruction they cause ) . when there is little damage , the scale describes how people felt the earthquake , or how many people felt it . very often , non-geologists use this scale , because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused , than to do calculations to get a value on the richter scale . values range from i - instrumental to xii - catastrophic . giuseppe mercalli ( 1850-1914 ) originally developed the scale , with ten levels . in 1902 , adolfo cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels . august heinrich sieberg copletely rewrote the scale . for this reason , the scale is sometimes named mercalli-cancani-sieberg scale , or mcs scale .
