Lepton     leptons are elementary particles with spin 1/2 ( a fermion ) that are not affected by strong nuclear force . they are a family of particles that are different from the other known family of fermions , the quarks . electrons are a well-known example that are found in ordinary matter . there are six leptons : the electron , muon , and tau particles and their associated neutrinos . the different varieties of the elementary particles are commonly called `` flavors '' , and the neutrinos here are considered to have distinctly different flavor . of the six leptons , three have electric charge and three do not . the best known charged lepton is the electron ( e ) . the other two charged leptons are the muon ( µ ) and the tau ( τ ) , which are like electrons but much bigger . the charged leptons are all negative particles , their `` antiparticles '' are positively charged ( for example , the antiparticle of the electron , e , is a positron , e ) . the chart below needs a bit of correction re : leptons . i 'll let someone more competent make the correction
