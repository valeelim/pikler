Guillotine     the guillotine is a machine used to execute people by decapitation ( chopping off their heads ) . a guillotine is made of a heavy blade attached to a rack , which moves up and down on a vertical frame . when the rack is let go , it will fall down and the blade will cut the convict 's head off . machines like the guillotine were first invented in the middle ages , and were used throughout europe . for example , scotland used a machine called the `` scottish maiden '' . the first time the guillotine was commonly used was in france , in the french revolution of 1789. the guillotine became the only legal way to execute someone in france . the guillotine was used because it caused a quick death . everyone died the same way , no matter what social class you were in , whether you were wealthy or poor . the guillotine was commonly used in france ( including france 's colonies ) , switzerland , italy , belgium , germany , and austria . it was also used in sweden . today , all of these countries have abolished ( legally stopped ) the death penalty . the guillotine is no longer used .
