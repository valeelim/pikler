Magma     in volcanology , magma is melted rock that is under the ground . there are many types of magma . one is called felsic magma . felsic magma is thick and has lots of a mineral called silica . it mostly makes light-coloured rocks . another type is called mafic magma , which is runny and has less silica . it usually makes dark-coloured rocks . a third type is intermediate magma . it is like both the other types . when magma becomes solid it 's usually by cooling slowly , far below the surface . this makes `` plutonic '' rocks such as granite . when magma comes out from the ground in a volcano and it is still melted , it is called lava . lava cools more quickly , and forms other kinds of rock such as basalt .
