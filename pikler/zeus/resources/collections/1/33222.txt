CD-R     a cd-r ( also called compact disc recordable ) is a compact disc that can be recorded once . when people record a compact disc , they put either music or data on it . a compact disc that can be recorded multiple times ( and erased ) is the cd-rw . when you put data onto a cd , it is called `` burning '' a disc . a laser `` burns '' pits into a dye layer on the disc , making them transparent . these transparent pits can later be read back by the cd drive or audio cd player as data or music . there are three types of dye used in cd-r discs . the most common is phthalocyanine , and it is usually light green . jvc ( formerly taiyo yuden ) uses cyanine dye . it is usually teal or dark green . verbatim uses phthalocyanine dye on some discs , and azo dye on others . azo dye is usually dark blue or blue-ish silver . the metal layer on the disc is usually made of silver . archival discs and some professional audio discs use a gold top layer . verbatim ultralife discs have a silver main layer , and a gold upper protective layer , providing the reflectivity of silver and the chemical stability of gold . early cyanine discs could decay and become unplayable within a few years . recent cyanine discs have preservatives added to the dye to prevent this from happening . azo and phthalocyanine dyes do not need preservatives and do not decay easily .
