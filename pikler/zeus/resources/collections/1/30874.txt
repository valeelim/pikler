Daft Punk     daft punk is a band from france . there are two people in the band , guy-manuel de homem-christo ( born february 8 , 1974 ) and thomas bangalter ( born january 3 , 1975 ) . daft punk uses analog synthesizers and other real instruments to make their music . both of the two daft punk members went to the same school in paris . they became friends and recorded a demo track with other students from the school . thomas bangalter played bass while guy-manuel de homem-christo played guitar . they formed a band called darlin ' which featured an additional member named laurent brancowitz . the darlin ' experience did not last very long and after a show they performed in the united kingdom , a newspaper qualified the music of thomas and guy-manuel as `` daft punk '' ( silly punk music ) . thomas and guy-manuel were amused by this nickname and officially adopted it , and that 's how they became the well known daft punk . laurent left the group and joined his younger brother christian mazzalai of phoenix . while attending a rave at eurodisney , they met scottish house/techno artists stuart macmillan and orde meikle of slam who signed them up to the label soma quality recordings based in glasgow .
