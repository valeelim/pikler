Void (astronomy)    void ( astronomy ) in astronomy , voids are the empty spaces between filaments . both filaments and voids are one of the largest-scale structures in the universe . there are no or few galaxies in voids . most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 mpc . especially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters . these voids are sometimes called supervoids . a 1994 official counting ( `` the structure of the universe traced by rich clusters of galaxies . `` , see references ) lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 mpc . some of supervoids chosen from the list are given below . other websites . - universe family tree : void references . 1. u. lindner , j. einasto , m. einasto , w. freudling , k. fricke , e. tago : `` the structure of supervoids . i. void hierarchy in the northern local supervoid . `` , astron . astrophys. , v.301 , p.329 ( 1995 ) 1. m. einasto , j. einasto , e. tago , g. b. dalton , h andernach : `` the structure of the universe traced by rich clusters of galaxies . `` , mon . not . r. astron . soc . 269 , 301 ( 1994 )
