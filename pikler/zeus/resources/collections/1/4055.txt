Cloud     a cloud is water vapour in the atmosphere ( sky ) that has condensed into very small water droplets or ice crystals that appear in visible shapes or formations above the ground . water on the earth evaporates ( turns into an invisible gas ) and rises up into the sky . higher up where the air is colder , the water condenses : it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice . we see these drops of water as clouds . the drops fall back down to earth as rain , and then the water evaporates again . this is called the `` water cycle '' . the atmosphere always has some water vapour . clouds form when the atmosphere can no longer hold all the invisible air vapor . any more water vapor condenses into very small water drops . warm air holds more water vapor than cool air . so if warm air with lots of water inside cools , it can form a cloud . these are ways air can cool enough to form clouds : - when air close to the ground is heated by the sun and rises to where the air is colder . - along weather fronts warmer air is cooled as it runs into colder air ;
