Observatory     an observatory is a place for making observations . usually it means a building that holds one or many big telescopes . observatories are used by astronomers to look at the sky . modern observatories are usually high up on mountains or hills , because they need clear and clean air to be able to see properly . the higher you go , the clearer , dryer and cleaner the air gets . observatories also have to be away from places that have lots of light pollution , like cities . too much light can make it so that the astronomers can not see out of the telescope very well .
