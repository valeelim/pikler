Time limit     a time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once . it may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics . for instance , if poor people and rich people are debating something , a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people can not keep debating until the poor people have to go to work , and lose . time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results ( for tax and investment purposes ) at the same time . this in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting . however , the deadline is imposed by an authority , whereas the time limit is imposed by a system . so there can be slack in a deadline , so that results do not have to be reported always very fast . for example , in the united states of america , the end of the calendar year on december 31 is the time limit for taxes , but the deadline for reporting is april 15. sometimes the government allows more time , as it did for the families of those who were killed in the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
