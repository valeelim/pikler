Compiler     a compiler is a computer program that translates instruction text into a different language of instruction text . the first language is called the source language , which is why instruction text is called source code . the second language , called the target , is usually for the computer to follow . in that case , the instructions become machine code . if a compiler can convert the same instruction text into machine code for different computers ( like smartphones or video game machines ) , it is a 'cross-compiler ' . if the compiler can make instruction text that is easier for people to read , it is a 'de-compiler ' . people who write these instructions are called programmers . some even made programs that can translate the instructions that describe how a compiler should work , into a compiler . that kind of program is called a compiler-compiler . a compiler usually has three steps . it reads the text and makes notes about how the words and sentences go together . if the words do n't make sense , it will try to tell the programmer . then it will use what it knows about the target language to make the instructions fit better . it then writes down the instructions in the target language . if the source instructions are on different pages , it may have to compile several before it can write everything down .
