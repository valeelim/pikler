Flatfish     flatfish are a type of fish . there are several different kinds of flatfish . some of them are fished commercially , like flounder , sole , turbot , plaice , and halibut . all flatfish are rather flat , and have rays . they swim sideways . some can hide on the ocean floor , waiting for prey . they have a capacity for dynamic camouflage , which is under nervous control , and can change in 'real time ' . the order pleuronectiformes is in the infraclass teleostei . but it is best to look upon it as a group of fish which are adapted to the same habitat . they share those features which suit their life-style . they have both eyes on one side of the head : the upper side . this is their main adaptation to living on the seabed ( benthos ) . other distinguishing features are the protrusible eyes : they can stick the eyes up a bit to see round . the flatfish life-style or 'habit ' evolved several times independently , and so the group is polyphyletic . their young are perfectly symmetrical , but the head is remodelled during a metamorphosis . one eye moves to the other side , close to the other eye . some species have both eyes on the left ( turbot ) , some on the right ( halibut , sole ) ; all living and most fossil flatfish to date show an 'eyed ' side and a 'blind ' side .
