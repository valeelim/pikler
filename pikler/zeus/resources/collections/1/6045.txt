ELISA     the elisa method ( enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay ) is a technique used in biochemistry to determine if a certain substance -- such as a specific cytokine or antigen -- is present within a sample . it is sometimes abbreviated as `` eia . '' this technique uses special antibodies that attach themselves to the substance . these antibodies generate a specific color . the amount of color indicates the amount of substance present . ( sometimes , the substance must be viewed under ultraviolet light for the antibodies to generate this color . ) another set of antibodies are used to `` capture '' the substance . these antibodies adhere to both the substance and the testing container , thus holding the substance in place . a more sophisticated and sensitive technique , the elispot method , was derived from the elisa techique . other websites . - an animated illustration of an elisa assay - image of a microtiter plate , such as is commonly used in elisa tests
