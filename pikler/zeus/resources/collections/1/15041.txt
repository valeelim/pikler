Skinhead     skinheads , named after their short haircuts , are members of a subculture that originated in britain in late 1960s , where they were closely tied to the rude boys and the mods . they shave their heads , because originally most of them were workers in factories and they had to be bald , so their hair could not get caught in the machines . traditional skinheads identify with the original skinhead movement ( `` the spirit of '69 '' ) in music , style , and/or working class pride . skinheads listen to ska , rocksteady , reggae , oi ! and punk music . people who are not part of the group often see skinheads as being politically close to the neo-nazi ( or white power ) movement . often skinheads are seen as part of that movement . this is wrong , given that there are many young people in the movement who have no political views at all . many skinheads are also not violent , unless they are provoked . other websites . - libcom.org : a brief history of skinhead culture - reggae , reggae , reggae the skinhead movement and reggae music
