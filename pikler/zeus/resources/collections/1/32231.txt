IEEE 1394     ieee 1394 is the name for a set of standards . the standards specify a serial bus which can be used to transfer information . other names for the standards include firewire , i.link and lynx . the standard is often used to connect a computer to an external device , like a hard drive or digital camcorder . it also has uses to transfer data in cars and airplanes . it is similar to usb . firewire replaced scsi for many applications : making a device understand firewire is easier than having it understand scsi ; handling firewire cables is also much easier than scsi cabling . `` firewire '' is popular in industrial systems for machine vision and professional audio systems . it is preferred over the more common usb because of its greater effective speed and power distribution capabilities , and because it does not need a computer host . perhaps more importantly , `` firewire '' makes full use of all scsi ( older connecting possibility ) capabilities . compared to usb 2.0 , it usually has higher data transfer rates . this feature is important for audio and video editors .
