Bacteria     bacteria ( sing . bacterium ) are very small organisms . they are prokaryotic microorganisms . bacterial cells do not have a nucleus , and most have no organelles with membranes around them . most have a cell wall . they do have dna , and their biochemistry is basically the same as other living things . they are amongst the simplest and the oldest organisms . they function as independent organisms . almost all bacteria are so tiny they can only be seen through a microscope . bacteria are made up of one cell , so they are a kind of `` unicellular organism '' . they are among the simplest single-celled organisms on earth , and were one of the earliest forms of life . they include a number of extremophiles which live in extreme habitats . there are probably more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet . most bacteria live in the ground or in water , but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms , including humans . there are about ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies . some bacteria can cause diseases , but others help us in everyday activities like digesting food ( gut flora ) . some even work for us in factories , producing cheese and yogurt .
