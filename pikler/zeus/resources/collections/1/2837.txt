Cardboard     cardboard is a heavy type of paper , notable for its stiffness and durability . it was first invented in china some time in the 15th century , and is used for a wide variety of purposes . one of its more common uses is as a packaging material . cardboard boxes were first produced commercially in 1817 in england . corrugated ( also called pleated ) paper was patented in england in 1856 , used as a liner for tall hats , but corrugated cardboard would not be patented and used as a shipping material until 20 december 1871. the patent was issued to albert jones of new york city , new york for single-sided corrugated cardboard . jones used the corrugated cardboard for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys . the first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated cardboard was built in 1874 by g. smyth , and in the same year oliver long improved upon jones ' design by inventing corrugated cardboard with liner sheets on both sides . this was now cardboard as we know it today . american robert gair was a brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s , and while he was printing an order of seed bags a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag . gair discovered that by cutting and creasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons . extending this to corrugated cardboard was a straightforward development when the material became available . by the start of the 20th century , corrugated cardboard boxes began replacing the custom-made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade .
