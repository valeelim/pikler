Eukaryote     a eukaryote is an organism with complex cells , or a single cell with a complex structure . in these cells the genetic material is organized into chromosomes in the cell nucleus . animals , plants , algae and fungi are all eukaryotes . there are also eukaryotes amongst single-celled protists . in contrast , simpler organisms , such as bacteria and archaea , do not have nuclei and other complex cell structures . such organisms are called prokaryotes . the eukaryotes are often treated as a superkingdom , or domain . eukaryotes evolved in the proterozoic eon . the oldest known probable eukaryote is `` grypania '' , a coiled , unbranched filament up to 30mm long . the oldest `` grypania '' fossils come from an iron mine near negaunee , michigan . the fossils were originally dated as 2100 million years ago , but later research showed the date as about 1874 million years ago . `` grypania '' lasted into the mesoproterozoic era . another ancient group is the acritarchs , believed to be the cysts or reproductive stages of algal plankton . they are found 1400 million years ago , in the mesoproterozoic era .
