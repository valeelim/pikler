Free software     free software is software that anyone may run , share , and change , at any time , for any reason . the opposite of free software is proprietary software . in 1984 , richard stallman started the free software movement when he began the gnu project . free software is very similar , but different from open source software . people who use the name “ free software ” more , say that they use it because they think every human must have the right to - use the things that they have how they want - learn how the things that they have work , and change them so they are more useful - give ( or sell ) a thing that they have to a good friend or neighbor , or to many friends and neighbors ; - change and fix ( correct ) the things that they have , and help other people to do the same , so that they do not need to do it themselves in secret when somebody else already did it and can help . people who use the name “ open source ” more , say that they use it because the authors of such software allow others to look at the software and change it , so the others will then help the authors make the software better .
