Cider     cider ( or cyder ) is a drink made from fruit juice , most often from apples . in europe and oceania it is an alcoholic drink that is made from apple juice , through a process called fermentation . in the united states and parts of canada , cider containing alcohol is called hard cider or alcoholic cider , while `` cider '' or `` apple cider '' means less-sweet , usually unfiltered , apple juice . in the united states and canada people drink a special kind of cider around halloween and thanksgiving . this cider is usually unfiltered , rather thick , and it is often heated and spiced with cinnamon before drinking it . this is different from the cider in europe , which usually is not heated . usually to make cider , apples with a high concentration of tannins are chosen . the fermentation of the apples takes place at around 4-15Â° celsius . the temperature influences the duration of the fermentation . the temperature at which the fermentation occurs also has an effect on the taste of the cider . shortly before all the sugar has been fermented away , the cider is put in a new barrel which is made air-tight . the rest of the sugar will then become carbonic acid . this will also add to the life-span of the cider ( no pasteurisation is needed ) .
