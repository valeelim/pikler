Pet door     pet doors , also known as cat doors , dog doors , doggie doors , or in the united kingdom , cat flaps , are small doors for pets . they are usually built in regular doors , but can also be in windows or walls . they usually have the hinge on the top , with no latch , so the animal can push their way in and out . newer models sometimes only let the pet go outside , but not inside . others have a latch and something that can be put on the pet that makes the latch open when the pet gets close to the door . they are most commonly used for pet cats , but can also be used for dogs , miniature pigs , or other small pets . the pet door was developed by isaac newton .
