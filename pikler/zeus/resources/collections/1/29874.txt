James MacMillan     james macmillan ( born july 16 , 1959 ) is the most important scottish composer of today . macmillan was born at kilwinning , north ayrshire , scotland . he studied music at the universities of edinburgh and durham . he writes a lot of his music for the scottish chamber orchestra and helps them to take music out to schools so that children can listen and join in with his music . three of his most important compositions are : `` the confession of isobel gowdie '' ( 1990 ) which is music about a woman who lived at the time when people believed that a lot of women were witches . in 1662 isobel gowdie was accused and tried for witchcraft . what is remarkable about her case is the fact that she confessed without torture , and there is no record of an execution ; she walked away after confessing . what is even more remarkable about her case is the fact that she did not pander to distorted christian ideas of witchcraft and the worship of satan . she spoke about true shamanism that is still in practice today.she spoke of what would be known today as astral travel , and other such beliefs and practices . most famously , she spoke of her soul being transformed into that of a hare .
