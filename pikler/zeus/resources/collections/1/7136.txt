Quantum mechanics     quantum mechanics ( qm ) is the part of physics that tells us how the things that make up atoms work . qm also tells us how electromagnetic waves ( like light ) work . it is also called `` quantum physics '' or `` quantum theory '' . qm is a mathematical framework ( rules written in maths ) for much of modern physics and chemistry . quantum mechanics helps us make sense of the smallest things in nature like protons , neutrons and electrons . complex mathematics is used to study subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves because they act in very strange ways . quantum mechanics is important to physics and chemistry . `` quantum '' is a latin word that means 'how much ' . so a quantum of energy is a specific amount of energy . light sources such as candles or lasers shoot out ( or `` emit '' ) light in bits called photons . photons are like packets . each one has a certain little bit of energy . photons are particles much smaller than atoms . the more photons a lamp shoots off , the brighter the light . light is a form of energy that behaves like the waves in water or radio waves . the distance between the top of one wave and the top of the next wave is called a 'wavelength . ' each photon carries a certain amount , or 'quantum ' , of energy depending on its wavelength .
