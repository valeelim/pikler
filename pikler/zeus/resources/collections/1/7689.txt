Henry VIII of England     henry viii ( 28 june 1491 â€“ 28 january 1547 ) was the king of england from 1509 until his death . he is perhaps one of england 's most famous monarchs because he and thomas cranmer the archbishop of canterbury split from the roman catholic church and the pope , and he married six times . henry was born at greenwich palace on 28 june 1491 , as the second son of henry vii of england and elizabeth of york . he had an elder brother , who was called arthur , prince of wales , and two sisters , who were called margaret and mary . arthur should have been king after their father died , but he died before his father , making henry next in line for the throne . henry married arthur 's widow , catherine of aragon . he is credited as a talented composer and author . however , king henry viii was famously unpredictable and temperamental with many of his subjects executed under his orders , including two of his own wives . his physical decline dominated his later reign and he became hugely obese . as he lay dying in 1547 , henry 's last words are reported to have been `` monks monks monks '' , with certain historians believing it a reference to the monks he evicted during the dissolution of the monasteries . he died at the age of 55 in 1547 , on the day which would have been his father king henry vii 's 90th birthday
