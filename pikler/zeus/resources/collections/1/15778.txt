Fermat's Last Theorem    fermat 's last theorem fermat 's last theorem is a very famous idea in mathematics . it says that : pierre de fermat wrote about it in 1637 inside his copy of a book called `` arithmetica '' . he said `` i have a proof of this theorem , but there is not enough space in this margin '' . however , no correct proof was found for 357 years . mathematicians everywhere think that fermat , in fact , did not have a good proof of this theorem . fermat 's last theorem is a more general form of the equation : formula_2 . ( this comes from the pythagorean theorem ) . a special case is when a , b , and c are whole numbers . then they are named a `` pythagorean triple '' . there are an infinite number of them ( they go on forever ) . fermat 's last theorem talks about what happens when the 2 changes to a bigger whole number . it says that then there are no triples when a , b , and c are integers greater than or equal to one ( meaning that if n is more than three , a , b and c can not be natural numbers ) . the proof was made for `` some '' values of n ( like `` n '' =3 , `` n '' =4 , `` n '' =5 and `` n '' =7 ) . fermat , euler , sophie germain , and other people did this .
