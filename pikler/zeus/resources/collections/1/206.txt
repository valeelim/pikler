Dictionary     a dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or , more precisely , lexemes . the words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly . the word “ dictionary ” comes from the latin “ dictio ” ( “ saying ” ) . there are several types of dictionaries : dictionaries which explain words and how they are used , dictionaries which translate words from one language to another , dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people , technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject ( sometimes called a thesaurus ) . some of these come close to being an encyclopedia , but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things ( knowledge ) and does not explain the use of the language . an encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does , but more than a simple dictionary . dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear `` definition '' of the word ( e.g . hippopotamus : a hoofed mammal with thick skin , large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of africa . )
