RSA (algorithm)    rsa ( algorithm ) rsa is algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages . it is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm . asymmetric means that there are two different keys . this is also called `` '' , because one of them can be given to everyone . the other key must be kept private . it is based on the fact that finding the factors of an integer is hard ( the factoring problem ) . rsa stands for , and , who first publicly described it in 1978. a user of rsa creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers , along with an auxiliary value , as their public key . the prime factors must be kept secret . anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message , but with currently published methods , if the public key is large enough , only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message . rsa involves a public key and private key . the public key can be known to everyone ; it is used to encrypt messages . messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key . the keys for the rsa algorithm are generated the following way :
