'science ' also refers to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process . research uses the scientific method . scientific research uses hypotheses based on ideas or earlier knowledge . then those hypotheses are tested by experiments . people who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called scientists . scientists study things by looking at them very carefully , by measuring them , and by doing experiments and tests . scientists try to explain why things act the way they do , and predict what will happen . today , `` science '' usually refers to a way of pursuing knowledge , not just the knowledge itself . it is mainly about the phenomena of the material world . in the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of `` laws of nature '' such as newton 's laws of motion . and over the course of the 19th century , the word `` science '' became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself , as a way to study the natural world , including physics , chemistry , geology and biology .
