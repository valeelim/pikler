Spirit     a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body . other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost . when a body is alive , it has a spirit in it . death is when the spirit separates from the body . christians believe that spirits exist in heaven or hell . ( see 1 timothy 3:16 , 4:1 ) spiritualists believe that spirits can talk with people , or change things in the world . many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way , ( see leviticus 19:31 ) but a few include this as part of their practice . another use of `` spirit '' means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document . for example , the `` spirit of a law '' is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted . this phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing , but a judge must decide what meaning is correct .
