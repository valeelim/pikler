Sphere     a sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball . most of the time , the terms ball and sphere are used as the same . but in mathematics , the precise ( exact ) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere . examples of these are basketballs , superballs , and playground balls . a sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle . the volume ( v ) of a sphere is given by the following formula where `` r '' is the radius of the sphere . the surface area ( a ) of a sphere is given by the following formula where `` r '' is the radius of the sphere . in cartesian co-ordinates , the equation for a sphere with a center at ( x , y , z ) is as follows : formula_3 where r is the radius of the sphere .
