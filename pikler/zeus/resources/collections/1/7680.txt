Public domain     public domain is a phrase that describes something that belongs to all people in general : the public . the `` opposite '' of `` public domain '' is copyrighted material , which is owned either by the creator of the work or his estate . the term `` public domain '' is only used to describe things such as photographs , drawings , written articles , books or plays , or similar works of art . as a general rule , all intellectual works , after enough time has gone by , will become part of public domain . actual examples include the works of leonardo da vinci , shakespeare and beethoven , the king james bible , and the books of isaac newton . a work can enter the public domain in many ways . in some cases , if a work enters the public domain after copyright expiration , anyone using the work may still be required to note who created the work . even if some works are in the public domain due to not being copyrighted , there may be still non-copyright usage restrictions . for examples , even though the design of national currencies may be ineligible , or be unsuitable , for copyright , counterfeiting them for fraud is widely a very serious crime .
