Great Britain     great britain is an island in the northwest part of europe . it is the biggest island on the continent , located just off the shore of france , west of the netherlands , and north of spain . great britain is part of the sovereign state called the united kingdom , and contains three of its four countries : england , scotland , and wales . england , the biggest part of the island , is in the southeast , and its capital city is london , which is also the capital of the uk . scotland is to the north of england , and its capital is edinburgh . wales is to the west of england , and its capital is cardiff . great britain is not the name of the country itself . many people call the uk `` great britain '' or `` england '' , and british people who do not live in these areas may not like it if other people make this mistake . west of great britain is a smaller island called ireland . ireland contains the republic of ireland , which is a country in itself , as well as northern ireland . northern ireland is not a part of the island of great britain , but it is part of the united kingdom . this is why great britain is not the same as the united kingdom , because northern ireland , which is one of its four constituent countries , is not part of great britain . together with some other islands , ireland and great britain form the british isles .
