Superlative     a superlative , in grammar , is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality . in other words , a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other . some examples : - the `` coldest '' day ( i.e . the best example of a cold day , or the day that is colder than all the others ) - the `` craziest '' man - the `` fluffiest '' cloud in english , most superlatives can be formed by adding -est to an existing adjective , like the examples above . ( for adjectives that end in `` -y '' , like `` crazy '' , you often change the `` y '' to an `` i '' before you add the -est on the end . ) some adjectives have irregular superlative forms , which do not follow the rules , such as far ( `` farthest '' ) . other adjectives have no superlative form at all , and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb `` most '' before the adjective . for instance , you do not say `` funnest , '' or `` interestingest '' . instead , you say `` most fun , '' and `` most interesting . '' this way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in `` ing '' ( like `` interesting '' , `` fascinating '' , `` disgusting '' or `` appealing '' . )
