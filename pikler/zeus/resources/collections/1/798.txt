State     in modern politics , a state is an association which has control over a geographic area or territory . states are seen as having three main pieces : - a territory - a people - some institutions ( which have the power to make rules ) . there are different forms of government a state can have , for example a republic or a monarchy . sometimes states form their own countries . at other times many states work together to form a country ( like the united states ) . most states also have armed forces , civil service , law and police . the earliest states were just human settlements . a group of farmers and merchants working together could be 'states ' since people can control them and protect them . more organized states could be monarchies such as early egypt under the pharaoh . following this were larger more military-based states such as the babylonian empire or roman empire . the most famous early states , however , were the ancient greek states which had freedom , writing and a democracy . when the military-based state , the roman empire , fell , lots of little states were made and each was also military-based and controlled by a king . these states did not often work together and war raged . however , once people within the state itself started fighting ( what 's called a civil war ) , the kings had to make peace and start parliaments .
