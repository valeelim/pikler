Richter scale     the richter magnitude scale is a scale of numbers used to tell the size of earthquakes . charles richter developed the richter scale in 1935. his scale was based on the seismogram measured by a particular type of `` seismometer '' at a distance of 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) from the earthquake . earthquakes 4.5 or higher on the richter scale can be measured by tools all over the world . the scale is logarithmic , with a base of 10. the amplitude of an earthquake that scores 3.0 is about 10 times the amplitude of one that scores 2.0. the energy that is released increases by a factor of about 32. the earthquake with the biggest recorded magnitude was the great chilean earthquake . it had a magnitude of 9.5 ( approximately 9.5 on the richter scale ) and occurred in 1960. about 6,000 people died because of the earthquake . other pages . - mercalli intensity scale other websites . - simplified description of the richter scale
