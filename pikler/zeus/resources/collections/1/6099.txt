Gill     gills are what fish , amphibians , and some other animals use to breathe in water . they have feathery parts which cause water to move across the animal 's body , which contains dissolved oxygen , after the animal has swallowed the water . the oxygen is absorbed into the animal 's blood , causing carbon dioxide moves out of the animal 's blood and into the water through the gills . fish and frog gills are hidden on the sides of their heads . sharks have many gills slits on their necks . baby salamanders have gills that stick out like leaves from their heads . in mushrooms , gills are the spore-bearing structure in agarics ( gilled mushrooms ) while fish and some young amphibians use them to get oxygen others breath . some insects that live in water have a plastron , which is a kind of gill . it is a patch of special hairs that keeps the water away from the insect 's spiracles . this allows them to continue to take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide while they are under water .
