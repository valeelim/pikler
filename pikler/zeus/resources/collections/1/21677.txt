Four color theorem     the four color theorem is a theorem of mathematics . it says that in any plane surface with regions in it ( people think of them as maps ) , the regions can be colored with no more than four colors . two regions that have a common border must not get the same color . they are called `` adjacent '' ( next to each other ) if they share a segment of the border , not just a point . this was the first theorem to be proved by a computer , in a `` proof by exhaustion '' . in proof by exhaustion , the conclusion is established by dividing it into cases , and proving each one separately . the number of cases sometimes may be very large . for example , the first proof of the four color theorem was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases . this proof was controversial because most of the cases were checked by a computer program , not by hand . the shortest known proof of the four color theorem today still has over 600 cases . even though the problem was first presented as a problem to color political maps of countries , mapmakers are not particularly interested in it . according to an article by the math historian kenneth may , “ maps utilizing only four colors are rare , and those that do usually require only three . books on cartography and the history of map making do not mention the four-color property . ”
