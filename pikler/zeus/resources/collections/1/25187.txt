Adrenal gland     the adrenal gland is a gland in most mammals . it is near the kidneys . its name tells its position ( `` ad '' – `` near '' , and `` renes '' – `` kidneys '' ) . the adrenal gland makes hormones which control stress . it is involved in the production of steroid hormones . among these hormones are cortisol and adrenaline . the gland is made up of two types of tissues : the centrally located tissue is called the adrenal medulla and outside this lies the adrenal cortex . the adrenal glands are known as `` suprarenal glands '' in humans . in many animals the glands are next to the kidneys , but they are cap-like structures on top of the kidneys in humans . the hormones secreted from the cortex region are called adrenocorticosteroids or corticoids . these are the hormones it makes : - corticosteroids : all corticosteroids are made from cholesterol . - cortisol / cortisone . these two are in a reversible reaction : they can be changed to each other by an enzyme . cortisol is the active version , cortisone is the inactive version .
