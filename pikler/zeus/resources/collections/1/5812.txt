Organism     an organism is any individual living thing . it is easy to recognize a living thing , but not so easy to define it . animals and plants are organisms , obviously . organisms are a biotic , or living , part of the environment . rocks and sunshine are parts of the non-living environment . organisms usually have five basic needs . they need air , water , nutrients ( food ) , energy and a place to live . however , not all living things need all these at the same time . many organisms do not need access to air at all . a little thought is needed about viruses . there is no agreement as to whether they should be regarded as living . they are made of protein and nucleic acid , and they evolve , which is a really important fact . however , they exist in two quite different phases . one phase is dormant , not active . the other is inside a living cell of some other organism . then the virus is very active reproducing itself . consider the parallel with a computer program . when in use it is active ; when it is not , it is completely inactive . it is still a program all the same .
