Shape     a shape is a geometric figure that can be described with mathematics . one way to classify shapes is to describe a bigger kind of shape that the shape is one of . for example , they can be classified by their different numbers of dimensions . thus , circles are two-dimensional shapes so , like other 2d shapes , they will fit into a flat plane . three-dimensional objects like cubes will not fit inside a plane , because they are not flat . four-dimensional shapes made of polygons are called polychorons , and shapes made of polygons of any dimension are polytopes . two shapes are said to be equal , if one can be changed into the other by turning , moving , growing , shrinking , or more than one of these in combination . 2d shapes . - circles - triangles - ovals - quadrilaterals - squares - rectangles - octagons - hexagons - pentagons - heptagon these are two-dimensional shapes or flat plane geometry shapes . their sides are made of straight or curved lines . they can have any number of sides . plane figures made of lines are called polygons . triangles and squares are examples of polygons .
