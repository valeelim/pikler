Cell membrane     the cell membrane is a thin flexible layer around the cells of all living things . it is sometimes called the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane . its basic job is to separate the inside of cells from the outside . in all cells , the cell membrane separates the cytoplasm inside the cell from its surroundings . in animal cells , that is all there is . bacteria , fungi and plants have cell walls as well , which support the cell and block the passage of large molecules . the membrane is made up of a thin layer called the 'phospholipid bilayer ' . this has two layers of phospholipid molecules with phosphate heads on the surfaces and lipid ( oil ) tails on the inside . the outside heads mix with water , but the tails reject water . other proteins and lipids can be added to the cell membrane . by these changes , the cell can adjust what it brings in or puts out . some proteins are always stuck into it , these are called `` integral '' membrane proteins . it also has some which are only sometimes stuck onto it . these are called peripheral membrane proteins .
