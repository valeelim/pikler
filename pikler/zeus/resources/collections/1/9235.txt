Astrophysics     astrophysics is the study of how stars and planets work , and how we can learn about them . astrophysicists use physics to explain what astronomers find and see . astrophysics is also the study of how the universe started and how it is changing with time . this part of astrophysics is called cosmology . for a long time bodies in the sky seemed to be unchanging spheres moving in a circle . but on earth growth and decay happened , and natural motion was in a straight line . therefore , people thought the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found on earth . during the 16th and 17th century , natural philosophers such as nicolaus copernicus , johannes kepler , galileo , descartes , and newton , began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws . when they were able to work out how the planets moved , the science of astrophysics was born . sir isaac newton realized that the same rules of mechanics that he had found on the surface of the earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved . he said , `` as above , so below . '' by this , he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space .
