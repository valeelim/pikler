Early Middle Ages     the roman empire ruled much of europe in ancient history . it became weaker and finally collapsed in 476. when it collapsed , its army stopped working and its communication systems ( ways of people in different places talking to each other ) also stopped working . this made the people in europe unable to talk to each other and share news and facts . because the roman army had kept peace between different parts of europe and defended it from other people , and the roman army had now collapsed , there was much fighting . this time was known as the dark ages . a famous person in the dark ages was king arthur of england . we do not know if he was real or just a myth . there is a legend that he stopped the fighting in england and made peace . after the dark ages , there was the middle ages . it is called the `` middle '' ages because it was between ancient history and modern history . it can also be called medieval times . it was a time when europe was christian , and the catholic church was very powerful . the middle ages ended when the renaissance started . during the renaissance people began going to school and university more and learning more things . there was less fighting . the printing press was also made . this was a machine that made books easily and quickly . it made it easier for people to read and learn things .
