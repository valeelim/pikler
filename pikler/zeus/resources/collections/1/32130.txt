Robot     a robot is an artificial agent , meaning it acts as a substitute for a person , doing things it is designed for . robots are usually machines controlled by a computer program or electronic circuitry . they may be directly controlled by humans . they may be designed to look like humans , in which case their behaviour may suggest intelligence or thought . most robots do a specific job , and they do not look like humans . they can come in many forms . in fiction , however , robots usually look like people , and seem to have a life of their own . there are many books , movies , and video games with robots in them . isaac asimov 's `` i , robot '' is perhaps the most famous . people have been interested in building machines to do work for us for a long time . but it takes time and money to build just one machine , so early ideas stayed ideas , or were built to make rich people laugh . leonardo da vinci designed a man-shaped machine to look like a knight in 1464. it would be controlled with ropes and wheels . other engineers and dreamers drew mechanical men . in1920 , karel ƒçapek wrote a story about them , and he used a word from czech that is connected with 'work ' : robot .
