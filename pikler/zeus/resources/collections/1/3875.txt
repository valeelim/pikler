Precipitation     precipitation is a form of water from the atmosphere . it is a term in meteorology , and includes rain , snow , sleet , dew , frost , and hail . these form from atmospheric water vapour , and fall under gravity . fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions . in that case , the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . if liquid , precipitation can be measured using a rain gauge . the most common form of solid precipitation is snow . snow is made when temperatures are so cold that water vapor changes directly to solid crystals . frozen rain is hail or sleet .
