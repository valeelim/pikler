Original sin     the concept of original sin refers generally to the christian belief in the universal nature of sin . original sin is considered to be the result of the story of adam and eve in the bible . in that story ( genesis 3 ) , god only made one rule for them : they must not eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil . but the snake told eve , that eating the fruit would make eve like god . eve then persuaded adam to eat the fruit . after they had broken god 's only rule , they were removed from the garden of eden . then genesis tells the story of how their oldest son cain killed his brother abel . based mostly on this and many other stories and passages in the bible and saint paul 's statement in romans 5:12 ( sin entered the world because one man , adam , sinned , and death came because of sin . everyone sinned , so death came to all people. -- niv ) , christians traditionally believe that no human is without sin . more specifically the term `` original sin '' refers to the state of being part of the human race . this was first explained fully by saint augustine in his writings against the pelagians . the eastern orthodox churches do not believe in this specific doctrine of original sin .
