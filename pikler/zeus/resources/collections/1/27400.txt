Blackbird     the blackbird ( `` turdus merula '' , or common blackbird ) is a thrush . it is a member of the passerine songbird family turdidae . it has a huge range across europe , asia , and north africa , and has been introduced to australia and new zealand . it has a number of subspecies across its range . depending on latitude , the common blackbird may be resident , partially migratory or fully migratory . the adult male is black , with a yellow/orange bill ( beak ) . juveniles and females are brown , and less easy to see . blackbirds are easy to find in gardens all over europe and in asia , south of the arctic circle . on average , blackbirds live to be 2.4 years old , but some have been found to be 20 years old . it is a terrific singer , and will breed whenever the weather is right . the male common blackbird defends its breeding territory , chasing away other males or utilising a `` bow and run '' threat display . this is a short run , the head first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously . if a fight between male blackbirds does occur , it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away .
