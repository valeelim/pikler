Reinheitsgebot     the reinheitsgebot is a regulation about the purity of beer . the regulation started in ingolstadt , in bavaria , in germany , in 1516. the regulation says several things : - it says what can be part of beer , and what can not . beer may only contain water , barley , and hops . - it gives a price to beer . this is important for taxation . the price is set to 1-2 pfennigs per ma√ü . some people talk about the `` bavarian '' reinheitsgebot , or the `` german '' reinheitsgebot . they all mean the same thing . there are similar acts in the other states which later became known as germany . the reinheitsgebot is no longer part of german law . it has been replaced by the provisional german beer law , which allows things prohibited in the `` reinheitsgebot '' , such as wheat malt and cane sugar , but which no longer allows unmalted barley . yeast was not a part of beer until louis pasteur discovered what it did during fermentation . this was around the year 1800. brewers ( the people brewing beer ) usually re-used some of the sediments of the fermentation . they took some sediments of an older brew and added those sediments to the next brew .
