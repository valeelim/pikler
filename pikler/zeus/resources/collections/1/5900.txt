Alpha male     an alpha male is the top-ranking male in a mammalian social group . some animals live in a social structure where the most powerful male in the group is decided by either fights or very aggressive battles that sometimes end in death ( in the wild ) . the current alpha male must defend his position from younger members . when he is too old or not strong enough to win , he loses his position in the group . sometimes , he will die or be forced to leave the group . the result of this is that the alpha male usually has more opportunity to mate with the available females . this system developed because strong males will produce young which have a better chance for survival . some animal groups which may have alpha males : - dogs , wolves - lions - apes : chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans - horses - deer alpha male can also refer to a high-ranked man in a human group . this may be in a business setting or sometimes in other competitive areas , like sports . however , this is an extension by metaphor : humans do not have the same mating system as other social mammals . one reason is that the oestrous cycle in humans is different . this has the result that females may be sexually receptive at almost any time . also , humans generally pair off , and alpha males do not have exclusive rights over all females in a group , except in rare circumstances .
