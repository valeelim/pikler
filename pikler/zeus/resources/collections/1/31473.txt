Hypnosis     hypnosis is `` a trance state characterized by extreme suggestibility , relaxation and heightened imagination '' . it is an altered state of consciousness . usually , one person ( the `` hypnotist '' ) talks to another ( the `` subject '' ) in a special way that puts the subject into a trance . while the subject is in this state , he can be influenced by suggestions . the hypnotist can tell him to forget his name , or that the room is hot ( he will start sweating ) , or that he is someone else . hypnotic suggestions may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject , or may be self-administered ( 'self-suggestion ' or 'autosuggestion ' ) . the use of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes is referred to as 'hypnotherapy ' , while its use as a form of entertainment for an audience is known as 'stage hypnosis ' . contrary to a popular misconception—that hypnosis is a form of unconsciousness resembling sleep—some contemporary research suggests that hypnotic subjects are fully awake and are focusing attention , with a corresponding decrease in their peripheral awareness . subjects also show an increased response to suggestions . however , the behaviour of subjects under hypnotism goes so far beyond normal focused attention that the description of `` altered state of consciousness '' is more used .
