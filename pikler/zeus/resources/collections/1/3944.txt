Hubble Space Telescope     the hubble space telescope ( hst ) is one of the most famous telescopes . it is the first optical space observatory telescope . being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground , because the atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches earth . named after the astronomer edwin hubble , the hubble space telescope can observe 24 hours a day . the main mirror is 94.5 inches ( 2.4 meters ) across . the telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else . it actually observes less than 20 % of the time . it was made by both nasa and the esa working together . it is 600 km in space and was launched on april 24 , 1990. it completes a full orbit of earth every 97 minutes . that means it travels at 5 miles ( 10 km ) per second . if you were going this speed on earth , you would be able to get from new york to san francisco in 10 minutes . the hubble itself is the size of a large school bus , but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a space shuttle . it was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality .
