Stellar evolution     stellar evolution is the study of how a star changes over time . stars can change very much between when they are first created and when they run out of energy . because stars can produce light and heat for millions or billions of years , scientists study stellar evolution by studying many different stars in different stages of their life . the stages in a star 's life are : nebula , main-sequence star , red giant and either white dwarf followed by black dwarf , neutron star or black hole . a star starts its life as a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula . this is pulled together by gravity which causes it to heat up . it also starts to spin and to look like a ball . when it gets hot enough , it starts to release energy through nuclear fusion , changing hydrogen to helium . this makes it shine very brightly and become what astronomers think of as a main-sequence star . it may stay a main-sequence star , looking about the same , for billions of years . sooner or later , almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium . this causes the nuclear reaction in the middle of the star to stop and the center will start to get smaller due to the star 's gravity . the layer of the star just outside the center will begin to change hydrogen to helium , releasing energy .
