Book of Esther     esther is the name of a book in the tanakh ( the hebrew bible ) and the old testament , and also its title heroine . it is the basis for the jewish celebration purim . although it is never said who wrote the book of esther , from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written . the author was a jew , because he where the jewish festival came from and from the jewish inside the story . the author probably lived in a persian city , because he knew persian customs well , and does not say anything about the land of judah or jerusalem . the earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told , for instance , about 460 b.c . ( before ezra 's return to jerusalem ) . it is also thought that the festival of purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written . the author 's main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of purim started and to make people remember the saving of the jewish people during king xerxes ' reign . the book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated .
