Horse     horses are mammals of the family `` equidae '' . the common horse is the species equus caballus . it was domesticated from wild horses by humans at least 5000 years ago . they are large , strong animals , and some breeds are used to pull heavy loads . racehorses can gallop up to 30 miles an hour . a male horse is a `` stallion '' , and a female horse is a `` mare '' . the general term for a young horse is `` foal '' . a young female horse is a `` filly '' , and a young male horse is a `` colt '' . a castrated horse is a `` gelding '' . horses have `` hooves '' which need protection by horseshoes from hard or rough ground . the evolution of horses has been well studied . fifty million years ago , there were no horses as we know them now . of the earliest fossil horse , the north american one is called `` eohippus '' , and the eurasian one is called `` hyracotherium '' . both were small animals : `` eohippus '' was the larger of the two at twice the size of a terrier dog . many changes took place between those little animals and today 's horse . these changes are best explained as adaptations to its changing ecological niche . from a small forest-dweller eating nuts and fruit to a larger forest browser eating leaves and small branches . finally , the modern horse is a grazer on open grassland , with different teeth , legs for running and much larger size . major changes happened in the mid-miocene when the climate became cooler , and grassland began to replace forests . this change continued , and several groups of mammals changed from browsers to grazers .
