Logic     logic is the philosophical study of reasoning . logic helps people decide whether something is true or false . a popular example of a syllogism given by aristotle : 1. all men are mortal 1. socrates is a man 1. therefore , socrates is mortal . the same syllogism can be written in a notation : formula_1 is read like `` and '' , meaning both of the two . formula_2 is read like `` or '' , meaning at least one of the two . formula_3 is read like `` implies '' , or `` if ... then ... '' . formula_4 is read like `` not '' , or `` it is not the case that ... '' . parentheses `` ( `` , '' ) '' are added for clarity and precedence ; this means that what is in parenthesis should be looked at before the things outside . this is the same example using logic symbols : and this is the same example using general terms : finally , those talking about `` logic '' talk about `` statements '' . a statement is simply something like `` aristole is human '' or `` all humans are mortal '' . statements have a truth value ; they are either true or false , but not both . mistakes in logic are called `` fallacies '' .
