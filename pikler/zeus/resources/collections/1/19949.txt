Beer Hall Putsch     the beer hall putsch was a failed coup d'Ã©tat in munich , germany between the evening of 8 november and the morning of 9 november 1923. the nazi party under adolf hitler tried to take over the government of bavaria , a state in germany . they began trying to do this by taking several hundred people hostage in a beer hall ( a large building where people got together to drink beer and sometimes listen to political speeches ) . several nazis died when they got into a gun fight with police officers in another part of munich , and hitler then went to prison for eight months . hitler chose to do this for many reasons . the weimar republic of germany was weak because of fighting between right and left-wing parties . inflation had also left the weimar republic with very little support from the people , or money to keep working ( paying bills , or even paying pensions and wages ) . this happened because when germany lost world war i , other countries made germany pay for the entire war , and germany had to make taxes very high so it could pay for the war . this hurt the economy of germany .
