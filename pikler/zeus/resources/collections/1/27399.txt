Differential     differentials are the main focus of differential calculus . ( see differential equation ) . differentials can also be used in automobiles , where they are used for turning , for example , while turning right , the right wheel travels a shorter distance than the left , the differential slows down the wheel so it will not slip . this is because the inside ( right ) wheel is closer to the center of the turn , meaning that it travels on an arc with a shorter radius , thus resulting in less distance traveled .
