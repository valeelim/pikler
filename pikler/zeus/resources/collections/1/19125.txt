Eucharist     the eucharist , also called holy communion , the sacrament , or the lord 's supper , is a kind of religious ritual in many christian churches . it started when jesus christ told his followers to eat bread and drink wine in memory of him , at the last supper . according to the roman catholic church , the eucharist is the true presence of jesus christ , the son of god . during a mass , through the act of transubstantiation , the bread and wine offered change , and are no longer bread and wine . they become the body and blood of jesus christ . the bread and wine do not change appearance , but they are the body and blood of jesus christ , which catholics in good standing ( not in the state of mortal sin ) come and receive christâ€”they consume him . this follows what was said by christ `` eat my body and drink my blood '' ( john ch.6 ) . most protestant denominations believe that this was meant as a symbol , while the catholic church bases its beliefs on the tradition handed down through the church . first century st. ignatius of antioch , disciple of the beloved disciple john , in speaking of `` the heretics plaguing the church '' in their day , wrote : `` they abstain from the eucharist because they do not confess that the eucharist is the flesh of our savior jesus christ '' ( smyrnaeans , 7 ) .
