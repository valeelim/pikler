Caenorhabditis elegans     caenorhabditis elegans is a species of roundworm or nematode . it is important because much research has been done on its genetics and development . `` c. elegans '' is about 1 mm long . the worms are not parasites , they are free-living . they live in soil and feed on bacteria . `` c. elegans '' is a model organism , used to study animal development and behavior . it is the first multicellular organism for which scientists have been able to sequence its whole genome . `` c. elegans '' has two types of sex : hermaphrodite and male . a hermaphrodite makes sperms when its in a larval stage and makes ova in an adult stage . a male can only make sperm . males are a little smaller than hermaphrodites . study using `` c. elegans '' was begun in 1965 by sydney brenner . in laboratories , they are easy to keep alive . at 25Âºc , they spend 14 hours as an embryo . animals like `` c. elegans '' that do not take long to grow and are easy to feed are usually good organisms for research . in 2002 , the nobel prize for medicine was awarded to sydney brenner , robert horvitz , and john sulston for their work on how `` c. elegans 's '' genes cause it to grow and cause some of its cells to die .
