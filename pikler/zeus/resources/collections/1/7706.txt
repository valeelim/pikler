Camera lens     a camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to the film or , in a digital camera , to a computer chip that can sense the light . many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass . the lens makes an image by focusing the light . the majority of cameras only have one lens that users can not change or take out . this is called a `` fixed lens '' design . more expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off , so anyone can take out one lens and put in another . a lens may be simple , or may actually be made of several lenses . photographers can use different lenses ( objectives ) to make different kinds of pictures . for example , a telephoto lens can take a picture of something far away . a wide-angle lens is the opposite . a zoom lens is more versatile ; it can do both . there are many kinds of lenses . the study of lenses and how they work is called optics . lenses for large sheet film cameras are especially difficult to design . cameras and their lenses have been made since the 19th century . some from before world war ii , are still usable today . computers now let engineers make better lenses , though , because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task .
