Progressive rock     progressive rock is a type of rock music with complicated musical technique and composition . this means that the tempo , time signature , and style can change many times in a single song . most normal rock songs follow a very simple pattern in the way they are arranged . this pattern is a verse followed by a chorus , then a different verse , and then the same chorus . progressive rock is more complicated than this , and can require more skill to play . progressive rock was first made in the late 1960 's , but became most popular in the 1970 's . it continues to be popular today , too . progressive rock began in england and spread throughout europe . it remains most popular in europe , but there are several notable american and canadian progressive rock bands . this genre was influenced by classical music and jazz fusion . over the years , different sub-genres of progressive rock have been created , such as symphonic rock , art rock , math rock , and progressive metal . progressive rock artists wished to create music that was not limited to the structures of common popular rock and pop music . they wanted to make rock music that `` progressed '' to the complexity of jazz and classical music by creating a more serious , complex and sophisticated type of rock music . progressive rock bands may have influences from psychedelic rock , folk music , traditional music , world music , and jazz or jazz fusion . it is also referred to as `` prog rock '' as an abbreviation , or as `` hobbit rock '' because of frequent medieval or fantasy themes in the lyrics .
