Half-life (element)    half-life ( element ) the half-life of a substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay . the word `` half-life '' was first used when talking about radioactive elements where the number of atoms get smaller over time . it is now used in many other situations . a geiger-muller detector can be used to measure the half-life ; it is the time when the activity is half of the original . note that half-life is defined as a probability . half-life is the expected value when half the number of atoms have decayed . carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years . taking one atom of c-14 , this will either have decayed after 5730 years , or it will not . but if this experiment is repeated again and again , it will be seen that the atom decays within the half life 50 % of the time . radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei . their nuclei are unstable because the arrangement of protons and neutrons in them are unsteady , making them shake until that they begin to decay and change into completely different types of atoms by releasing certain types of radioactive particles , such as alpha particles , beta particles or gamma rays , and possibly by fissioning into smaller nuclei . this is known as radioactive decay . for example , a radioactive carbon-14 atom releases a beta particle to become nitrogen-14 . as an example of fission decay , a fermium-256 atom can split into xenon-140 and palladium-112 atoms , releasing 4 neutrons in the process .
