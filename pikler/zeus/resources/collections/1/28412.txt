Design pattern     in computer science , a design pattern is an abstract solution to a certain problem . design patterns are used in object oriented programming . they give a possible solution to a problem of designing software . design patterns became popular around the year 1995. they also simplify the language between computer scientists . ideally , a design pattern should be reusable many times . it is like a brick of a house , it can be used for many different problems . one can also build bridges with bricks , not only houses . these examples are actual examples of design patterns as they are in use . they have not been simplified . it is only the language used to describe them that has been made simpler . the flyweight design pattern is used to minimize the use of many similar objects . in a text-processing system each letter can have some attributes like formatting , typeface , and size . while it would be possible to create a new object for each character in the document and give it these attributes , it is extremely expensive .
