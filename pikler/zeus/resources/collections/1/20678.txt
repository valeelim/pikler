Factorization     factorization ( or factorisation ) is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number . these smaller numbers are called factors or divisors . 1 is a factor of all numbers . prime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number . note that since 1 is not prime , it is not included in the prime factorization . for example , 12 can be factorized as 4 × 3. since 4 is not a prime number , that is not its prime factorization . 12 's prime factorization is in fact 3 × 2 × 2. the numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered , for example , starting with the smallest number . for example , 72=2^3*3^2 . the factorization of every number is unique . this generalizes to : 1. every number has a unique prime factorization 1. every prime factorization corresponds to a unique number since finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers , this fact can be used in cryptography .
