Hades     hades , also known as pluto , is the god of the underworld in greek mythology , and the eldest son of the titans kronos and rhea ( mythology ) . he is the god of the greek underworld . in roman mythology he is called orcus . in his roman form not only is he god of the underworld but also the god of riches and despair . hades is the brother of zeus , poseidon , hestia , hera and demeter . he owns the three-headed dog cerberus . cerberus acts somewhat as a guardian of the underworld . persephone is to go there every six months since she ate the seeds of a pomegranate , this is what the ancient greek believes causes the seasons to change . lonely in the underworld , hades saw and fell in love with persephone , who was picking flowers . persephone was the daughter of demeter . hades then arose from the earth and carried persephone into the underworld . at her absence , demeter became anguished and searched the earth for her missing daughter , neglecting her duty of bringing flourishing plants to the mortals . the distressed mortals starved and prayed to zeus , who had no choice but to tell hades to give up persephone .
