Paradox     a paradox is a sentence in logic that can not be true but also can not be false . many famous problems of this kind exist . one of most famous paradoxes is called the liar 's paradox . it is the simple sentence `` this sentence is a lie . '' if the sentence is true , then it is a lie , as it says . but if it is a lie , how can it be true ? a lie can not also be the truth . so the sentence being true makes it a lie . if the sentence is a lie , then it is not as it says , it is true . but that is just what the sentence says . so that makes it true . so the sentence being a lie makes it true . this paradox is not just true in english but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself . this is true of mathematics as well . paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself . another example is the statement that `` there is no cabal '' . only a cabal can know if there is no cabal , so this is either a guess , or , it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist .
