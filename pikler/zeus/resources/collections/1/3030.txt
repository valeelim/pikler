Creative Commons     the creative commons is a non-profit organisation that tries to make creative work available for others to use and share . their website allows copyright holders to give some of their rights to any other people . they still keep some other rights . they do this through licenses and contracts . some of these make the work public domain or open content . they do this because copyright law can stop people sharing information . the project has different free licenses . a person who has copyright can choose which one they want to use when they publish their work . they also provide rdf/xml metadata . these say what the licenses are and make it easier to automatically sort out and find work that has these licenses . they also provide a 'founder 's copyright ' contract . this aims to give the same effects as the original us copyright did . creative commons was officially started in 2001. lawrence lessig is the founder and chairman of creative commons . lessig started it as a way of reaching the goals of his supreme court case , eldred v. ashcroft .
