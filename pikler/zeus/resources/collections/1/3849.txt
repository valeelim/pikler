Safety lamp     a safety lamp is a miner 's lamp with a covered flame that used to be used in coal mines . the first safety lamp was invented by william reid clanny , which used bellows and water to separate gases . later , two newer designs were invented : one was the geordie lamp , made by george stephenson , and the other was the davy lamp , made by sir humphry davy . in 1815 , davy discovered that if a flame was in a lamp , it would not ignite the flammable gases in mines . coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gases like methane that can accumulate ( gather together ) . a lamp with a naked ( exposed ) flame might ignite these flammable gases , causing an explosion , which might kill people . the safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses , reducing the chance of an explosion .
