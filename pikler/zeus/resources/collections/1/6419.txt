Tutankhamun     tutankhamun ( also spelled as tutankhaten and sometimes called king tut ) was a pharaoh of ancient egypt from about 1334 bc to 1323 bc . he became pharaoh of the 18th dynasty ( royal family ) during the new kingdom at 9 years old . tutankhamun was the son of akhenaten and one of akhenaten 's sisters , or perhaps one of his cousins , kiya . tutankhamun ruled for 9 years and died very young , at 19 , so he is known as the boy king . he was married to his half-sister ankhesenamun , daughter of queen nefertiti , his step mother . in 1922 howard carter found tutankhamun 's tomb . in his third year of his reign , tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his father 's reign . he ended the worship of the god aten and restored the god amun to supremacy . the ban on the cult of amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood . the capital was moved back to thebes and the city of akhetaten abandoned . this is when he changed his name to tutankhamun , `` living image of amun '' , reinforcing the restoration of amun .
