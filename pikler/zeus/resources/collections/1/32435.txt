Printing press     the printing press is a machine for printing . it makes many copies of identical pages . the printing press today is used to print books and newspapers . it had a great influence on society , especially western society . it was `` one of the most potent agents ... of western civilisation in bringing together the scattered ideas of thinkers '' . woodcut printing has been done for several centuries . that was whole pages cut into wood , words and pictures . in the 15th century johannes gutenberg improved the process . he used separate alloy letters screwed into a frame . this way a large set of letters could make almost any page for printing . this process was called typesetting . each letter was in a block of metal , fixed in a frame . he could then move paper and ink over it , much like a stamp . this method was called letterpress . the letters would leave ink on the paper in the shape of the letters , creating text or illustrations . bigger and much faster presses were invented in the industrial revolution . the main improvements were made in the 19th century . two ideas altered the design of the printing press entirely . first was the use of steam power to run the machinery . second was the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders . both were done by the german printer friedrich koenig between 1802 and 1818. having moved to london in 1804 , koenig got financial support for his project in 1807. in 1810 , koenig patented a steam press `` much like a hand press connected to a steam engine '' .
