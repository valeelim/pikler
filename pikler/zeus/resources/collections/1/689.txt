Society     society is the term to describe human beings together ( collective , the sum of their social networks and power networks ) . it does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does , but only to those things that everybody acts upon – or refuses to do – quite reliably . because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest , a society is very concerned with its citizenship , rights , ethics , and time limits . these are basic ways to achieve fairness . if they break down badly , people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other , refusing to help each other , or seeing those who have more as cheats . while every society is different , the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same : fraud , theft , violence , war , and occasionally even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a `` race '' of people . a new society may be formed out of only those who still agree , or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one .
