Periodic table     the periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known elements . in the table , the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number . the atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular atom . in the periodic table the elements are arranged into `` periods '' and `` groups '' . a row of elements across the table is called a `` period '' . each period has a number : from 1 to 7. period 1 has only 2 elements in it : hydrogen and helium . period 2 and period 3 both have 8 elements . other periods are longer . elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers . a column of elements down the table is called a `` group '' . there are 18 groups in the standard periodic table . each group has a number : from 1 to 18. elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways , which gives them similar chemical properties ( they behave in similar ways ) . for example , group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms .
