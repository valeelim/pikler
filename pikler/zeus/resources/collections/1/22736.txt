Serial killer     a serial killer is someone who murders several people at different times ( similar killers of more than one person are mass murderers and spree killers ) . the victims are usually people the serial killer does not know , and the killer commits his crimes to get a certain kind of excitement or other feeling . he usually has no practical motive such as robbery or revenge . `` serial killer '' first became a commonly used phrase for this kind of killers in the 1970s . this was the result of the crimes of people like ted bundy and david berkowitz ( `` son of sam '' ) . jack the ripper is thought by many to be one of the first serial killers that many people knew about , even though his victims were killed long before the phrase was invented . a serial killer 's crimes are nearly always alike in some ways . the killer may only attack a certain type of person , for instance women of a certain age or appearance ( young or old , blonde or dark-haired ) . he may always use the same kind of weapon to kill his victims , or may treat them in a certain manner , such as tying them up with the same kind of rope or adhesive tape . some serial killers have had very strange habits which leave evidence of their work at each crime ; for instance albert de salvo , the boston strangler , would tie the cord with which he had strangled a woman around her neck in a special bow . to law enforcement officers a serial killer 's habits are known as his signature , and they are always valuable leads in detecting who he is and capturing him .
