Biology     biology is the science of life and living things , and their evolution . living things include animals , plants , fungi ( such as mushrooms ) , and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea . people who study biology are called biologists . biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work , and what they are like . biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment . it has existed as a science for about 200 years , and was preceded by natural history . biology has many research fields and branches . like all sciences , biology uses the scientific method . this means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves . biology attempts to answer questions such as : `` what are the characteristics of this living thing ? '' ( comparative anatomy ) ; `` how do the parts work ? '' ( physiology ) ; `` how should we group living things ? '' ( classification , taxonomy ) ; `` what does this living thing do ? '' ( behaviour , growth ) ;
