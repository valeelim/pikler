Hydroelectricity     hydroelectricity is electricity produced by movement of water . it is usually made with dams that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water that is pumped there . when the water is released , the pressure behind the dam forces the water down pipes that lead to a turbine . this causes the turbine to turn , which turns a generator which makes electricity . this renewable energy method makes about one sixth of the world 's electricity . it produces less pollution than the fires of steam engines do . some places such as norway and quebec get most of their electricity this way . the way the electricity is produced does not harm the environment as much as fossil fuels like oil or coal do . hydroelectricity is very powerful and safe , and produces no waste . hydroelectricity can be made very quickly . this makes it useful for times when demand for electricity is high . water that has been stored in a reservoir can be released ( let go ) when needed , so the energy can be made quickly . this controllability also makes hydroelectricity a good match for less controllable intermittent energy sources . when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining , hydroelectricity can be created .
