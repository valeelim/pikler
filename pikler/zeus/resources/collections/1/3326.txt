Perimeter     in geometry , perimeter is the distance around a flat object . for example , all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length , so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches ( 2+2+2+2=8 ) . real-life objects have perimeters as well . a football field , including the end zones , is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide . so the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet . the perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference . it may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times `` pi '' . pi is a constant which is equal to 3.14159 ; however , the places to the right of the decimal are endless . the number of places used depend on the accuracy required for the result .
