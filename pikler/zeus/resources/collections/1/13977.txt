Fertilization     fertilization ( british english spelling : fertilisation ) is what happens when a female 's ovum ( or `` egg '' ) joins together with a male 's sperm and they form a zygote . fertilization is also called `` conception '' . biologists call a fertilized egg a zygote . a zygote grows into an embryo . fertilization is important in animals including humans and birds , in plants , fungi , protists , in fact all eukaryotes . fertilization makes a cell with twice as many chromosomes . the eukaryote life cycle must also include meiosis which divides the chromosome number in half . in animals , there are two types of fertilisation , internal and external . internal fertilisation happens in the female body . external fertilisation happens outside of the body . mammals , birds , and reptiles use internal fertilisation . amphibians and most fish use external fertilisation . some animals with internal fertilization give birth to live offspring . others such as birds , most reptiles , and some mammals such as the platypus , lay eggs .
