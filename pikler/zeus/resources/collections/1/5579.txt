Cathedral     a cathedral is a large christian church . it is the seat of a bishop . only those christian denominations that have bishops have cathedrals . cathedrals can be found in the roman catholic , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , anglican as well as some lutheran churches . as cathedrals are the seat of a bishop , they are central church of a diocese . in the greek orthodox church , the terms `` kathedrikos naos '' ( literally : `` cathedral shrine '' ) and `` metropolis '' ( literally `` mother city '' ) are both used to describe the same thing . `` metropolis '' is more common , but both terms are officially used . there are certain variations on the use of the term `` cathedral '' ; for example , some pre-reformation cathedrals in scotland now within the church of scotland still retain the term cathedral , despite the church 's presbyterian polity which does not have bishops . as cathedrals are often particularly impressive buildings , the term is often used incorrectly to refer to any large important church . several cathedrals in europe , such as strasbourg , and in england at york , lincoln and southwell , are referred to as `` minster '' ( german : `` m√ºnster '' ) churches , from latin `` monasterium '' , because the establishments were served by canons living in community or may have been an abbey , prior to the reformation . the other kind of great church in western europe is the abbey .
