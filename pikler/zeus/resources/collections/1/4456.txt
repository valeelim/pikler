Stone Age     the stone age was an ancient time when people made tools from stone . wood , bones , and other materials were also used for tools , but those things do n't last as long , so more stone tools are found . stone ( especially a hard kind of stone called flint ) was used to cut things . the period began with the first stone tools , about 2.7 million years ago . some groups of people were still in the stone age into the 20th century . they also killed animals for food and clothing . they used animal skin for their shelters . the time after the stone age is the bronze age , named after the metal bronze . the stone age ended when people discovered the art of smelting ( making metals ) . the first metal used was copper , followed by bronze . people probably began using bronze instead of just stone in the middle east sometime between 3000 and 2000 bc . the stone age is divided by archaeologists ( people who study relics ) into three sections : paleolithic ( `` old stone '' ) , mesolithic ( `` middle stone '' ) , and neolithic ( `` new stone '' ) . pottery was invented during the neolithic stone age .
