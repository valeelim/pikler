Buddha     a lord buddha is a very holy person in buddhism . the word `` buddha '' means `` enlightened one '' in sanskrit . buddha was born siddhartha gautama . he was the man who started buddhism . sometimes people call him `` the buddha '' . other times , people call any person a buddha if they have found enlightenment . if a person has not found enlightenment yet , but is very close to reaching it , then he is called bodhisattva . in early buddhism , buddha meant only siddhartha gautama . later an idea began that there could be many buddhas : some in the past , some maybe in the present and some in the future . since buddhism tradition thinks buddha is an ideal person , tradition reached a notion of 36 ideal features of buddhas . some of those features are represented on statues of buddhas . some other features , like the feature of their foot , are difficult to be represented on a statue . buddhists believe that the buddha was enlightened , which means that he knew all about how to live a peaceful life and how to not to suffer in an afterlife . they think he never got depressed , frustrated , upset or confused . he is said to have never argued with other people , but just said what was true and useful , out of compassion .
