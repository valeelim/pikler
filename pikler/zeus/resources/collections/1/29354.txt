Recitative     recitative ( italian : “ recitativo ” ) is music which is telling a story quite quickly , as if it were being spoken , `` talky '' . the word means : “ to recite ” i.e . to tell a story . recitative is used in opera , oratorio and cantatas . when opera was invented around 1600 the composers needed to tell the story in music . in recitative the story is sung quickly , with maybe just a harpsichord playing a few chords . after a while , the situation in the story has changed , and the singer can sing an aria which is more interesting musically . when recitative is just accompanied by a keyboard instrument it is called “ recitativo secco ” ( dry recitative ) . sometimes the orchestra joins this . this is called “ recitativo accompagnato ” ( accompanied recitative ) . there are no bar lines in recitative because there is no regular beat . recitative is simple musically , it can sometimes describe the words being sung in quite interesting or amusing ways . sometimes this might be improvised by the harpsichordist . in the 19th century the difference between aria and recitative gradually disappeared . wagner wrote operas where everything had musical interest and the various sections flowed into one another .
