Negentropy     negentropy is reverse entropy . it means things becoming more in order . by 'order ' is meant organisation , structure and function : the opposite of randomness or chaos . one example of negentropy is a star system such as the solar system . another example is life . as a general rule , everything in the universe tends towards entropy . star systems eventually become dead . all energy has gone , and everything in the system is `` at the temperature of the surrounding space '' . the opposite of entropy is negentropy . it is a temporary condition in which certain things are hotter and more highly organised than the surrounding space . this is the second law of thermodynamics : life is considered to be negentropic because it takes things in which have less order , like dead food , and turns it into things with more order , like cells in the body , tissues , and organs . in doing so , it gives off heat . another example of negentropic things are societies , or social systems , because they take disorderly things such as communications , and make them into order which is useful to people .
