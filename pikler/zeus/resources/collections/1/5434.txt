Human science     human science is the science of humans : what makes them different from animals , and their limits , which tend to be the same as those of other animals . because human bodies are animal bodies , human science is part of biology which leads to life science . however human behaviour includes the use of words , measures , numbers , knowing time and having memory , and such habits as trade - thus economics and psychology are considered to be part of human science . a general human science is anthropology which studies only the differences between humans and near relatives . one important debate in human science is whether the exchange of culture ( or in economics instructional capital ) , is only among humans or if it also goes on among our great ape near relatives . if so , then culture is part of primatology and there is no clear line between human science and life sciences . another name for human science is social science , since the most complex thing about humans is how they relate to each other in society . the most general social science is ethics , or economics , depending on your point of view .
