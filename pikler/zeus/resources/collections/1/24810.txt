Aesop     aesop , or æsop ( from the greek `` αἴσωπος '' `` aisopos '' ) , known only for his fables , was by tradition a slave of african descent who lived from about 620 to 560 bc in ancient greece . aesop 's fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for various entertainments , especially children 's plays and cartoons . aesop wrote thousands of fables , his most famous fable is the lion and the mouse . nothing was known about aesop from credible records . the tradition was that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of delphians . in fact , the obscurity shrouding his life has led some scholars to deny his existence altogether . his most famous fable in america is a parable of the tortoise and the hare . in this story , a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race . the rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result , depending on the version of the story , in some way completes the race slower than the turtle . often , the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks . the persistent tortoise , despite being slower , wins because it persevered .
