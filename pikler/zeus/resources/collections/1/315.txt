Geometry     geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size , shapes , positions and dimensions of things . there are flat ( 2d ) shapes and solid ( 3d ) shapes in geometry . squares , circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry . cubes , cylinders , cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry . plane geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape . solid geometry can also measure a solid shape 's volume and surface area . geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things . for example , geometry can help people find : - the surface area of a house , so they can buy the right amount of paint - the volume of a box , to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food - the area of a farm , so it can be divided into equal parts - the distance around the edge of a pond , to know how much fencing to buy . geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people . the word `` geometry '' means `` to measure the land '' . it has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics . the greek mathematician euclid wrote the first book about geometry . geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics .
