Atmospheric pressure     atmospheric pressure is a force in an area pushed against a surface by the weight of air in earth 's atmosphere . the earth is covered in a layer of air . however , this layer is not distributed evenly around the globe . at different times , the layer of air is thicker in some places than in others . where the layer of air is thicker , there is more air . since there is more air , there is a higher pressure in that spot . where the layer of air is thinner , there is a lower atmospheric pressure . the higher the altitude , the thinner the air is , and the lower the atmospheric pressure is . this is because high places do not have as much air above them , pushing down . barometers can be used to measure atmospheric pressure . there is the same atmospheric pressure from all directions . the si unit for pressure is hpa . other units such as bar ( unit ) and torr are used for various applications . other websites . - atmospheric pressure citizendium
