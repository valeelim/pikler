Legend     legends are usually very old stories with little or no evidence to prove them . legends are often passed on by word-of-mouth . they are very similar to myths . legends can also be famous or historically significant people , places , art , etc . we sometimes say of someone who is extremely famous that they are a `` legend '' or `` of legendary fame '' . examples of legends are ali baba , the fountain of youth , and the loch ness monster . some legends are stories about real people ; others are not . robin hood for example might have been real but most the stories about him are definitely fiction . for some places , legends are the earliest history . for example , the origin of ancient rome is known only from legends , as are the earliest dynasties in the history of china .
