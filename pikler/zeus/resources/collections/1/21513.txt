Game theory     game theory is the study of how and why people make decisions . ( specifically , it is `` the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers '' . ) it helps people understand parts of science and politics . an alternative term suggested `` as a more descriptive name for the discipline '' is interactive decision theory . in the cold war period , the strategic decisions of the united states and the soviet union were sometimes viewed as an exercise in game theory . in that case the `` players '' being studied were the united states and the soviet union . game theory is not just about games , but how and why businesses make decisions , and just about any decision based on valuing likely outcomes . in game theory , all of these situations are `` games '' since the people involved make choices based on how they value the possible outcomes of the choices . this is true even of cases where the decisions of a single person only affect that one person . game theory is found in the financial choices people make , and is found in the study of economics .
