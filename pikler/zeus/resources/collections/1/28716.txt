Mutual assured destruction     mutual assured destruction ( mad ) is a military strategy in which two opposing military forces are powerful enough to completely destroy each other . it should help to avoid a nuclear war . this usually happens when both forces have nuclear weapons . if a state attacks another with nuclear weapons , the state attacked will potentially be able to attack back . the attacker must think that he will be destroyed with his victim if he attacks . the theory is that no state would start an attack if attacking its enemy means its own destruction . the concept was discussed by herman kahn . it was part of the background to the film `` dr. strangelove '' .
