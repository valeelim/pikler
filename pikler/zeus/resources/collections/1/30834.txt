Christian cross     the christian cross is the main symbol of the christian religion . these crosses are usually found on christian churches . jesus , who many christians believe is god the son and their messiah , was crucified ( nailed to a large wooden cross ) . this was a commonly used method for killing people in roman times . christians believe that jesus ' death made the sins of all humans who trust in him , go away , and that they are forgiven . they also believe that jesus was resurrected ( came back to life ) after three days . because of this , the cross is a symbol for jesus ' sacrifice and suffering , but also a symbol of hope , forgiveness of sins , and victory over death . there are several different christian crosses that are symbols for different christian groups or persons . a cross with the body of jesus on it is called a crucifix . the empty cross is usually favoured by protestants and eastern orthodox , and the symbol reminds them of the resurrection of jesus , though the orthodox will add a slanted footbar , as well . the crucifix is favoured by catholic churches and is a reminder of christ 's sacrifice . jehovah 's witnesses believe that jesus died on a simple upright pole , a `` torture stake '' ; and only display it as a picture of an impaled jesus in their literature .
