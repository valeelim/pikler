Pre-history     pre-history is the time before people began to write . the word comes from the ancient greek words προ ( `` pre '' = `` before '' ) and ιστορία ( `` historia '' = `` history '' ) . paul tournal first used the french word `` préhistorique '' . he found things made by humans more than ten thousand years ago in some caves in france . the word was first used in france around 1830 to talk about the time before writing . daniel wilson used it in english in 1851. the term is mostly used for the period from 12,000 bc 3000 bc , roughly speaking , the neolithic . sometimes the term `` prehistoric '' is used for much older periods , but scientists have more accurate terms for those more ancient times . less is known about prehistoric people because there are no written records ( history ) for us to study . finding out about pre-history is done by archaeology . this means studying things like tools , bones , buildings and cave drawings . pre-history ends at different times in different places when people began to write . in the more ancient stone age pre-history , people lived in `` tribes '' and lived in caves or tents ( houses made from animal skin ) . they had simple tools made from wood and bones and cutting tools from stone such as flint , which they used to hunt and to make simple things . they made fire used it for cooking and to stay warm . they made clothing out of animal skins , and later by weaving . society started when people began doing specialized jobs . this is called the division of labour . the division of labor made people depend on one another and led to more complex civilizations .
