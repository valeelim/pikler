Unit of measurement     measurement is a process that uses numbers to describe a physical quantity based on what we can observe . this is done to be able to compare them to each other . we can measure how big things are , how warm they are , how heavy they are , and lots of other features as well . units of measurement provide standards for our comparisons , so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing . for example , the metre is a standard unit to measure length . before 1982 , it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod . now scientists define the metre by using the speed of light . saying something has a length of 2 metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre , or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance . today , most units of measure fall into one of three systems : the older two , the british imperial system and the closely related us customary system use the foot as a measure of length , the pound as a measure for weight , and the second as a measure for time . they use other units as well . the number of smaller units that make the bigger units in these two systems varies : for example , there are 12 inches in a foot and 16 ounces in a pound .
