Bivalve     the bivalves are a large class of molluscs , also known as pelecypods . they have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves ' . the soft parts are inside the shell . the shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical . there are over 30,000 species of bivalves , including the fossil species . there are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families . all of them live in the water , most of them in the sea or in brackish water . some live in fresh water . all are filter feeders : they lost their radula in the course of evolution . a few are carnivorous , eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves . the best known examples of bivalves are clams , mussels , scallops and oysters . bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth . they are made of a calcareous mineral , calcite or aragonite . the valves are covered by a periostracum , which is an organic horny substance . this forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell . the shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles . scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim .
