Still     a still is a tool used to clean a liquid . it does this by first boiling the liquid and turning it into a gas . this gas is then cooled , changing it back into liquid . stills get their name from the word di '' still '' ation . distillation is the process of boiling and cooling a liquid to purify it . stills are most often used to create alcohol , but they can also be used with any liquid . some examples are medicines and perfumes . there are two main types of stills : pot stills and reflux stills . in a pot still , the pot ( like a large kettle ) holding the liquid is heated . the hot gas is cooled in a simple neck , or tube , and collected . pot stills are used for making alcohol like whisky . a reflux still is much more complex . it works with a continual flow of liquid going into the boiler , and a continual flow of distilled liquid coming out . the distilled liquid can also be put through the process several times , which is why it is called a reflux still . this allows for a more pure product , and the person working the still can control the level of purity . reflux stills are used in the chemical and petroleum industries .
