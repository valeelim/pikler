Hooke's law    hooke 's law it is a law of mechanics and physics by robert hooke . this theory of elasticity says the extension of a spring is proportional to the load applied to it . many materials obey this law as long as the load does not exceed the material 's elastic limit . materials for which hooke 's law is useful are known as linear-elastic or `` hookean '' materials . the length of a spring always changes by the same amount when it is pushed or pulled . the equation for that is : when x = 0 , the spring is at the equilibrium position . this equation only works on a linear spring . a linear spring is a spring that is only being pushed or pulled in one direction , such as left or right or up or down . examples of everyday objects that have elastic potential energy are stretched or compressed elastic bands , springs , bungee cords , car shock absorbers , etc . elastic potential energy is the energy saved in an object that is stretched , compressed ( compression is pressing objects together ) , twisted or bent . for example , an arrow gets the elastic potential energy from the bow . when it leaves the bow , the potential energy turns into kinetic energy .
