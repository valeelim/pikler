Kazan     kazan ( , ) is the capital city of tatarstan and one of russia 's largest cities . it is a major industrial , commercial and cultural center , and remains the most important center of tatar culture . kazan lies at the confluence of the volga ( idel ) and kazanka ( qazansu ) rivers in central european russia . the origin of the name is unclear . the literal translation of tatar qazan is a boiler or cauldron . alternately , it may have been derived from qazğan , tatar for `` dug [ ditch ] '' . `` qazan '' is originally a name for a special cooking pan , a variant of a wok , but more solid and heavier . it was believed that the city of kazan is named after this object because of its geographical similarity with a `` qazan '' -pan ; namely the city is situated in a u - shape lowland . another , more romantic legend tells a story of a tatar princess söyembikä , who dropped a golden dish ( golden qazan ) into the river on which the city is located while washing it . nevertheless , chuvash legends refer to bulgarian prince `` khusan '' ( chuvash rendering of muslim name hassan ) and chuvashes call this city хусан after the name of this prince .
