Rickets     rickets is a disease that happens in young children . it happens in children who do not get enough vitamin d and calcium . it causes larger spaces inside bones , and makes them dry , like sponges . it can make the legs curve toward each other ( so the knees touch ) or away from each other . rickets in adults is called osteomalacia . the word `` rickets '' comes from the greek word `` rhakhis '' , which means `` spine . '' people need both vitamin d and calcium to make their bones strong . vitamin d helps the bones absorb ( take up ) calcium . low vitamin d makes it hard to absorb calcium . the human body makes vitamin d in the skin , from cholesterol . then the liver changes vitamin d into calcitriol , which sends calcium from the blood into the bones . the bones need calcium to stay strong . however , the skin will not make vitamin d unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it . sunlight contains ultraviolet light , so getting enough sun is one way of getting enough d. people need calcium for calcification . calcification uses calcium to help make bones bigger and stronger . low calcium makes bones delicate and easier to break .
