Consonant     all the letters in the alphabet are either consonants or vowels . a consonant is a speech sound in which the air is at least partly blocked , and any letter which represents this . consonants may come singly ( by themselves ) or in clusters ( two or more together ) , but must be connected to a vowel to form a syllable . notice that the consonant ( c ) and vowel ( v ) notation does not match the letters of english spelling in a one-to-one relationship ( e.g . 'th ' is one sound ) , but rather individual sounds . words with single consonants include : - `` go '' ( cv ) , which has one consonant and one vowel in that order - `` on '' ( vc ) , which has one vowel and one consonant in that order - `` ton '' ( cvc ) , which has a consonant , a vowel , and another consonant in that order words with consonant clusters include : - `` pro '' ( ccv ) , which has two consonants in-a-row and one vowel afterwards - `` old '' ( vcc ) , which has one vowel and two consonants in-a-row afterwards - `` spree '' ( cccv ) , which has three consonants in-a-row and one vowel afterwards
