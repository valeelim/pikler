Map     a map is an image of an area , usually of the earth or part of the earth . a map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation . the word `` map '' can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas , people , events , or anything else you can think about . this is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map . people who make maps are cartographers . many maps today are made using gis computer systems . these are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records . if a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen , it has to be projected . this is because the earth is round and paper and screens are flat . there are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make projections . the only kind of map of the earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere . this is called a globe .
