Quartz     quartz is a tectosilicate mineral that is the second most common mineral in earth 's continental crust . its crystal structure is a framework of sio siliconâ€“oxygen tetrahedra . each shares an oxygen atom with another tetrahedron , so the overall chemical formula is sio or silica . there are many different varieties of quartz , some of which are semi-precious gemstones . they have been used for a long time to make jewelry and hardstone carvings . agate , amethyst , rose quartz are all forms of quartz . quartz crystals are used in oscillators , for example in quartz clocks . people also extract the silicon to make semiconductors . the majority of sand is small quartz bits . quartz has a mineral hardness of 7 . ( mohs scale ) . the word `` quartz '' comes from the german word `` quarz '' . 'fused quartz ' is glass made of silica in non-crystalline form . it does not contain other ingredients that are added to other glass to lower the melting point . fused silica has high working and melting temperatures . for some purposes , fused quartz is better than other types of glass due to its purity . the glass is used in a number of high-tech products .
