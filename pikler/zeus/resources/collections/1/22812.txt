Switch     a switch is something that changes the flow of an electrical circuit . the most common kind of switch is something ( for example a railroad switch ) which can be taken off of one course and put onto another . the term `` switch '' usually means electrical power . in applications where more than one switch is needed , ( i.e . a telephone service ) mechanical switches have been replaced by electronic switches which can be controlled automatically . the switch is called a `` gate '' when used in a mathematical form . in logic , arguments are represented as logic gates . the use of electronic `` gates '' to work as a system of logical gates is the basic idea behind the computer â€”i.e . a computer is a lot of electronic switches that work as logic gates . there are many types of switches . some of these are : - dip switch - reed switch - rocker switch - micro switch - relay switch - rotary switch - surface mount switch - toggle switch - tilt switch - time switch the word 'switch ' can also mean to change between two things . for example , on a railway line , sometimes the track can split into two different tracks . if the train is travelling on one line and changes over to the other , it has just done a switch .
