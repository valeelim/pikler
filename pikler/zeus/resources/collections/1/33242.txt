Elementary algebra     elementary algebra is the most basic form of algebra taught to students . it is often one of the next areas of mathematics taught to students after arithmetic . while in arithmetic only numbers and operators like + , − , × , and ÷ occur ; in algebra , variables ( like `` a '' , `` x '' , `` y '' ) are used to stand for numbers . this is useful because : - it lets people solve problems about `` unknown '' numbers . this means learning about equations and how to solve them ( for example , `` find a number `` x '' where formula_1 '' ) . - it allows the generalization of the rules from arithmetic . while some students understand that formula_2 , it helps to prove that formula_3 for all `` a '' and `` b '' . this makes algebra a good step to learning about abstraction ( learning general ideas from many examples ) . - it helps people understand and create functional relationships ( also sometimes called cause and effect ) . an example of this is `` if `` x '' tickets are sold , then the profit will be formula_4 dollars '' . these three are the main strands of elementary algebra . elementary algebra is often used in many other subjects , like science , business , and building . abstract algebra , a much more advanced topic , is generally taught late in college .
