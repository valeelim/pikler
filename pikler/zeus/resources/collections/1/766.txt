Sail     a sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats . the wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water . the piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast . some boats have many sails , and some have only one . usually , small boats have only one sail , and bigger boats have more . boats with sails are called `` sailing boats '' . there are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails . before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil , sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans . now they are not so important for transport , but they are still used for recreation and competition . modern sails can be classified into three main categories : - a mainsail is a sail located behind the main mast of a sailing vessel . - a headsail also known as the jib sail , is any sail set forward of the main mast . - a spinnaker or downwind sail ( also termed kite ) . special-purpose sails are often a variation of the three main categories .
