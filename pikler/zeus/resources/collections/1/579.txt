OK     ok ( okay ) is a word in the english language . it is used to mean that something is good or correct . it can often be used instead of the word yes . it is not certain where the word `` ok '' originally comes from , but some experts say it came from a funny way of writing `` ol korrect '' ( all correct ) . it is also the two-letter abbreviation for the state of oklahoma in the united states of america . you also find the phrase `` ola kala '' in greek , which means something like `` everything fine '' . the term appears to have achieved prominence in the united states in 1840 , when supporters of the american democratic political party claimed during the 1840 united states presidential election that it stood for `` old kinderhook , '' a nickname for a democratic presidential candidate , martin van buren , a native of kinderhook , new york . `` 'vote for ok ' was snappier than using his dutch name . '' in response , whig opponents attributed `` ok '' , in the sense of `` oll korrect , '' to andrew jackson 's bad spelling . the country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in `` okay '' 's history , widely and suddenly popularizing it across the united states .
