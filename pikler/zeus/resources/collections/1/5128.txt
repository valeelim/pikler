Socrates     socrates ( 469 bc â€“ 399 bc ) was one of the greatest greek philosophers . he did not propose any specific knowledge or policy . he showed how argument , debate , and discussion could help men to understand difficult issues . most of the issues he dealt with were only political on the surface . underneath , they were moral questions about how life should be lived . such is the influence of socrates that philosophers before him are called the presocratic philosophers . socrates made enemies , three of whom brought charges against him . socrates was tried for his life in 399 bc , found guilty , and put to death by drinking hemlock ( a herbal poison ) . the story of his trial and death is the subject of a tract by plato which is called the `` apologia '' . most of what we know about socrates comes from the works of plato , who was his pupil . socrates lived in the greek city of athens . his method of teaching was to have a dialogue with individual students . they would propose some point of view , and socrates would question them , asking what they meant . he would pretend `` i do n't know anything ; i 'm just trying to understand what it is you are saying '' , or words to that effect . this is now called the socratic method of teaching .
