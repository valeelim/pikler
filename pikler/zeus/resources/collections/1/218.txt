Earth science     earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet earth . earth science may also be called geoscience . it is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science , which is part of astronomy . the earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere , oceans and biosphere , as well as the solid earth . typically earth scientists will use tools from physics , chemistry , biology , chronology and mathematics to understand the earth , and how it evolved to its current state . if there is one fact which underlies all earth science it is this : the earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation . the extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think . the following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences : - geology describes the rocky parts of the earth 's crust ( or lithosphere ) and its historic development . major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology , geochemistry , geomorphology , paleontology , stratigraphy , structural geology , engineering geology and sedimentology .
