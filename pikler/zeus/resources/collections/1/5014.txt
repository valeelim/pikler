Head of government     the head of government of a country is the person who runs it . this is not always the same person as the head of state . official titles for heads of government include premier or prime minister . for example , in the united states , the president is both the head of state and the head of government . in the republic of ireland the president is the head of state but the taoiseach is the head of government . in most modern monarchies the king ( or queen ) is the head of state but not the head of government . the head of state of some countries has no power over law and justice , for example , the bundespresident of germany .
