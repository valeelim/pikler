Ionic compound     in chemistry , an ionic compound is a compound made of ions . they have strong ionic bonds between particles . lots of energy ( heat ) is required to break the bond apart , resulting in high melting and boiling points . the ions join together because they have different charges . compounds of metals and non-metals are usually ionic . they are made when two or more atoms come close together and an electron goes from one atom to the other atom . the electron does this because both atoms want a full outer shell , similar to those of the noble gases . note 1 : carbon and silicon in group 4 usually form covalent bonds by sharing electrons . note 2 : the elements in group 0 do not react with other elements to form ions .
