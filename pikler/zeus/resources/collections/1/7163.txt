Electricity     electricity is the presence and flow of electric charge . its best-known form is the flow of electrons through conductors such as copper wires . electricity is a form of energy that comes in positive and negative forms , that occur naturally ( as in lightning ) , or is produced ( as in generator ) . it is a form of energy which we use to power machines and electrical devices . when the charges are not moving , electricity is called static electricity . when the charges are moving they are an electric current , sometimes called 'dynamic electricity ' . lightning is the most known - and dangerous - kind of electricity in nature , but sometimes static electricity causes things to stick together . electricity can be dangerous , especially around water because water is a form of conductor . since the nineteenth century , electricity has been used in every part of our lives . until then , it was just a curiosity seen in a thunderstorm . electricity can be created if a magnet passes close to a metal wire . this is the method used by a generator . the biggest generators are in power stations . electricity can also be generated by combining chemicals in a jar with two different kinds of metal rods . this is the method used in a battery . static electricity is created through the friction between two materials - for instance a wool cap and a plastic ruler . this may make a spark . electricity can also be created using energy from the sun , as in photovoltaic cells .
