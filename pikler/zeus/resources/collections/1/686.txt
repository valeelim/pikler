Sound     we can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium . sound is the term to describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear . all sounds are made by vibrations of molecules through which the sound travels . for instance , when a drum or a cymbal is struck , the object vibrates . these vibrations make air molecules move . sound waves move away from their source ( where they came from ) , traveling on the air molecules . when the vibrating air molecules reach our ears , the eardrum vibrates , too . the bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave . these vibrations let you hear different sounds . even music is vibrations . irregular vibrations are noise . people can can make very complex sounds . we use them for speech . sound waves are longitudinal waves with two parts : `` compression '' and `` rarefaction '' . compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed ( `` compressed '' ) together . rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other . sound waves are a sequence of compressions and rarefactions .
