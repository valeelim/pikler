Monopoly     a monopoly ( from the greek `` monos '' , one + `` polein '' , to sell ) is when a product or service can only be bought from one supplier for a specific market . if other firms serve the market , they may be too small compared to the largest , thus allowing the large firm to have a lot of market power . a monopoly usually happens when there is no economic competition to produce the product or service and there is no available substitutes to the product or service . in economics , a monopoly is a single producer of a product or service . in law , a monopoly is a firm that has a lot of market power and is able to charge very high prices for a product or service . as long as the firm has a lot of market power , it does not matter if the firm is large or small , as size is not used to decide if a firm is a monopoly . a monopoly can be formed by the government , by merging a few firms to form a large one , or form naturally to become a natural monopoly . in many places , utilities such as telephone service or cable television are monopolies , as it is very costly to build the infrastructure for another firm to compete in the market . such natural monopolies is hence allowed by the government , but is usually strictly controlled to prevent the monopoly from charging a very high price for a product or service .
