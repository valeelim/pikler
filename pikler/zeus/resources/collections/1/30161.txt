Actuary     actuaries are people who are experts in mathematics , probability , economics , and finance who figure out how much money businesses should charge for making promises to pay for something that may or may not happen . hundreds of years ago , when people got sick or died , it cost a lot of money to take care of them or bury them . people had the idea of joining their money together to help each other out . this was called pooling . eventually , people started to make a business out of collecting enough money to help people who had big problems . figuring out how much money needed to be collected from people to be used if problems happened was not easy . over hundreds of years , the math needed for this was developed by many people from all over the world . today , actuaries use computers to figure out problems that were too difficult before . actuaries now work in many places . most work for insurance companies , but others work in all kinds of finance companies . actuaries still figure out how much money needs to be paid for life insurance , as well as other kinds of money promises , like pensions , car insurance , house insurance , and similar .
