Carl Friedrich Gauss     carl friedrich gauss ( pronunciation : , latin : carolus fridericus gauss ) ( 30 april 1777 – 23 february 1855 ) was a famous mathematician from göttingen , germany . gauss contributed to many areas of learning . most of his work was about number theory and astronomy . he was born in braunschweig . that city was then part of the duchy of braunschweig-lüneburg . today the city is part of lower saxony . as a child , he was a prodigy , meaning he was very clever . when he was 3 years old , he told his father that he had incorrectly measured something on his complicated payroll . gauss was correct . gauss also taught himself to read . when he was in elementary school , his teacher once tried to keep the children busy , telling them to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. gauss did it quickly , like this : 1 + 100 = 101 , 2 + 99 = 101 , 3 + 98 = 101 , and so on . there were a total of 50 pairs , so 50 × 101 = 5,050. the formula is formula_1 . according to this website , the problem given to gauss was actually more difficult to do .
