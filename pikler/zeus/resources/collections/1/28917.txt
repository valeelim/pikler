Northern Cyprus     the turkish republic of northern cyprus ( trnc ) ( turkish : `` '' ) is a `` de facto '' state in the northern third of the island of cyprus . three hundred thousand people live in its 3,335 km² . turkey is the only country which recognizes the territory as an independent republic . the present situation came about because cyprus , historically greek , was conquered and became part of the ottoman empire from 1570–1914 . many turks became settlers . as the ottoman empire sided against the british empire in world war i , the british annexed cyprus . in 1923 by the treaty of lausanne turkey gave up the island to the british empire which in 1925 converted it to a crown colony . the british administered it from 1878 until 1960. in 1974 some of the greek army supported a coup against the archbishop and president makarios . the turkish army invaded cyprus . this had the effect that over two hundred thousand greek and turkish cypriots abandoned their homes and become refugees in the other part of their own country . many settlers from mainland turkey came from turkey into the occupied part of the island . some native turkish cypriots left the occupied part to find a better life in the u.k and other countries .
