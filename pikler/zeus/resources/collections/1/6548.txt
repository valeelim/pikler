Photographic film     photographic film is a sheet of plastic used to record pictures . the plastic has been specially treated , so it is sensitive to light . that way , it is possible to record an invisible image with the plastic when it is exposed to light . normal film is shipped in small canisters ( boxes ) that protect it from the light . a normal photographic film can hold up to 40 pictures . once all pictures have been recorded , the film has to undergo a special chemical treatment . this is called `` developing a film '' or film processing . that treatment makes the pictures visible ( you can see them ) , and the exposed film is no longer sensitive to light . different kinds of films exist . some require more light to be exposed than others . some are black and white only ; they record no colors . there are also special films which can record infrared light . film can only be used once . after that , it can not be used again ( if it is accidentally used again , this results in an artifact called a multiple exposure ) . when not in use , film needs to be covered from light , otherwise it will record any lights that shine on it . this will make it useless to record a picture . film comes in a can called a canister to cover it from light rays .
