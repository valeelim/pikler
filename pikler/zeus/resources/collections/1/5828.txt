Gender     gender means 'type ' . it is a word commonly used for a person 's sex ( male or female ) . when people use the word gender in this way , it is often because `` sex '' has many other meanings , making it hard to understand . `` gender '' comes from the latin word genus which meant `` kind '' or `` type '' . in the few hundred years before the 1950s , the term 'gender ' was used only in the field of grammar . in 1955 , a scientist began to use the word `` gender '' in new ways when referring to people , in a way that was related to their 'sex ' but not quite the same . before the 1950s , the term 'gender ' was used only in the field of grammar , and only to distinguish a category of words that are called 'feminine nouns ' from other words that are 'masculine nouns ' . early indo-european languages~had three genders . languages that come from latin like spanish , french , and italian have lost one , and their nouns are either feminine or masculine in gender . for example , in spanish , 'house ' ( `` casa '' ) is feminine , and 'day ' ( `` d√≠a '' ) is masculine . some languages still have three genders , like german . outside of their grammatical category , the word 'gender ' was not used to refer to people . at that time , when one spoke about someone being either 'male ' or 'female ' , the word used was `` sex '' .
