Jana Gana Mana     the lyrics are written below in the roman alphabet . < poem > you are the ruler of the minds of all people , dispenser of india 's destiny . thy name rouses the hearts of punjab , sindh , gujarat and maratha , of the dravida , orissa and bengal ; it echoes in the hills of the vindhyas and himalayas , mingles in the music of yamuna ganges and is chanted by the waves of the indian sea . they pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise . the saving of all people waits in thy hand , thou dispenser of india 's destiny . < /poem >
