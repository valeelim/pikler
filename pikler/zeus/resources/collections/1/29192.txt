Aeschylus     aeschylus ( 525 bc – 456 bc ) was an ancient greek poet and writer . he wrote about 70–90 plays . only six of his tragedies have survived complete . aeschylus was the earliest of the three greatest greek writers of tragedians . the two others were sophocles and euripides . aristotle said that aeschylus added more characters into his plays . his characters spoke to each other and not just to the chorus . this made it easier to create drama between the characters . one of his plays , `` the persians '' , was about the persian invasion of greece . aeschylus had fought in this war . people studying greek history use his play as an important source of information . the war was so important to the greeks and to aeschylus , that the writing on his grave only talks about his part in the greek victory at the battle of marathon . there is nothing about the plays he wrote . aeschylus was born about the year 525 bc in a small town called eleusis , which is about 27 kilometers northwest of athens . the date is based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the great dionysia . his family was rich , and his father , euphorion , was a member of the eupatridae , the ancient nobility of attica . pausanias wrote that aeschylus worked in a vineyard until the god dionysus visited him in his sleep . the god ordered him to write the first tragedies . his first play was performed in 499 bc , when he was only 26 years old .
