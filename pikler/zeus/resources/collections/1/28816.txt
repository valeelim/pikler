Johannes Brahms     johannes brahms ( 7 may 1833 - 3 april 1897 ) was a famous german composer . he started his career as a pianist . he was always very self-critical and destroyed any composition he thought was not really good . he thought that people were expecting him to be the “ next beethoven ” , and spent many years on his first symphony before he allowed it to be performed . he wrote four symphonies , four concertos , a requiem , piano music , chamber music and songs . perhaps his best known tune is his `` wiegenlied '' ( `` cradle song '' ) , often called `` brahms ' lullaby , '' used in many a child ’ s musical box . brahms was born in germany . his father was a double bass player in the hamburg city orchestra . he probably gave the young boy his first music lessons . he soon was learning the piano with a teacher named otto cossel . when brahms played in a public concert in 1843 an american agent asked him to tour america , but his teacher realized he was too young . he said that johannes should study with eduard marxsen , a well-known teacher in hamburg . by 1848 he was playing piano recitals . he also started to compose , and he sent some of his compositions to robert schumann to ask for his advice . schumann sent the parcel back unopened .
