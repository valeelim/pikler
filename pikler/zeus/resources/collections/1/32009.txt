Biometrics     biometrics is a field of study which aims to identify or recognise people based on traits they have . given these traits , a system can be trained to recognise certain people , with a certain probability . better training usually lowers the probability of falsely identifying someone . the traits used are of two types : - based on the shape of the body . ( called physiological ) these include fingerprints , face recognition , scent , iris ( eye ) , or retina . - based on the behaviour of a person . most often , the two types are combined , as in voice or signature recognition . most of these biometrics are seen as `` behavioral '' , but some are linked to the physiology , e.g . of the vocal tract , or of the hand . a person may be identified by a fingerprint , or by letting the person sign a document . the data could then be kept . someone who is checking can again take the fingerprint or the signature , and compare it to the old version . when selecting features , those choosing must also look at social acceptance . taking a fingerprint may be ok , taking a blood test may not be . some biometric data is also easier to fake , e.g . signatures .
