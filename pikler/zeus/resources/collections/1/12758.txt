Metaphysics     metaphysics is a major branch of philosophy . it concerns existence and the nature of things that exist . altogether it is a theory of reality . ontology is the part of metaphysics which discusses `` what '' exists : the categories of being . apart from ontology , metaphysics concerns the `` nature '' of , and `` relations '' among , the things that exist . the metaphysical idea that reality exists independently of one 's mind and yet can be known is called realism . the metaphysical idea that no mind-independent reality exists or can be known is idealism . these are two main battlegrounds of metaphysics . in the west , metaphysics is usually traced to the natural philosophers in ancient greece , where aristotle systematized a metaphysical description of nature equivalent to today 's theoretical science . by the 4th century ad in alexandria , egypt , alchemy was starting its transformation into chemistry . the conventional view is that alchemy was steeped in mysticism , and that chemistry did not quite become what we would call science until it entered the 19th century .
