Ordinal number     ordinal numbers ( or ordinals ) are numbers that show something 's order , for example : 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th . in set theory , ordinals are ordinal numbers people use to order infinite sets . suppose a person has four different t-shirts , and then lays them in front of the person , from left to right . - at the far left , there is the red t-shirt . - right of that is the blue one . - then there is the yellow one . - and finally , at the far right is an orange t-shirt . if the person then starts counting the shirts from the left , he would first see the red shirt . so the red shirt is the first t-shirt . the blue shirt is the second t-shirt . the yellow shirt is the third one , and the orange t-shirt is the fourth one . the `` first '' , `` second '' , `` third '' , and `` fourth '' in this case are ordinal numbers . they result from the fact that the person has many objects , and they give them an order ( hence 'ordinal ' ) . the person then simply counts those objects , and gives the ordinal numbers to them . related pages .
