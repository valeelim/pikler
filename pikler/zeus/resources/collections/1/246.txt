Economics     economics is the social science which studies economic activity : how people make choices to get what they want . it has been defined as `` the study of scarcity and choice '' and is basically about individual choice . it also studies what affects the production , distribution and consumption of goods and services in an economy . investment and income relate to economics . the word comes from ancient greek , and relates to οἶκος oíkos `` house '' and νόμος nomos `` custom '' or `` law '' . the models used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century . people took ideas from the field of political economy because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences . the subjects ( actors ) in economic study are households , business companies , the government ( the state ) , and foreign countries . households offer their `` factors of production '' to companies . this includes work , land , capital ( machines , buildings ) and information . they get income which they use to buy or 'consume ' goods .
