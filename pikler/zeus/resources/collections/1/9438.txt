Demand     demand is the total amount of goods or services which people want to buy , for a set price . the demand for an item indicates how much it is needed or wanted . this is important in economics , because the law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold . demand is the amount of goods that people want to buy at a given price . prices go up when supply is less , and demand is more . it follows the law of demand where as price increases , demand decreases and vice versa showing an inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price . this is known as the law of demand which assumes that the consumer is alive . sometimes the demand does not change much no matter what the price is . one example is when people are addicted to illegal drugs . these people need to get their drugs , they will pay any price they can afford . this effect is known as elasticity .
