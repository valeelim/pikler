Helium     helium is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol he , atomic number 2 and atomic weight of about 4.002602. there are 9 isotopes of helium , only two of which are stable . these are he and he . he is by far the most common isotope . helium is called a noble gas , because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds . it has the lowest boiling point of all the elements . it is the second most common element in the universe , after hydrogen , and has no color or smell . however , helium has a blue-ish , neon color when being burnt with fire . helium does not usually react with anything else . astronomers discovered helium in 1868. they found that it was in the sun before it was found on earth . because of where it was found , its name comes from the greek word for sun , `` helios '' . helium is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air , and does not burn or react , meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way . it is also used in some kinds of light bulbs . people also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke , but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much , since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air . breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to vocal cords .
