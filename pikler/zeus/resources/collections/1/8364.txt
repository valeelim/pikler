Vegetable     a vegetable is any eatable part of a plant that does `` not '' have seeds . for example , lettuce leaves are vegetables , because they do not have seeds . carrots and potatoes are parts of the root systems of the plants , but since they have no seeds and are eaten by humans , they are vegetables . they are not in the same category as a fruit , nut , herb , spice , or grain . though tomatoes are often thought of as vegetables , but because they have seeds , they are actually fruits . vegetables are an important part of people 's diet , ( what they eat every day ) . vegetables and fruits are sometimes called produce . vegetables have vitamins a , b , c , d , minerals and carbohydrates . the word `` vegetable '' can also be used to mean plants in general , such as when people say `` animal , vegetable , or mineral . '' however , in an asian context , 'vegetable ' may mean any plant produce , apart from grain and nuts , that is consumed cooked , while only the fruits consumed raw are considered as 'fruits ' . for example , an artichoke is therefore considered a vegetable , while a melon qualifies as a fruit .
