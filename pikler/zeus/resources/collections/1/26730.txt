Dvorak keyboard     the dvorak keyboard is an alternative way of putting letters on an english keyboard . most english keyboards have the keys lined up in a `` qwerty layout . '' the point of qwerty was to prevent typewriter keys from sticking , but it is not the most `` ergonomic '' , or comfortable , keyboard to type on . augustine dvorak invented the dvorak keyboard , where letters are arranged based on how often they are used . for instance , the most common letters ( like `` e '' ) are in the center row of keys , so less hand movement is needed when a person is typing . proponents of the dvorak keyboard feel that with the use of computers rather than typewriters , there is no reason to keep the qwerty keyboard . many dvorak keyboard users think that more people should use the dvorak keyboard , as it aims to prevent typing injuries ( like repetitive stress injury and carpal tunnel ) . but most users are used to the qwerty keyboard , and do not want to switch . it is an example of conservatism , or resistance to change .
