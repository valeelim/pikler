Line     a line is the path of one point moving . a line has length but no width . a line is a type of geometric figure . a line is made up of an endless number of points . a `` line segment '' is part of a line . here is an example of a straight line segment : a line can be straight or curved . the word `` line '' usually means a `` straight line '' . a straight line is the shortest distance between two points . a straight line is the line traced by a point moving in a direction that does not change . a `` curved line '' is sometimes called a curve . the edge of a circle is not straight and is an example of a curve . lines can get their names from any two points on the line . for example , if a line has a point named `` '' a '' on the line and a point named `` b '' on the line , then the line can be called either `` ab '' or `` ba '' '' . sometimes , lines are also named with just one letter ; for example , line `` a '' . two lines can be : - parallel : two lines are parallel if they are on the same plane and they never touch . - concurrent : two lines are concurrent if they touch on one point .
