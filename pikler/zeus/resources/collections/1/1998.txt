Coordinated Universal Time     coordinated universal time ( utc ) is the standard time system of the world . it is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time . it is , within about 1 second , mean solar time at 0Â° longitude . the standard before was greenwich mean time ( gmt ) . utc and gmt are almost the same . in fact , there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people . some websites , like wikipedia , use utc because it does not make any country look more important than the others . it offers one time for all the internet ( the same time can be used by people all over the world ) . timezones are often named by how many hours they are different from utc time . for example , utc -5 ( united states east coast ) is 5 hours behind utc . if the time is 07:00 utc , the local time is 02:00 in new york ( utc -5 ) and 10:00 in moscow ( utc +3 ) . 07:00 utc is also written more simply as 0700z ( or 07:00z ) . note that utc uses the 24-hour clock . that means there is no 'am ' or 'pm ' . for example , 4:00pm would be 16:00 or 1600 .
