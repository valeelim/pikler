Mixture     in chemistry , a mixture is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances . these substances be chemical elements or compounds . a mixture can be made of liquids , solids , or gases . a mixture is not the same as a compound which is made of two or more atoms connected together . for instance , a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen , not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms . a mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called `` heterogenous '' , one where this is not the case is called `` homogeneous '' . a third form is called colloid . if one substance in a mixture dissolves in the other , it is called a solution . for example if sugar is put in water it forms a mixture , then dissolves to make a solution . if it does not dissolve , it would be called a suspension . solids can be mixtures also . many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals .
