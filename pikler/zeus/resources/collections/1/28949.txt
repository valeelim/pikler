Sonata form     sonata form is a way of organizing a piece of music . it has been used a great deal since the classical period ( from the middle of the 18th century onwards ) . listening to some pieces of music in sonata form will help to understand it fully . it is helpful to know something about the different keys . sonata form is not just used in sonatas . it can be the form for movements from symphonies , concertos , overtures etc . in the baroque period composers like bach and handel wrote a lot of dance movements such as minuets . these were in “ binary form ” . this meant that there were two sections . the two sections were often the same length , and were separated by a double bar line which meant that each section was repeated . the music would not be in the same key all the time . the first section would modulate ( change key ) and then the second section would gradually modulate back again so that it sounded finished at the end . domenico scarlatti wrote lots of sonatas for harpsichord which are in binary form , but they started to get longer and more complicated . the first section would start with a theme ( tune ) in the main key , and then modulate to another key for a contrasting tune . the second section might be longer than the first second , starting off by modulating to strange keys before arriving back to repeat the main tunes . this kind of piece is the beginning of sonata form .
