Ptolemy     ptolemy is the english name for claudius ptolemaeus . he was a greek who probably lived and worked in alexandria , in egypt . he lived from about 85 to 165 a.d. he is famous for his work on astronomy and geography . very little is known about his personal life . he was an astronomer , mathematician , and geographer . he described in his writing the greek or geocentric view of the universe . the greeks thought that the earth was the center of the universe . he also thought out and described the apparent motions of the planets as they were known in his time . ptolemy explained and extended hipparchus 's system of epicycles and eccentric circles to explain his geocentric ( earth-centered ) theory of the solar system . ptolemy 's system involved at least 80 epicycles to explain the motions of the sun , the moon , and the five planets known in his time . he believed the planets and sun moved around the earth in this order : mercury , venus , sun , mars , jupiter , saturn . this system became known as the ptolemaic system . it predicts the positions of the planets accurately enough for naked-eye observations , so it seemed accurate at the time . this is described in his book `` mathematical syntaxis '' ( widely called the `` almagest '' ) , a thirteen-book mathematical treatment of the phenomena of astronomy . it contains a wide variety of information ranging from earth conceptions to sun , moon , and star movement as well as eclipses and an explanation of the length of months . the almagest also included a star catalog containing 48 constellations , using the names we still use today .
