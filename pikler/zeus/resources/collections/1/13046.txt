Radio control     radio control is a way of making models of cars , boats , helicopters and airplanes move on their own like real ones . invisible electrical signals called radio waves come out of a part called a transmitter . the transmitter is a box with the model 's controls on it . when a control is moved , the radio signal changes . the part on the model that takes the changing signals and helps turn them into movement is called the receiver . the receiver then tells a special kind of motor called a servo to move part of the model . on a car or boat , a servo is usually used for steering . model sailboats use a servo to adjust the sail as well as the rudder , or steering device . on airplanes and helicopters , servos are used not only for steering but for up and down pitch . if the model uses an engine to make it run , a servo is used to control the speed of the engine . a model which operates with an electric motor usually has something called an electronic speed control or `` esc '' to control its speed .
