Real number     a real number is a rational or irrational number . usually when people say `` number '' they usually mean `` real number '' . the official symbol for real numbers is a bold r or a blackboard bold formula_1 . some real numbers are called positive . a positive number is `` bigger than zero '' . you can think of the real numbers as an infinitely long ruler . there is a mark for zero and every other number , in order of size . unlike a ruler , there are numbers below zero . these are called negative real numbers . negative numbers are `` smaller than zero '' . they are like a mirror image of the positive numbers , except they are given minus signs ( â€“ ) so that they are labeled differently from the positive numbers . there are infinitely many real numbers . there is no smallest or biggest real number . no matter how many real numbers are counted , there are always more which need to be counted . there are no empty spaces between real numbers . this means that if two different real numbers are taken , there will always be a third real number between them , no matter how close together the first two numbers are .
