Political party     a political party is an organized group of voters . it often puts forward candidates for public office . in a democracy , leaders must `` run for office '' in an election . in a dictatorship , there is generally only one party allowed , that can approve a new leader without non-members having a choice . a political party is similar to a faction , and can be the same thing . in some systems , members of one party in the legislature are all expected to vote the same way . the laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country , so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats , gets to run the government . the next largest party is often called the `` opposition '' . sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats , no one party has over half of the seats . then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a `` coalition '' . some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group . others form policies to address all matters of government , known as a `` platform '' .
