God Save the Queen     `` god save the queen '' is the national anthem of the united kingdom . when there is a king instead of a queen it becomes `` god save the king '' . some other countries that still have the british monarch as their head of state use this song as a `` royal anthem '' to honour the queen . it is not completely known who wrote it , but most people think it was dr henry carey , who first performed it in 1740. the tune for `` god save the queen '' was used in many countries as a national anthem . apart from the german state , many of which were linked to great britain by marriage , liechtenstein and switzerland used the tune . switzerland changed to a different tune in the 1960s . liechtenstein still uses the tune . the tune is both american and british . in the 1930s the united states chose an official anthem . `` the star spangled banner '' was chosen instead of the equally popular `` my country 't is of thee '' which used the `` god save the queen '' tune .
