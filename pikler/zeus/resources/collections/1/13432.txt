Heart     the heart is an organ found in every vertebrate . it is a very strong muscle that is about the size of a fist . it pumps blood throughout the body . it has regular contractions , or when the heart squeezes the blood out into other parts of the body . `` cardiac '' and `` cardio '' both mean `` about the heart '' , so if something has the prefix `` cardio '' or `` cardiac '' , it has something to do with the heart . myocardium means the heart muscle : 'myo ' is from the greek word for muscle - 'mys ' , cardium is from the greek word for heart - 'kardia ' . the human heart has four chambers or closed spaces . some animals have only two or three chambers . in humans , the four chambers are two `` atria '' and two `` ventricles '' . atria is talking about two chambers ; atrium is talking about one chamber . there is a right atrium and right ventricle . these get blood that comes to the heart . they pump this blood to the lungs . in the lungs blood picks up oxygen and drops carbon dioxide . blood from the lungs goes to the left atrium and ventricle . the left atrium and ventricle send the blood out to the body . the left ventricle works six times harder than the right ventricle because it carries oxygenated blood..
