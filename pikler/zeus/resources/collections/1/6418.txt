American Civil War     the american civil war ( 1861â€“1865 ) was a civil war in the united states of america . it is sometimes called `` the war between the states '' . eleven southern states in which slavery was legal wanted to leave the united states of america . they formed the confederate states of america , also called `` the confederacy '' . they wanted the confederate states of america to be its own country , separate and independent from the united states . jefferson davis was chosen as president of the confederacy . the u.s government and the states that remained loyal to it were called the union . the union is sometimes called `` the north '' . every state where slavery was illegal supported the union . most of these states were in the north . five states where slavery was legal also supported the union . these were called the `` border states '' . the war began on april 12 , 1861 when confederate forces attacked fort sumter held by a union garrison . it lasted four years and devastated the south . the republican party , led by abraham lincoln , won the 1860 presidential election . the republican party was against spreading slavery to places where it was not already legal . after the election , seven southern states declared their independence from the union . they formed the confederate states of america , even before lincoln became president on march 4 , 1861. the outgoing u.s. president , james buchanan , said this was against the law , but did nothing to stop them . lincoln and his republican party treated this secession as a rebellion . no country ever recognized the confederacy as its own , separate nation . this was because of diplomacy on the part of the union , anti-slavery feelings in europe , and the northern blockade of southern ports .
