Special relativity     special relativity ( or the special theory of relativity ) is a theory in physics that was developed and explained by albert einstein in 1905. it applies to all physical phenomena , so long as gravitation is not significant . special relativity applies to minkowski space , or `` flat spacetime '' ( phenomena which are not influenced by gravitation ) . einstein knew that some weaknesses had been discovered in older physics . for example , older physics thought light moved in luminiferous aether . various tiny effects were expected if this theory were true . gradually it seemed these predictions were not going to work out . eventually , einstein ( 1905 ) drew the conclusion that the concepts of space and time needed a fundamental revision . the result was special relativity theory . this is based on the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference and the principle of relativity . - inertial frame of reference : a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously , isotropically , and in a time-independent manner . shorthand : space the same everywhere at all times .
