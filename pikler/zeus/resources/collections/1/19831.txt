Glucose     glucose is a simple carbohydrate , or `` sugar '' . it is one of several kinds of sugars . it is important because cells in an organism use it as a source of energy . turning glucose into energy is called cellular respiration , which is done inside the cells of a living organism . glucose is made by plants in a process called photosynthesis . it can also be made by animals in their liver or kidneys . having the right amount of glucose available in a person 's body is important . it can be measured with a simple blood test . people that do not have enough glucose have low blood sugar levels . this is a health condition called hypoglycemia . people with too much glucose have hyperglycemia . they might have a health condition called diabetes . its chemical formula is cho . this means it has 6 carbon atoms , 12 hydrogen atoms , and 6 oxygen atoms bonded together . how sugars work , and how glucose can be formed , was studied by a german chemist named emil fischer in the 1890s . his work earned him the 1902 nobel prize in chemistry .
