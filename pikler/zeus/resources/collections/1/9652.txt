Anti-tank dog     anti-tank dogs were dogs with explosives placed on their backs . these dogs were trained to run under enemy tanks . the explosives were then remotely detonated in order to destroy the target tank . these dogs were trained by the soviet union during world war ii to be used against german armored vehicles . they were trained on russian tanks , which used diesel fuel . in battle , the dogs often ran toward the smell of diesel fuel from the soviet tanks instead of the intended german targets . the german army soon learned about the dogs , so all russian dogs were shot on sight by the germans . very few dogs remained in the eastern front as a result of this . after the war better weapons against tanks were made . therefore , it is unlikely that anti-tank dogs will ever be used again .
