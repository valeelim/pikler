Alpha Centauri     alpha centauri is the brightest star in the southern centaurus constellation . it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky , with a magnitude of -0.01. it is visible in the southern hemisphere , and is too far south for most of the northern hemisphere to see . alpha centauri is a binary star system of two stars a & b. the distance between them is quite close . to the naked eye , the stars are too close for the eye to be able to see them as separate . their orbit is about the distance of the giant planets from our sun . there is a third star , proxima centauri ( or alpha centauri c ) . this is usually considered separately , but in fact it is also gravitationally connected to the other two . it is actually slightly closer to us , with a very much larger orbit around a and b. viewed as a triple star system , alpha centauri is the closest to our own , being 4.2-4.4 light years ( ly ) away . it consists of two main stars , alpha centauri a and alpha centauri b ( which form a binary star together ) at a distance of 4.36 ly , and a dimmer red dwarf named proxima centauri at a distance of 4.22 ly . both of the two main stars are rather similar to the sun . the larger star , alpha centauri a , is the most similar to the sun , but a little larger and brighter .
