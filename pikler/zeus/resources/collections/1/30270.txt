Parasitism     parasitism is a form of one-sided symbiosis . the parasites live off the host . they may , or may not , harm the host . parasitoids , on the other hand , usually kill their hosts . a parasitic relationship is the opposite of a mutualistic relationship . examples of parasites in humans include tapeworms and leeches . world-wide , the most serious cause of human death by a parasite is malaria . a definition : - a parasite is an organism drawing nutrients from a living host . it lives in or on another organism , getting from it part or all of its food . it usually shows some degree of adaptive modification , and causes some degree of damage to its host . `` humans are hosts to nearly 300 species of parasitic worms and over 70 species of protozoa , some derived from our primate ancestors and some acquired from the animals we have domesticated or come in contact with during our relatively short history on earth . our knowledge of parasitic infections extends into antiquity '' . when the above definition is applied , many organisms which eat plants can be seen as parasites , because they feed largely or wholly on one individual plant . examples would include many herbivorous insects : the hemiptera or true bugs ( leafhoppers , froghoppers , aphids , scale insects and whiteflies ) . the larvae of lepidoptera usually feed and mature on a single individual of the host plant species , and what they eat accounts for most of the food for their complete life span . moreover , caterpillars can and often do serious damage to the host 's foliage . other orders also have many parasitic herbivores : thysanoptera ( thrips ) , coleoptera ( beetles ) , diptera ( flies ) .
