Great circle     a great circle the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere , one that divides the surface into equal halves , called hemispheres . it is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on . these curves are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference , that is , the length of the circle . there are an infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere . the longitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two points ( the north pole and the south pole ) . the equator is another great circle . great circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere ( or on the earth ) . a straight line from plane euclidean geometry corresponds to a great circle in non-euclidean spherical geometry . other websites . - great circle
