Archaeology     archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts ( historical things ) left by the people who lived long ago . these remains can include old coins , tools , buildings , and inscriptions . archaeologists , the people who study archaeology , use these remains to understand how people lived . archaeologists think it is important to understand the past , because so many people use the past to know where they come from . when archaeologists do fieldwork , they look for remains , often by digging deep in the ground . when things are found , or even when nothing is found , the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist 's base is , maybe a university or museum . they record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer , so that they can build a picture of everything that is found . as settlements ( places where people lived in groups ) change and grow , old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings . ancient rome , for example , is now up to 40 feet ( 12 metres ) below the present city . this is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time .
