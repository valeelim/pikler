Army     the army is the part of a country 's military that fights on the ground . people in the army are called soldiers . many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks , airplanes , and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground . a soldier may be a volunteer ( someone who joins something because they want to ) , or he may be forced by the government to join the army . forcing men to join the army is called conscription or `` draft '' . voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers , but high in confidence and quality . drafted armies are large , but often lacking in confidence and in quality : it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will . sometimes an army is made up from mercenaries , who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to the country which they serve . soldiers do many things , from shooting enemies , to digging defensive trenches . they are used to defend their country , or attack another country 's army . it is difficult , and soldiers must be in good shape , both physically and mentally . they almost always move together , and that way the team can do more things , in a safer way . they may be assigned to certain places to guard , or they may be told to search a place , or even attack it . that is up to their commander . every soldier answers to someone else , so that way , everything is organized .
