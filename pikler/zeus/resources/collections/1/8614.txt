Great Wall of China     it is thought that the earliest wall was built under the rule of emperor qin , who successfuly unified parts of china around 221 bc . previously , individual states had built their own wall defences , but now emperor qin sought to connect the walls to provide defences against northern invaders . he ordered the building of the Â“wan li chang cheng '' as it was known in china . this translates as `` the ten thousand li great wall '' . a `` li '' is a chinese length unit . 2 li are equal to 1 km . read ( or print ) the famous story meng jiangnu weeps . most of the original wall no longer exists . over the centuries that followed each dynasty did more work to maintain and develop the wall . the ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) carried out a major rebuilding project extending the great wall , which resulted in a 6000 kilometre wall which is what is mainly in evidence today . the great wall of china is approximately 6000 kilometres long . however if you were to measure all the individual structures and changes to the wall made over the centuries , it is believed the final measurement would total over 50000 kilometres !
