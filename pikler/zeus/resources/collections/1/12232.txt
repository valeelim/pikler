Fly     a fly ( plural : `` flies '' ) is an insect of the order diptera . the diptera is a large order of advanced flying insects . their most obvious distinction from other insects is in their flight . a typical fly has two flight wings on its thorax and a pair of halteres . the halteres , which evolved from the hind wings , act as flight sensors : they are balance organs . also flies have large eyes with excellent wide-angle vision . with the help of their eyes and halteres , flies are exceptional fliers . they can avoid most predators , and are the most difficult insects to capture by hand . their jinks , dives and turns to avoid their predators is their main adaptation . `` these flies do a precise and fast calculation to avoid a specific threat and they are doing it using a brain that is as small as a grain of salt '' ... `` and they can fly like an ace at birth . it 's like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do '' . the only other order of insects bearing two true , functional wings plus any form of halteres are the strepsiptera , a small order of insects . in contrast to the flies , the strepsiptera evolved their halteres from their front wings and their flight wings are their rear wings .
