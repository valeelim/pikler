Greek alphabet     the modern greek alphabet has 24 letters . it is used to write the greek language . the greek alphabet is thought to be where all important european alphabets came from . although the alphabet was borrowed from the phoenician alphabet around the 10th century bc , there were many changes made to make it fit the greek language . the main change was that some of the phoenician letters that were for sounds not used in greek were turned into vowels . the phoenicians had written their alphabet without any vowels , so this change made writing a lot easier to read . this change was also better fit for indo-european languages , which did not use consonant-based roots ( meaning the word 's central meaning is based on the consonant string ) like those in semitic languages such as phoenician , arabic , hebrew , and aramaic . another change is that some new letters were invented for sounds that were in greek but not in the phoenician language . at first , greek was written from right to left , the same as phoenician , but after the 6th century bc , it was written from left to right .
