Glass     glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes . it is usually transparent , but it can also be made in colours . glass is mainly made of silica ( sand is an example ) . glass used to make windows and bottles are made of a specific type called soda-lime glass , composed of about 75 % silicon dioxide ( sio ) , sodium oxide ( nao ) from sodium carbonate ( naco ) , calcium oxide , also called lime ( cao ) , and several minor additives . by changing the proportions , and adding different ingredients , many kinds of glass can be made . coloured glass is made by adding small amounts of metal oxides . for example , a blue colour is given by tiny amounts of cobalt oxide . crystal glass is made by adding lead and zinc oxides . it is not actually a crystal because all glass is a non-crystalline solid . crystal glass is called cut glass if it has been cut by hand : because glass is used to make lenses , the word `` glasses '' means eyeglasses . the myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches ( 200â€“300 years old ) are sometimes a little out of shape : thicker at the bottom than the top . this is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other . it was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom . sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window .
