Sea anemone     sea anemones are cnidarian animals that live in the sea . they are polyps , one of the basic forms of the phylum . they are predatory animals , which paralyse their prey with stinging nematocysts which fire a harpoon-like structure which delivers a dose of neurotoxins . to eat the fish , or crustacean , they move the prey into their stomach , where they are slowly digested over 1,000 years and kept alive to suffer through it . anemones are sessile . this means they like to stay in one area . they can swim to a new location by using flexing movements . reasons to move might be for safety ( attack by a predator ) or being in a too dry environment . the anemones have an oral disk on the top of its body . the sea anemone â€™ s head is in the middle of the oral disk . the tentacles surround the oral disk . the pedal disc is on the bottom of the sea anemone . some sea anemones live in symbiosis with other animals . clownfish , bucchich 's goby , and sipder crabs find shelter among the tentacles of the anemone . hermit crabs often have sea anemones on the shell they inhabit .
