Bartolomeu Dias     bartolomeu dias ( or `` bartholomew dias '' , 1450 - may 29 , 1500 ) was a portuguese explorer who was the first european to sail past the cape of good hope . in 1487 , king john ii of portugal asked dias to search for the land of a legendary christian king named prester john in the east . in 1488 bartholomew and his sailors sailed along the western coast of africa . they got caught in a storm and landed at a cape in southern africa and they could not sail beyond that point . they named it `` cape of storms '' and later returned to portugal . the king of portugal considered it as a victory gained by the portuguese adventurers and named it as `` cape of good hope '' . because prester john did not really exist , they did not find his country but the route from the atlantic ocean to the indian ocean leading to asia turned out to be valuable . commanding a ship in pedro Ã¡lvares cabral 's later expedition to brazil he died at sea in 1500 during a storm . there was a statue made for him later in cape town , south africa .
