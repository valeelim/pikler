Theology     theology is the study of one or more religions ( `` theo- '' means god in greek and `` -logy '' is study , which makes it `` god study '' or `` study of god '' ) . somebody who studies theology is called a theologian . books or ideas about theology are called theological . theology may be studied for many reasons . some people study theology to better understand their own religion , while other people study theology so that they can compare religions . the word ‘ theology ’ was first used to describe the study of god in christianity but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally , but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so . some people use the words 'comparative theology ' when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once . during the high middle ages , it was thought that theology was the highest subject learned in universities . theology at that time was named `` the queen of the sciences '' . there was a plan for young men to study easy subjects and then harder subjects . the easiest subjects were called the trivium . the next harder subjects were called the quadrivium . finally , young men were expected to study theology . this meant that the other subjects existed primarily to help with theological thought .
