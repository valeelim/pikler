Electronic music     electronic music is music which is made with electronic equipment such as synthesizers or computers . sometimes electronic music artists create special sounds using tape recorders too . after world war ii , when tape recorders had been invented and were becoming popular , composers started to use them to make music . the tape recorder was needed for the performance . composers used them to combine lots of different sounds . sometimes it was music played on ordinary ( acoustic ) instruments which was then changed in some way by the tape recorder . sometimes they took sounds from everyday life such as the sound of water , traffic noise or bird song . all these noises were put together in the way the composer wanted by using the tape recorder . tapes of sounds were often cut into pieces , then the pieces were 'spliced ' – put back together in a different order . the results were often very interesting , but there were problems . some people asked : “ is it music ? ” others thought it was boring to just look at a tape recorder during a concert instead of being able to watch live musicians play .
