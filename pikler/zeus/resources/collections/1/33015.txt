Tadpole     a tadpole or polliwog is a young frog that breathes and lives in the water . they hatch from small eggs laid in a pond or lake by their mother . frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings . there is enough food in each egg to last 21 days . after a few weeks , they begin to grow back legs , then front legs . soon after , the froglets begin to breathe air and lose their tails . they will grow larger , and in a few months , become adults . most types of tadpole eat only plants . some types of tadpole eat plants and animals , even other smaller tadpoles . during the tadpole stage of the amphibian life cycle , most breathe by means of external or internal gills . they usually do not have arms or legs until the change to adulthood . they have a large , flattened tail with which they swim by 'lateral undulation ' ( side to side ) , similar to most fish . as a tadpole matures , it changes by gradually growing limbs , usually the back legs first . then it gradually loses its tail by programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) . lungs develop at the time of leg development : tadpoles late in development are often near the surface of the water , where they breathe air . during the final stages , the tadpole 's mouth changes from a small mouth at the front of the head to a large mouth the same width as the head . the intestines shorten to accommodate the new diet . most tadpoles are herbivorous , living on algae and plants . some species are omnivorous , eating detritus and , when available , smaller tadpoles .
