Sovereignty     sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area . the idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as ancient greece if not older . the exact meaning of sovereignty has changed some in the past . the present meaning of sovereignty is said to come from the peace of westphalia , an agreement between the rulers of europe in 1648 which said : - no one should try to help break up one sovereign government into more than one . - no one should cross over into the land , water , or air where the international law says a government is sovereign , unless they have agreement from that sovereign government . - a sovereign government is the only maker of laws in the land , water or air where international law says it is sovereign . ancient rome was first the roman republic , but then when octavian made the roman empire the emperor of rome said that he was `` sovereign '' . the meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted , and he did not have to do what the law said himself .
