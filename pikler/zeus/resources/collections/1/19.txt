Farming     farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials . farming is a part of agriculture . agriculture started thousands of years ago , but no one knows for sure how old it is . the development of farming gave rise to the neolithic revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in what became cities . agriculture and domestication probably started in the fertile crescent ( the nile valley , the levant and mesopotamia ) . the area called fertile crescent is now in the countries of iraq , syria , turkey , jordan , lebanon , israel , and egypt . wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew . people probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops , but still gathered many foods from the wild . people may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change . farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land . agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals , but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants , manure or dung , animal hides ( skins or furs ) , leather , animals , fungi , fibers ( cotton , wool , hemp , and flax ) , biofuels , and drugs ( biopharmaceuticals , marijuana , opium ) .
