Photon     photons ( from greek φως , meaning `` light '' ) , in many atomic models in physics , are particles which transmit light . in other words , light is carried over space by photons . photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle . in quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy . photons have a rest mass of 0 ( zero ) . however , einstein 's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum . before the photon got its name , einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy ( particles ) . these particles came to be known as photons . a photon is usually given the symbol γ ( gamma ) , photons are fundamental particles . although they can be created and destroyed , their lifetime is infinite . in a vacuum , all photons move at the speed of light , c , which is equal to 299,792,458 meters ( approximately 300,000 kilometers ) per second . a photon has a given frequency , which determines its color . radio technology makes great use of frequency . beyond the visible range , frequency is less discussed , for example it is little used in distinguishing between x-ray photons and infrared . frequency is equivalent to the quantum energy of the photon , as related by the planck constant equation e = h × f
