Pathogen     a pathogen is an infectious thing , such as a virus , bacteria , fungi or parasite , which causes a disease . this ability is called pathogenicity . the body has many ways to defend against some of the common pathogens ( such as `` pneumocystis '' ) in the form of the human immune system and by some `` helpful '' bacteria present in the human body 's normal human flora . however , if the immune system or `` good '' bacteria is damaged in any way ( for example , chemotherapy , hiv , or antibiotics being taken to kill other pathogens ) , pathogenic bacteria that were being held back can grow and cause harm to the host . such cases are opportunistic infections . some pathogens cause epidemics . these include the bacterium `` yersinia pestis '' which may have caused the black death , the `` variola '' virus , and the malarial protozoa . they hurt or even kill large numbers of people . the most famous and lethal outbreak was the 1918 spanish flu pandemic ( type a influenza , h1n1 subtype ) , which lasted from 1918 to 1919. it is not known exactly how many it killed , but estimates range from 20 to 100 million people . this pandemic has been described as `` the greatest medical holocaust in history '' and may have killed as many people as the black death .
