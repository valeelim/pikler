Protease     a protease is a digestive enzyme . it breaks down long chains of proteins into shorter amino acids . proteases have evolved a number of times . we know this because different kinds of protease can do the same reaction in completely different ways . proteases are found in animals , plants , bacteria , archaea and viruses . now more than 50 types of protease are known . each is a separate evolutionary origin of proteolysis . protease can be divided into 6 types : - serine proteases - threonine proteases - cysteine proteases - aspartate proteases - metallo proteases - glutamic acid proteases
