Asteroid     an asteroid is a small object in the solar system that travels around the sun . it is like a planet but smaller . they range from less than 1 km ( over 1000 feet ) to 600 miles ( 1000 km ) across . a few asteroids have asteroid moons . the name `` asteroid '' means `` like a star '' in the ancient greek language . asteroids may look like small stars in the sky , but they really do move around the sun , while stars only seem to move because the earth spins . like planets , asteroids do not make their own light . because of this , some people think `` asteroids '' is not a good name , and think that the name `` planetoid '' ( `` like a planet '' ) would be a better name . giuseppe piazzi found the first asteroid , in 1801. it was named 1 ceres , and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt . other asteroids in the asteroid belt , like juno , 2 pallas , and 4 vesta were found later . today , astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month . asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the solar system . these rocks were too small to make a planet , and could not collide but some are made of carbon or metal . depending on what 's on the surface , they are classified into various kinds in including type m ( metal ) , type s ( stone ) , and type c ( carbon ) .
