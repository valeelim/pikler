Synagogue     a synagogue is a place where jews meet to worship and pray to god . in hebrew , a synagogue is called `` beit knesset '' , which means , a `` house of gathering '' . the word `` synagogue '' comes from `` sunagoge '' , which is a greek word . in a synagogue , jews carry out the jewish services , which consist of prayers , sometimes with special actions . a synagogue will usually have a large room for prayers . there might be some smaller rooms for studying . there will be some offices . there will also usually be a big room for special events . the front of a synagogue faces towards jerusalem in israel . in the front is the holiest part of the synagogue , the ark . this is a closet which has the torah scrolls inside . the torah scrolls have the holy writings of judaism on them . the ark usually has a curtain in front of it . on top of the ark is light which is always lit , called the “ eternal lamp ” . it is a symbol which means that god is always there . every synagogue has a raised platform called the “ bimah ” . the person who reads the torah scroll stands there when he reads . the bimah is either in the middle of the hall , or in front of the ark .
