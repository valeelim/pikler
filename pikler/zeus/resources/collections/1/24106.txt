Boeing 747     the boeing 747 is a jet airliner . it is made by boeing commercial airplanes . the boeing 747 has more than one aisle , which means it is a wide-body aircraft . it is often called the `` jumbo jet '' or `` queen of the skies '' . the boeing 747 is one of the easiest planes in the world to recognise . it was the first wide-body aircraft ever made . the first type of 747 was two and a half times the size of the boeing 707. the boeing 747 made its first flight for an airline in 1970. the 747 could carry more people than any other aircraft for 37 years , until the airbus a380 was made . the 747 is a double deck plane . it can carry people , cargo and many other things . boeing designed the 747 's upper deck to be a first class lounge or just extra seats . they also designed the upper deck so that the aircraft could be changed into a cargo plane easily . this was done by removing seats and putting in a cargo door at the front of the plane . boeing did this because they thought that supersonic airliners would become much more popular than the 747 and other subsonic airliners . however , they thought that subsonic cargo planes would always be popular . it was thought that the 747 would become unpopular after 400 were sold . however , 1,000 planes had been made by 1993 , so it stayed popular . by september 2012 , 1,448 aircraft had been built . 81 747-8s were still waiting to be built .
