Infinity     infinity is about things which never end . sometimes , it is also written formula_1 . infinity means many different things , depending on when it is used . the word is from a latin word , which means `` without end '' . infinity goes on forever , so sometimes space , numbers , and other things are said to be 'infinite ' , because they never come to a stop . infinity is not really an ordinary number , but it is sometimes used as one . infinity often says how `` many '' there is of something , instead of how `` big '' something is . for example , there are infinitely many whole numbers ( called integers ) , but there is no integer which is infinitely big . but different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity . so its meaning often changes . there are two kinds of infinity : potential infinity and actual infinity . potential infinity is a process that never stops . for example , adding 10 to a number . no matter how many times 10 is added , 10 more can still be added . actual infinity is a more abstract idea . for example , there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down .
