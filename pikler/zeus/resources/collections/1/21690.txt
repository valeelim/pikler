Axiom     an axiom is a concept in logic . it is a statement which is accepted without question , and which has no proof . the axiom is be used as the premise or starting point for further reasoning or arguments , usually in logic or in mathematics . this means it can not be proved within the discussion of a problem . so inside some discussion , it is thought to be true . there are many reasons why it has no proof . for example , 1. the statement might be obvious . this means most people think it is clearly true . an example of an obvious axiom is the principle of contradiction . it says that a statement and its opposite can not both be true at the same time and place . 1. the statement is based on physical laws and can easily be observed . an example is newton 's laws of motion . they are easily observed in the physical world . 1. the statement is a proposition . here , an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived . this means we care more about what `` happens '' if the axiom is true . whether the proposition is empirically true is not the business of logic . this is a more modern definition of an axiom .
