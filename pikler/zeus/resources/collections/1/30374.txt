String quartet     a string quartet is a piece of music for four string instruments . a string quartet can also mean the four people who play a piece for four string instruments . the four instruments in a string quartet are almost always 2 violins , 1 viola and 1 cello . the reason that a double bass is not used is that it would sound too loud and heavy . the balance between 2 violins , viola and cello is perfect . string quartets are the most popular form of chamber music . many composers have written string quartets . string quartet writing started in the 18th century . italian composers like sammartini ( 1698-1775 ) wrote music for two violins , viola and continuo . the continuo was either just a harpsichord or harpsichord with cello . gradually composers started to leave the harpsichord out . the cello often played the same as the viola but one octave lower . composers of the classical music period started writing cello parts which had a life of their own . joseph haydn ( 1732-1809 ) wrote many string quartets , making it a very popular form . his quartets from op.33 were , he said , “ written in a new and special way ” . all four parts were very clear and individual . there were always four movements : a fast movement , a slow one , a minuet and trio and a fast finale . haydn often played in a quartet with wolfgang amadeus mozart ( 1756-1791 ) and two other players . mozart also wrote lots of string quartets and dedicated some of them to haydn . three of mozart ’ s later ones were written for the king of prussia who played the cello well , so mozart gave the cello lots of difficult music to play .
