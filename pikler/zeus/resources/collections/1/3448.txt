Question     a question is what someone asks , usually when there is something that he or she does not know . in writing , a question mark ( `` ? '' ) comes at the end of a question . sometimes a question needs a simple answer like `` yes '' or `` no '' . sometimes a question has a more complicated answer like `` maybe '' , or `` i do n't know '' . there are so many types of questions and so many ways of answering questions . people may give a short answer . people may give a long answer . it depends on the question . - `` guess what ? '' - `` how are you ? '' - `` can i help you ? '' - `` do you speak english ? '' - `` is this your bag ? '' - `` what time is it ? '' - `` where are you from ? '' - `` why are you doing that ? '' - `` who do you want to see ? '' - `` when will tea be ready ? '' - `` what did you say ? '' - `` how old are you ? '' - `` what time is the football game ? '' - `` why do you look so funny ? '' - `` why did the chicken cross the road ? '' - `` where can i find the nearest subway station ? '' - `` why do you allow people to change an online encyclopedia ? '' different kinds of why questions need different kinds of answers . a question like `` why did you do that ? '' clearly asks for an explanation . what that explanation might be depends on context . this kind of explanation is not right or wrong : it all depends on circumstance . the question and answer may also have to do with `` who '' , `` what '' , `` when '' and `` where '' .
