Common chimpanzee     the common chimpanzee ( `` pan troglodytes '' ) , or robust chimpanzee , is a species of great ape . the common chimpanzee is often called the chimpanzee ( or `` chimp '' ) , though this can be used to refer to both species in the genus `` pan '' : the common chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo . evidence from fossils and dna sequencing show both species of chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to modern humans . the common chimpanzee is more robust than the bonobo , weighing between and measuring approximately from head to tail . its gestation period is eight months . the infant is weaned at about three years old , but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several more years ; it reaches puberty at the age of eight to 10 , and its lifespan in captivity is about 50 years . the common chimpanzee lives in groups which range from 15 to 150 members , although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day . the species lives in a male-dominated , strict hierarchy , so disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence . nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools , modifying sticks , rocks , grass , and leaves and use them for acquiring honey , termites , ants , nuts , and water . the species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees .
