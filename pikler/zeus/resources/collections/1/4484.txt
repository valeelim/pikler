Big Bang     the big bang is a scientific theory about how the universe started , and then made the stars and galaxies we see today . the universe began very hot , small , and dense superforce ( the mix of the 4 cosmic forces ) , with no stars , atoms , form , or structure ( called a `` singularity '' ) . then about 13.8 billion years ago , space expanded very quickly ( thus the name `` big bang '' ) . this started the formation of atoms , which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies . it was georges lema√Ætre who first noted ( in 1927 ) that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point . the universe is still expanding today , but getting colder as well . as a whole , universe is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes . cosmology is the study of how the universe began and its development . scientists who study cosmology agree that the big bang theory matches what they have observed so far . fred hoyle called the theory the `` big bang '' on his radio show . he did not believe the big bang was correct . scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it . since then , fred hoyle 's reasons for not agreeing with the theory have been proved wrong .
