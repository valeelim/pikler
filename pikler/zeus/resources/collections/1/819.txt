'theatre ' can also mean the business of putting on plays . an actor might say `` i am in the theatre business '' , or a writer might say `` i write for the theatre '' , meaning that they write plays , rather than writing for movies or television shows . the first people we know created plays were the ancient greeks , about the year 500 b.c . they divided plays into two kinds : tragedy and comedy . this division is still used today . the best known ancient greek writers of plays are aeschylus , sophocles , euripides and aristophanes . some of their plays survived , and are still performed today .
