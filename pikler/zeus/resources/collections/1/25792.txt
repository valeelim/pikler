Vein     a vein is a type of blood vessel in the body . all veins carry blood to the heart . most veins carry blood that is low in oxygen , except for the pulmonary vein and the umbilical veins which carry blood that is high in oxygen . a vein has a large lumen ( width ) and less pressure than an artery . there is smaller amounts of smooth muscle and elastic fibres in the vessel wall . most veins have one-way valves that keep blood from going backwards . veins carry blood to the heart and enter the heart through the vena cava , the biggest vein in human bodyã…… other important veins are the coronary veins ( veins on the heart ) and renal veins ( veins on the kidney ) . veins are mainly seen just below the skin , and could easily be seen from the outside , where they look blue because of the lack of oxygen . the blood carried by veins is dark red , but when a vein is cut or pierced , the dark blood immediately reacts with the oxygen in the air and becomes bright red colored . the vein appears blue because of the scattering of light through the skin and the way the eye perceives color and light .
