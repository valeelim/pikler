Stomach     the stomach is part of the digestive system . it is an internal organ between the esophagus and the small intestines . the stomach is the third stage in the digestive process . it holds food after ingestion . food in the stomach then passes through to the small intestine where most of the food 's nutrition is absorbed . the stomach contains hydrochloric acid made by stomach cells . as a useful side-effect , the acid kills bacteria in the food . however , its main function is to help the protein-digesting enzymes called proteases work . in general , the food is churned , squeezed and mixed . this prepares it for digestion . the partially digested food is called chyme . the stomach acid may cause problems . it can make peptic ulcers worse . it can also cause heartburnâ€”pain in the chest when acid from the stomach `` refluxes '' ( backs up into ) the oesophagus . these can usually be treated by neutralizing the acid . vomiting occurs when food goes back up the oesophagus and out the mouth . vomiting can be a symptom of disease .
