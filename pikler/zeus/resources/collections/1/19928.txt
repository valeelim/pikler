Sauce     in cooking , a sauce is a liquid mixture added to another food for flavour . sauces are not normally eaten by themselves ; they add flavour , moisture , and visual appeal to another dish . sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world . the main sauces of french cuisine are built on a basis of roux , which is just flour and the liquid part of butter . examples from italian cuisine are the egg , cheese and ham sauce called `` carbonara '' ; the ground meat sauce called `` bolognese '' , and the herbs and garlic sauce called `` pesto '' . bottled sauces can be poured over food when it is served . an example would be the tomato-based sauce that is usually poured over spaghetti . gravy is a brown sauce served with meat . `` sauce '' is a french word taken from the latin `` salsus '' , meaning `` salted '' . possibly the oldest sauce recorded is `` garum '' , the fish sauce used by the romans . sauces need a liquid component , but some sauces ( for example , pico de gallo salsa or chutney ) may contain more solid elements than liquid .
