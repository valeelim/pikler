Page     a page can be different things : - usually , a page is a physical sheet of paper in a book , magazine , newspaper etc . when a page is not in a book ( etc . ) it is a `` sheet '' or `` piece '' of paper . - when we talk about computers , a page is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for `` webpage '' . here the page is not paper , it is a piece of information which we can see on a computer monitor at one time . we can print it to make a real page . but the information may not fit all on one page , and we can not change it when it is printed - we can change a web page . so a webpage is not always the same even as a printed copy of that page . this is a conceptual metaphor . it can be confusing . someone who uses it is also likely to use other jargon . - a page is also a boy or a young man who helps carry things and does small jobs for someone . another word for this is a `` pageboy '' . - to page someone is to contact that person on their `` pager '' : this is a small electronic machine which makes a sound or gives someone a message .
