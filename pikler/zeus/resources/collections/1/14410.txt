Saint Anna     saint anna is the mother of virgin mary and the grandmother of jesus . her husband is saint joachim . her name is a version of the hebrew name hanna . anna means grace . according to tradition , joachim went to a temple to pray , but was not allowed in because he did not have a child . anna heard , prayed , and sacrificed . she promised god that she would bring up a child in god 's name . an angel came to anna and joachim and told them that god would grant her a baby . anna had the baby soon after , and named the girl mary . anna kept her promise . when mary was about three years old joachim and anna brought her up in the second temple . in detail , once as anna prayed beneath a laurel tree near her home in galilee , an angel appeared and said to her , `` anna , the lord hath heard thy prayer and thou shalt conceive and bring forth , and thy seed shall be spoken of in all the world . '' anna replied , `` as the lord my god liveth , if i beget either male or female , i will bring it as a gift to the lord my god ; and it shall minister to him in holy things all the days of its life `` and thus anna became the mother of the blessed virgin mary .
