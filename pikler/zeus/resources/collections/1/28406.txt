Capacitor     a capacitor ( also called condenser , which is the older term ) is an electronic device that stores electric energy . it is similar to a battery , but is smaller , lightweight and charges up much quicker . capacitors are used in many electronic devices today , and can be made out of many different types of material . the leyden jar was one of the first capacitors invented . capacitors are usually made with two metal plates that are on top of each other and near each other , but that do not actually touch . when powered , they allow energy to be stored inside an electrical field . because the plates need a lot of area to store even a small amount of charge , the plates are usually rolled up into some other shape , such as a cylinder . sometimes , other shapes of capacitors are used for special purposes . a capacitor-like effect can also result just from two conductors being close to each other , whether you want it to exist or not . the type of capacitor used depends on the application . capacitors come in many sizes . they can be as small as an ant or as large as a dustbin . a few capacitors are adjustable .
