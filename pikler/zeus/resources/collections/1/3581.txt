Schizophrenia     schizophrenia is a medical disorder of the mind . people with this disorder often do not behave the way most people do towards others . they also may not know what is real ( this is called psychosis ) . some common signs are strange beliefs , unclear or confused thinking and language , hallucinations ( such as hearing voices that are n't there ) , poor interaction with others , less expression of feelings , and not doing much . diagnosis is based on observing the person and what he or she says about experiences such as hearing voices . problems have to last for at least six months before the person is diagnosed as schizophrenic . the word `` schizophrenia '' comes from two greek words that mean `` to split '' and `` mind , '' because there is a 'split ' between what 's going on in the person 's mind and what is actually happening . a person with schizophrenia does not change between different personalities : they have only one . the condition in which a person has more than one personality , meaning they act like a different person at different times , is dissociative identity disorder . there are no medical tests that can be used to say if a person has schizophrenia or not , so getting a diagnosis depends on which list of symptoms are used . it also depends on the doctor or psychologist who talks to the person . the lists of symptoms include wording like `` disorganized [ not organized , or oddly organized ] speech present for a significant portion of time '' . it is difficult to agree on what exactly `` disorganized speech '' is and how disorganized it has to be . it is also difficult to agree on how long a `` significant portion of time '' is . because of this , two doctors or psychologists trying to make a diagnosis may often disagree . one will say that the person is schizophrenic and the other will say he or she is not .
