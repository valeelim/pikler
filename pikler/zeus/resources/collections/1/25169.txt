Radar     radar is a machine that uses radio waves for echolocation to find objects such as aircraft , ships , and rain . the basic parts of a radar are : - the transmitter creates the radio waves . - the antenna directs the radio waves . - the receiver measures the waves which are bounced back by the object . by doing this , the radar can locate the object . radar is used in many different ways . it can measure the speed and number of cars on a road , the amount of water in the air , and many other things . radar was first used in 1904 by christian h√ºlsmeyer . he was given a patent for radar ( reichspatent nr . 165546 ) . it became commonplace during world war ii . the word `` radar '' was created in 1942 as an acronym for radio detection and ranging . this acronym replaced the british initialism `` rdf '' ( `` radio direction finding '' ) . the word is now thought of by many people as a regular word , no longer as an acronym . the faa ( federal aviation administration ) use several kinds of radar : - arsr ( air route surveillance radar )
