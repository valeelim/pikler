Kernel (computer science)    kernel ( computer science ) a kernel is the central part of an operating system . it manages the operations of the computer and the hardware - most notably memory and cpu time . there are two types of kernels : - a microkernel , which only contains basic functionality ; - a monolithic kernel , which contains many device drivers . a computer user never interacts directly with the kernel . it runs behind the scenes and can not be seen , except for the text logs that it prints . the kernel is the most fundamental part of an operating system . it can be thought of as the program which controls all other programs on the computer . when the computer starts , it goes through some initialization ( booting ) function , such as checking memory . it is responsible for assigning and unassigning memory space which allows software to run . it provides services so programs can request the use of the network card , the disk or other piece of hardware ( the kernel forwards the request to special programs called device drivers which control the hardware ) , manages the file system and sets interrupts for the cpu to enable multitasking . many kernels are also responsible for ensuring that faulty programs do not interfere with the operation of others , by denying access to memory that has not been allocated to them and restricting the amount of cpu time they can consume .
