Detroit Red Wings     the detroit red wings are an ice hockey team in the national hockey league ( nhl ) . the red wings were formed in 1926. the western canada hockey league ( wchl ) folded that year , and many of the players from the wchl 's victoria cougars went to play for detroit . as a result , the team was first called the detroit cougars , then later it changed to detroit falcons , before becoming known as the red wings . in the late 1940s , the line of sid abel , gordie howe , and ted lindsey became very important to the team . abel won the hart trophy in 1949 , and lindsey won the art ross trophy as scoring champion in 1950. howe then won six hart and six art ross trophies between 1951 and 1963. terry sawchuck was a star goaltender , who ended up with more career shutouts than any other goalie ( 103 ) . red kelly won the first ever norris trophy as best defence . as a result of having such great players , the red wings won four stanley cups in six years : 1950 , 1952 , 1954 , and 1955. two of these were very close : they were won in overtime of the 7th and deciding game in 1950 ( against the new york rangers ) and 1954 ( against the montreal canadiens ) . these are the only two times the nhl championship has gone to overtime of game seven .
