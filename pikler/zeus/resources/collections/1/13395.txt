Action theory     action theory is an area in philosophy that talks about theories about the processes that cause intentional ( willful ) human body movements . some philosophers ask the question 'what is an action ? ' or 'what makes somebody do an action ? ' . here are two theories . some philosophers say that an action is caused by a person wanting something and thinking that by doing that action they can get it . for example , if i want an apple and think that by walking to a table with some apples on it i can get one , then i will walk to the table . it is important to have both a want ( desire ) and a thought about how to get it ( belief ) . if i think that by walking to a table with some apples on it i can get an apple , but want an orange and not an apple , then i will not walk to the table . if i want an apple , but think that the table across the room is just a picture of a table , then i will not walk to the table . other philosophers say that the want-think theory is not true . they say that it is my brain and my nerves that causes an action . they see the brain as working like a computer that directs small electric packages from some nerves to other nerves and stores some for a while in memory . these packages can not be named , they are just like computer bits and bytes . these philosophers say that we talk about what we want and what we think because the brain is very complicated and we do not understand it yet .
