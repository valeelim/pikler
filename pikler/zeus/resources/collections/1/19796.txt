FTP     ftp , also known as file transfer protocol , is a communication protocol for the rapid , simple transmission of files across a network supporting the tcp/ip protocol . this network is generally the internet , or a local network . ftp is a way of accessing files on another computer . ftp uses the client-server architecture , meaning that there is a server , that holds the files , and does the authentication , and a client , or the end-user , who is accessing the files . the server listens on the network for connection requests from other computers . the client can make a connection to the ftp server by using ftp client software . once connected and authenticated ( via rsh or sftp ) the client can do things such as uploading files to the server , downloading files ( taking the server 's files and putting them on his own computer ) from the server , and renaming , deleting files on the server , changing file permissions , etc . most modern operating systems support ftp . this implies that any computer to connected to a tcp/ip based network can manipulate files on another computer on that network regardless of which operating systems are involved , provided that they are open to ftp connections . there are many existing ftp client and server programs , many of these are available free , or open source .
