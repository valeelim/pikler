Scrotum     the scrotum is the bag that holds the testicles ( commonly called `` balls '' ) in male mammals . it is made of skin and muscle and is found between the penis and anus . it is often covered in pubic hair and becomes tight when the male is aroused . the function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body . human testicles work best at 36.8 degrees celsius ( 98 degrees fahrenheit ) when normal body temperature is 37 degrees celsius ( 98.6 degrees fahrenheit ) . higher temperatures than 36.8 degrees will damage the sperm inside the testicles . the temperature is controlled by moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when they are too cold , and away when too hot . this is done by muscles contracting or relaxing . this lifts and lowers the testicles inside the scrotum . the scrotum will usually tighten during erection . the testicles can also be lifted by tightening the anus and pelvic muscles . the best temperature for the testes varies between species , but usually it is a bit cooler than body temperature . this means that the testicles have to be held outside of the body in most male mammals .
