Selene     selene is the goddess of the moon and a titan in greek mythology . she is the daughter of hyperion and theia . she later became one with the goddess artemis . in roman mythology the moon goddess is called luna , latin for `` moon '' . the roman luna became one with diana . like most moon deities , selene plays a fairly big role in her pantheon . in the collection of poems called the homeric hymns , there is a `` hymn to selene '' ( xxxii ) , used with the hymn to helios ; in it selene is called `` far-winged '' , a name ordinarily applied to birds . selene is also talked about in nonnus , `` dionysiaca '' 48.581 ; pausanias 5.1.4 ; and strabo 14.1.6 , the etymology of `` selene '' is not known , but if the word is from greek , it is probably connected to the word `` selas '' , meaning `` light '' . `` boreion selas '' is the greek name for aurora borealis . the word `` selenology '' , the study of the geology of the moon , comes from her name . the chemical element selenium was also named after selene . in post-renaissance art , selene is shown as a beautiful woman with a pale face . she is sometimes riding a silver chariot ( cart ) pulled by oxen or a pair of horses . often , she is shown riding a horse or bull , wearing robes and a half-moon on her head and carrying a torch .
