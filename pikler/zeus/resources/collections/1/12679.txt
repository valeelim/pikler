Compact disc player     a cd player is a device that can read the binary data on a cd ( compact disc ) and turn that into sound waves . a cd player has a laser and an optical sensor . a cd has tracks and bumps on the tracks . the cd player passes a laser beam along the track of the cd . the areas that are reflected ( without the bumps ) are 1s to the player and the areas that are reflected ( with the bumps ) are 0s to the player . when the 1 's and 0 's are added to the cd a complicated coding is used that enables error corrections to prevent the cd `` skipping '' in the event of a small scratch . the cd player converts the series of 1 's and 0 's into sound waves by sending a varying voltage into an amplifier which then drives a speaker . the conversion of digital data into an analogue signal is achieved through the use a matrix ( maths not the movie ) , imaginary numbers and trigonometric functions .
