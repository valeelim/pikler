European Union     the european union ( abbreviation : eu ) is a `` de facto '' confederation of 27 member countries in europe , started in 1957 as the european economic community ( eec ) . it has created a common economic area with europe-wide laws allowing the citizens of eu countries to move and trade in other eu countries almost the same as they do in their own . nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money : the euro . the treaty of lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the union is run . every member state signed to say that they each agreed with what it says . most importantly , it says which jobs ( `` powers '' ) the union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves . the members decide how the union should act by voting for or against proposals . the objective of the eu is to bring its member states closer together with respect of human rights and democracy . it does this with a common style of passport , common rules about fair trading with each other , common agreements about law enforcement , and other agreements . most members share a common currency ( the euro ) and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport .
