Tapeworm     tapeworms are the class cestoda of segmented flatworms ( platyhelminthes ) . they are parasitic , which means that they need another larger creature as a host . tapeworms live inside the intestines of vertebrate animals . this includes humans . when a vertebrate has a tapeworm , they may lose weight and become weaker . tapeworms can be up to 30 or 36 feet ( 10â€“12 metres ) long . they eat by absorbing material directly through their epidermis ( outside layer ) . the head of a tapeworm has four suckers and two rings of hooks . the body of a tapeworm is in segments ( pieces that are like each other ) . each segment can produce eggs . little segments of the tapeworm sometimes break off and pass out through the stool of the host , with the eggs . little segments of its body fall off . they go out of the host body , and are eaten by the next host , which is another type of vertebrate . tapeworms are hermaphrodite , with both sexes . cross-fertilization occurs between two tapeworms in the same intestine . they have a life cycle with a secondary or intermediate host . for example , human tapeworms have cows or pigs as intermediate hosts . the 'definitive ' host ( humans in this case ) is the one where fertilization takes place .
