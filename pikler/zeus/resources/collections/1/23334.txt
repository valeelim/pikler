Exodus     exodus is the second book in the torah , or books of moses . exodus in hebrew is called `` shmowt '' , which means `` names . '' exodus means 'going out ' in latin . it is about how the hebrew people were led out of egypt by god . moses , their leader , hears god 's words and in turn tells the israelites . exodus ends with god 's laws and his instructions on how to build a holy container called the ark of the covenant . after the hebrews went to egypt to get food , the old pharaoh died and a new pharaoh came to power and made each hebrew a slave . the pharaoh made the hebrews work for them very hard , and told his soldiers to throw their babies into the nile river . a baby ; moses , who was put in a reed basket set adrift on the nile and later rescued by an egyptian princess , grew up in pharaoh 's palace , later killed an egyptian slave-driver . he escaped from egypt and lived away from his people in midian for jethro , his father-in-law . one day , while moses was tending his flocks , god appeared in a burning bush to moses and instructed him to lead the israelites out of egypt . as moses had no confidence in doing this task , god gives him his brother aaron to help him . aaron was a good talker and helped moses speak to the pharaoh .
