MS-DOS     ms-dos is a computer operating system by microsoft corporation . it stands for `` microsoft disk operating system '' , and came from an operating system microsoft bought called qdos , or the `` quick and dirty operating system . '' it was popularly used in pcs before an operating system called microsoft windows came out and still is in some places today . os/2 was originally made by a joint agreement with companies that are called microsoft and ibm . os/2 was maintained by ibm until 2006. os/2 was supposed to replace ms-dos , but that replacement did not succeed . ms-dos was the framework behind windows operating systems until an operating system known as windows xp . ms-dos is a text-based operating system , meaning that a user works with a keyboard to input data and receives output in plain text . later on , ms-dos often had programs using a mouse and graphics to make work more simple and quick . ( some people still believe that working without graphics is really more efficient . ) it is called a disk operating system because it was originally made to be loaded into a computer 's memory with a floppy disk each time the computer is started ( booted ) up .
