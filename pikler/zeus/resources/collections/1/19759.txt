Primary color     primary colors ( or primary colours ) are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors . the primary colors are those which can not be created by mixing other colors in a given color space . for subtractive combination of colors , as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing , the primaries normally used are cyan , magenta , and yellow , though the set of red , yellow , blue is popular among artists . for additive combination of colors , as in overlapping projected lights or in crt displays , the primary colors normally used are red , green , and blue . primary colors are not a fundamental property of light but are related to the physiological response of the eye to light ( the way the eye works ) . for humans , three primary colors are usually used , since human color vision is trichromatic . fundamentally , light is a continuous spectrum of the wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye , an infinite-dimensional stimulus space . however , the human eye normally contains only three types of color receptors , called cone cells . each color receptor respond to different ranges of the color spectrum . humans and other species with three such types of color receptors are known as trichromats .
