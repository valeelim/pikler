Netherlands Antilles     the netherlands antilles was a country within the kingdom of the netherlands . the country was originally a group of six islands in the caribbean sea . some were discovered in 1493 by christopher columbus , and some were discovered in 1499 by alonso de ojeda . aruba , bonaire and curaçao are part of the leeward islands . they are near venezuela . saint martin , sint eustatius , and saba are part of the windward islands . they are near puerto rico and the virgin islands . of these , the island sint maarten is in fact part of two countries : the northern part belongs to france ( as saint martin ) , but the southern part is dutch ( as sint maarten ) . aruba left the netherlands antilles in 1986. when curaçao and sint maarten did the same thing on 10 october 2010 , the country no longer existed . the remaining bes islands of bonaire , sint eustatius and saba now belong to the netherlands and are called the dutch caribbean islands . because the netherlands antilles was a part of the kingdom of the netherlands , queen beatrix of the netherlands proper was also the queen of the netherlands antilles , but the islands ' residents had a government of their own . aruba , curaçao and sint maarten are now separate countries within the kingdom . all of these places still have king willem-alexander as their monarch today .
