Social network     a social network is a set of people who interact . this includes group organizations . the social relationships may include friendship/affect , communication , economic transactions , interactions , kinship , authority/hierarchy , trust , social support , diffusion , contagion , and so on . calling social relationships a network calls attention to the pattern or structure of the set of relationships . a community social network is the pattern of relationships among a set of people and/or organizations in a community . each of these networks can involve social support , give people a sense of community , and lead them to help and protect each other . how big a personal network becomes depends on the individual and the type of relationships considered . `` the set of people that a person knows well or with whom a person frequently interacts seldom exceeds several hundred '' . as the size of a network grows , keeping relationships is strained by the size . there is a so-called `` law of 150 '' which suggests that about 150 people is the best size for a village or large clan though most people live in much bigger towns . some experts think that a corporation has an ideal size of about 70 people : these people and their spouses would also make a large social network .
