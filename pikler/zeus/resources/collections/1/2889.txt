Developmental biology     developmental biology is the study of the process by which organisms grow and develop . modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of cell growth , differentiation and morphogenesis . these are the processes which turn a zygote into an adult animal . differentiation is the formation of cell types , from what is originally one cell – the zygote or spore . the formation of cell types like nerve cells occurs with a number of intermediary , less differentiated cell types . a cell stays a certain cell type by maintaining a particular pattern of gene expression . this depends on regulatory genes . embryogenesis is the step in the life cycle after fertilisation – the development of the embryo , starting from the zygote ( fertilised egg ) . organisms can differ drastically in the how embryo develops , especially when they belong to different phyla . growth is the enlargement of a tissue or organism . growth continues after the embryonic stage , and occurs through cell division , enlargement of cells or accumulation of extracellular material . in plants , growth results in an adult organism that is strikingly different from the embryo . the dividing cells tend to be distinct from differentiated cells ( see stem cell ) .
