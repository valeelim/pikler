Time     we use time to sequence events , to compare their durations and the intervals between them , and to quantify the speed at which objects move and things change . to measure time , we can use anything that repeats itself regularly . one example is the dawn of a new day ( as earth rotates on its axis ) . two more are the phases of the moon ( as it orbits the earth ) , and the seasons of the year ( as the earth orbits the sun ) . even in ancient times , people developed calendars to keep track of the number of days in a year . they also developed sundials that used the moving shadows cast by the sun through the day to measure times smaller than a day . today , highly accurate clocks can measure times less than a billionth of a second . the study of time measurement is horology . the si ( systeme internationale ) unit of time is one second , written as s. in einsteinian physics , time and space can be combined into a single concept . see space-time continuum . units of time . - 1 = ~1 billion years ( in astronomy )
