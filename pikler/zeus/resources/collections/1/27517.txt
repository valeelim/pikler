Swedish language     swedish ( ) is a language mostly spoken in sweden and in parts of finland , typically along the southern and western coasts and on the Ã¥land islands . more than nine million people speak swedish . it is similar to two of the other scandinavian languages , norwegian and danish , and a person who understands one of these languages can understand the others . other scandinavian languages , such as icelandic and faroese , are less closely related and can not be understood by swedish speakers . standard swedish is spoken and written throughout sweden , but there are some local dialects with differences in grammar and vocabulary in small towns and rural areas . swedish began as a dialect of old norse , which was a language that everyone in scandinavia understood during the viking age . around the 12th century swedish began to slowly become different from the other dialects . these dialects later became what we today call norwegian , icelandic , faroese and danish . swedish is a germanic language with some similarities to english because of the vikings that invaded england in the 10th century . it is even more similar to german and dutch , partly because of the hanseatic league of the middle ages , when sweden traded very openly with germany .
