PH     ph ( potential of hydrogen ) is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. it tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is . more acidic solutions , have lower ph . more alkaline solutions , have higher ph . substances that are n't acidic or alkaline ( that is , neutral solutions ) usually have a ph of 7. acids have a ph that is less than 7. alkalis have a ph that is greater than 7. ph is a measure of the of protons ( h ) in a solution . introduced this concept in the year 1909. the p stands for the german `` potenz '' , meaning power or concentration , and the h for the hydrogen ion ( h ) . the formula for calculating ph is : [ h ] indicates the concentration of h ions ( also written [ ho ] , the equal concentration of ions ) , measured in moles per litre ( also known as molarity ) . most substances have a ph in the range of 0 to 14 , although `` extremely '' acidic or alkaline substances may have ph < 0 , or ph > 14. alkaline substances have , instead of hydrogen ions , a concentration of hydroxide ions ( oh ) . certain dyes change colour depending on whether they are in an acid solution or an alkaline solution . ph indicator is a chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the ph ( acidity or basicity ) of the solution can be seen . the ph indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions ( ho ) or hydrogen ions ( h ) . normally , the indicator causes the colour of the solution to change depending on the ph .
