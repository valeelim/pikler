Jubilee line     the jubilee line is a line on the london underground . it runs from stanmore in north-west london to stratford in east london . the colour of the jubilee line on tube maps is grey . the line opened on 1 may 1979 , taking over one of the bakerloo line 's two branches to relieve the main part of the line . to the baker street to stanmore part a new four-kilometre part into central london was added , terminating at a new station at charing cross railway station . the old charing cross station , on the circle , district , bakerloo and northern lines , was renamed embankment . the new charing cross tube station created a new interchange , from the stations of strand on the northern line and trafalgar square on the bakerloo . the jubilee line of 1979 was to be the first part of the project , but because of the lack of money the line stayed the same until the late 1990s . phase 2 would have extended the line along fleet street to stations at aldwych , ludgate circus , cannon street , fenchurch street , st katherine 's dock , wapping and then under the river thames to new cross , terminating at lewisham . an alternative plan was created in the late 1970s to extend the jubilee line in parallel with the river thames , this would taken the line from wapping to thamesmead via surrey docks north , canary wharf , north greenwich , custom house , silvertown , woolwich arsenal and to thamesmead . however the 'river line ' extension as it was called was too expensive and construction of the extension never started .
