Steam engine     a steam engine is an engine which uses steam from boiling water to make it move . the steam pushes on the engine parts to make them move . steam engines can power many kinds of machines including vehicles and electric generators . steam engines were used in mine pumps starting in the early 18th century and were much improved by james watt in the 1770s . they were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses , windmills and watermills to work machines . the first steam engines were piston engines . the steam pressure pushed on a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a `` reciprocal '' ( back-and-forth ) motion . this could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine . they operated at low pressure and had to be very big to make much power . steam engines were used in factories to work machines and in mines to move pumps . later smaller engines were built that could move railway locomotives and steam boats . the steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler that heats water to make steam . in most places fire heats the boiler . fuel for the fire may be wood , coal , or petroleum . nuclear energy or solar energy may be used instead of fire . the steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston . a valve sends the steam to one end of the piston , then the other , to make it move backwards and forwards . movement of the piston is then used to turn wheels or drive other machinery . the crosshead stops the piston rod from getting out of line when it pushes the connecting rod . the heavy spinning flywheel smooths out the power from the piston . the governor controls the speed of the engine .
