Battle of Trafalgar     the battle of trafalgar was a sea battle fought on 21 october 1805 between the navies of france and spain on one side , and great britain on the other . the battle took place near cape trafalgar ( a cape is a piece of land sticking out into the sea ) , which is in southwest spain . the battle ended with a clear victory for the british forces . this allowed britain to become the world 's largest sea power for 100 years . the battle of trafalgar was the most important sea battle of the 19th century . france and britain had been at war for some time . france had built the strongest army in europe , and controlled much of the land . because it was an island , britain had built a strong navy , and had used this to try to prevent french ships from leaving their ports . ( this is called a `` blockade '' . ) because the french leader napoleon bonaparte wanted to invade ( capture ) britain , he knew that he would have to sink the british navy first , otherwise it would be able to prevent his army from landing .
