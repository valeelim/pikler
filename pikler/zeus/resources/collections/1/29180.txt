Theatre of ancient Greece     the theatre of ancient greece was at its best from 550 bc to 220 bc . it was the beginning of modern western theatre , and some ancient greek plays are still performed today . they invented the genres of tragedy ( late 6th century ) , comedy ( 486 ) and satyr plays . the city-state of athens was a great cultural , political and military power during this period . drama was at its centre . theatre was part of a festival called the dionysia , which honoured the god dionysus . in the dionysia , the playwrights presented their work to an audience . it was a competition , with a winner and prizes . these two main genres were never mixed : they each had their own typical structure . athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote their way of life . only men were allowed as actors . the chorus were men , as were the actors and the audience . technically , they had to be citizens of athens , which only applied to free-born men plus a few special cases . the actors wore masks , so that the people would know which persona ( character ) the actor played .
