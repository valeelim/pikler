Hephaestus     hephaestus was the greek god of fire and volcanoes . his roman equivalent is the god vulcan . he was prayed to by metal workers . hephaestus mother and father were hera and zeus . his grandparents were kronos and rhea . when hephaestus was born , he was ugly and weak , with a broken foot . hera did not like the way he looked and threw him off her castle which was on top of the clouds . hephaestus fell for one day and one night before falling into the sea . the sea animals rescued him and took him to an island called lemnos . there hephaestus built his forge underneath a volcano . he collected precious metals , pearls and pieces of coral to fashion extraordinary jewelry . hephaestus built little robots of gold to help him get around . hephaestus even worked with the cyclopes ( one eyed creatures ) . to impress the gods and goddesses , he made a set of golden thrones for them . hera realized her mistake of throwing hephaestus off mount olympus and pleaded zeus to welcome hephaestus back . hephaestus politely refused , saying that he was quite happy where he was . then he set to work and fashioned a beautiful golden throne and sent it to hera as a ‘ thank you gift ’ for the invitation . the instant she sat on it , golden ropes flew out and tied her up locking her into the chair .
