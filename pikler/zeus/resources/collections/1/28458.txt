Flashlight     a flashlight ( in north american english ) or torch ( in most commonwealth countries ) is a small , portable spotlight . its function is a beam of light which helps to see . it usually requires batteries . the light is made by a small light bulb . in the 20th century it was usually an incandescent bulb . nowadays most use leds , which work slightly differently . in 1896 , the first dry cell battery was invented . unlike previous batteries , it used a paste electrolyte instead of a liquid . this was the first battery suitable for portable electrical devices , as it did not spill or break easily and worked in any orientation . sometimes the electricity comes from a small generator instead of a battery . hundreds of years ago , people used candles for all indoor light . this was expensive , and once the candle was gone , you would have to buy or make a new one or be stuck in the dark . when electricity was discovered and the light bulb was invented , david misell , a british man working in hubert 's new york shop in 1898 , came up with the idea of a light bulb that you could take with you , anywhere you wanted to go . then , the torch was invented .
