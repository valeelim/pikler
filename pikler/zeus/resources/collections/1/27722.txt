Solar eclipse     when seen from earth , a solar eclipse ( ee klips ' ) happens when the moon passes between the earth and the sun . this makes the moon fully or partially ( partly ) cover the sun . solar eclipses can only happen during a new moon . every year about two solar eclipses occur . sometimes there are even five solar eclipses in a year . however , only two of these can be total solar eclipses , and they are quite uncommon . the area in which an eclipse is total is only a narrow track along the earth . totality lasts only a few minutes . outside this path , all eclipses are partial , and places far from the track get no eclipse at all . the track can be predicted many years before it happens . many people who are sometimes called `` eclipse chasers '' or `` umbraphiles '' ( the moon 's shadow is called an `` umbra '' ) travel to faraway places to see solar eclipses . after the solar eclipse on august 11 , 1999 , in europe , people began to show more interest in solar eclipses . on october 3 , 2005 , there was another solar eclipse , and unusually many people came to see it .
