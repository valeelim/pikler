Shape of the universe     the shape of the universe can not be discussed with everyday terms , because all the terms need to be those of einsteinian relativity . the geometry of the universe is therefore not the ordinary euclidean geometry of our everyday lives . according to the special theory of relativity , it is impossible to say whether two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space . to speak of `` the shape of the universe ( at a point in time ) '' is naive from the point of view of special relativity . due to the relativity of simultaneity we can not speak of different points in space as being `` at the same point in time '' nor , therefore , of `` the shape of the universe at a point in time '' . what astrophysicists do is ask whether a particular model of the universe is consistent with what is known through observations and measurements of the universe . if the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe ( in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller or even infinitesimal ) , observation is limited to a part of the whole .
