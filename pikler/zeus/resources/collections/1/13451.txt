Circulatory system     the circulatory system is the body system that moves blood around the body consisting of heart and all blood vessels . blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries . arteries divide into smaller arteries as they go away from the heart . the smaller arteries that connect to the capillaries , are called `` arterioles '' . blood vessels that take blood towards the heart are veins . veins get bigger as they go towards the heart . the smallest veins are called `` venules '' . capillaries go between arteries and veins . capillaries are quite thin , hence the name which comes from the latin `` capillus '' meaning `` hair . '' so blood moves : heart→artery→arteriole→capillary→venule→vein→heart . this is called circulation . there are two different `` circulations '' in the circulatory system . the `` systemic circulation '' is how blood goes to most of the body . the `` pulmonary circulation '' is how blood goes through the lungs . ( pulmonary means ¨about the lungs¨ ) . this is how it works in mammals , including humans . circulatory systems of other vertebrates differ somewhat . invertebrates are very different .
