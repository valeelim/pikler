Internet Protocol     the internet protocol ( ip ) is the fundamental communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relaying data across network boundaries . it essentially establishes the internet . historically , ip did not provide the connectivity ; it only specified how packets are supposed to be created . the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) allowed this functionality . due to this , one could not perform it 's task without the other ; they go hand in hand , therefore they earned the name tcp/ip , as a sign of their dependency on each other . think of ip as something like the postal system . it allows you to address a package and drop it into the system , but there is no actual direct `` link '' between you and the recipient . instead , there is a `` web '' of links interconnecting with each other . this is where ip and tcp come in . ip tells packets what their destination is and how to get there ; tcp ensures a reliable connection , checking packets for errors , requesting a `` re-transmission '' if it detects one .
