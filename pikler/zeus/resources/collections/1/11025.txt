Cylinder     a cylinder is one of the most basic curved geometric shapes , with the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given line segment , known as the axis of the cylinder . the shape can be thought of as a circular prism . both the surface and the solid shape created inside can be called a `` cylinder '' . the surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times . in differential geometry , a cylinder is defined more broadly as any ruled surface which is spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines . a cylinder whose cross section is an ellipse , parabola , or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder , parabolic cylinder , or hyperbolic cylinder respectively . in common use a `` cylinder '' is taken to mean a finite section of a right circular cylinder , i.e. , the cylinder with the generating lines perpendicular to the bases , with its ends closed to form two circular surfaces , as in the figure ( right ) . if the cylinder has a radius and length ( height ) `` h '' , then its volume is given by :
