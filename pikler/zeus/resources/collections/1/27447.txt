Address     an address ( pronounced ad-dress or ad-dress ) is a way to find or communicate with someone . it can be a postal address or an e-mail address . on forms , it is common to ask for someone 's name , address and phone number , so that the person can be found easily . a postal address is usually the location of someone 's house , but sometimes it is the person 's post office box . it is the information that is put on a letter to have the letter delivered to a person . example ( in england ) : example ( in the u.s. ) : an email address is used to send someone an e-mail . it has a username , and this is followed by the name of the person 's email provider . the at sign ( @ ) separates the two . for example : the `` name '' part can be made up of any letters or numbers , and a few special characters , but it can not contain spaces . the `` provider '' part can be made up of any letters or numbers , but no special characters and no spaces . some providers may restrict the `` name '' part in other ways . for example , gmail does not allow underscores .
