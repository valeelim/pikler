Shanghai Fugu Agreement     the shanghai fugu agreement was a successful political prank which was landed on the social democrats in the german state of hesse in 1985. in 1985 the new green party prepared to enter into a german state government for the first time in its history . the first green cabinet minister in german history was going to be joschka fischer who later became minister of foreign affairs in the german federal government under chancellor gerhard schroeder . the 1985 hesse coalition was to be based on an official policy agreement negotiated by both parties . during a final night session of the negotiations the greens tabled a demand that hesse join the `` shanghai fugu agreement '' . this was accepted by their tired social democratic counterparts and became official state policy . the greens argued that the fugu fish is well known to be a dangerous delicacy requiring specialised chefs who mostly come from asia . due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants have found it difficult to employ such specialists . the `` shanghai fugu agreement '' provides special regulations for certified fugu chefs internationally .
