Miguel de Cervantes     miguel de cervantes saavedra ( 29 september 1547 â€“ 23 april 1616 ) was a spanish writer . his most famous book was `` don quijote de la mancha '' . it is considered the first modern novel , and therefore cervantes was the first novelist . the book has been published in 65 countries . the work is considered among the most important in all of literature . he is sometimes called `` the prince of satire '' . nobody knows for sure the reasons that forced cervantes to leave castile . whether he was a `` student '' of the same name , a `` sword-wielding fugitive from justice '' , or fleeing from a royal warrant of arrest , for having wounded a certain antonio de sigura in a duel , is another mystery . in any event , in going to italy , cervantes was doing what many young spaniards of the time did to further their careers . rome would reveal to the young artist its ecclesiastic pomp , ritual , and majesty . in a city teeming with ruins cervantes could focus his attention on renaissance art , architecture , and poetry ( knowledge of italian literature is readily discernible in his own productions ) and on rediscovering antiquity . he could find in the ancients `` a powerful impetus to revive the contemporary world in light of its accomplishments '' . thus , cervantes ' continuing desire for italy , as revealed in his later works , was in part a desire for a return to an earlier period of the renaissance .
