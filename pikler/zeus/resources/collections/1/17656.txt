Pascal's Triangle    pascal 's triangle pascal 's triangle is a mathematical triangular array . it is named after french mathematician blaise pascal , but it was used in china 3 centuries before his time . pascal 's triangle can be made as follows . on the first row , write only the number 1. then , to get the numbers of following rows , add the number that can be seen above and to the left ( if any ) and the number above and to the right ( if any ) to find the new value . for example , the numbers 1 and 3 in the fourth row are added to make 4 in the fifth row . the triangle has many uses in probability . it can also be used in binomial expansions . for example notice the coefficients are the third row of pascal 's triangle : 1 , 2 , 1. in general , when a binomial is raised to a positive integer power we have : where the coefficients `` a '' in this expansion are precisely the numbers on row `` n '' + 1 of pascal 's triangle ; in other words , formally speaking , the way of making the pascal 's triangle uses pascal 's rule , which states that for non-negative integers `` n '' and `` k '' where `` n '' â‰¥ `` k '' and with the initial condition
