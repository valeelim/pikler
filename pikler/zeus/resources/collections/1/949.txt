'chinese ' can refer to the written or the spoken languages . although there are many spoken chinese languages , they use only one writing system for the language . differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing . official china adopts a similar policy to the one in the soviet union . all official documents are written in mandarin , and mandarin is taught all over china . they have one standard language for all of the schools in china and taiwan . it is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries . in english we call it mandarin . in china they call it `` pǔtōnghuà '' or `` common to everybody speech . '' in taiwan they call it `` guóyǔ '' or `` language of the whole country '' . they need a standard language because otherwise many people would not understand each other , despite being in the same country .
