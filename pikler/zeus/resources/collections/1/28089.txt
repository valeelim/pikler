Longbow     a longbow is a type of bow . it may not have been as powerful as a crossbow but it could shoot more arrows per minute . also , the basic equipment cost little , and could be very easily mass produced . metal-tipped arrows could pierce all but the best plate armour . archers ( longbowmen ) would usually have a second weapon , often an axe , for close-quarter fighting . the longbow was mainly used in the middle ages up until henry viii 's reign . it was made from a single piece of hard wearing , flexible wood ( often yew ) . yew was cut during the winter when there was no sap . the flat side of the bow facing the target was flexible sapwood while the belly ( facing the archer ) was round and made of strong heartwood ( from the center of a tree ) . the devastating hail of the longbowmen ( at a rate of six per minute ) was often very demoralizing . longbows have been found in europe as far back as the mesolithic period . in the british isles the weapon was first recorded as being used by the welsh . in ad 633 offrid , son of edwin , king of northumbria , was killed by an arrow shot from a welsh longbow . this was during a battle between the welsh and the mercians â€” more than five centuries before any record of its use in england . despite this , the weapon is more commonly known as the `` english longbow '' than the `` welsh longbow '' .
