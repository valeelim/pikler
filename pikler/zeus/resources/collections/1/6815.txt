Moresnet     moresnet or neutral moresnet ( ) was a very small territory that existed from 1816 to 1919. it had a size of 3.5 kmÂ² . it existed because its neighbours could not agree on who should own it , so they decided to make it a neutral territory where both neighbours would both have power . it was 7 km southwest of aix-la-chapelle ( germany ) , and south of the points were the borders of germany , belgium and the netherlands come together on the vaalserberg . at the congress of vienna in 1815 many borders and countries changed . one of the borders was the one between the new united kingdom of the netherlands and prussia . for the most part prussia and the netherlands agreed on the border , because it was mostly the same as the old border . around moresnet there was a problem . between the villages of moresnet and neu-moresnet was the zinc mine of vieille montagne ( in french ) / altenberg ( in german ) . both countries wanted to have this mine . in 1816 it was decided that the village of moresnet itself would become part of the netherlands , neu-moresnet would become part of prussia and the mine and the village of kelmis around it would become neutral territory where both countries shared the power .
