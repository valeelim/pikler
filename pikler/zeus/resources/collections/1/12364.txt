Nurse     a nurse is a person who is trained to give care ( help ) to people who are sick or injured . nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well ( not sick ) and to keep them fit and healthy . nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving . nursing is a profession , like a doctor , but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need . in some places , nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse . nurses work in many places . nurses work in hospitals , in doctor 's offices , and in the community , and they even visit people at home if they can not get out . sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors , because the nurses will be able to help patients directly , by talking to them , doing things they need , carefully watching that nothing goes wrong , and then seeing them as they get better . like doctors , nurses can choose what work they do . some nurses train and work to help during surgery . some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition ( what to eat ) , and disease ( what can make people sick ) . nurses can do many different jobs to help people .
