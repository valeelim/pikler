Ribosome     ribosomes are important cell organelles . a ribosome is a large complex of rna and protein . it does rna translation , building proteins from amino acids using messenger rna as a template . ribosomes are found in all living cells , prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes . a ribosome is a mixture of protein and rna that starts its formation in the nucleolus of a cell . the nucleolus is found in the center of the nucleus . the nucleus is protected by the nuclear envelope , and lets things out through the nuclear pores . the job of the ribosome is to make new proteins . it does this by moving along a strand of rna and building a protein based on the code it reads . making a protein this way is called translation . ribosomes are usually found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum , but can also be found throughout the cytoplasm . ribosomes are made out of two things : a small ribosomal subunit that reads the mrna , while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain . each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal rna ( rrna ) molecules and a variety of proteins .
