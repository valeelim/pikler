Tonality     music has tonality if it uses the notes of a major or minor scale . such music is tonal . it is in a particular `` key '' . nearly all western music is tonal . all tonal music is based on a major or minor scale . if the tune “ twinkle , twinkle little star ” is played starting on the note c , the notes of a c major scale will be used . the note c will sound like the home note ( the “ tonic ” ) and , indeed , the tune finishes on a c. the tune could have started on any other note ( c sharp , d , e flat , e etc . ) but a knowledge of scales would be needed as some sharps or flats ( black notes ) will be required . when singing the tune there is no need to think about the sharps and flats : the singer does them quite naturally . a piece of tonal music will usually modulate after a while . this means that it changes key . but the music will not sound finished until it goes back to the original key . if one sings the star-spangled banner and stops after the words “ our flag was still there ” the song sounds as if it has stopped in mid-air . it will not sound finished until it goes back to the first key in the last two lines .
