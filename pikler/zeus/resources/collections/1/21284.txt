Equinox     an equinox is when the sun passes directly over the equator . there are two equinoxes each year . equinox can also mean either of the two days when this happens . on these days , the nights are equal in length at latitudes l° north and l° south . the word `` equinox '' comes from two latin words meaning `` equal '' and `` night '' . around the day of the equinox , the length of the day is a little over twelve hours and the length of the night is a little under twelve hours . they are not exactly equal because the sun is not a point in the sky and because the sunlight bends as it comes to earth . the exact day and time when this happens depend on how far away from the equator it is being measured . they occur on or around march 21 and september 21. solstices fall around june 21st and december 21st at odd intervals . the equinoxes are the beginning of spring , and autumn ( or `` fall '' in the us ) . the time of daylight is quite easy to measure . this was done in many cultures where festivals were celebrated at the equinoxes .
