Chemical warfare     chemical warfare means using chemical compounds in war to injure or kill people . the chemicals used for chemical warfare are poisonous . chemical warfare has been used since the stone age . since 1899 , several international laws have said that using chemical weapons is illegal . but chemical weapons have still been used in wars since then . chemical weapons are different than regular weapons ( like bombs ) or nuclear weapons because they do not explode . some chemical weapons are meant to kill people ; they do this by poisoning them . other chemical weapons are meant to `` incapacitate '' people ( make them unable to fight back ) . they do this by causing pain , injuries , or sickness . chemical warfare does not include using living organisms ( like anthrax bacteria ) to make people sick . that is called biological warfare . however , some living organisms make toxins ( poisons ) . these toxins are not alive . for example , botulinum toxin is made by a bacteria , and ricin is made by the castor oil plant . because botulinum toxin and ricin are not alive , using them to make people sick is called chemical warfare . this is explained in the chemical weapons convention ( cwc ) . the convention also says that any toxic chemical is a chemical weapon unless it is used for legal reasons .
