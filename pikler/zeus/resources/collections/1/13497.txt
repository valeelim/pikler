Pedophilia     pedophilia ( paedophilia in british english ) is when a person sixteen years of age or older is primarily or exclusively sexually attracted to children who have not begun puberty ( generally eleven years old or less ) . a person with pedophilia is called a `` pedophile '' . the child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia . adults whose primary sexual attraction is for early adolescents are properly called hebephiles , not pedophiles . adults whose primary sexual attraction is for mid-to-late teens are properly called ephebophiles , but ephebophilia is not considered abnormal by mental health professionals . the opposite of pedophilia is `` teleiophilia '' ( attraction to adults ) . medically , this condition is classified by the american psychiatric association as a mental disorder . some pedophiles have sex with children or use children in a sexual way . this is called `` child sexual abuse '' because by law , children are unable to truly agree to sexual acts with an adult . some adults have pedophilic feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children . some adults who are not pedophiles commit sexual abuse against children .
