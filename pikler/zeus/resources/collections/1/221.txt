Et cetera     et cetera means `` and the rest '' in latin . it is often used in english to continue a list that is longer than what can be normally written . people most often write `` et cetera '' as etc.. very rarely , it is also written `` & c '' because the ampersand , or the `` & '' , is the same as `` et '' , having been formed by 'e ' and 't ' being joined into a single letter . it is also the symbol for `` and '' . some people write it as `` ect '' , but that is wrong since it incorrectly abbreviates `` et cetera '' . - `` jane has a lot of pets . she has cats , dogs , cows , horses , kangaroos , rabbits , etc . '' - `` robert ordered a large amount of groceries in order to stock for later . he ordered carrots , tomatoes , potatoes , eggs , etc . ''
