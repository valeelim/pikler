Tropical cyclone     a tropical cyclone is a circular air movement over the warm ocean waters in the warm part of earth near the equator . most tropical cyclones create strong winds and heavy rains . while some tropical cyclones stay out in the sea , others pass over land . this can be dangerous because they can cause a lot of damage . tropical cyclones form when convection causes warm , moist ocean air to rise . they begin as a group of storm winds when the water gets as hot as 80 °f ( 27 °c ) or hotter . the coriolis effect causes the winds to rotate . these storms usually move westward in the tropics , and later move north or south into the temperate zone . the `` eye of the storm '' is the center . it has little rain or wind . the eye wall has much rain and the strongest winds . it is surrounded by rain bands and an area of strong winds . the term `` tropical cyclone '' is a general term and includes regionally specific terms such as `` hurricane '' and `` typhoon '' . a tropical cyclone that forms in the atlantic is called a hurricane . the same is true of those that form in the eastern , central and northern pacific . in the western pacific a tropical cyclone is called a typhoon . in the indian ocean they are called `` cyclones '' . the name for a tropical cyclone depends on its location .
