Hyaena     hyaenas ( sometimes 'hyena ' ) are mammals . they are the family hyaenidae , in the order carnivora . they live in africa , and in west and south asia . in the past they had a much wider distribution . now there are two subfamilies with four species . with only four species , it is the fourth-smallest family in the carnivora , and one of the smallest in the class mammalia . despite their low diversity , hyenas are unique and vital components to most african and some asian ecosystems . hyaena walk much like bears because their front legs are longer than their back . hyaenas are known to have one of the world 's strongest bites . its function is to crush bone . hyaenas look much like canids , but they are actually in the feliformia , with cats and mongooses . although related to felines and viverrids , their life style is similar to canids . convergent evolution has taken place . both hyaenas and canids are non-climbing , running hunters which catch prey with their teeth rather than claws . both eat food quickly and may store it . their calloused feet have large , blunt , nonretractable nails , good for running and making sharp turns . however , the hyaenas ' grooming , scent marking , defecating habits , mating , and parental behaviour are similar to the behaviour of other feliforms .
