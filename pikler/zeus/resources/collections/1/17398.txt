3DO     3do is the name of the video game consoles made by the 3do company . they were released in 1993 and 1994. its features were very ahead of its time . the 3do was one of the worst-selling consoles in history because it was very expensive ( the launch price was $ 700 ) and other companies had cheaper systems . by 1994 , the price was reduced to $ 400 and eventually $ 300 . it was also not advertised very well , so no one knew about it . some of the best games for it are `` alone in the dark '' and `` myst '' . the 3do company also wanted to make another console called the m2 , but it was never released .
