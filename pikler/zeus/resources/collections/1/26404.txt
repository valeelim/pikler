Even number     an even number is an integer which is `` evenly divisible '' by two . this means that if the integer is divided by 2 , it yields no remainder . zero is an even number because zero divided by two equals zero , which despite not being a , is an integer . even numbers are either positive or negative . an integer that is not an even number is an odd number . integer addition and subtraction follows these rules : note : the symbol '± ' mean either addition or subtraction . - even ± even = even - even ± odd = odd - odd ± odd = even to find the set of even natural numbers , we use 2 '' n '' where `` n '' is any natural number . any number multiplied with an even number will result in an even number . for example : 0n , 2n , 4n , 6n , ... ( where n is any natural number ) the result is always an even number .
