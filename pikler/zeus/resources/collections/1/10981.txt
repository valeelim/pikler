Copyleft     copyleft is a name for a type of a license for free content or free software . it is not the opposite of copyright , but its purpose is the opposite of the purpose of the frequently seen copyright type of license ( which uses copyright to `` forbid '' changing , giving , or selling something ) . a copyleft license uses copyright to `` forbid forbidding '' changing , giving , or selling something . both copyleft and non-copyleft ( “ permissive ” ) licenses for free content or free software can be used for things like documents ( for example books ) , art , music and software ; they always allow people to change the works , and to give or sell them to other people . it should be noted that , although people might think that copyleft content is not copyrighted , that 's a myth . copyleft is a form of licensing : it is not just another name for public domain . however , in a copyleft license , when a person gives or sells a work ( changed or not changed ) to a friend , the person must allow the friend to do the things which the author of the original work has allowed in the license to the person . this often means , for example , that if another person licensed a book under a copyleft license , and you changed it into a new book , you would have to license your new book under the same license .
