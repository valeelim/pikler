Kurt Gödel     kurt gödel ( 28 april 1906 brno , then austria-hungary , now czech republic – 14 january 1978 princeton , new jersey ) was a logician , mathematician , and philosopher . some people believe gödel was one of the most significant logicians of all time . gödel 's work has had a big impact on scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century . many people , such as bertrand russell , a. n. whitehead , and david hilbert , tried to use logic and set theory at that time . they wanted to understand the foundations of mathematics . gödel is best known for his two incompleteness theorems . the theorems were published in 1931. he was 25 years of age , and had just finished his doctorate at the university of vienna one year earlier . the more famous of the two theorems says that if there are consistent axiomatic systems that are powerful enough to describe themselves , there will be things that are true in those systems that can not be proved within the system itself . to prove this theorem , gödel developed a technique now known as gödel numbering , which codes formal expressions as natural numbers .
