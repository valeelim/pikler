Device driver     a driver is a program that lets the operating system communicate with specific computer hardware . computer parts need a driver because they do not use standard commands . ( ex . : ati and nvidia graphic cards do the same jobs , but each requires its own driver as each driver sends different commands to the hardware ) . different operating systems also need different drivers , a driver written for linux can not be used by microsoft windows ( there are some exceptions to this , for example , linux can use windows wi-fi ( ndis ) drivers using ndiswrapper ) . many parts of a computer need drivers , and common examples are : - graphic card - modem - network card - sound card - computer printer some other computer parts do not need drivers ( or the driver is built-in to the operating system ) because they use a kind of standard ; the operating system recognizes those parts and knows how to use those parts . such parts include items on the following list : - processor - ram - cd and dvd drive ( including player and burner ) ; however , for scsi drives the controller card 's driver may be needed as well .
