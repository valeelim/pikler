Digon     a digon is a shape that has two sides and two corners ( vertices ) . it is impossible to make on a flat surface , called a plane because the sides would be the same , but possible to make on a sphere . it can be made by picking two places on a great circle and connecting them . if the places are opposite each other , the digon is called a regular digon .
