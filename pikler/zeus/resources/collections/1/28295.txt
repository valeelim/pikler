Torque     in physics , torque is the tendency of a force to turn or twist . if a force is used to begin to spin an object , or to stop an object from spinning , a torque is made . the force applied to a lever , multiplied by the distance from the lever 's fulcrum , multiplied again by the sine of the angle created , is described as torque . this is also known as `` r cross f , '' or `` force times fulcrum distance times sine theta . '' fulcrum is the axis of rotation or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something . the equation for torque is : where f is the force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting . the units of torque are force multiplied by distance . the si unit of torque is the newton-metre . the most common english unit is the foot-pound . other websites . - `` horsepower and torque '' an article showing how power , torque , and gearing affect a vehicle 's performance . - a discussion of torque and angular momentum in an online textbook
