Music theory     music theory is all about trying to understand how existing music works and how new music could or should be organized . someone who makes a special study of music theory is a music theorist . people who make their own music are composers . people who play or sing music are “ performers ” . it is important for both composers and performers to understand what makes the music sound the way it does . in the times of the ancient greeks the famous philosopher pythagoras tried to explain how instruments are tuned . he understood the science of the good vibrations that the instruments make and explained how and why the octave is divided into twelve parts ( in some cultures ) . in the middle ages there were several famous music theorists who wrote books about music theory . their ideas are interesting for us because they tell us what people thought about music at that time . in the 18th century some composers wrote books on music theory . carl philipp emanuel bach ( son of the famous johann sebastian bach ) wrote a book called : “ an essay on the true art of playing the keyboard ” . leopold mozart ( the father of the famous wolfgang amadeus mozart ) wrote a book called `` the art of playing the violin '' . both these books were extremely well known in their day . in spite of their titles the first halves of these two books are both about a branch of music theory called `` performance practice '' : they tell us a lot about how music was played in those days , how some rhythms were played quite freely and how ornaments in the music were played .
