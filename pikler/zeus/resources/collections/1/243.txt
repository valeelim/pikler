Ecology     ecology is the science which studies the biota , the environment , and their interactions . it comes from the greek `` oikos '' = house ; `` logos '' = study . ecology is the study of ecosystems . ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization . since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity , ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the earth 's atmosphere . scientists who study these interactions are called `` ecologists '' . terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus . there are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology , wetland management , natural resource management ( agriculture , forestry , fisheries ) , city planning ( urban ecology ) , community health , economics , and applied science . it provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction . ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement , wellness movement , environmental movement , and ecology movement we know today . when these are combined with peace movements and the six principles , they are called green movements . in general , these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities , as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony , and better economics .
