Clot     a clot is a semi-solid substance that blood forms , especially when it is in air . when a person bleeds , the blood turns into a clot at the injury . a blood clot is also called a `` thrombus '' . the process is called `` coagulation '' . if a person gets a cut on their body , that person may bleed . to stop the bleeding , the human body does several things . first , the brain orders the liver to produce chemicals that will help the clot to form . when the chemicals released by the liver arrive at the injury , the coagulation begins . in the mean time , the brain also lessens the blood flow near the injury ( by tightening the veins and arteries in that area ) , so that not as much blood is lost . there is a limit to how quickly a clot can form . if the cut is very deep and the person bleeds too much , a clot may not be able to form and a lot of blood may be lost . coagulation begins almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium lining the vessel . when blood is exposed to proteins such as tissue factor it starts changes to blood platelets and the plasma protein fibrinogen , which is a clotting factor . platelets immediately form a plug at the site of injury . proteins in the blood plasma , called `` coagulation factors '' or `` clotting factors '' , respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands . these strengthen the platelet plug .
