Taxonomy     taxonomy is a branch of science . it is about the laws and principles of classifying things . from one type of taxonomy , many classifications might be produced . the best-known kind of taxonomy is used for the classification of lifeforms ( living and extinct ) . each organism has a scientific name . this name is part of the biological classification of that species . the name is the same all over the world , so scientists from different places can understand each other . in addition , a species has a position in the tree of life . thus the crow is `` corvus corone '' , a member of the corvidae family , and they are passerine birds . that is well agreed , but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present , and often several classifications are being discussed . living things are classified into three domains : bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes . the highest rank in a domain is the kingdom . each kingdom has many smaller groups in it , called phyla . each phylum has more smaller groups in it , called classes . this pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them . each species is put into a group because of what it does , how and what it eats , special body parts , and so on . at the end of the pattern , the groups ( genera ) are very small . then each species in the genus is given its own name .
