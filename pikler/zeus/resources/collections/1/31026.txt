Scottish Gaelic language     the scottish language ( g√†idhlig , pronounced `` gah-lick '' ) is often commonly called just gaelic in english . it is a sister language of irish and manx ; all three are goidelic languages and part of the celtic language family . it is also related to the welsh language , cornish language and the breton language ( these three are brittonic or brythonic languages ) . in past times , the language was spoken across all of scotland , except for the northern islands ( orkney and shetland ) . in the later part of the middle ages , the kings of scotland began to speak the english language , and looked down on the scottish language . after the union of england and scotland , the language was snubbed and looked down on even more . the english language took over . scottish gaelic today is basically that of the gaelic spoken in the outer hebrides and on skye . generally speaking , the gaelic spoken across the western isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group , although there is some regional variation .
