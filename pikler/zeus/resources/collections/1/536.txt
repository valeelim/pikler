Nēnē     the nēnē , or hawaiian goose ( `` branta sandvicensis '' ) is a species of goose . it is found today on only three hawaiian islands . it gets its name from its soft call . this is an unmistakable species , with its generally brown plumage ( feathers ) and darker head . its strong toes have much reduced webbing ( skin between the toes ) , an adjustment to the lava flows on which it breeds . the nēnē goes about on land much more than other water birds . when moulting ( dropping old feathers and growing new ones ) , the nēnē can not fly , as do other geese , a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting . the nēnē was once among the most threatened waterfowl species around the world . once common , hunting and predators brought to the islands such as mongooses , pigs and cats reduced the population to only 30 birds in the 1950s . however , this species breeds well in captivity ( zoos and bird parks ) , and has been successfully re-introduced . there are also good numbers in wild bird collections . the nēnē is the state bird of hawaii .
