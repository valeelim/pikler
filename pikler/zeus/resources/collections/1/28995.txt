Giovanni da Palestrina     giovanni da palestrina ( born palestrina , ( c.1525 – february 2 , 1594 in rome ) was a very important italian composer of church music of his time . he lived in the period called the renaissance . most of his music was choral ( written for choirs ) . it is very polyphonic . this means that the different voices ( sopranos , altos , tenors or basses ) are often singing different words and different parts of the tune at the same time . many composers since have studied the way that palestrina wrote , because this is an excellent way to learn to write contrapuntal music . palestrina took his name from the town where he was born . we are not sure of the exact date of his birth . any records of his birth were destroyed when the town burned in 1577. he was probably a choirboy in palestrina . when he was grown up he got a job as organist and choir director at the roman basilica of santa maria maggiore . he was not earning much money , but he married a lady who came from a very rich family , so he was comfortably off . pope julius iii heard about how good this young composer was . he asked him to come and meet him . he was given the job of master of the capella juliana , the choir that sang at the services in st peter ’ s , rome . this was the top job in italy and he was only 26. of course , palestrina composed a mass in the pope ’ s honour .
