Airport     an international airport is a large airport that airplanes can use to fly to and from other countries . a domestic airport is an airport which is usually smaller and only has airplanes coming from places in the same country . most international airports have shops and restaurants for airplane passengers to use . an airport used by the military is often called an air force base or airbase . an aircraft carrier is a floating airbase . airports are made and operated for safety . today , people must walk through a metal detector , a machine that can tell if metal goes through it . if it makes a noise , the officers will make that person take off all things on them that are metal . they also have x-ray machines that can look into luggage . if officers find items such as weapons , or anything that can be used to kill people , that item ( and the person who has it ) are taken away and possibly arrested . as well as this , passengers are not allowed to bring bottles or containers with over 100 ml of liquid onto the plane because they could be turned into bombs . therefore , all water bottles must be emptied before entering the secured area .
