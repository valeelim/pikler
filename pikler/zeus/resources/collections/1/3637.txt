Arctic     the arctic is the area around the earth 's north pole . the arctic includes parts of russia , alaska , canada , greenland , lapland and svalbard as well as the arctic ocean . it is an ocean , but it is always covered with ice . most scientists call the area north of the treeline arctic . trees will not grow when the temperatures get too cold . the forests of the continents stop when they get too far north or too high up a mountain . ( higher places are colder , too . ) the place where in the trees stop is called the tree line . the area north of the treeline is not an empty ice field . in fact , the only large ice-covered land is central greenland , which is covered year-round by a continental glacier . the land of the arctic is around the edges of the arctic circle and is usually covered with tundra . a tundra is a cold , almost treeless plain covered with moss and grasslike plants called `` sedges '' . tundras do not get very much rain or snow . however , they are very wet in the summer time because , three feet ( 1m ) or so below the surface , the ground is always frozen . this permafrost is a layer of ice with the hardness of stone that keeps water from soaking into the earth beneath it . permafrost can be thousands of feet thick . in the summer the ground on top thaws out when the sun shines and the snow that did fall melts . but the melted snow can not drain into the ground ; it just soaks the topsoil . there is no place for the water to go , except to form lakes and puddles on top of the ground until it freezes again or dries up .
