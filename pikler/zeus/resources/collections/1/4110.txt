Organic compound     organic compounds are carbon-based compounds . organic compounds contain carbon bonds in which at least one carbon atom is covalently linked to an atom of another type ( usually hydrogen , oxygen or nitrogen ) . most polymers are organic compounds . the name `` '' is a historical name from the 19th century . people believed that only living things could make organic compounds and `` dead '' things ( such as minerals ) could make inorganic compounds . however , friedrich w√∂hler proved this wrong because certain compounds in urine were thought to be inorganic , but urine came from a living thing . there are natural organic compounds , and synthetic ones . their structure may be described by using names , and making diagrams . one way of showing the molecule is by drawing its structural formula . because molecules can have complicated structures , people have made ways to show them in simple language . one way is to use line diagrams . each atom is shown by a letter , and connected by a line to each atom with which it is has a covalent bond . one line means a single bond , two lines means a double bond and so on .
