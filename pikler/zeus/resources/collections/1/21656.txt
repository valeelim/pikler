Instant messaging     instant messaging ( im ) is a way of chatting between two or more people by typing text . the text is then sent by computers over a network such as the internet . instant messaging must have an instant messaging client that hooks up to a service that can send instant messages . instant messaging is different from e-mail because conversations happen and can be read right away ( `` instantly '' ) . a multiprotocol instant messaging application lets one connect to many im networks . instant messaging services got many ideas from an older and still popular way to online chat named internet relay chat ( irc ) . in early instant messaging programs , each letter appeared when it was typed and when letters were deleted to correct typos . these were also seen by the reader . this made it more like a telephone conversation than sending letters . in newer instant messaging programs , the other readers in the conversation generally only sees each line of text right after a new line is started . most instant messaging programs have a way to set a status message . this works likes the message on a telephone answering machine . it shows whether or not people are online and want to chat .
