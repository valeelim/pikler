Peafowl     a peafowl is a bird of the `` phasianide '' family . it is a relative of the pheasant . there are two species of peafowl : the asiatic peafowl ( `` pavo '' ) or the congo peafowl ( `` afropavo congensis '' ) . the congo peafowl is the only member of the pheasant family that originated outside asia . the male peafowl can have up to 150 brightly colored feathers on its tail coverts . for centuries peafowl have been admired for their beauty and hunted for their meat . recently peacocks have become more popular in parks and gardens . the male peafowls ( called peacocks ) have long , colorful feathers . female peafowls ( called peahens ) have shorter , brown feathers . they like to eat any kind of green shoots ( flowers , veggies , grass etc . ) as well as wheat , cracked corn or wild game feed . they can handle freezing temperatures as long as they have a dry perch that is out of the wind and weather . dry dog and cat chows make excellent winter feed for peafowl , who are omnivores , eating insects , small snakes , lizards , grain , as well as many varieties of greens . they are particularly fond of petunias and similar pot plants , leaving nothing but a small green circle where the stem once emerged from the soil . the birds will learn to come to a specific place at specific times of day to be fed , and a regular light feeding during summer adapts them to coming to the feeding place in winter .
