Manhattan Project     the manhattan project was the program based in the united states which tried to make the first nuclear weapons . the project went on during world war ii , and was run by the u.s. army . the head of the project was general leslie r. groves , who had led the building of the pentagon . the top scientist on the project was robert oppenheimer , a famous physicist . the project cost $ 2 billion , and created many secret cities and bomb-making factories , such as a laboratory in los alamos , new mexico , a nuclear reactor in hanford , washington , and a uranium processing plant in oak ridge , tennessee . the manhattan project had to find solutions to two difficulties . the first difficulty is how to make the special isotopes of uranium or plutonium . this process is called separation and is very slow . the united states built very big buildings with machines for separation . they made enough fissionable special isotopes for a few nuclear weapons . the second difficulty was how to make a bomb that will produce a big nuclear explosion every time . a weapon with a broken design will often make a much smaller nuclear explosion . this is called a `` fizzle '' . in july 1945 , the manhattan project solved the two difficulties and made the first nuclear explosion . this test of a nuclear weapon was called `` trinity '' and was a success .
