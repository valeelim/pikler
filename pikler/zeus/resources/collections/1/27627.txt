Wikispecies     wikispecies is a sister project of wikipedia , and so it is a wiki supported by the wikimedia foundation . it is a free directory of species that wants to make a full catalogue of all living things . it tells of how `` species '' are classified into groups ( taxonomy ) , and how those groups are similar to one another . it calls itself the `` directory of life '' . it is supposed to be written and used by scientists , not by normal people . the people who write wikispecies do not need to show their education but need to show their general understanding in the area . it was started in august 2004 , with biologists around the world invited to help . now , the project has become a good directory listing the linnaean taxonomy with links to wikipedia articles on individual species since april 2005. the links are provided in different languages . the articles in wikispecies are all written in the latin names , so that scientists around the world , no matter what language that use , can use the website . there is information in the article telling people what the article 's living thing is called in every other language that has a common name for it . still , wikispecies is mostly in english ; its main page is in english , and it is run in english .
