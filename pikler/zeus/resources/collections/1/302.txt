GNU Free Documentation License     the gnu free documentation license ( gfdl ) is a copyleft license for open content . it was made up by the free software foundation ( fsf ) for the gnu project . it was initially created for use with software documentation , but can be applied to other types of works as well , such as wikipedia . as a copyright license , the gfdl is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work ( such as a book , an encyclopedia article , a painting , or a piece of music ) and anyone else who might want to use it . the gfdl is considered `` copyleft '' because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work , not to restrict its use . if a copyrightable work is released under the gfdl , the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce , distribute , or modify the work , as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the gfdl . among the requirements of the gfdl are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the gfdlâ€”that is , once something is licensed as gfdl , it will always stay licensed as gfdl , and anything which uses it also is licensed as gfdl . ( because the license `` reproduces '' and stays with the work , this is sometimes called a `` viral '' license . )
