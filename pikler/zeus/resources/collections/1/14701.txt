Industrial Revolution     the industrial revolution is the name historians have given to the period in history when there was a large and rapid change in the way things were made . this meant that instead of things being hand made in small workshops , they were made in large quantities by machines in factories . products being made in large quantity now meant that they were sold for less . many people began to move from an agricultural based life in the country to the towns where the factories offered more and better paid work . the industrial revolution began in great britain in the middle of the 18th century . in particular , the county of shropshire was important , for it had both minerals ( e.g . iron ore and coal ) and transport on the river severn . this led to the group of industries near the ironbridge gorge and the town of coalbrookdale . the revolution spread to europe and the americas , especially the united states , by the early 19th century . samuel slater , who had been an apprentice in an english cotton factory , disguised himself and came to america . he reconstructed a spinning machine from memory and built a factory of his own .
