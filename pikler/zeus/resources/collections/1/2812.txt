Meteor shower     a meteor shower is an event when many meteors seem to come from one point in the night sky . these meteors are caused by meteoroids entering earth 's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel paths . most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand , so almost all of them burn up and never hit the earth 's surface . a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet . comets are dirty snowballs , made up of rock embedded in ice , orbiting the sun . each time a comet swings by the sun in its orbit , some of its ice vaporizes and meteoroids will be shed . the meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream , also known as a `` dust trail '' . most of our short-period meteor showers are the product of rare disintegrations , when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet . examples are the quadrantids and geminids . they originated from a breakup of asteroid-like objects , 2003 eh1 and 3200 phaethon , respectively , about 500 and 1000 years ago . the fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust , sand , and pebbles , and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream , which later moves into earth 's path .
