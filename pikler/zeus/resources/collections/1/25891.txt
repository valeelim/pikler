Mask     a mask is a type of clothing which covers the face . it is similar to a veil , but more close-fitting . there are different reasons why people use masks . a person can use masks so others do not know who they are ( as when a robber steals from a bank ) . or , a mask may keep someones face safe from harm ( like a gas mask so harmful gases do not get into the lungs ) . there are many practical uses for masks in everyday life . mostly , the masks used are `` semi-masks '' which cover only the bottom half of the face , the mouth and nose . an example is the use of masks in operating theatres , and by wood-workers . in surgery , the purpose is to keep bacteria off the patient ; in wood-working the purpose is to keep wood fibres out of the lungs . in venetian masks only the top half of the face is covered , to prevent recognition . ice hockey masks , used in the hannibal lecter movies , cover the whole face to protect it from the hockey puck moving at high speed . the word 'mask ' might have come from other languages . the french `` masque '' , the italian `` maschera '' , the spanish `` m√°scara '' , the latin ( not classical ) `` mascus/masca ( meaning `` ghost '' ) '' or the arabic `` maskharah ( meaning `` jester '' or `` man in masquerade '' ) '' all use the same word .
