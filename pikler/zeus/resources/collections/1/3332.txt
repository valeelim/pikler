Metal     some chemical elements are called metals . they are the majority of elements in the periodic table . these elements usually have the following properties : 1. they can conduct electricity and heat . 1. they can be formed easily . 1. they have a shiny appearance . 1. they have a high melting point . most metals are solid at room temperature , but this does not have to be the case . mercury is liquid . alloys are mixtures , where at least one part of the mixture is a metal . examples of metals are aluminium , copper , iron , tin , gold , lead , silver , titanium , uranium , and zinc . well-known alloys include bronze and steel . the study of metals is called metallurgy . most metals are hard , shiny , they feel heavy and they melt only when they are heated at very high temperatures . lumps of metal will make a bell-like sound when they are hit with something heavy ( they are sonorous ) . heat and electricity can easily pass through a metal ( it is conductive ) . a lump of metal can be beaten into a thin sheet ( it is malleable ) or can be pulled into thin wires ( it is ductile ) . metal is hard to pull apart ( it has a high tensile strength ) or smash ( it has a high compressive strength ) . if you push on a long , thin piece of metal , it will bend , not break ( it is elastic ) . except for cesium , copper , and gold , metals have a neutral , silvery color .
