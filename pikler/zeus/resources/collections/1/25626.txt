Object-oriented programming     object-oriented programming , also called oop , is a model for writing computer programs . before oop , most programs were a list of instructions that acted on memory in the computer . instead of a procedural list of actions , oop is modeled around objects that interact with each other . classes generate objects and define their structure , like a blueprint . the objects interact with each other to carry out the intent of the computer program . many design patterns have been written utilizing oop principles for code reuse . oop has become popular , but many people criticize it . luca cardelli wrote a paper titled 'bad engineering properties of object-oriented languages ' . - richard stallman wrote in 1995 , `` adding oop to emacs is not clearly an improvement ; i used oop when working on the lisp machine window systems , and i disagree with the usual view that it is a superior way to program . '' - a study by potok et al . tells us that there is very little difference in productivity between oop and procedural approaches .
