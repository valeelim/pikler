Aegean Sea     the aegean sea is part of the mediterranean sea . it is between the greece and anatolia . it is connected ( attached ) to the sea of marmara and the black sea by the dardanelles and bosporus . it is not known how the sea got its name . in ancient times two groups of people lived near the sea the minoans of crete , and the myceneans of the peloponnese . the city-states of athens and sparta came later and were part of ancient greece . persians , romans , the byzantine empire , the venetians ( people from venice , the seljuk empire , and the ottoman empire later started around the aegean sea . the people near the aegean were very advanced ( powerful and clever ) in ancient history and they sailed across it to talk to each other . there are seven groups of aegean islands : the thracian sea group , the east aegean group , the northern sporades , the cyclades , the saronic islands ( or argo-saronic islands ) , the dodecanese and crete . the word archipelago used to mean these islands . many of the aegean islands , or chains of islands , are part of the mountain ranges on the mainland . one chain goes across the sea to chios , another one goes across euboea to samos , and a third one goes across the peloponnese and crete to rhodes . this one divides ( splits , cuts ) the aegean from the mediterranean . many of the islands have safe harbours and bays , but sailing in the sea is difficult . many of the islands are volcanos , and marble and iron are mined on other islands . the bigger islands have some green valleys and plains . two big islands on the aegean sea are part of turkey : bozcaada ( ) and gökçeada ( ) .
