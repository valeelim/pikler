ΜCLinux    μclinux µclinux is an operating system for small computers inside integrated circuits ( chips ) . the system is based on the linux operating system in many ways . apart from the rather big size of linux , µclinux is much smaller and not as packed with features as linux . it finds uses in many places , mostly dealing with sensor and data-gathering of different sorts . thanks to its compact nature , it can easily be transferred over slow connections . yet it is a stable and robust system distributed as an open source program .
