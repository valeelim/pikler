Church     a church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together . these people are usually christians , or influenced by christianity . some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches . depending on the number of people that are in a community , the churches come in different sizes . small churches are called chapels . the churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese . each diocese has a cathedral . in most cases , the cathedral is a very big church . cathedrals are the seat of bishops . in the early days of christianity people had to worship in secret . christian worship was not allowed in the roman empire , so christians had to meet in a secret place . sometimes they met in people â€™ s houses or barns , sometimes they met underground . the first places that were built for christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered . after the death of the roman emperor constantine in 337 a.d. christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in . these first churches were built on a similar plan to roman basilicas . this plan was later used for the fine gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the middle ages .
