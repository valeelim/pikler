Clavichord     a clavichord is a musical instrument like a small keyboard . it was very popular for many years , especially in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries . the clavichord is a very quiet instrument . it was not suitable for playing with other instruments because it was so quiet . but it sounds very beautiful in slow , expressive music . it was used as a practice instrument by harpsichord players , or by organists who wanted to practise at home instead of in a ( often very cold ) church . they were so small that they could be lifted up and put on a table . they could be put one on top of another so that an organist could practise music written for a two-manual organ . sometimes they even had pedals for organists to practise this skill . many german composers like johann sebastian bach wrote music for the “ clavier ” . this meant any keyboard instrument : harpsichord , clavichord or organ . the player could choose which they wanted to use . when the piano suddenly became popular – in the 1760s and 1770s – people started to forget about harpsichords and clavichords . today a few people make harpsichords and clavichords again so that people can play renaissance and baroque music - the music from when the clavichord was popular .
