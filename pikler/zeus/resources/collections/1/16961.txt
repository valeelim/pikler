Rottweiler     the rottweiler is a large breed of dog . their coat of fur is mostly black , with brown on the legs and face . they are excellent guard dogs , as well as herding , and companion dogs . dogs are pack animals . when they feel threatened , they will defend themselves . they will also protect other members of the pack to a certain extent . how they defend themselves , and how close they feel to the rest of the pack ( their owners ) depends on the dog 's nature . it also depends on how they were raised . since dogs judge dangerous situations differently , they should not be left unattended near a place where people are arguing . they may also judge `` unattended '' moves of a child as an attack . therefore dogs should not be left alone near children . there is no specific weight for a rottweiler to qualify to be judged in dog shows . the dog must be neither too thin or too fat for its size . both males and females must be `` medium-large '' in size for the american kennel club . the general german rottweiler club ( adrk ) lists 50 kilograms ( 110 pounds ) for males and 42 kilograms ( 93 pounds ) for females .
