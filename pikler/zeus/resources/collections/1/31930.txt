Sewer     sewers are underground pipes that take away dirty water and human waste from homes , offices and many other places . the sewers lead to treatment plants that remove the harmful and unwanted parts , returning clean water to the environment . things like chemicals , bacteria , and ultraviolet light help clean the sewage . many rules and regulations exist for how clean the final discharge ( effluent ) must be . these rules can be at the national , state , and regional level . cleaning crews use special trucks and tools to help keep the sewers clear of grease , tree roots , and other blockages . more rural areas may have septic systems where sewers do not yet exist .
