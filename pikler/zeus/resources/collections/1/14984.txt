Agnosticism     agnosticism is the philosophical view that it is unknown ( or even , unknowable ) whether any deities ( god or gods ) exist or not . some people who call themselves `` agnostic '' say that it is not possible for anyone ever to know if there are any deities or not . other agnostics , though , say only that they themselves currently do not know if there are any deities . thomas henry huxley , the english biologist , coined the word `` agnostic '' in 1869. in 1889 he wrote `` agnosticism ... is not a creed , but a method ... the fundamental axiom of modern science ... in matters of the intellect , do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable '' . there are several different kinds of agnosticism : - `` absolute agnosticism '' ( also called `` hard agnosticism '' , `` closed agnosticism '' , `` strict agnosticism '' , `` strong agnosticism '' ) is the belief that it is not possible to know whether a god/gods exists or not . - `` empirical agnosticism '' ( also called `` soft agnosticism '' , `` open agnosticism '' , `` weak agnosticism '' , `` temporal agnosticism '' ) is the belief that at present there is not enough information to know whether any god/gods exists or not , but that we might find out someday .
