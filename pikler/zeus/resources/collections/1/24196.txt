Microwave     a microwave is a kind of high-frequency radio wave . they are broadly defined as having a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 1 meter , or narrowly as between 3mm and 300mm . microwaves have many uses including communication , radar , radio astronomy , and to heat food in a microwave oven . when something moves , it almost always has a wave pattern to its movement - this can be seen in water most easily , with ripples and ocean waves . a very common type of wave in the universe is electromagnetic waves . light is an example of an electromagnetic wave , and so is a microwave . we can only see electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum ( which is why it 's called the visible light spectrum ) , so microwaves are invisible . microwave ovens work because microwaves make polar molecules ( that is , molecules that act like tiny magnets ) all face the same direction - to visualize it , imagine that the microwave oven is telling all of the molecules to face left . then , the microwave oven reverses the waves , so that all of the molecules have to face the other direction - right , in this case .
