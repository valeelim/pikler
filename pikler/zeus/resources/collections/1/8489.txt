Translator     a translator reads something written in one language and speaks it or writes it in another language . for example , they could read a book in french and then `` translate '' it into english . see translation for more information . in order to convert meanings from one language into another one , translators must be able to know deeply about the target culture , so that they are effective in conveying the original meaning of the source text or material . as a result , translators do not only convert words , what makes it deeper than a science but an art . translation is a complex activity , mainly because to interact and to communicate between languages require more than fluency in the source and the target languages but flexibility between them in an effective way for a specific audience or special readers . it is a sort of occupation and career that is mainly based on research and great skills for languages .
