Chemical reaction     a chemical reaction happens when one or more chemicals are changed into one or more other chemicals . examples : - iron and oxygen combining to make rust - vinegar and baking soda combining to make sodium acetate , carbon dioxide and water - things burning or exploding - many reactions that happen inside living things - electrochemical reactions when discharging or recharging batteries some reactions are fast , and others are slow . some happen at different speeds , depending on temperature or other things . for example , wood does not react with air when it is cold , but if it is made hot enough , it will start to burn . some reactions give out energy . these are exothermic reactions . in other reactions , energy is taken in . these are endothermic reactions . nuclear reactions are `` not '' chemical reactions . chemical reactions involve only the electrons of atoms ; nuclear reactions involve the protons and neutrons in the atomic nuclei . in a synthesis reaction , two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance .
