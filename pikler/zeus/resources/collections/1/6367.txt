Tea     tea is a drink that is popular all over the world . it is made by soaking the dried leaves or flowers of the plant `` camellia sinensis '' in hot water . tea can have other herbs , spices , or fruit flavours in it , like lemon . all teas are made from the camellia sinensis plant . sometimes the word `` tea '' is used for other drinks that have been made by soaking fruit or herbs in hot water , like `` rosehip tea '' or `` camomile tea '' . these are called `` herbal teas '' . there are two main types of tea : black tea and green tea . to make black tea , workers take the leaves and spread them out on shelves where they can dry . next they are rolled and broken into pieces and put into a room where they absorb oxygen . chemical reactions change the taste and style of the tea . finally the leaves are dried with hot air until they turn brown or black . most black tea comes from sri lanka , indonesia and eastern africa . when black tea leaves are brewed in boiling water , the tea made from them looks deep dark red , so another name used for black tea , especially in china , is red tea .
