Orthography     orthography is an official or correct way to write a particular language . it includes rules of spelling . orthography may also include rules about punctuation , capitalization , and diacritics ( e.g . accents ) . in english , spelling is a problem for all learners , and is the main issue in orthography . some languages have someone to decide the correct spelling , such as the académie française . english does not . english orthography was the work of the early printers . they had to decide how particular words would be spelled in their books . gradually the number of alternative spellings began to drop . the word which is `` merry '' today was spelled in about 30 ways in written sources from the 9th to the 16th century . english orthography , or english spelling , is the way the 26 letters of the alphabet are used to write down the 36 ( ipa ) sounds of english . the first manuscripts in old english were written using the latin alphabet . it had 24 letters . no alphabet fits its language exactly . one reason for this is that there are always more sounds than letters . in english there are far more vowel sounds than vowels . the ancient greeks , who were the first to use letters for vowels , decided to use only a few letters for their vowel sounds . this choice influenced all later alphabets :
