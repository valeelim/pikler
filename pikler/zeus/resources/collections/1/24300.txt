Globalization     globalization is the way that local or national ways of doing things become global , that is , done together around the world . it is about economics or trade , technology , politics , and culture . people feel differently about globalization : some think it helps everyone while others think it hurts some people . globalization is a term which may be used broadly to mean doing things as distant people do them , or more narrowly to mean complying to global standards in economy , politics , culture , education , environment or other matters . it describes the way countries and people of the world interact and integrate . many things have become globalized as people come into contact . economic globalization is how countries are coming together as one big global economy , making international trade easier . in the late 20th century , many countries agreed to lower tariffs , or taxes on goods that are imported from other countries . telegraphy and other communication technologies have helped people to buy and sell products from around the world , thus bringing globalization . herman e. daly has said that there is an important difference between internationalization and globalization . internationalization is about nations working together for the same goals . these are things like treaties , alliances , and other international agreements . globalization is about international trade being less blocked by national borders .
