Delusion     a delusion is a false belief held by a person . if doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease , usually a disease of the mind , such as `` paranoia '' , `` schizophrenia '' or `` bipolar disorder '' . delusions also have other properties , according to karl jaspers : - they can not change ( that is they are fixed ) - those holding the belief are absolutely certain of its truth . - the beliefs may be implausible or bizarre . studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time , which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief . delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality ' . some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable , and hence can not be described as false or incorrect , no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not . a doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false , because it `` seems '' to be unlikely or bizarre.psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person â€™ s claims ; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional . this is known as the martha mitchell effect , after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the white house . at the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness . only after the watergate scandal was she proved right , and sane .
