Consciousness     consciousness means being awake , alert and responsive with the environment . the definition of consciousness may differ in psychology , neuroscience , philosophy and other related sciences . consciousness is a spectrum . there are several states between a fully conscious state and a fully unconscious state . in medicine , the degree of `` loss of consciousness '' is measured by using glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) ; a score between 3 and 15 is given to each person at any time , to show how conscious he or she is . higher scores show more conscious states . the opposite of consciousness is subconsciousness/unconscious mind . this means people do things that are instinctive and do not think about them like breathing and making one 's heart beat . it is not known what causes consciousness . so , it is difficult to know if another person or thing is indeed conscious . for example , if a robot seems to react to its environment , how does one know if it has consciousness ( see artificial life ) ?
