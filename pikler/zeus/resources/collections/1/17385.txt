Spectral line     spectral lines are how scientists tell one element from another by looking at color . in order to understand spectral lines , color has to be understood . in a rainbow , the colors of light go from purple to red . several hundred years ago , the famous scientist isaac newton did an experiment where he showed that even white light from the sun was made up of all the colors of the rainbow . when other scientists following him looked at this rainbow very closely , they noticed that there were dark lines breaking up the rainbow , where certain shades of colors should be . these lines were very small , and could only be seen when the rainbow got streched out very far . they investigated this further , and discovered that certain chemical elements , like the hydrogen and helium that make up the sun , absorbed certain frequencies of light where those colors should be , like a sponge absorbs water , but does not absorb chalk . soon , scientists discovered that when they heated up other chemical elements , like calcium and oxygen , so hot that they shined with a white light , they found similar lines , but in different places . no two chemical elements had these lines in exactly the same places along the rainbow , and they also soon discovered that could be used to be able to tell what stars were made up of in the universe .
