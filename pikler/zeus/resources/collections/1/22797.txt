Amplitude     the amplitude or peak amplitude of a wave is a measure of how big its oscillation is . amplitudes are always measured as positive numbers ( for example : 3.5 , 1 , 120 ) and are never negative ( for example : -3.5 , -1 , -120 ) . that 's because distance can only be greater than zero or equal to zero ; negative distance does not exist . the distance from the top of one peak to the bottom of another is called `` peak-to-peak amplitude '' . another way to describe peak-to-peak amplitude is to say that it is the distance between the maximum positive value and the maximum negative value of a wave . related pages . - waves and their properties : - frequency - period - wavelength - amplitude modulation - vibration control - vibration isolation
