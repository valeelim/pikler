Barnacle     a barnacle is a cirripede , a kind of crustacean . it is covered with hard plates of calcium carbonate , and lives stuck to hard surfaces . it does not look like a crustacean , and for many centuries it was thought to be a mollusc . in the 1830s , j.v . thompson found their larvae , and followed their development through to their adult form . they have a nauplius larva , typical of crustaeans . later charles darwin , who spent eight years working on barnacles , found that thompson had been right . barnacles grow on hard surfaces like piers , boats , rocks , and on other animals such as turtles and whales . barnacles are a different group from crabs and shrimps . they are considered a nuisance to the shipping industry and private boat owners . barnacles are suspension feeders , sweeping small food into their mouth with their curved 'feet ' . they are cemented to rock ( usually ) , and covered with hard calcareous plates , which they shut firmly when the tide goes out . the barnacles reproduce sexually , and produce little nauplius larvae which disperse in the plankton . eventually , the larvae change into cypris form , and attach on other hard surfaces to form new barnacles . their comparative anatomy was worked out in detail by charles darwin .
