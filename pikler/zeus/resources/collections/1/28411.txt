Strategy     strategy is a word which was first used by the military . it comes from an ancient greek word for the general officer commanding all the armed forces of a state . a strategy is a long term plan on what to do to achieve a certain goal . when talking about the near future , people often use the word `` tactics '' . military theorist carl von clausewitz said `` tactics is the art of using troops in battle ; strategy is the art of using battles to win the war '' . today , the word `` strategy '' is in common use ; people might talk about `` business strategy '' , for example . the distinction between strategy and tactics applies to any planning which might be done against an enemy or opponent . strategy is what we broadly intend to do to reach our long-term goal or objective . tactics is the detailed steps which are used as our progress is opposed by the opponent . for this reason , tactics are short-scale and flexible . strategy , on the other hand , is changed as little as possible . it may be that our goal simply can not be reached . in that case , a search goes on for a new goal and a new or adjusted strategy . often , in war , chess or business , roughly the same tactics are still used to get to a different goal . negotiation is another area where the distinction between strategy and tactics is especially clear .
