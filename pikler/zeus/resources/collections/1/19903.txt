Spider     spiders ( order araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods . they have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom . most make silk . they are a large order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all groups of organisms . about 40,000 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists . over twenty different classifications have been proposed since 1900. almost all spiders are predators , and most eat insects . they catch their prey in several ways . some build a spider web , and some use a thread of silk that they throw at the insect . some kinds of spiders hide in holes in the ground , then run out and grab an insect that walks by . others will make web 'nets ' to throw at passing insects . or they go out and simply attack their prey . some can jump quite well and hunt by sneaking close to an insect and then jumping on it . spiders have a two-part body , the front part ( cephalothorax ) and the abdomen . unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . the more advanced spiders have a centralized nervous system , with their ganglia fused into one mass in the cephalothorax . unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs , and extend them by hydraulic pressure .
