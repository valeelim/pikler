Akrisios     akrisios ( or acrisius ) is a person in greek mythology . he was the king of argos . he is the father of danaë , and grandfather of perseus . akrisios was told by an oracle that he would be killed by his grandchild . because of that he put his daughter danaë in a tower where noone was allowed to enter , so she could not have a child . but the god zeus could enter in the form of a golden rain , and with him her child was perseus . akrisios then put danaë and her baby perseus in a box and threw it into the sea . but zeus tells the sea-god poseidon to help them , and so danaë and her son come to the island seriphos . there they are found by , who lets them live with him . a long time after that , the grown up perseus takes part in some funeral games . during the games perseus throws a discus , which accidentally hits akrisios . akrisios is killed by it : he was killed by his grandchild , like the oracle 's prophecy said .
