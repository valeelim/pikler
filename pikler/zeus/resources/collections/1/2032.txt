Oceania     oceania is a name used in geography for the region made up of australia , new zealand , new guinea , and several other island nations in the surrounding area . some people call this part of the world australasia instead . the term `` oceania '' does not have one single agreed definition . in politics ( united nations etc ) it includes australia and the nations of the pacific from papua new guinea east , but not the malay archipelago or indonesian new guinea . the widest definition of oceania includes the entire region between continental asia and the americas , including islands in the pacific rim such as the japanese archipelago , taiwan , and the aleutian islands . on the other hand , the oceania ecozone includes all of micronesia , fiji , and all of polynesia except new zealand . sometimes , people use the term 'oceania ' to include only the polynesian and melanesian islands in the pacific ocean , as separate from australasia . for these reasons , it is `` not '' correct to say that australasia is part of oceania , because what is meant by 'oceania ' is not clear . australasia has an exact definition in biogeography and geology . australasia includes new zealand , australia ( including tasmania ) , and melanesia , new guinea , and the islands just north and east of australia . all these are south-east of the baliâ€“lombok line . this is known as the wallace line , after alfred russel wallace .
