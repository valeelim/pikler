Beer     beer is an alcoholic drink . it is made with water , hops , barley ( types of cereal grains ) , and types of yeast ( a fungus that produces alcohol ) . a process called fermentation turns sugar into alcohol , using yeast . another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide . in general , all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called `` beer '' . in these cases , distillation is not used . the difference to wine is that with wine , sugars from plants , such as fruit sugar , or that made by animals is used . as an example , mead is a wine made from honey . japanese sake is made from rice , and uses yeast for fermentation ; so even if some people call it `` rice wine '' , sake is really a kind of beer . the act of making beer is called `` brewing '' . beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains . the enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars . this is called the mash . the water is then sparged ( drained ) from the grain . the water is now called wort . the wort is boiled and hops are added . hops provide flavour and preserve the beer . after boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added . the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer .
