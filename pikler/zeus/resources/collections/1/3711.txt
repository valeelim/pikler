Freedom of speech     1. freedom of speech is the right to state one 's opinions and ideas without being stopped or punished . sometimes this is also called freedom of expression . freedom of speech is thought to also include freedom of information . however , new laws are usually needed to allow information to be used easily . most people think freedom of speech is necessary for a democratic government . in countries without free speech , people might be afraid to say what they think . then , the government does not know what the people want . if the government does not know what they want , it can not respond to their wants . without free speech , the government does not have to worry as much about doing what the people want . some people say this is why some governments do not allow free speech : they do not want to be criticised , or they fear there would be revolution if everyone knew everything that was happening in the country . a well-known liberal thinker , john stuart mill , believed that freedom of speech is important because the society that people live in has a right to hear people 's ideas . it 's not just important because everyone should have a right to express him or herself .
