Angel food cake     angel food cake is an example of cake that became popular in the united states in the 19th century . it is also called angel cake . it is very light and fluffy . because of this , it is named angel cake because it is said to be `` food for the angels . '' angel food cake needs the egg whites to be whipped until they are stiff , and carefully folded into the other ingredients . for this method of `` leavening '' to work well , it is helpful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat . this causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste . angel food cake should be cut with a serrated knife , as a solid blade tends to compress the cake rather than cut it . some cooks like alton brown add aromatic spices to angel food cake .
