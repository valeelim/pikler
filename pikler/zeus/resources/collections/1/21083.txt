Jealousy     jealousy or envy is a feeling ( or emotion ) people get when they want what others have . this is a negative feeling . when someone is jealous of someone else , he or she usually dislikes the other person . these particular emotions are usually caused by a person having a certain object or quality which you desire but can not obtain . under rational observation jealousy is not reasonable . feeling jealous of something that someone else has is n't helping you get what you want , instead of feeling jealous , one should simply try and obtain the things that one wants instead of acting in a jealous manner . for example : being jealous of someone 's car . instead of being rude about said car or bad mouthing person driving said car , work hard to earn money to acquire a similar car , then the jealous feelings should disappear .
