Hikaru Utada     hikaru utada ( 宇多田ヒカル `` utada hikaru '' , born january 19 , 1983 in new york city ) , is a japanese and american singer and songwriter . because she was born in the united states , she can speak english perfectly . she is the only child of the 1970s enka singer keiko fuji . her first japanese album , `` first love '' , was very popular . it sold more copies than any other japanese singer ever . she is also known in the west for singing the theme songs for `` kingdom hearts '' and `` kingdom hearts ii '' : `` simple and clean '' and `` sanctuary '' . when hikaru was little , she did not want to become a singer . she saw how busy her parents ' lives were , and did not want that for herself . when she was 10 years-old , her parents asked her if she wanted to write songs . she did not want to , but tried doing it . she wrote a song called `` i 'll be stronger '' . during this time , hikaru went to school in new york . her classmates were not able to say her name right ( hee-ka-roo ) so they shortened it to 'hikki ' . 'hikki ' became hikaru 's nickname . her fans in japan call her that . the name is not promoted very much in the united states because it sounds too much like 'hickey ' .
