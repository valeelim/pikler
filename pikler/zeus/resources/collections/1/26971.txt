Niccolò Paganini     niccolò paganini ( 27 october 1782 - 27 may 1840 ) was a italian composer and violin player . he is believed to be one of the best violinists who ever lived . he was born in genoa , italy and died in nice , france . paganini was the perfect virtuoso during his time although many other violinists slowly approach and some appear to be as virtuosic as him too . he was said to be a show off during his time and many wanted to challenge his violin skills . paganini once broke all of the strings on his violin except the g-string and played a piece just on one string to show how good he was . he was the master of violin technique and invented many new techniques such as ricochet bowing , flying staccatos , left hand pizzicato , etc . his 24 caprices are his most famous compositions . paganini was good friends with franz liszt who was also an equally magnificent virtuoso , only that he played the piano . they both came together and composed the etude `` la campanella '' , also known as `` the clock '' in english .
