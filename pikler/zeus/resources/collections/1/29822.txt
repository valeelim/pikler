Durga     durga is one of the goddesses in hinduism and is a form of devi , the supreme goddess . in bengal , she is said to be the mother of ganesha and kartikeya as well of saraswati and lakshmi . she is considered a divine mother , a guardian , and a warrior who protects divine law and righteousness , and these are her main roles . durga is most often seen as a warrior woman riding a lion or a tiger with eight or ten hands carrying weapons and assuming mudras , or symbolic hand gestures . this way , the goddess is the embodiment of feminine and creative energy ( shakti ) . according to the narrative from the devi mahatmya of the markandeya purana , durga was made by the gods as a warrior goddess to fight a demon . the demon 's father , rambha , king of the demons , once fell in love with a water buffalo , and mahishasur was born from this union . he is therefore able to change between human and buffalo form at will ( mahisha means `` buffalo '' ) . through intense prayers to brahma , mahishasura was given the boon that he could not be defeated by any man or god . he unleashed a reign of terror on earth , heaven and the nether worlds . the gods , realizing that only a woman or goddess could defeat the buffalo demon , gave forth all of their creative energy and created durga . durga , holding many weapons , went to battle with mahishasur and won , saving the gods and men from destruction .
