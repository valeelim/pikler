Alchemy     alchemy is the very old study and philosophy of how to change basic substances ( such as metals ) into other substances . it also studied how substances ( and how they are changed into other substances ) were related to magic and astrology . people who studied alchemy were called `` alchemists '' . some things alchemists tried to do were change lead or [ mercury ( element ) |mercury ] ] into gold , make the philosopher 's stone , and make the `` elixir of life , '' which they thought could cure ( make better ) any disease and make someone young again . alchemists believed that substances , mind , philosophies , religion , magic and astrology were related to each other . they tried to find connections between them . they tried to understand one by understanding the other . some alchemists used metals ( like gold or silver ) to represent spiritual or occult ideas . people in many different countries studied alchemy . in the 1600s and 1700s , people started to study only the properties of substances without trying to relate them to secret , old knowledge . they did experiments and wrote down what they discovered so other people could learn from them . one of the important people who did these experiments was robert boyle . people called the new study of substances chemistry .
