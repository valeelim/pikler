NAND gate     the nand gate is a logic gate used to build digital logic circuits . given two inputs , a and b , a nand b will be true if at most one of a and b is true . in other words , a nand b is false if both a and b are true , and true otherwise . the nand gate is a `` universal gate . '' there are three symbols for nand gates : the 'military ' symbol and the 'rectangular ' symbol . for more information see logic gate symbols .
