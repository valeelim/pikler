Pancreas     the pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and enzymes to help digestion . the pancreas helps break down carbohydrates , fats , and proteins . the pancreas is behind the stomach and is on the left side of the human body . the part of the pancreas that makes hormones is called the islets of langerhans . the islets of langerhans are a small part ( 2 % ) of the total cells in the pancreas . the islets of langerhans change which chemical they make depending on how much of other chemicals are already in the blood . so , the pancreas works to keep the level of chemicals in balance in the body . if the islets of langerhans stop working , a person will suffer from a disease called diabetes . doctors are experimenting with taking the islets of langerhans cells from a donor body and putting them into the pancreas of a person with diabetes to make that person well . the pancreas belongs to two systems of the body : the digestive system for its role in breaking down nutrients , and the endocrine system for producing hormones .
