Electrical cell     an electrical cell is a device that is used to generate electricity , or one that is used to make chemical reactions possible by applying electricity . a battery is one kind . the simple electrical cells were first developed in 1800s . they are also called `` galvanic cells '' , because an italian scientist named luigi galvani invented these cells . special chemical reactions which occur inside the electrical cell , result in oxidation and reduction of the substances inside the cell . this produces electrical energy . normal batteries work like this . some electrical cells produce electricity without using chemical energy . for example , solar cells produce electricity when they are exposed to sun light . these cells are commonly related with chemical reactions . for example , a plate of zinc and a plate of copper are immersed in a dilute solution which contains acid or salt . the solution acts as an electrolyte ( electric conductor ) . when the two plates are connected to a meter with a wire , electric current will pass ; this is because oxidation and reduction processes take place in this chemical reaction turning the zinc plate to a negative electrode and the copper plate to a positive electrode , and so the electrons flows from zinc to copper which makes the meter move .
