Dozen     a dozen is a unit of measurement . it means twelve ( 12 ) items of something . the term goes back to `` duodecim '' , which means 12 in latin . humans might have started to count on a base 12 because there are approximately 12 cycles of the moon in one cycle of the sun . in other words , a solar year has 12 months . the first to have used the unit were probably the mesopotamians . 12 dozen ( 144 items ) are a gross . 12 gross ( 1728 items ) are called a `` great gross '' . a great hundred is 120 or ten dozen ( a dozen for each finger on both hands ) . the dozen is convenient because its multipliers and multiples are convenient : 12 = 3 × 2 × 2 , and 360 = 30 × 12. the french word `` douzaine '' means `` about twelve '' and is part of a family of words with similar meanings , e.g . `` vingtaine '' – `` about 20 '' `` centaine '' – `` about 100 '' etc . a baker 's dozen , also known as a long dozen , is thirteen .
