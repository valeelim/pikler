Canberra     canberra is the capital city of australia . there are 340 800 people who live there . it doesn ’ t belong to a state but it is in the australian capital territory ( act ) . canberra was started in 1913 and in the middle of the city is lake burley-griffin . this lake was created especially for the city . there was a competition to design the new capital city of australia . the competition was won by an architect from chicago in the united states of america . his name was walter burley griffin . griffin designed his triangular town as a garden town , so its size expanded over a big area . but as canberra grew larger and larger , the lake was no longer in the middle of the town , but the people who are in charge of planning the city make sure canberra is as close to griffin 's original plan as possible . canberra has a size in area nearly as big as berlin , but the number of people who live there is much smaller . before canberra was founded , australia ’ s two most important cities , sydney and melbourne , were arguing which city should be the capital of the continent . first melbourne was elected the capital , but in 1908 there was a vote . the result : an area of 2400 square kilometers was given to the country by new south wales to build canberra in . this was the place , 300 kilometers away from sydney and with a distance of 650 kilometers to melbourne , where a few years later canberra was built .
