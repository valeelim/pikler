Algebra     algebra is a part of mathematics ( often called math in the united states and maths in the united kingdom ) . it uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known . when an equals sign ( = ) is used , this is called an equation . a very simple equation using a variable is : 2 + 3 = x in this example , x = 5 , or it could also be said , `` x equals five '' . this is called `` solving for x '' . besides equations , there are inequalities ( `` less than '' and `` greater than '' ) . a special type of equation is called the function . this is often used in making graphs . algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things . physics , engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time . it is also useful to know in surveying , construction and business , especially accounting . people who do algebra need to know the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers , starting with adding , subtracting , multiplying , and dividing . more advanced operations involve exponents , starting with squares and square roots . interestingly , many of these rules can also be used on the variables .
