Anne Boleyn     anne boleyn ( 1501 or 1507 – 19 may 1536 ) was the second wife of king henry viii of england and queen consort from 1533 until 1536. she was the mother of elizabeth i of england . anne has been called `` the most influential and important queen consort england has ever had . '' it was because of anne boleyn that henry viii divorced catherine of aragon , and became independent from the roman catholic church . after she was accused of adultery , incest and high treason , she was executed . people 's opinions of anne 's beauty was different . the venetian diarist marino sanuto described anne as `` not one of the handsomest women in the world ; she is of middling , complexion , long neck , wide mouth , bosom not much raised ... eyes , which are black and beautiful '' . simon grynée wrote to martin bucer in september 1531 that anne was `` young , good-looking , of a rather dark complexion '' . lancelot de carles called her `` beautiful '' with a good figure . a venetian in paris in 1528 also said that she was beautiful . the most well-known description of anne was written by the catholic nicholas sanders in 1586. he wrote it several years after anne died . even though this is the most famous , it is also probably the least correct description . `` anne boleyn , '' he said , `` was rather tall ... with black hair , and an oval face of a sallow complexion , as if troubled with jaundice . she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip , and on her right hand six fingers [ which historians now say is not true ] . there was a large wen under her chin , and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat ... she was handsome to look at , with a pretty mouth . '' sanders said that it was because of anne that henry went away from the catholic church . sanders ' words about anne made what eric ives called the `` monster legend '' of anne boleyn . anne was also a good dancer . william forrest , who wrote a modern poem about catherine of aragon , praised anne 's dancing . he said she had `` passing excellent '' skill as a dancer . `` here '' , he wrote , `` was [ a ] fresh young damsel , that could trip and go .
