Newt     newts are small amphibians , a kind of salamander . they are found in north america , europe , and north asia . their mother lays eggs and leaves them . tadpoles are born from those eggs . newts have three life stages . first as a tiny aquatic larva , which gradually undergoes metamorphosis . then they leave the water for a year as a juvenile called an `` eft '' . they go back in the water to breed as adults . in some species the adults stay in water for the rest of their lives . others are land-based , but return to water each year to breed . many newts produce toxins in their skin secretions as a defence against predators . they have bright skin colours as a warning to other animals . `` taricha '' newts of western north america are particularly toxic ; the rough-skinned newt `` taricha granulosa '' of the pacific northwest produces more than enough tetrodotoxin to kill an adult human . recently , a 29-year-old man in coos bay , oregon , who had been drinking heavily , swallowed a rough-skin newt for a dare ; he died later that day despite hospital treatment .
