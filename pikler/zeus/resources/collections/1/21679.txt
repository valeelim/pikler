Triceratops     triceratops was a huge herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur from the late cretaceous . its name came from having three horns on its head . they were mainly found in north america . as adults , they grew up to 30 feet long , 9 feet tall , and probably weighed around 5,400 kg ( 12,000 lb ) . `` triceratops '' was a low browser with a bony beak in front of its jaws . the jaws had close-set grinding teeth . its defence had to stand up to attacks from taller theropods , hence the shield which covered its neck . holes made by teeth have been found on the bony frill behind the horns , and on the sacrum ( the part of the spine above the pelvis ) . many fossils of `` triceratops '' have been collected since the genus was first described in 1889. there is at least one complete individual skeleton . paleontologist john scannella observed : `` it is hard to walk out into the hell creek formation and not stumble upon a `` triceratops '' weathering out of a hillside '' . forty-seven complete or partial skulls were discovered in just that area during the decade 2000â€“2010 . specimens showing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found .
