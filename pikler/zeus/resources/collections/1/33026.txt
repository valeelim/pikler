Stone fruit     a stone fruit , also called a drupe , is a fruit with a large `` stone '' inside . the stone is sometimes called the seed , but that is a mistake , as the seed is inside the stone . the stones can also be called a pit . examples of stone fruits are peaches , nectarines , plums , lychees , mangoes , and cherries . these fruits are edible and used frequently in cooking . not all drupes have single large stones . raspberries are a good example . to see their stones , the fruit has to be carefully broken open . then the tiny stones can be seen inside . they are called stones because the seeds keep their covering ( called an `` endocarp '' ) , not because they are large and hard . the many small round parts that make up a raspberry each have a similar structure with a very small pit inside . the small parts are called `` drupelets '' , meaning little drupes .
