Eating     eating is taking in food to get energy , nutrients or for enjoyment . people and animals need to eat because they can not make their own food inside their bodies like plants . all plants ' energy comes from the sun . plants take the sun 's energy , and they are eaten by other animals as food . the animals then eat each other for the energy . however , many people can not stop themselves from eating , and they end up becoming fat or obese . you can become fat by eating the wrong , unhealthy types of food and by eating too much . when a plant collects energy from the sun through its leaves , it is called photosynthesis . if a plant gets too much food , it can just store it until later . they use this storred food during the winter . when you are proven to be fat or obese through your body mass index ( bmi ) , it means you are heavier than the average for your height . the taller you are , the heavier you should be , in theory . if someone is too heavy to be called fat , then they are called obese . when someone eats too much of one thing , they become fat . someone can eat junk food , but they can also balance themselves by also eating fruits and vegetables .
