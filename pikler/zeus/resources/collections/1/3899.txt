Amylase     amylase is an enzyme which breaks down starch into sugars which the body can use . more accurately , it is a family of similar enzymes which work in a wide range of animals , plants and fungi . there are two variants in humans : alpha-amylase , and gamma-amylase . alpha-amylase is a major digestive enzyme . its optimum ph is 6.7â€“7.0 . it is found in saliva and pancreatic juice . it takes starch chains and breaks them into smaller pieces with two or three glucose units . it can break down starch into maltose . it works in the mouth and stomach during digestion . the gamma-amylase has most acidic optimum ph of all amylases because it is most active around ph 3. therefore , it works best in the stomach , which does have an acidic ph . apparently , early humans did not possess salivary amylase . the closest evolutionary relatives of humans , chimpanzees and bonobos , have either one or no copies of the gene for producing salivary amylase . a duplication event of the amy1 gene led to the production of amylase in the saliva . the same event occurred independently in rodents . this shows the importance of salivary amylase in organisms that eat relatively large amounts of starch .
