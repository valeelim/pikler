Mahjong     mahjong is a game for four players that was created in china . it is a game of skill , intelligence , calculation and luck . a mahjong game is played at a square table ( four sides all the same length ) . the dealer is called the `` east '' player and everyone else is called a different direction because of where they are sitting - so the person to east 's left is south , the person across from east is west , and the person to east 's right is north . if east wins , he is the dealer again for the next round ; if he does not , the dealer is the person to his right ( north ) . that person then becomes east . a game of mahjong ends when every player has been the dealer four times , or when they have played the number of rounds they said they would play before they started . a single-player version of this game exists , called mahjong solitaire . it is based on the four-player game , but can be played by one person , so it is one of the games that are played often on computers ( such as solitaire , spider solitaire , or minesweeper ) . mahjong solitaire is much simpler than four-player mahjong : it is played without dice or chips , by removing tiles ( set up in the shape of a pyramid ) from the board in sets of two . each set of two has to match - they are either exactly the same , or go together ( two `` flowers '' tiles , for example ) . a mahjong solitaire player wins when he picks up all the tiles , or he loses when he runs out of sets of two that he can pick up .
