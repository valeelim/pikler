Stonehenge     stonehenge is a prehistoric world heritage site north of salisbury in wiltshire , england . it is made of a henge , with standing stones in circles . there were three main building phases , each between about 3100 bc and 1950 bc . the first circle , ~3000 bc , was made of timber . the post holes for the timber have been found . around 2600 bc , the builders gave up timber in favour of stone . most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 bc . the first stone circle was a set of 'bluestones ' . the holes held up to 80 standing stones ( shown blue on the plan ) , only 43 of which can be traced today . the bluestones ( made of dolerite , an igneous rock ) , were thought for much of the 20th century to have been brought from the preseli hills , away in modern-day pembrokeshire , wales . another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by the irish sea glacier . later , ~2400 bc , 30 huge grey sarsen stones were brought to the site . they were erected in a circle 33 metres in diameter , with lintels on top of the standing stones . the remaining blue circles were placed as an inner circle . the site was in use until the bronze age . the modern stonehenge consists entirely of original stones , some of which have been replaced in upright position .
