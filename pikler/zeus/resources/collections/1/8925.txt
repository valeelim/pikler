Tobacco     tobacco is a plant of the nightshade family , found mainly in north america and south america . dried tobacco leaves are often smoked in cigars , cigarettes and pipes , but can also be chewed in the mouth or sniffed in the nose . tobacco contains a very powerful addictive chemical called nicotine which makes it very hard for tobacco users to stop using it . native americans used tobacco before europeans arrived in america . these europeans learned to smoke and brought it back to europe , where it became very popular . at that time tobacco was usually smoked in a pipe . the europeans who moved to america started to farm tobacco so that they could sell it in europe . this became one of the main causes of the african slave trade . in 1610 a european man called john rolfe arrived in the american state of virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich . rolfe was the first farmer to use `` nicotiana tabacum '' , which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today . he also married pocahontas , a native american woman who became famous when she went to live in london .
