Tycho Brahe     tycho brahe ( born tyge ottesen brahe , 14 december 1546 â€“ 24 october 1601 ) was an astronomer from denmark . he observed the night sky before the invention of the telescope . he built a large observatory called uraniborg on the island of hven in denmark . he discovered that the universe outside the solar system could change when he studied a supernova and a comet . johannes kepler was his assistant . tycho made very careful observations of the planets . when tycho died in 1601 , kepler continued tycho 's work . tycho was not a modern scientist . he believed in astrology , and his astronomy was a strange mixture of scientific observation and religious belief . although he rejected the ptolemaic system , he also rejected the copernican system . he developed a geocentric theory that imagined the sun and moon orbited the earth , but the other planets orbited the sun . to his benefit , he did not believe in the unchanging celestial realm or spheres . the supernova proved that changes did take place . also , he worked out that comets were real celestial objects , and that their orbits were different to those of the planets .
