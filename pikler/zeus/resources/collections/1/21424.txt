Atomic mass     an atomic mass ( symbol : `` m '' ) is the mass of a single atom of a chemical element . it includes the masses of the 3 subatomic particles that make up an atom : protons , neutrons and electrons . atomic mass can be expressed in grams . however , because individual atoms have very small masses , this is not very helpful . instead , atomic mass is expressed in unified atomic mass units ( unit symbol : u ) . 1 atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom . 1 u has a value of 1.660538921 ( 73 ) Ã— 10 kg . a carbon-12 atom has a mass of 12 u. because electrons are so light , we can say that the mass of a carbon-12 atom is made of 6 protons and 6 neutrons . because the masses of protons and neutrons are almost exactly the same , we can say that both protons and neutrons have a mass of roughly 1 u. hence , we can get a rough value of an atom 's mass in atomic mass units by working out the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus , which is called the mass number . the atomic mass of an atom is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number .
