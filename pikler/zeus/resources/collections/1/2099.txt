Ion     an ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms . it is a part of an atom , or part of a group of atoms ( molecule ) . it is `` charged '' so it will move near electricity . this is because atoms are made of three smaller parts : neutrons ( with no charge ) , and equal numbers of ( 2 ) charged protons and ( 3 ) oppositely-charged electrons . an ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons . making an ion from an atom or molecule is called `` ionization '' . the charge on a proton is measured as +1 ( positively charged ) . the charge on an electron is measured as -1 ( negatively charged ) . an atom that is ionized makes two ions , one positive , and one negatively charged . for example , a neutral hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron . heating the atom breaks it into two parts : ( 1 ) a positively charged hydrogen ion , h+ ( 2 ) a negatively charged electron . a liquid with ions is called an electrolyte . a gas with lots of ions is called a plasma . when ions move , it is called electricity . for example , in a wire , the metal ions do not move , but the electrons move as electricity . a positive ion and a negative ion will move together . two ions of the same charge will move apart . when ions move they also make `` magnetic fields '' .
