Plankton     plankton are drifting organisms that live in the surface layers of the ocean . they live in the top layer of the ocean , called the epipelagic zone . they are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents . the term is in contrast to nekton , who can control their movements . there are three groups : - phytoplankton : which live at the surface of the ocean and photosynthesise ( use light to make sugars and other molecules ) . - eukaryote algae : diatoms , coccolithophores , some dinoflagellates . - bacteria : cyanobacteria . - zooplankton : small protozoans or metazoans : ctenophores ; jellyfish ; rotifers ; foraminifera ; tiny crustacea and other animals . some eggs and larvae of larger animals such as fish , crustaceans , and annelids . apart from the eggs , they all feed on other plankton . - some groups fall into both categories . dinoflagellates can be either photosynthetic producers or heterotroph consumers ; many species are `` mixotrophic '' depending upon their circumstances . it is also hard to fit viruses into this scheme ; yet they are present in great numbers .
