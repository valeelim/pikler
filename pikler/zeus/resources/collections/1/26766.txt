Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol     the dynamic host configuration protocol , is a protocol related to computers and networks of computers . it is referred to as dhcp for short . it was made so that computers could connect to other computers ( on a network ) automatically . to be able to access the internet ( or any computer network ) , an ip address is needed . dhcp allows for this ip address to be obtained automatically . other data , like a dns nameserver , or a time server can also be obtained that way . finally , computers that support it can even get a disk image they boot from over the network . the address can be dynamic ( it can change ) , or it can be static ( it stays the same ) . after a certain time , the address lease has to be renewed . dhcp is one of the most complicated ip protocols in networks of computers .
