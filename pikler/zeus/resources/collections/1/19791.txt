Bismuth     bismuth is a chemical element . it is element 83 on the periodic table and its symbol is `` bi '' . its atomic mass is 209. it is only a very little radioactive . the radioactivity is so little that it is seen as nonradioactive normally . bismuth is only found as one isotope naturally , which is the almost nonradioactive one . its radioactivity was predicted by scientists and proven by analyzing the metal . it is in group 15 on the periodic table . bismuth is a silver metal with a pink tinge to it . this pink color is because of its oxide coating . bismuth is a post-transition metal . it is one of the strongest diamagnetic metals . it is almost as heavy as lead . its melting point is quite low , which is normal for post-transition metals . it is quite brittle . it can make crystals with a shiny surface . this is because of the oxide coating too . as a liquid it is heavier than as a solid . another chemical that does this is water . it does not conduct electricity or heat very well . bismuth is somewhat similar to antimony . bismuth makes a thin coating of bismuth ( iii ) oxide when it is in air . this makes the colors on the crystals . it does not oxidize any more than the oxide layer . it burns when powdered with a bright blue flame , making yellow bismuth ( iii ) oxide fumes . bismuth reacts with sulfur when molten as well . bismuth reacts with nitric acid to make bismuth ( iii ) nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid to make bismuth ( iii ) sulfate and sulfur dioxide . it reacts with the halogens to make bismuth ( iii ) halides . with fluorine it makes bismuth ( v ) fluoride unless the fluorine is diluted , though .
