Accompaniment     an accompaniment in music is music that accompanies ( goes with ) something else . a piece of music may have a melody ( tune ) and an accompaniment underneath . the music may be played on the piano with the right hand playing the tune and the left hand playing the accompaniment . the accompaniment might also be played on a different instrument . music does not have to be a tune with accompaniment , although it often is . the accompaniment does not always have to be lower than the tune . to play the piano , the pianist has to learn to play a tune in the right hand and accompaniment in the left hand , or the tune might be passed from one hand to the other . the tune should usually be played a little louder than the accompaniment . the accompaniment must not ‘ drown ’ the tune . an accompaniment might be single notes , or chords , or any other pattern . the accompaniments help us to feel the harmony . an accompaniment might be another tune ( this is called counterpoint ) . tunes can be played or sung without accompaniment . folk songs are traditionally sung unaccompanied .
