Armenian Genocide     the armenian genocide was the forcible deportation and massacring of armenians during the government of the young turks from 1915 to 1917 in the ottomane empire . in november 1914 , the ottomane empire went into the world war i on the side of the central powers . ismail enver , who was then the minister of war , launched a disastrous military campaign against russian forces in the caucasus in hopes of capturing the city of baku . his forces were routed at the battle of sarikamis , and many more of his men froze to death . returning to istanbul , enver largely blamed the armenians living in the region for actively siding with the russians . in spite of these obstacles , the armenians thrived under ottoman rule . the armenians tended to be better educated and wealthier than their turkish neighbors , who in turn tended to resent their success . this resentment was compounded by suspicions that the christian armenians would be more loyal to christian governments ( that of the russians , who shared an unstable border with turkey ) than they were to the ottoman caliphate .
