Volcano     a volcano is a mountain with a hole where lava ( hot , liquid rock ) comes from a magma chamber under the ground . most volcanoes have a volcanic crater at the top . when a volcano is active , materials come out of it . the materials include lava , steam , gaseous sulfur compounds , ash and broken rock pieces . when there is enough pressure , the volcano erupts . some volcanic eruptions blow off the top of the volcano . the magma comes out , sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly . some eruptions come out at a side instead of the top . volcanoes are found on planets other than earth . an example is olympus mons on mars . volcanologists are scientists who study volcanoes using methods from geology , chemistry , geography , mineralogy , physics and sociology . the lava and pyroclastic material ( clouds of ash , lava fragments and vapor ) that comes out from volcanoes can make many different kinds of land shapes . there are two basic kinds of volcanoes . these volcanoes are formed by fluid low-silica mafic lava .
