Conducting     conducting in the musical sense means : beating time to help a group of musicians to play well together . if a large orchestra is playing music , it is important that they all play exactly together . they need to know exactly when to start , what speed to go , how loud or quietly to play and what the mood of the music should be . if two , three or four people play music together they can talk about this amongst themselves and one person can nod with his/her head or with a violin bow or flute to help the group to start and finish together . with an orchestra there are so many people that they need a conductor . in the 17th century orchestras were very small so they did not need a conductor . but as orchestras grew in size it became more and more necessary to have someone in front to lead . the french composer lully ( 1632-1687 ) used to beat time by banging a big stick ( like a walking stick ) on the floor to the time of the music . one day he banged his stick very hard and it went through his foot and he became ill and died .
