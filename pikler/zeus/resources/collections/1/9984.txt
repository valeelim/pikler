Noon     noon is the time exactly halfway through the day , written 12.00 or 12:00 in the 24-hour clock and 12:00 pm in the 12-hour clock . midday also means noon , although this also means `` around '' noon , or very early afternoon . solar noon is when the sun appears the highest in the sky , compared to its positions during the rest of the day . it occurs when the sun is exactly halfway between sunrise ( dawn ) and sunset . this is also the origin of the terms a.m. and p.m. , `` ante meridiem '' and `` post meridiem '' . at solar noon , the sun is due south seen from the northern hemisphere , and due north seen from the southern hemisphere . the sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the equator on the equinoxes ; at tropic of cancer ( latitude 23½°n ) on the summer solstice in june ; and at tropic of capricorn ( 23½°s ) on the winter solstice in december . because of the use of time zones and daylight saving time , the highest point of the sun and a clock time of noon are usually different . the opposite of noon is midnight .
