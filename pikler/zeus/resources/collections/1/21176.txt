Arctic Circle     the arctic circle is one of the five major circles of latitude ( imaginary lines around the earth ) that are often marked on maps of the earth . this is the parallel of latitude that ( in 2000 ) runs 66° 33 ' 39 '' north of the equator . the arctic circle is one way to say what part of the earth is in the arctic . the north pole is in the center of the arctic circle . countries which are partly within the arctic circle are : - russia - canada - denmark ( greenland ) - united states of america ( alaska ) - norway - sweden - finland - iceland ( less than 1 square kilometre ) the position of the arctic circle is not fixed . it directly depends on the earth 's axial tilt . the axial tilt fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000-year period , mostly due to tidal forces from the orbit of the moon . the arctic circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about per year ; see `` circle of latitude '' for more information . related pages . - northern hemisphere - southern hemisphere - eastern hemisphere
