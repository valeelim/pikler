Voltage     voltage is a force that makes electricity move through a wire . it is measured in volts . voltage is also called electric tension or electromotive force ( emf ) . it was named after alessandro volta . technically , the voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points . voltage is always measured between two points , for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery , or between a wire and ground . as seen in volt # hydraulic analogy , voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source . it is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the electrons . in other words , the higher the voltage , the higher the pressure . for example , a battery of 3 volts will exert pressure on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1.5 volts . the voltage can push the electrons into a component , like a resistor , creating a current . usually , the voltage and the current are related by a formula ( see impedance ) . note that there must be both voltage `` and '' current to transfer power ( energy ) . for example , a wire can have a high voltage on it , but unless it is connected , nothing will happen . birds can land on high voltage lines such as 12kv and 16kv without dying , because the current does not flow through the bird .
