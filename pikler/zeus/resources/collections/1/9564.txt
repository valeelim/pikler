Milton Keynes     milton keynes is a very large town in buckinghamshire , england . in 1967 , the government decided to start a large new town with the idea that it would become a city of 250,000 people by the end of the twentieth century . the place where it was built already included three towns and sixteen villages , with about 45,000 people living there . more and more houses , shops and factories are built every year . by 2011 , there were are about 275,000 residents . ( in the united kingdom , no matter how large a town is , it can not just call itself a city . only the king or queen can give it that name ) . aeroplanes flying over ordinary towns can see roads that look like a spider 's web . but when they fly over milton keynes , they see that its big roads look like a net or a grid . the people who live there call the spaces between the busy roads grid squares and that is where they live . nobody lives right next to the big roads , so there are no trucks going past the front door of people who live there . so really , milton keynes often seems more like a 100 little villages than a big city .
