Sodium     sodium ( symbol na , from the latin name `` natrium '' ) is the chemical element number 11 in the periodic table of elements . it follows that its nucleus includes 11 protons , and 11 electrons orbit around it ( according to the simplified model known as `` niels bohr atom '' ) . even if a relatively large number of isotopes can be artificially produced , all decay in a short time . as a consequence all sodium found in nature ( mainly in sea water ) has the composition na , meaning that the nucleus includes 12 neutrons . the atomic mass of sodium is 22.9898 ; if it is rounded , it would be 23. sodium is a light , silver-coloured metal . sodium is so soft that it can be easily cut with a knife . when it is cut , the surface will become white after a bit of time . this is because it reacts with air to form sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate . sodium is a little lighter than water ; when it reacts with water it floats . this reaction is very fast . hydrogen and sodium hydroxide are produced . the hydrogen may ignite . since sodium melts at a low temperature , it melts when it reacts with water . it has one valence electron which is removed easily , making it highly reactive .
