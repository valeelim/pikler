Conjugation     conjugations are forms of verbs that are changed to agree with the subject that is doing the action described by the verb . usually most of the word stays the same , but the endings change . most conjugation systems follow some sort of pattern within the language . example : french verb for 'to eat'- `` manger '' ( stem : mang ) ( `` manger '' is the infinitive of the verb . the infinitive is the un-conjugated form of the verb , literally the `` to do '' something form such as `` to '' walk , `` to '' play , `` to '' eat . in english one does not say `` i like eat '' one must say `` i like `` to '' eat '' . in both english and french ( `` j'aime `` manger '' '' ) the infinitive form of the verb would be used in this case . the pattern here is that the `` er '' is removed from the verb and replaced with a different ending depending on the subject ( who 's doing the eating ) . this pattern is good for many french conjugations , but not all , and in other languages , conjugation patterns are going to be very different . other websites . - conjugation.com all english verbs conjugated in any tense , any form , any voice
