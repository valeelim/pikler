Dutch people     the dutch are the people who live in the netherlands , or those that come from the netherlands . often the netherlands is called holland , but this is only part of the netherlands . the dutch culture and ethnicity are also found outside of the netherlands , with large number of dutch living in the united states of america , south africa , suriname , namibia . many inventors were dutch , including hans lippershey , hans janssen , and his son zacharias janssen the inventors of the microscope and the telescope , and the incubator . many famous painters have also been dutch , among them rembrandt van rijn , vincent van gogh and johannes vermeer . the definition of ethnicity is not always clear . one can count all people living the netherlands as dutch , but many are not . this is because many people who live in the netherlands were not born there . there are about 15.5 million people in the netherlands who actually have the dutch nationality . about 1 million people living in the netherlands do not have the dutch nationality . to make things more confusing , people who live in the other parts of the kingdom of the netherlands ( including aruba , cura√ßao , sint maarten , and the caribbean netherlands ) also have dutch nationality . still , even more people in the netherlands were not born there can also be called `` dutch '' . according to some definitions , also people who were born in the netherlands , but who 's parents were not , can not be called dutch . this definition leaves almost 20 % of the entire dutch population to be 'foreign ' .
