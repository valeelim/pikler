Johnny Appleseed     john `` johnny appleseed '' chapman ( september 26 , 1774 - march 11 , 1847 ) is an american folk hero . he was a christian missionary and pioneer . his nickname came from the fact that he planted apple trees throughout the american midwest . many people consider him an early conservationist or `` tree-hugger '' . he wandered the country , usually barefoot , and with a cooking pot on his head for most of his adult life , planting apple trees , teaching the bible , telling stories , and befriending native americans , wild animals , and other settlers . many stories have been told about him and his journeys , as well as art , books , and later movies , which makes him a folk hero . he was born in leominster , massachusetts and is buried in johnny appleseed park in fort wayne , indiana . john chapman is said to have been in the wilkes-barre region some time in the 1790s , practicing his profession as a nurseryman , but just when he embraced the swedenborgian faith and began his missionary activities we can not be sure , though it is probable that it was before he ever reached western pennsylvania . there are some early accounts of john speaking of his own activities as `` a bible missionary '' on the potomac when he was a young man , and johnny was seen for two or three consecutive years along the banks of the potomac in eastern virginia , picking the seeds from the pomace of the cider mills in the late 1790s.the apple seeds that johnny obtained were free , as the cider mills wanted there to be more apple trees planted to improve their business .
