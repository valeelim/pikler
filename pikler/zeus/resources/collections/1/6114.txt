Utilitarianism     utilitarianism is a theory in philosophy about right and wrong actions . it says that the morally best action is the one that makes the most overall happiness or `` utility '' ( usefulness ) . this is not limited to the happiness caused by a single action but also includes the happiness of all people involved and all future consequences . the theory essentially states that an action is justifiable if it brings the most amount of happiness for the greatest number of people . the theory was made popular by 18th and 19th century british philosophers like francis hutcheson , jeremy bentham , and john stuart mill , but the idea goes all the way back to ancient times . bentham wrote about this idea with the words `` the greatest good for the greatest number '' , but did not use the word `` utilitarianism '' . it was mill , a follower of bentham 's ideas , who named the idea . more reading . - `` wiki felicifia '' , an encyclopedia for people who believe in utilitarianism
