Ear     the ear is the part of the body which allows animals ( including people ) to hear . people and most mammals have ears . non-mammals can also hear , but may have holes instead of external ears . the ear works by directing sound to the inner ear . these vibrations are sent to the brain by a network ( organized group ) of nerves . the whole system is called the auditory system . the inner part of the ear is common to most vertebrates , but mammals have special adaptations for hearing which even other land vertebrates do not have . these include the external ear and the three little bones which transmit sounds ( the ossicles ) . the part of the ear that sticks out and can be seen is called the `` pinna . '' ears are also used in other ways . african elephants use their large ears to cool themselves when it is very hot . bats rely on their ears to find prey by echolocation . some animals use their ears for signalling to each other . in ordinary language , `` ear '' refers to this receptor which conducts sound and sends signals to the brain . it does not refer to the many other methods of hearing found in fish and invertebrates . many animals do not hear through ears . spiders have small hairs on their legs that they can hear with .
