Enzyme     enzymes are protein molecules in cells which work as catalysts . enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body , but do not get used up in the process . almost all biochemical reactions in living things need enzymes . with an enzyme , chemical reactions go much faster than they would without the enzyme . the substances at the start of the reaction are called substrates . the substances at the end of the reaction are the products . enzymes work on the substrates , and turn them into products . the first enzyme was found in 1833 , by anselme payen . enzymes are large molecules made from many amino acids . the amino acids link together in a long chain , which is folded up into a complex structure . enzymes have a part which holds the substrate : a `` claw , cleft , hollow or knob to grasp , hold , stretch and bend the molecule it acts on , the substrate '' . there are thousands of different enzymes . enzymes have names which show what they do . enzyme names usually end in â€“ase to show that they are enzymes . examples of this include atp synthase . it makes a chemical called atp . another example is dna polymerase . it reads an intact dna strand and uses it as a template to make a new strand .
