Inertia     inertia is the resistance of an object to any change in its motion , including a change in direction . an object will stay still or keep moving at the same speed and in a straight line , unless it is acted upon by an outside force . for example , a rubber ball will not start bouncing around unless someone picks it up and throws it . basically , if an object is not moving , it will not start moving unless something else acts upon it . the same idea can be applied to motion : an object in motion will stay in motion unless some outside , opposing force acts upon it . inertia is also called sir isaac newton 's first law of motion . the first law of motion says that : `` every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight ahead , except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed . '' [ cohen & whitman 1999 translation ] this basically means : `` every object stays at rest or stays moving at the same speed unless something makes it change . `` johannes kepler gave inertia it 's name in `` epitome astronomiae copernicanae '' ( published in three parts from 1617â€“1621 )
