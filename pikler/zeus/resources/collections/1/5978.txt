Hippocrates     hippocrates ( c. 460 â€“ c. 370 bc ) was a greek doctor who is called the `` father of medicine '' . he was the first person to write that people got sick for scientific reasons . people used to believe disease was caused by angry ( mad ) gods . hippocrates wrote about treating sick people . his writings are still important to doctors today . he said many ideas that doctors still study . an idea he wrote about is `` patient confidentiality '' . this means that doctors can not tell anyone else what their patients tell them . another idea is that the doctor can not do anything to kill a patient . these kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics . the `` hippocratic oath '' is named after him . this is a promise or `` oath '' doctors say . this means they say they will do what is said in the `` hippocratic oath '' . ( people now think that hippocrates did not write it . ) most medical schools today use a new `` version '' . this means that some things are changed . but the important ideas are the same . this is an example of a modern `` hippocratic oath '' . this is used today at the university of north carolina school of medicine .
