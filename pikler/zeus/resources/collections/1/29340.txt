Cantata     a cantata is a type of singing which is done accompanied by an instrument ( s ) . by contrast , a cappella specifically refers to unaccompanied singing . the word ( cantata ) etymologically comes from the italian word “ cantare ” which meant “ to sing ” . the word “ cantata ” was used mainly in the 17th and 18th century to describe music with religious words that were sung by a choir or by soloists or both , accompanied by instruments . the most famous cantatas are those by johann sebastian bach . nearly all his cantatas are sacred ( written for church services ) . very often he used lutheran hymn tunes ( chorales ) for the first and last movements . in between there are movements for solo singers : recitatives and arias . a famous example is bach 's cantata no 80 which is based on the chorale “ ein feste burg ist unser gott ( “ a safe stronghold our god is still ” ) . the whole work is about being safe in the hands of god . this is what the sermon would have been about . the congregation would join in singing the chorale towards the end of the cantata .
