Mestizo     mestizo ( meh-stee-tzo ) is a spanish term for a person who is of mixed european ( usually spanish ) and native american ancestry . mestizos have existed since the time when spain controlled what is now latin america . a mestizo was usually the son of a spanish father and a native american mother . mestizos form the largest part of the population in some latin american nations , a large minority of mestizos makes up most of the population in mexico , which is the spanish-speaking nation with the largest population in the world . during the colonial era , many native americans were converted to roman catholicism and began using the spanish language instead of their traditional one . this was because of the concept that existed in the spanish colonies which gave more `` value '' to european people over native americans and africans . because of this , many native americans gained better social status by calling themselves `` mestizos '' instead of `` native american .
