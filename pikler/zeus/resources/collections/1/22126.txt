Frame of reference     a frame of reference is how one knows if an object is moving . for example , when you see a ball roll down a street , you can tell the ball is moving because the frame of reference is the streets , whatever may be on the side of the roads or the earth . all of these are a frame of reference . the most common frame of reference is earth itself , even though it moves .
