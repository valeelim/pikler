Tallahassee, Florida    tallahassee , florida tallahassee is the capital city of the u.s. state of florida . as of the 2010 census , its population was 181,376. the name comes from the apalachee native american words : `` talwa '' meaning town , and `` ahassee '' meaning old . tallahassee was created as the capital of florida during the territory 's second legislative session . it was chosen as the midpoint between st. augustine and pensacola , which had been the capitals of the spanish and british colonies of east florida and west florida , respectively . ( at that time , very few people lived in the swamps of south florida . ) the first session of florida 's legislative council–as a territory of the united states–met on july 22 , 1822 at pensacola and members from st. augustine traveled fifty-nine days by water to attend . the second session was in st. augustine and required western delegates to travel perilously around the peninsula on a twenty-eight day trek . during this session , it was decided that future meetings should be held at a half-way point to reduce the distance . two appointed commissioners selected tallahassee , at that point an abandoned apalachee settlement , as a halfway point . in 1824 , the third legislative session met there in a crude log capitol . also in 1824 , marquis de lafayette , french hero of the american revolution , returned for a grand tour of the united states . the us congress voted to give him $ 200,000 ( the same amount he had given the colonies in 1778 ) , us citizenship , and the lafayette land grant , of land that today includes large portions of tallahassee . in 1845 , a greek revival masonry structure was erected as the capitol building in time for statehood .
