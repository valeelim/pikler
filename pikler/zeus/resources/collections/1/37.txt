Native American     native americans ( also called aboriginal americans , american indians , amerindians , or indigenous peoples of america ) are the people , and their descendants , who were in north america , central america , south america , and the caribbean islands when europeans arrived . there are many different tribes of native american people , with many different languages . there are more than three million native americans in canada and the u.s. combined . approximately 51 million native americans live in latin america . sometimes these people are called `` indians '' , but this is confusing , because it is the same word used for people from india . when christopher columbus was travelling west , he did not know about the americas . he thought he was going to india , so he called the people `` indians '' . many native americans died after the europeans came to the americas , from diseases that came with the europeans that were new to the native americans , in battle with the europeans , or because the europeans made them work as slaves . most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands .
