Chaos theory     chaos theory is a part of mathematics . it looks at certain systems that are very sensitive . a very small change may make the system behave completely differently . very small changes in the starting position of a chaotic system make a big difference after a while . this is why even large computers can not tell the weather for more than a few days in the future . even if the weather was perfectly measured , a small change or error will make the prediction completely wrong . since even a butterfly can make enough wind with its wings to do this , a chaotic system is sometimes called the `` butterfly effect '' . no computer knows enough to tell how the small wind will change the weather . some systems ( like weather ) might appear random at first look , but chaos theory says that these kinds of systems or patterns may not be . if people pay close enough attention to what is really going on , they might notice the chaotic patterns . the main idea of chaos theory is that a minor difference at the start of a process can make a major change in it as time progresses . quantum chaos theory is a new idea in the study of chaos theory . it deals with quantum physics .
