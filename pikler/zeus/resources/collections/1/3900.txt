Variegated leaf     a variegated leaf is a leaf which has both green and non-green parts . as the green parts contain chlorophyll they photosynthesize , but the non green parts do not contain chlorophyll , so they can not photosynthesize . a variegated leaf is useful in conducting experiments to show that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis to happen . they are also popular in horticulture . the easiest of these experiments is to stain the places where starch is produced ( starch is a more compact form of glucose ) . place the leaves in boiling water for six minutes to soften the cells , and then in ethanol ( alcohol ) . when the leaves are drained of colour , spread them out on a flat surface . soak the leaves in iodine and the green parts will turn blue/black and the non green parts will stay the yellowish brown colour of iodine liquid . the green parts contain starch , which makes iodine turn blue/black . the blue/black stain is what shows starch is present . you could take `` before & after '' photos to prove the black areas were green at the start .
