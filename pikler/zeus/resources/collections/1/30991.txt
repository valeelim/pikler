Nuclear reactor     a nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat . there are different designs which use different fuels . most often , uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels . most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity . in nuclear power plants heat from the reactor changes water into steam . the steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity . it is important to remember that the turbines do not change the temperature of the steam , or the amount of steam . instead , the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam . some reactors are used for other purposes . some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes . some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work . the first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by enrico fermi . this was a part of the manhattan project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb . the first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in idaho in 1951. it made just enough electricity for four light globes .
