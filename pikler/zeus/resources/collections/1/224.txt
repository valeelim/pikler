Experiment     an experiment is a test of an idea or a method . it is often used by scientists and engineers . an experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world . experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them . experiments are part of scientific method . experiments can tell us if a theory is false , or if something does not work . they can not tell us if a theory is true . when einstein said that gravity could affect light , it took a few years before astronomers could test it . general relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field ; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body . this effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the sun . now , a hundred years or so after einstein published his ideas , there have been many tests , all of which have been consistent with einstein 's predictions . but , one day , we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work . what we test are implications of the theory , because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once .
