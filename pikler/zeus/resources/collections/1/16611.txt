Solstice     a solstice is an astronomical event that happens twice each year when the sun reaches its highest position in the sky as seen from the north or south pole . the day of the solstice is either the `` longest day of the year '' or the `` shortest day of the year '' for any place on earth , because the length of time between sunrise and sunset on that day is the yearly maximum or minimum for that place . the name is derived from the latin words `` sol '' ( “ sun ” ) and `` sistere '' ( “ to stand still ” ) . during the solstice , the sun stands still ; that is , the seasonal movement of the sun 's path comes to a stop before reversing direction . the “ northern solstice ” occurs in june , when the sun is at its highest point seen from the north pole . the “ southern solstice ” occurs in december , when the sun is at its highest point seen from the south pole . the solstices , together with the equinoxes , are connected with the seasons . in some cultures they mark either the beginning or the middle of summer and winter . the june solstice happens when the northern hemisphere of the earth is tilted toward the sun and the southern hemisphere of the earth is tilted away from the sun . at the north pole , the sun reaches its highest point in the sky , and then begins moving lower . at the moment of the june solstice , the sun is directly overhead some point on the tropic of cancer ; this is the furthest north that the subsolar point ever reaches . in the northern hemisphere the june solstice is called the summer solstice ( and marks the longest day of the year ) , while in the southern hemisphere it is called the winter solstice ( and marks the shortest day of the year ) . the june solstice is usually on june 21 .
