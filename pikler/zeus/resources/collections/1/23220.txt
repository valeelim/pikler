McGurk effect     the mcgurk effect shows how hearing and vision are used for speech perception . named after the man who found it , harry mcgurk ( 23 february 1936 â€“ 17 april 1998 ) , it says that people hear speech with their ears , and use other senses to help interpret what they hear . the mcgurk effect happens when watching a video of a person saying /ga/ with a sound-recording saying /ba/ . when this is done , a third sound is heard : /da/ . the mcgurk effect is robust : that is , it still works even if a person know about it . this is different from some optical illusions , which do not work anymore once a person can see it . the mcgurk effect describes a phenomenon that shows how speech perception is not dependent only on auditory information . visual information in the form of reading the lips is also taken into account and combined with the auditory information that is heard to produce the final stimuli perceived . this can get particularly interesting when the auditory information of one sound , paired with the spoken lips of another sound , ultimately combine to form the perception of a third different sound .
