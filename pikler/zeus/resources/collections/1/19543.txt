Age of consent     the age of consent is the age at which a person can legally consent to have sexual intercourse . this is also the minimum age of the other person legally permitted to engage in sexual activity . having sex with a person who is younger than the age of consent ( but who agrees to have sex ) is called statutory rape . the person below the minimum age is regarded as a victim , and their sex partner as the offender . different countries have different laws regarding the age of consent . some are as low as 12 or as high as 21. most countries have ages set between 13 and 16. but worldwide , the average age of consent is 16 years of age . most jurisdictions allow minors above a certain age to marry with parental and/or government permission . in jurisdictions which allow this , a minor who is married is an exception to the law . for example , in wisconsin the age of consent for sex is 18. marriage is an exception . marriage usually prevents a party to the marriage from being charged under sexual assault laws , as long as both husband and wife are at least 16 years , although not if one of the parties is younger than this age and one is older . this varies from country to country . in some places kissing is considered a sexual activity . other places only count sexual intercourse . most countries have laws that say what the legal age of consent is . this is usually a fixed age . for example , in france the age of consent is set at 15 , which means having sex with anyone below that age by anyone over that age is illegal . however , some jurisdictions use sexual maturity instead of age to determine capacity for consent . for example , when russia was a part of the soviet union , its age of consent was having reached `` sexual maturity '' .
