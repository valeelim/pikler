Bismarck (ship)    bismarck ( ship ) the german battleship bismarck was one of the most famous warships of world war ii . it only sailed for one mission , operation `` rhein√ºbung '' , before sinking in the atlantic ocean . nearly 3500 seamen lost their lives in the battle which lasted around 8 days . the whole ship with all the oil reserves weighed 53165 tonnes . it was about long and wide . the ship had eight big guns : cannons , called the heavy artillery . there were 12 smaller cannons , and several anti-aircraft `` flak '' cannons too . it had very thick armour , even for warships today . the thickest plating was around the heavy artillery , where the metal was thick . first the `` bismarck '' had to reach the open sea . this because it was a huge battleship few other ships would be able to get close enough to attack without being destroyed , so it could control a large area of sea . the first problem the `` bismarck '' had was how to pass the british isles . it took the way near the fjords of norway . there it met the other german ship `` prinz eugen '' . both ships reached the open sea in the denmark straits . the royal navy 's battleships hms hood and hms prince of wales were sent to sink the `` bismarck '' . the `` hood '' lost this battle . the `` hood '' was more than a ship for the british military leaders . it was kind of a myth . so the british navy sent a large number of ships to hunt the `` bismarck '' . there were some cruisers , many battleships and some aircraft-carriers . there was a very dramatic hunt , because the bismarck was damaged but escaped from the nearest british ships .
