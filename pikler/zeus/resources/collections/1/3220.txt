Force     in physics , force is a push or a pull that changes or tends to change the state of rest or uniform motion of an object or changes the direction or shape of an object . force causes objects to accelerate , add to the object 's overall pressure , change direction , or change shape . force is measured in newtons . ( n ) . a force is always a push , pull , or a twist , and it affects objects by pushing them up , pulling them down , pushing them to a side , or by changing their motion or shape in some other way . according to newton 's second law of motion , the formula for finding force is : where formula_2 is the force , formula_3 is the mass of an object , and formula_4 is the acceleration of the object . this formula says that when there is a force on an object then it will move faster and faster . if the force is weak and the object is heavy , then it will take a long time to increase the speed very much , but if the force is strong and the object is light , then it will move a lot faster very quickly . gravity is an acceleration . everything that has a mass is being pulled toward the earth because of that acceleration . this pull is a force called weight .
