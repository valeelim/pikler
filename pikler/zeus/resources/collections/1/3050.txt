Northern Ireland     northern ireland ( , ulster ) is a province of ireland . the whole island of ireland used to be a kingdom , called the kingdom of ireland . but after the act of union in the year 1800 , it became part of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . this stayed until 1922 , after a civil war , when ireland was divided into the republic of ireland , the sovereign state that takes up the southern part of the island , and northern ireland , which chose to stay as part of the uk . about 1.8 million people live in northern ireland , and the capital and largest city is belfast . sometimes people use other names for northern ireland . some call it ulster , even though some parts of ulster are actually in the republic of ireland . others call it `` the north '' or `` the six counties '' , because they do not want to recognise that a part of the island of ireland is not independent and is actually in the united kingdom . northern ireland is the smallest part of the united kingdom at 5,345 sq mi . english is spoken by almost everyone in northern ireland . another important language is irish ( sometimes called `` irish gaelic '' ) and a language known as ulster scots , which comes from eastern ulster and lowland scotland . the irish language became less widely spoken in the 20th century , but a revival has led to increased usage , especially in belfast , the glens of antrim and counties tyrone and fermanagh . this revival has been driven largely through the creation of irish-language schools . the irish language is spoken by some nationalists ( whether catholic or protestant ) people . ulster scots is almost exclusive to areas of north antrim and the ards peninsula .
