Pentagram     a pentagram is a five-pointed star , with all lines the same length and all angles the same . a 'pentangle ' , 'star pentagon ' , or 'pentalpha ' means the same thing . the word `` pentacle '' originally meant 'any symbol that protects against evil spirits ' . there are many of such symbols , only a few of which include a pentagram . during the modern age of wicca , the word 'pentacle ' acquired a second definition , due to sounding similar to the word 'pentagram ' , and the fact that wiccan pentacles use a pentagram . that second definition of 'pentacle ' is 'a circumscribed pentagram ' , which means 'a pentagram drawn inside a circle so that the points of the pentagram touch the circle ' . the pentagram means different things to different people . these meanings have changed over time . in ancient times , the pentagram was used as a christian symbol . it stood for the five wounds that jesus christ received during his crucifixion ( the nails in each hand and foot , and the spear wound in his side ) . in the past , the pentagram was commonly seen as a symbol for good and for protection against evil .
