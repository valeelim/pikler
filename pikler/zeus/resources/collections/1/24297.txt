Human evolution     human evolution is about the origin of human beings . all humans belong to the same species , which has spread from its birthplace in africa to almost all parts of the world . its origin in africa is proved by the fossils which have been found there . the term 'human ' in this context means the genus `` homo '' . however , studies of human evolution usually include other hominids , such as the australopithecines , from which the genus `` homo '' had diverged ( split ) by about 2.3 to 2.4 million years ago in africa . the first `` homo sapiens '' , the ancestors of today 's humans , evolved around 200,000 years ago . it was known for centuries that man and the apes were related . at heart , their anatomy is similar , despite many superficial differences . this was the reason why buffon and linnaeus , in the 18th century , put them together in one family . charles darwin 's theory of evolution says that such basic structural similarity comes from the common origin of the group . the apes and man are close relatives , and are primates : the order of mammals which includes monkeys , apes , lemurs and tarsiers .
