Alloy     an alloy is a uniform mixture . it is made up of two or more chemical elements , of which at least one is a metal . an alloy has properties different from the metals it is made of . most alloys are made by melting the metals , mixing them while they are liquid to form a solution , then leaving them to cool and turn solid again . combining a pure metal with one or more other metals or non-metals often makes it better . for example , steel is an alloy made from iron but it is stronger than iron . physical properties like density , reactivity and electrical and thermal ( heat ) conductivity may not be much different than the elements ( substances ) which make the alloy . but , properties like strength can be very much different . the first alloy to be discovered was bronze . bronze is made from copper and tin . bronze was discovered a very long time ago in the prehistoric period . then , bronze was being used for making tools and weapons . this period was known as bronze age . but , later better alloys were discovered which replaced bronze for making tools and weapons . now , bronze is used for making ornaments , statues , and bells . brass is another alloy made from copper and zinc .
