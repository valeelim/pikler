Messiah     messiah or the anointed one is the figure promised by god to the jews for the salvation of the world . the jews think that the messiah will be a human being that will save israel and lead the whole world into the end of days and eternal peace . other people in real life or fiction are called messianic if they have the qualities of a messiah , or people think they will bring about a better world . the how , where , and why . - why : jews believe the biblical prophets inspired by god to tell of his coming . during the period of the roman rule in 1st century bc the idea of the messiah became very important in jewish thought and teaching . according to the scriptures , the messiah would rescue the people from the romans and restore the country . - where : it is not known but most jews believe that messiah will come to israel . - how : there are many of ideas about how the messiah will come : judge , warrior , beggar , academic , philosopher , healer or a common person . christianity , which began in israel with jewish followers of jesus ( hebrew : yeshua ) , holds that the messiah foretold by the jewish scriptures is jesus , and that in fulfillment of prophecy jesus died for the sins of the world , rose from the dead and lives today , seated at the right hand of god until his return . most jews do not hold these beliefs ; those who do are sometimes called messianic jews . some messianic jews and other christians see the fact that a majority of jews do not hold these beliefs as a fulfillment of prophecy .
