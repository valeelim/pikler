Membrane     a membrane is a thin soft layer of material . a membrane separates two things . in biology a membrane can mean two things : a tissue membrane or the membranes of a cell . the membranes of cells are very small . tissue membranes are bigger . a membrane can mean a thin layer of cells or tissue . this layer covers the body or an organ , or separates , or lines a body cavity . an example is the mucous membrane that is the `` skin '' that lines the inside of your nose and mouth . an epithelial membrane has two parts , one part is epithelial tissue and the other is connective tissue . there are many different types of membranes in a cell . the cell membrane , also called the plasma membrane , covers one cell . membranes also divide the cell into different spaces called organelles . organelles are special areas of the cell that do different work . for example , the nucleus holds the dna in a cell . the mitochondria make energy for the cell . membranes in cells are made of lipids ( fats ) and protein . the lipids keep the inside of the cell or the organelle separate from the outside . the proteins do many things . plasma membranes give the cell messages from outside . they let some things ( like glucose , calcium , and potassium ) go into and out of the cell .
