Absolute zero     in theory , absolute zero is the temperature at which the particles of matter ( molecules and atoms ) are at their lowest energy points . some people think that at absolute zero particles lose all energy and stop moving . this is not correct . in quantum physics there is something called zero point energy , which means that even after all the energy that can be removed from particles has been removed , the particles still have some energy . this is due to the heisenberg principle of uncertainty , which states that the more that is known about a particle 's position , the less that can be known about its momentum , and vice versa . therefore , a particle can not be completely stopped because then its exact position and momentum would be known . some people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero : the record temperature was 100 pk ( one hundred picokelvin , equal to 10 kelvin ) above absolute zero . even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects . scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures .
