Amsterdam     amsterdam is the capital and largest city in the european country of the netherlands . amsterdam is famous for its canals and dikes . unlike most other countries , the national government is not in amsterdam , but in the hague . about 838,000 people were living in amsterdam in 2016. the city hosts two universities ( the university of amsterdam and the free university amsterdam ) and an international airport `` schiphol airport '' . about 2.2 million people live in the metropolitan area . the city of amsterdam is the world 's most multi-cultural city . it has people living there from 175 different countries . like other big cities in the netherlands and elsewhere in the world , amsterdam is unfortunately subjected to many criminal activities . a dam was built in 13th century in the river amstel ( that 's why the city is called amsterdam ) . the old harbor of the city , `` damrak '' , is now one of the busiest streets in the city . the city was for the first time mentioned in 1275 by count floris v , count of holland and zeeland who gave the people of amsterdam some more freedom . the city got its city rights probably in 1306 ; at least soon after the year 1300. the city became a major trading port pretty soon , with a successful trading route to the baltic sea . the city grew fast in the 15th century . because the city basically lies in swamp , the builders of the city had to dig canals to use the digging-ground for getting the living-ground higher . homes were built on wooden poles , and the canals served as a pretty effective primitive sewer .
