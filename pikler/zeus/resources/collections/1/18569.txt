Myxobolus cerebralis     myxobolus cerebralis is a small myxozoan parasite that eats the insides of fish like salmon and trout , causing whirling disease . this is a problem in fish farming and also in natural fish groups . in the last 100 years , it has spread to most of europe ( including russia ) , the united states , south africa , and other countries . in the 1980s , people found out that `` m. cerebralis '' needs to live in a worm before it can live in a fish . it infects both the fish and the worm by poking a hole in them and putting part of itself in . whirling disease hurts young fish the most , and can hurt bones and nerves . fish with the disease do not swim very well , and they `` whirl '' or spin instead of swimming straight . this makes it hard for the fish to get food and get away from danger . dealing with `` m. cerebralis '' costs more money than most other parasites in its group ( which are called `` myxozoans '' ) . people do not get sick with whirling disease , though ; only fish do . at first , people thought that this parasite infected fish brains , so they named it `` cerebralis '' , which means brain-related . then , people found out that it mostly infects cartilage and bones . they tried to change the name , but they could not . later , they found out that other creatures called `` triactinomyxon dubium '' and `` t. gyrosalmo '' were actually stages of `` m . cerebralis . '' it would be like finding out that caterpillars are really young butterflies even though they look very different .
