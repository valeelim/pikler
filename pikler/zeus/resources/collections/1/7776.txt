Madagascar     madagascar is a large island nation in the indian ocean . it is off of the east coast of africa . twenty-two million people live there ; its capital is antananarivo . it is the world 's fourth largest island . the official languages are malagasy and french . geologists think that about two million years ago , madagascar was a part of a big landmass that included what is now the continent of africa , but it broke off . madagascar would later break off of the indian subcontinent . madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when dutch explorers went there . they do not even exist elsewhere in africa . they only exist in madagascar . in fact , most of the mammals living in madagascar do not live anywhere else in the world . however , many of the species in madagascar are in danger because many of the forests have been cut down . a big reason that forests have been cut down is so that land can be used to grow crops such as coffee , which is one of the most important crops that is grown in madagascar .
