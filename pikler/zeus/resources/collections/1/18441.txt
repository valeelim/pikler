Whiskey Rebellion     the whiskey rebellion was a rebellion in the history of the united states . some farmers in western pennsylvania rebelled against the united states federal government in 1794. they believed that they had to pay a tax on whiskey that was not fair . other farmers in other parts of the united states did not have to pay the same tax . it was a tax on whiskey . selling whiskey was how people traded things in western pennsylvania , so they thought the new tax was very unfair . alexander hamilton offered the idea to try and make up for the young country 's debt from the war . the government under george washington , with advice from alexander hamilton , quickly stopped the rebellion . washington and hamilton wanted to ensure that no one would question the power of the federal government , so they sent almost 13,000 troops to stop the rebellion of a few hundred farmers , led by president washington himself . that made the new government more solid , and the president more powerful . numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts .
