Neptune     neptune ( ) , is the eighth and last planet from the sun in the solar system . it is a gas giant . it is the fourth largest planet and third heaviest . neptune has four rings which are hard to see from the earth . it is 17 times heavier than earth and is a little bit heavier than uranus . it was named after the roman god of the sea . neptune 's atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium . it also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue . neptune 's blue color is much brighter compared to uranus ' , which has a similar amount of methane , so there might be another reason why neptune is blue . neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system , measured as high as 2,100 km/h or 1,300 mph . neptune was discovered by the astronomers , urbain le verrier and john couch adams . they were both honored for the discovery . the planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a telescope . because of uranus ' odd movements in its orbit ( the line which a planet follows in moving ) , it made astronomers search for the new planet . the planet was visited by only one spacecraft , `` voyager 2 '' on august 25 , 1989. neptune once had a huge storm known as the `` great dark spot '' which was discovered in 1989 by voyager 2. however , the dark spot was not seen in 1994 , and new spots were found since then . it is not known why the dark spot disappeared . visits by more space probes have been proposed .
