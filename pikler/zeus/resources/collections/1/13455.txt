Pink triangle     the pink triangle is one of the two big symbols of the lgbt community . the other is the rainbow flag . the pink triangle was first used in nazi germany to mark homosexual prisoners . there was also a `` black triangle '' that marked `` anti-social women '' . many but not all of these women were lesbians . jews wore the famous yellow star of david . if a prisoner was both jewish and gay , he would wear a yellow triangle overlapped by a pink triangle , creating a star of david . homosexuality was illegal in nazi germany under a law called `` paragraph 175 '' , which made it a felony ( a `` very serious '' crime ) . about 100,000 people were arrested , with about 50,000 sent to prison . some were sent to mental hospitals . some were castrated ( had their testicles removed ) . some homosexual men were also sent to concentration camps , especially jewish homosexuals . between 15,000 and 600,000 homosexual men were sent to concentration camps . most of them died there . we are not sure of the real number . prisoners who were jewish and homosexual may not have been counted as homosexual .
