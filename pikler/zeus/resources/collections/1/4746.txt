Greenhouse effect     the greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the earth 's atmosphere ( the air around the earth ) entraps infrared radiation . this makes the planet become warmer , similar to the way it makes a greenhouse become warmer . the greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases ; the most important greenhouse gases in earth 's atmosphere are : water vapor , carbon dioxide , and methane . when there is more greenhouse gas in the air , the air holds more heat . this is why more greenhouse gases cause global warming . the greenhouse effect is natural . it is important for life on earth . without the greenhouse effect , the earth 's average temperature would be around -18 or -19 degrees celsius ( 0 or 1 degree fahrenheit ) . earth would be locked in an ice age . because of the greenhouse effect , the earth 's actual average temperature is 14 degrees celsius ( 57 degrees fahrenheit ) . the problem is that recently , the greenhouse effect has become stronger . this is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuels , which release carbon dioxide when they are burned . since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , it has caused the planet to warm over the past 150 years .
