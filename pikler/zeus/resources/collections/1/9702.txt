Copyright infringement     copyright infringement ( or copyright violation ) is the use of material which is covered by copyright law , in a way that violates one of the original copyright owner 's `` exclusive rights '' , such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work , or to make derivative works that build upon it . the slang term `` bootleg '' ( from the use of boots to smuggle items ) is often used to describe illegally copied material . some people call copying of movies and music , that copyright does not allow , `` piracy '' or `` theft '' . richard stallman says people should not call copying and distribution `` piracy '' , because piracy is robbery with attacking ships , killing and stealing people , and owners of copyright use the word to say that such copying is same evil as piracy . some courts say that the word `` piracy '' may be used , but the word `` theft '' may not be used . when people use the word `` piracy '' for copyright infringement , it usually means `` selling of many copies without permission '' , but sometimes any `` big copyright infringement '' .
