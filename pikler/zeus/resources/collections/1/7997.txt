Sublimation     sublimation is the process by which a solid transforms into a gas without passing through the liquid stage . at normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth , only some compounds like 'dry ice ' ( solid carbon dioxide ) can go through this process . most substances can only sublimate at lower pressure . many can sublimate in space . snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day , but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first . a better example is co , which changes from a solid to a gas without being a liquid . also diamond , graphite , iodine , ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure .
