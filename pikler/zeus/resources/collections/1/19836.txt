Cellulose     cellulose is the main chemical that forms the main structure of plants . it is the most abundant macromolecule on earth . it is also a fibre . cellulose is made from a form of glucose and makes up most of the cell wall of plant cells . this is what keeps a plant in shape . cellulose is not digestible by humans . it is a polysaccharide , which is repeating units of a monosaccharide joined together by a glycosidic bond by a condensation reaction , there is a by-product of water , found in plants . it is very tough because when you join beta glucose together , they are opposite ways up , the bonds are straight , forming straight chains . there is hydrogen bonds between the polymers . these fibers are in bundles of about 40 , called microfibrils . microfibrils are embedded in a hydrated network of other polysaccharides . the cell wall is assembled in place . the parts are made inside the cell and then assembled by enzymes associated with the cell membrane .
