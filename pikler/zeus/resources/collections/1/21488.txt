Magnetism     in physics , magnetism is a force that can attract ( pull closer ) or repel ( push away ) objects that have a magnetic material like iron inside them ( `` magnetic objects '' ) . in simpler words it is a property of certain substances which pull closer or repel other objects . magnetism can be made by a permanent `` magnet '' , or by electricity in a wire . this is called an electromagnet . when magnets are put near magnetic objects , the magnet and the object are pulled toward each other . this is called magnetic attraction . magnets can also repel ( push away ) other magnets . most objects that are attracted to magnets have iron in them . most other metals , such as aluminium , are not attracted to magnets . magnets have an unseen area around them called a `` magnetic field '' . magnetic objects inside this unseen field are attracted to the magnet . magnetic things outside the magnetic field are not attracted to the magnet . this is why a magnet must be close to an object to attract it . the poles of two magnets repel or attract each other . different poles attract each other . for example , if the south pole of one magnet is put near the south pole of another magnet , the magnets will repel each other . this will also happen with two north poles that are put near each other . if a north pole is put near a south pole , the magnets will attract each other until they stick to each other and can be hard to pull apart .
