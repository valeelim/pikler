Protoplasm     protoplasm is an old term , which means the living substance that makes up a cell . it is no longer much used . biologists prefer to talk about the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus . in plant cells , it is surrounded by a cell wall . in animal cells , the whole cell is made of protoplasm , surrounded by a cell membrane . protoplasm in living beings is made up of about 7580 % water . however , this is rather misleading because the cytoplasm is full of structures called organelles , which do various tasks . the endoplasmic reticulum is the largest of these structures ; there are many other organelles . the word `` protoplasm '' was first used in 1846 by hugo von mohl to describe the substance in plant cells , apart from the cell wall , the cell nucleus and the vacuole . after the invention of the electron microscope it was clear that a living cell is much more complicated than von mohl knew .
