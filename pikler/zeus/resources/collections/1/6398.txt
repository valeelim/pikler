Dreyfus Affair     the dreyfus affair was one of the biggest scandals in the history of france . it happened at the end of the 19th century . it was about alfred dreyfus , a jewish officer in the french army . in 1894 , dreyfus was accused of being a spy , and accused of crimes against france . people thought he wrote letters to the germans telling them about secrets of the french army . his punishment was to be sent to a prison island in south america for the rest of his life . when he was in prison , people ( mostly his brother mathieu and a high-ranking officer called picquart ) thought he was innocent . they proved that another soldier , major esterhazy , was guilty . but the army did not want to admit that it had been wrong . they refused to free him . finally , the evidence that dreyfus was innocent became so strong that the government had to demand a new trial . at the new trial , the army again found him guilty . the president of france , who did not want an innocent man to suffer any more , pardoned dreyfus in 1899 .
