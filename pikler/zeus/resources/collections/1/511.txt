Metabolism     metabolism is the name given to the chemical reactions which keep us alive . it happens in the cells of living organisms . reactions catalyzed by enzymes allow organisms to grow , reproduce , maintain their structures , and respond to their environments . the word ‘ metabolism ’ can also refer to digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells . metabolism is usually divided into two categories . catabolism breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of cellular respiration . anabolism uses energy to construct molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . the chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways , or cycles , like the krebs cycle . one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes . the metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds nutritious and which poisonous . for example , some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient , yet this gas is poisonous to animals . the speed of metabolism , the metabolic rate , influences how much food an organism will need , and how it is able to get that food .
