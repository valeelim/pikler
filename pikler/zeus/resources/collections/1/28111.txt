Jerk     jerk is the change in the acceleration of an object . mathematically , jerk is the derivative , or the rate of change of acceleration by time . jerk is also called jolt ( in british english ) , surge , or lurch . jerk is a vector and there is no word for its scalar value . the jerk is measured in metres per second cubed ( formula_1 ) . yank can be thought as a force in terms of jerk . force is mass times acceleration . similarly , yank is mass times jerk . it is also the derivative of the force . however , when an object is moving near the speed of light , a force is often written as the derivative of momentum . in this case , yank is the rate of change of the derivative of momentum . jerk is used in engineering , particularly in making roller coasters . weak objects such as people can be damaged by high acceleration or high jerk . also , jerk must be thought in the process of making any product . sudden change in acceleration means very large jerk . extent of exposure to jerk is often a good predictor of the rate of deterioration of tools while in normal use ; it corresponds better to the appearance of metal fatigue among other modes of failure .
