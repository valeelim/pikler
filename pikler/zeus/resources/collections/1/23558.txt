Russian Revolution     the russian revolution was a series of revolutions in the russian empire during 1917. the events destroyed the tsarist autocracy , and helped create the soviet union . the first revolution was on 8 march 1917 , but in russia it was recorded as 28 february 1917. this happened because russia still used the julian calendar instead of the gregorian calendar , which is the standard for measuring dates today . after the february revolution , tsar nicholas ii was forced to step down and was replaced with a socialist provisional government . this government was meant to rule for a short time until the country became stable again . the second revolution , the october revolution , was in october of the julian calendar . communist bolsheviks replaced the provisional government , and created the soviet union . the royal family was put under house arrest , but later shot and killed . the term `` red october '' is used to describe the events of this month . during the 1890s , improvements in russian industry put more jobs in cities . this made the cities larger as people moved there . the workers in the cities , with increasing levels of education , began to develop an interest in politics and the creation of political parties in order to try and change their lives for the better . the conditions that they lived and worked in were horrible . poor people from other parts of the russian empire , like poland and ukraine , also created their own parties to try and stop the russians oppressing them .
