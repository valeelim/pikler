Plastic Ono Band     the plastic ono band was a rock and roll band formed by yoko ono with husband ( and former beatle ) john lennon . they were active from 1969 until 1974. lennon and ono recorded their first single together , titled `` give peace a chance '' , in a montreal hotel with a roomful of guests , including tommy smothers , allen ginsberg , norman mailer , timothy leary , and the local hare krishna chapter . the pair were in an auto accident before the single was to debut ( be played in public for the first time ) , and they had to stay in the hospital . not wanting to cancel the debut , they sent the first version of their `` new band '' – a set of plastic cases that held the sound equipment – which played in their place . it was a strange kind of debut for a new band , but the song ( a protest against the vietnam war ) became a minor hit that year , in england and in the united states . the second version of the plastic ono band included ono and lennon in person , along with musicians eric clapton , klaus voormann and alan white . they performed together at a rock concert in toronto in september 1969 , and it was the first time lennon had played in public with a band other than the beatles . the show went well , and helped lennon decide to leave the beatles , which he had thought about doing for some time . a second single , `` cold turkey '' , was recorded with this lineup .
