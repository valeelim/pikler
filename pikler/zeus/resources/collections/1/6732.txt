Plasma (physics)    plasma ( physics ) plasma is a state of matter . the three other common states of matter are solids , liquids and gases , so plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter . plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave its atoms . this is called ionization . it results in negatively charged electrons , and positively charged ions . unlike the other states of matter , the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields ( i.e . electromagnetic fields ) . if a plasma loses heat , the ions will re-form into a gas , emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize . over 99 % of the matter in the visible universe is believed to be plasma . when the atoms in a gas are broken up , the pieces are called electrons and ions . because they have an electric charge , they are pulled together or pushed apart by electric fields and magnetic fields . this makes a plasma act differently than a gas . for example , magnetic fields can be used to hold a plasma , but not to hold a gas . plasma is a better conductor of electricity than copper .
