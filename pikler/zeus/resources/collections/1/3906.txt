Chemical cell     a chemical cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy . most batteries are chemical cells . a chemical reaction takes place inside the battery and causes electric current to flow . there are two main types of batteries - those that are `` rechargeable '' and those that are not . a battery that is not recharageable will give electricity until the chemicals in it are used up . then it is no longer useful . it can be rightly called 'use and throw ' . a rechargeable battery can be `` recharged '' by passing electric current backwards through the battery ; it can then be used again to produce more electricity . it was gaston plante , a french scientist who invented these rechargeable batteries in 1859. batteries come in many shapes and sizes , from very small ones used in toys and cameras , to those used in cars or even larger ones . types of chemical cells . - simple chemical cell - dry cell - wet cell - fuel cell - solar cell - electric cell an extremely important class of oxidation and reduction reactions are used to provide useful electrical energy in batteries . a simple electro chemical cell can be made from copper and zinc metals with solutions of their sulphates . in the process of the reaction , electrons can be transferred from the zinc to the copper through an electrically conducting path as a useful electric current .
