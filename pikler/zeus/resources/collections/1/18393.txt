Dynamite     dynamite is an explosive invented by alfred nobel . its main explosive component is nitroglycerin . nitroglycerin is very sensitive to movement . it explodes very easily , when moved . for this reason , diatomaceous earth is used to take away this sensitivity . in dynamite , about one part of four is diatomaceous earth , the other three are nitroglycerin . a little sodium carbonate is added to stabilise the mixture . even though the diatomaceous earth takes away some of the dangers of nitroglycerin , there are still problems because the mixture is not stable in damp environments . dynamite that is damp , or even wet slowly loses its nitroglycerin . the nitroglycerin can build up , and explode unexpectedly . for this reason , the formulation was changed . instead of diatomaceous earth , gelignite was used to hold the nitroglycerin . gelignite holds the nitroglycerin so that it can not dissolve in water . today , dynamite is no longer used commercially . it has been replaced by explosives based on ammonium nitrate which use gelignite . these explosives are cheaper to produce , and easier to handle than dynamite . however , dynamite still used in movies and television .
