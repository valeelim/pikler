Cast iron     cast iron is an alloy of iron . the term is usually used for grey cast iron . there are two main types of cast iron : `` grey cast iron '' and `` white cast iron '' . the differences between the two are mainly based on the amount of silicon in the alloy . all cast iron has about 95 % iron in it . grey cast iron has 3 % silicon and 2 % carbon . white cast iron has less silicon . the silicon in grey cast iron causes the carbon to change into graphite . this causes it to have a dark grey or almost black color . with less silicon , the carbon in white cast iron changes to cementite or `` iron carbide '' ( fec ) . this causes white fractures to form on the surface and give white cast iron the name . grey cast iron is very good at conducting heat . because of this , it is often used to make cookware .
