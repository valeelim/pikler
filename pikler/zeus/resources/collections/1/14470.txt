Kilobyte     a kilobyte ( kb ) is a number used to measure storage space on computer hard drives or computer memory . a kilobyte originally meant 1000 bytes . over time the meaning changed and today it is often used to mean 1024 bytes . this created some confusion as a `` kilo '' normally means 1000. the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) now defines a kilobyte as being 1000 bytes . according to the iec , the correct name for 1,024 bytes is a kibibyte . one thousand kilobytes make one megabyte .
