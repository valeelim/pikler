Glue     glue is a sticky material ( usually a liquid ) that can stick two or more things together . glue can be made from plant or animal parts , or it can be made from oil-based chemicals . the first glues may have been natural liquids that come out of trees when they are cut . later , people learned to make glue by boiling animal feet , cartilage or bones . some very strong glues were first made from fish bones , rubber or milk . a simple glue can be made at home by mixing wheat flour and water . this glue will stick pieces of paper together . many kinds of art can be made using glue . a collage is a work of art made by using glue to stick coloured things onto paper . some glues can be used to keep water out of boats , buildings or vehicles . in this case the glue may be called caulk . some man-made materials , including wood-like materials , are made using glues to bind together small pieces of material or powders . while many glues are safe , certain kinds of glue contain strong-smelling chemicals . some people sniff these glues to get high . sometimes people breathe in the vapors by mistake . this is a very bad idea because these chemicals are often poisons and may cause brain damage or illness .
