Metronome     a metronome is a small object that can be used by people who are practising instruments to help them to play in time . it is also something a composer can use to show the performer what speed to play . a traditional metronome works by clockwork . it has a pendulum which makes a loud tick as it goes to and fro , like the pendulum of a grandfather clock . it has to be wound up after a few minutes of ticking . there is a weight on the pendulum which can be slid up or down and set to a particular speed . there are numbers on the metronome to which you can set it . these numbers mean the number of ticks per minutes . a speed of 60 will make it tick 60 times a minute ( i.e . every second ) . the numbers usually go from 40 ( slow ) to 208 ( very fast ) . nowadays many people use electronic metronomes . these are very accurate , do not need to be wound and often have other helpful things like an a to tune to ( see musical tuning ) . some of them are hardly bigger than a credit card . the metronome was invented by dietrich nikolaus winkel in amsterdam in 1812. a man called johann maelzel copied winkel â€™ s ideas and improved them . he made a small , portable metronome which was patented in 1816 .
