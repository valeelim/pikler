Civilization     civilization ( or civilisation ) comes from the latin word `` civis '' meaning someone who lives in a town . when people are civilised , they live in large well-organized groups like towns , not in small tribes or isolated family groups however , a civilization is something more than a town . it is an advanced stage of organisation . that means it has laws , culture , a regular way of getting food and protecting the people . most civilizations have agriculture , and a system of government like monarchs or elections . they speak a common language , and usually have a religion of some kind . they teach their young the knowledge they need . all civilizations since the sumerians and the egyptians have some kind of writing . writing lets people store and build up knowledge . the roman empire is an example of a large civilization . it was governed from rome . this empire once stretched from the scottish borders to north africa and the eastern mediterranean . they had their own language , latin . latin became the preferred method of communication among educated people until long after their civilization had vanished . today lawyers and politicians , doctors and scientists , scholars and others still use latin in the course of their everyday work , even though the roman civilization died out more than 1,500 years ago . it is said that william shakespeare excelled at latin . latin is still taught in some schools . we still admire and copy roman architecture , use roman numerals to count certain things , use the names of roman gods to mark the days and months of our calendars , name the constellations in the sky by the same names that the romans used and we model our western political constitutions and structures on roman models ( senate , governor , election , tribunal , justice , vote , census , even the word constitution , are all latin words , their meaning unchanged in thousands of years ) .
