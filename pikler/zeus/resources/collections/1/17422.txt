Antimatter     antimatter is a term in particle physics . antimatter is a material composed of antiparticles . these have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and properties , such as lepton and baryon number . encounters between particles and antiparticles lead to the destruction of both . this gives rise to high-energy photons ( gamma rays ) , neutrinos , and lower-mass particleâ€“antiparticle pairs . in physics , all the elementary particles , or the basic building blocks of the things we can touch , come in pairs . each particle has what is called an antiparticle . this may look and act just like the regular particle , except for one major difference . an example is the electron and the positron . they both weigh the same , and act the same , but the electron has a negative electrical charge , while the positron has a positive electrical charge , which is where the positron ( positive + electron ) gets its name . other antimatter particles are the same way , where they have the same weight , and look and act the same as regular particles , but their electrical charge is the opposite of regular particles . antihydrogen , for example , has the positron , which is positively charged , orbiting around an antiproton , which is negatively charged , which is the opposite way regular hydrogen looks , which has the electron ( negative charge ) , orbiting around a proton ( positive charge ) .
