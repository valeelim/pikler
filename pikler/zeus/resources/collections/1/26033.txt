Wii     the wii ( pronounced `` we '' ) is a video game console made by nintendo . it first came out on november 19 , 2006 , in north america . it plays video games made for the wii and the nintendo gamecube . it was succeeded by the wii u in 2012. nintendo , the company that made the wii , says they want to focus more on new ways to play games . the wii uses a controller , called the wii remote , that is very different from the controllers of other video game consoles . it can be held with just one hand , and uses technology that senses the player 's movements . by making the wii , nintendo says they are trying to change the way video games are looked at and played . the wii was made for all people of any age or interest . by making it easier to play , nintendo thinks that they can get people who do not normally play games to start playing . because of this , more people who have been playing video games for a long time ( that means that they are `` hardcore '' ) do not like the wii . cpu : `` broadway '' processor at 1 ghz gpu : ati `` hollywood '' at 243 mhz
