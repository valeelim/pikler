Paper     modern paper is a thin material of ( mostly ) wood fibres pressed together . people write on paper , and books are made of paper . paper can absorb liquids such as water , so people can clean things with paper . the pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood as raw material and produce pulp , paper , board and other cellulose-based products . modern paper is normally made from wood pulp . wood is ground up and mixed with water and other chemicals to make a thin liquid called `` paper pulp '' . paper pulp can be bleached to make paper more white , and dyes can be added to make colored paper . this pulp is pressed into sheets of paper . printing is often done on paper before the paper is cut into sheets . newsprint paper ( newspaper ) comes in a huge roll , and goes through the printing process as one continuous sheet . it is cut by a machine-driven guillotine blade later . folding comes last , then packing for distribution . sometimes paper is made heavier and more glossy ( shiny ) by adding clay , and by 'milling ' it . milling is done by squeezing the paper through a series of rollers . sometimes paper is made from used or waste paper : this is recycling .
