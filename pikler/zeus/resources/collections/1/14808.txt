Celsius     celsius ( more precisely , a degree celsius ) , sometimes called centigrade , is a unit of measurement used in many countries to measure temperature . this unit was created by anders celsius ( 1701–1744 ) , a swedish astronomer . 0 degrees ( ° ) celsius is the melting point of pure water at sea level ( `` normal pressure '' ) . 100° celsius is the boiling point of water at normal pressure . ( water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes ) . 1 °c is therefore one hundredth ( the 100th part ) of that difference . since 1948 , this unit has been called `` celsius '' . `` centigrade '' was the name of the unit before the change . `` centi '' meaning 1/100 , and `` grade '' being a scale . the other commonly used measurement of temperature is the fahrenheit scale . the celsius scale , based on multiples of ten , is used with si , or metric measurements . in 1742 , `` anders celsius '' ( 1701–1744 ) made a “ reversed ” version of the modern celsius temperature scale . in this scale , zero was the boiling point of water and 100 was the melting point of ice . in his paper `` observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer , '' he wrote about his experiments . he showed that the melting point of ice was basically unaffected by air pressure . ice would turn into water at the same temperature , whether it was at sea level or on a mountain . this was not the case for the boiling point of water . it would boil easier with less pressure ( on a mountain ) . he decided that zero on his temperature scale ( water ’ s boiling point ) would be set at the standard barometric pressure at sea level . this pressure is known as one atmosphere . in 1954 , resolution 4 of the 10th cgpm ( the general conference on weights and measures ) set what exactly is one standard atmosphere ( 101.325 kpa ) .
