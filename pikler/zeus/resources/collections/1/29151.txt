Anthem     an anthem is a piece of music written for a choir to sing at an anglican church service . the difference between an anthem and a motet is that an anthem is sung in english . also most anthems are accompanied by an organ . the word “ anthem ” has come to mean “ a song of celebration ” . this is why we also talk about national anthems . anthems for the church have been composed ever since king henry viii argued with the pope and did not want to be roman catholic any more . he founded ( started ) the english anglican church . church composers were told to write music in english . the words usually come from the bible . we know that as early as 1502 the composer fayrfax was paid 20 shillings for composing an anthem . after the reformation many anthems were composed . at first they were like motets , but in english . soon the english anthem developed differently from the continental motet . two kinds of anthem developed : the “ full anthem ” in which the whole anthem was sung by the full choir , and the “ verse anthem ” which was usually longer and had several verses which would be sung by soloists , with choruses for the full choir in between .
