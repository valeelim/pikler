Bandwidth     in electronics , bandwidth is used to measure electric communication . bandwidth is shown as the difference between the electric signal having highest-frequency and the signal having the lowest-frequency . in computer networks , bandwidth is often used as a term for the data transfer bit rate . more easily , the amount of data that is carried or passed from one point to another in a network , in a given time period ( usually a second ) . in music industry , it is the measurement used to define bands . many systems work by means of continuous movements , or oscillations . each complete `` back and forth '' it makes is called a cycle . the number of cycles every second is its frequency . frequency is measured in cycles every second , most often called `` hertz '' , or `` hz '' for short . systems have at least 1 frequency , and usually many different frequencies . for example , sound travels with vibrations . people can hear sound frequencies low as 20 hz , and high as 20,000 hz . a band of frequencies is a continuous range of frequencies ; the band of frequencies people can hear is from 20 hz to 20,000 hz .
