Pressure     pressure means how much something is pushing on something else . it is expressed as force per unit area : p=f/a in technology , pressure is often specified in multiples of atmospheric pressure . it can also be defined as the thrust [ compressive force acting perpendicularly to the surface of a body ] acting per unit area . since pressure depends on both force and area , the same amount of force applied by a hand will make less pressure than when applied by something smaller , like a finger . pressure is also related to density . by the ideal gas law , for example , doubling the pressure can put twice as much gas in a bottle . to measure the amount of pressure people use these units : - pounds per square inch - ( psi , psi , lb/in2 , lb/sq in ) . this u.s. customary units is not elsewhere . normal atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi , which means that a column of air one square inch in area rising from the earth 's atmosphere to space weighs 14.7 pounds . - atmosphere - atm . normal atmospheric pressure is called 1 atmosphere . 1 atm = 14.6956 psi = 760 torr .
