Perihelion     the perihelion is the point in the orbit of a planet , asteroid or comet where [ & when ] it is nearest to the sun . it is the opposite of aphelion , which is where [ & when ] the orbit of the object is farthest from the sun . the word perihelion stems from the greek words `` peri , '' meaning near , and `` helios , '' meaning the greek god of the sun . ( the similar word , perigee , refers to the nearest point in some object 's orbit of earth . ) all planets , comets and asteroids in our solar system have approximately elliptical ( a kind of non-circular ) orbits ( any single revolution of a body around the sun is only approximately elliptical , because the phenomenon known as precession of the perihelion prevents the orbit from being a simple closed curve such as an ellipse ) . thus , they all have a closest and a farthest point from the sun : a perihelion and an aphelion . orbital eccentricity measures the flatness of the orbit . earth comes closest to the sun every year around january 3. it is farthest from the sun every year around july 4. the difference in distance between earth 's nearest point to the sun in january and farthest point from the sun in july is 3.1 million miles ( 5 million kilometers ) . earth is about 91.4 million miles ( 147.1 million kilometers ) from the sun in early january , in contrast to about 94.5 million miles ( 152 million kilometers ) in early july .
