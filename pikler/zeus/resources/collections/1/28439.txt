Koala     koalas ( `` phascolarctos cinereus '' ) are herbivore marsupials that live in the eucalyptus forests of eastern australia . they are the only living species in the family phascolarctidae . koalas are often called the koala bears because it looks like a small bear or teddy bear . however , it is not a bear , it is quite a different type of animal . koalas have brownish-grey or silver-grey fur , and a big pink and/or black nose . they have sharp claws which help them to climb . koalas also have finger prints which look the same as human finger prints . finger print experts have had difficulty in being able to tell if the prints are from a human or koala . finger prints are rare among mammals that climb trees . scientists do not know why the koala has them , but their best guess is that it helps the koala select leaves to eat . koalas are mostly active at night . they live in trees and are rarely found on the ground . they eat leaves of eucalyptus trees . koalas do not drink often , they get most of their water from the eucalyptus leaves .
