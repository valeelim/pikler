Migration     migration is when animals move on a regular cycle . for example , caribou in the arctic go south in winter and return in summer when it is warmer . many birds migrate , such as geese and storks . migration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new habitat . the trigger for the migration may be local climate , local availability of food , or the season of the year . to be counted as a true migration , and not just a local dispersal , the movement should be an annual or seasonal event . many birds fly to warmer places for the winter , as do some insects such as the migratory locust . young atlantic salmon leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches ( cm ) in size . many species in the sea have a daily migration . plankton go up for the day where there is light , and down at night , where they are less easy to find . the many species which feed on them follow them up and down . migration is an evolutionary force . this is because it is a major source of natural selection . the success or failure of individual animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce .
