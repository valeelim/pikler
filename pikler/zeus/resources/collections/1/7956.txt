Weight     the weight of an object ( or the weight of an amount of matter ) is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field . weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass . for small objects on earth , the weight force is directed towards the center of the planet . for larger objects , such as the moon orbiting around the earth , the force is directed towards the center of mass of the combined system . in common language , the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the earth 's surface . unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds . for almost all of human history , weight has been measured on the surface of the earth . here , the weight is proportional to the mass . objects which have the same mass have the same weight . an object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight . as a consequence it is common practice to use the two words , mass and weight , as if they mean the same thing and to use kilograms and pounds as the units for both mass and weight . using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties , mass and weight . mass and weight are not the same thing .
