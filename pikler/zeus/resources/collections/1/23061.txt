Métis people     the métis ( pronounced 'may-tee ' in english and 'may-tees ' in french ) , also known as bois brule , mixed-bloods , or countryborn ( anglo-métis ) , are one of the three divisions of aboriginal peoples in canada according to the canadian government . their home land is in the canadian provinces of british columbia , alberta , saskatchewan , manitoba , ontario , quebec , new brunswick , nova scotia , as well as the northwest territories . the métis homeland also includes parts of the northern united states ( specifically montana , north dakota , and northwest minnesota ) . the métis nation are descendants of marriages of woodland cree , ojibway , saulteaux , mi'kmaq and menominee indians ( native americans ) with french canadian and/or british/celtic settlers . their history starts in the mid-1700 's in the west and starts in the early 1600 's in the east . historically , many ( but not all , only in the west ) métis spoke a mixed language called michif . `` michif '' is the métis pronunciation of `` métis '' . the métis today mostly speak english , with french as a strong second language , as well as many native language . the use of michif is growing again thanks to the work of the provincial métis councils .
