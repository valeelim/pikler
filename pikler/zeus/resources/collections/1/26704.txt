Anion     anions are atoms or radicals ( groups of atoms ) , that have gained electrons . since they now have more electrons than protons , anions have a negative charge . for example , chloride ions cl- , bromide br- , iodide i- . these are monovalent anions , meaning they have a combining capacity with only one ion of hydrogen . similarly there are bivalent anions , etc . anions are one of the two types of ions . the other type is called a cation , and have a positive charge . ions are atoms that have an electrical charge . anions are termed so because they are attracted towards the anode ( the positive electrode ) . all anions tend to accept a proton h+ thus they are categorized as bases . anions are one of the type of ions we have , the other one is a cation . anions are negatively charged , on the other hand cations are positively charged
