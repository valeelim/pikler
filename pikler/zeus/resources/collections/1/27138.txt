Loch Ness Monster     the loch ness monster , also referred to as nessie , is a supposed animal , said to live in the scottish loch of loch ness , the second biggest loch in the country . the loch ness monster story was big in the field of cryptozoology . most scientists believe that the loch ness monster is not real , and they say that many of the seeings are either hoaxes or pictures of other mistaken existing animals . however , a popular theory among believers is that `` nessie '' is a plesiosaur , an extinct meat-eating aquatic reptile that lived in the mesozoic era . the loch ness monster has also been described as an elephant , eel , and other animals . the surgeon 's photograph was the only photographic evidence of a head and neck â€“ all the others are humps or disturbances . dr. wilson claimed he was looking at the loch when he saw the monster , so grabbed his camera and snapped five photos . after the film was developed , only two exposures were clear . the first photo ( the more publicised one ) shows what was claimed to be a small head and back . the second one , a blurry image , attracted little publicity because it was difficult to interpret what was depicted .
