Windows 98     windows 98 is an operating system for computers . released on june 25 1998 by microsoft , it is an updated version of windows 95. windows 98 was seen by many as an upgrade to windows 95 , rather than a rebuilt version of windows . the biggest changes were : - larger disk partitions ( separations ) were allowed - internet explorer ( a web browser ) was made part of the gui ( what the user sees ) and file manager . this had already happened in the last versions of windows 95 that were released . this is called 'web integration ' . because microsoft made internet explorer such an important part of windows 98 , the company was taken to court by the united states government . this was because they felt it was unfair to other companies who made web browsers . it is not supported anymore , but many people still use it on older computers that will not run windows xp , windows vista , or windows 7. before the release of windows 98 , there was a press demonstration at comdex in april 1998. microsoft ceo bill gates was highlighting the operating system 's ease of use and enhanced support for plug and play ( pnp ) . when presentation assistant chris capossela plugged a scanner in and attempted to install it , windows 98 displayed a blue screen of death . gates remarked after applause and cheering from the audience , `` that must be why we 're not shipping windows 98 yet . '' video footage of this event became a popular internet phenomenon .
