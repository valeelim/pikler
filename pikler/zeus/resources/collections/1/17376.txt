Central processing unit     a central processing unit ( cpu ) is an important part of almost every computer . the cpu sends signals to control the other parts of the computer , almost like how a brain controls a body . the cpu is an electronic machine that works on a list of things to do , called `` instructions '' . it reads the list of instructions and does ( `` executes '' ) each one in order . a list of instructions that a cpu can run is a computer program . the speed that a cpu works at is measured in hertz ( hz ) . modern processors often run so fast that gigahertz ( ghz ) is used instead . one gigahertz is one billion cycles per second . most cpus used in desktop ( home ) computers are made by either intel or advanced micro devices ( usually shortened to amd ) . some other companies that make cpus are arm , ibm , and sun microsystems . most of their cpus are used in embedded systems for more specialized things , like in mobile phones , cars , game consoles , or in the military . in the 20th century engineers invented many different computer architectures . nowadays most desktop computers use either 32-bit cpus or 64-bit cpus . the instructions in a 32-bit cpu are good at handling data that is 32 bits in size ( most instructions `` think '' in 32 bits in a 32-bit cpu ) . likewise , a 64-bit cpu is good at handling data that is 64 bits in size ( and often good at handling 32-bit data too ) . the size of data that a cpu handles best is often called the `` word size '' of the cpu . many old cpus from the 70s , 80s and early 90s ( and some modern small cpus ) have an 8-bit or 16-bit word size . when cpus were invented in the middle 20th century they had many different word sizes . some had different word sizes for instructions and data . the less popular word sizes later stopped being used .
