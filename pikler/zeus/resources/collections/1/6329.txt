Temperature     temperature is how hot or cold a thing is . our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold . to measure temperature more accurately , a thermometer can be used . thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is . the scale most often used is in degrees celsius ( °c ) , sometimes called centigrade . in the usa , degrees fahrenheit ( °f ) are more often used while scientists mostly use kelvins ( k ) to measure temperature because it never goes below zero . scientifically , temperature is a physical quantity which describes how quickly molecules are moving inside a material . in solids and liquids the molecules are vibrating around a fixed point in the substance , but in gases they are in free flight and bouncing off each other as they travel . in a gas the temperature , pressure and volume of the gas are closely related by a law of physics . when they invented temperature scales scientists found there were certain things which were always around the same temperature :
