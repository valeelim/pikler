Chinook     a chinook is a warm westerly wind that sometimes flows over canada 's rocky mountains in the winter . it can raise temperatures in southern alberta by twenty or thirty degrees in an hour . a chinook is caused when air flowing off the pacific ocean is raised by the mountains and heated as the water vapor in the air condenses . then it is warmed more as it flows down the other side of the mountains and is compressed . it flows out over the prairie , and may travel as far as the eastern border of alberta if it is especially strong . the chinook is also called `` snow eater '' , because it can melt snow so quickly .
