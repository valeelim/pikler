Virgil     virgil , publius vergilius maro , or vergil , ( 15 october 70 bc 21 september 19 bc ) was a poet in the latin language . his poems are about gods and their mythology . virgil 's most famous epic poem is called the `` aeneid '' . tradition is that virgil was born in the village of andes , near mantua in cisalpine gaul . scholars looking at the way he used words think that he may have etruscan , umbrian or even a celtic background . study of his name has led to beliefs that his family may have been earlier roman settlers . these modern beliefs are not supported by evidence from his own writings or from writers of his biographies . some scholars have noted that his nickname , `` maro '' , is an anagram of the two main themes in the aeneid : `` amor '' ( love ) and `` roma '' ( rome ) .
