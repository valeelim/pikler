Ayyavazhi     ayyavazhi ( , `` path of the father '' ) , is a religion with one god that started in south india in the middle of the 19th century . the 'zhi ' ( ) in the word , 'ayyavazhi ' , is a retroflex , ri . ayyavazhi is not a part of hinduism , but since it was not considered a separate religion it was considered as a branch of hinduism only officially . it has evolved into a different religion , spreading in tamil nadu 's southern districts of kanyakumari , tirunelveli , and tuticorin . as one of the fastest growing religions of southern india , its growth had been noted in the christian missionary reports of the mid-19th century . the ideas and philosophy of the religion are based on the teachings of ayya vaikundar and the religious texts akilattirattu ammanai and arul nool . ayyavazhi began to be seen firstly by the large number of people gathering to worship ayya vaikundar at swamithoppe , which is at that time `` poovandanthoppe '' . the majority of the followers of ayyavazhi were from the poor group of the society . for the christian missionaries it gives a big challenge in their converting mission from its beginning . although the majority of these followers were from the chanar cast , apart from ayyavazhi sources , some outer sources too says that a large number of people from other castes also followed this religion .
