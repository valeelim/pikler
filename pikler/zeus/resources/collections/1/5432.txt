Cabal     a cabal is a group of people who try to control things in a secret way . sometimes people say `` there is no cabal '' , or use the abbreviation tinc to mean `` there is no cabal '' but since a cabal is necessarily secret , they can not know . one new example of the use of the word cabal is that the former chief of staff , lawrence wilkerson , of the secretary of state colin powell said that the foreign policy of george w. bush 's administration were run by a `` cheney-rumsfeld cabal '' . with this word he meant that the president had not really the power that he is given by the constitution and that the vice president and the secretary of defense had more influence than they should have .
