Vegetarianism     vegetarianism is the practice of not eating meat or fish . people who follow vegetarianism are called vegetarians . vegetarians eat foods like vegetables , fruit , nuts , beans and grains . some vegetarians eat or drink animal products , like milk and eggs . they are called lacto-ovo vegetarians . vegetarian people may like tofu , falafel and other meat substitutes . there are many reasons for not eating meat . some think that it is wrong to kill animals ; others think that eating meat is bad for their health or the world . this is because land used for animals can be used to grow food . some people may become vegetarians because their religion says not to eat animals . vegetarians who do not drink milk and eat eggs are called vegans . vegans also often will not use animal products like leather , but many vegetarians do use animal products . some people who call themselves vegetarians and eat fish or sea food are not vegetarians , because fish and sea creatures are also animals . such people are sometimes called `` pescetarians '' . there are also many people who are not vegetarians , but do not eat too much animal food . some eat only very little meat ( so-called `` flexitarians '' or `` semi-vegetarians '' ) , some eat only fowl ( `` pollotarians '' ) . there is also a philosophy called freeganism , it means eating animal products only if otherwise they will be thrown away to garbage - such as food thrown away by restaurants .
