Mantra     in hinduism and hindu mythology , mantra means a group of words . there are many such groups of words . some mantras have meanings . however , there are many mantras which are just syllables , with or without any words . such mantras do not carry meanings . from the ancient times , hindus , as well as in many cases , texts of buddhism and jainism contain many mantras . traditionally , people associate the mantras with various powers . however , it is more a matter of individual faith and experience than a fact of science . the earliest examples of mantras are many hymns and verses of vedas . people read them aloud . they thought that by doing so they would get the blessings of the gods and other beings . the system continued in hindu practices of worship and meditation . even now , many hindus believe in the power of mantras to gain health and wealth . mantras may form part of worship or people may simply recite them loudly or slowly . some time no recitation may take place , and the person would just think of the mantra silently for long time .
