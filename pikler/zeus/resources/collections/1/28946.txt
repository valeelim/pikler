Sonata     a sonata is a piece of music for one instrument or one instrument with another instrument accompanying . the word comes from the italian “ sonare ” which means “ to sound ” . a composer could call any solo instrumental piece “ sonata ” if he or she wants to , but usually a sonata is quite a long piece with several movements . a sonatina is a simple and short sonata . the term `` sonata '' was used in the 16th century to mean anything that was not sung . in the baroque period ( 17th and early 18th centuries ) many composers like arcangelo corelli wrote sonatas with several movements . there were two types : “ sonata da camera ” ( “ room sonata ” i.e . “ chamber sonata ” ) which were for playing in people ’ s homes , and “ sonata da chiesa ” ( “ church sonata ” ) which were for being played in churches . the first type would have harpsichord accompaniment and the second type organ accompaniment . there would also be a cello playing the bass line . the solo instrument might be a violin , flute , recorder or oboe . at the end of the baroque period domenico scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas for harpsichord . these are all short pieces in binary form ( two sections ) .
