Marxist economics     marxist economics comes from the ideas of a philosopher named karl marx applied to economics . he created it to explain the `` rules of motion '' of production and exchange under capitalism . this theory was used to argue against the middle class theories of economics common at that time . marx wanted this to be a tool for the working class ( the proletariat ) to use to overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism , then with communism . socialism , would be a step towards the disappearance of the state , and communism would be , according to marx , a society where goods and services would be distributed `` to each according to his need , from each according to his ability . '' marx used the labor theory of value , which says that the value of a commodity is determined by the labor required to produce it . more specifically , marx defined the value of a commodity as the socially necessary labor time required to produce it , the average ( taken across all of society ) time required to produce a given commodity under the average conditions of production . it follows from this that the [ working class ] is responsible for the production of all of the [ value ] ( wealth ) consumed by all members of society .
