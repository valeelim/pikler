Labradoodle     a labradoodle is a mixed-breed dog , created by breeding a labrador retriever with a poodle . labradoodles are now bred worldwide . labradoodles are not a considered an official dog breed by most dog expert organizations , such as the fédération cynologique internationale ( fci ) . the american kennel club ( akc ) has now created the 'canine partners '' category to include the labradoodle and other hybrid breeds for agility and other competitions . the labradoodle has a very short but interesting history . the labradoodle originated during the mid-to-late 1980s . a vision-impaired woman needed a good service dog that would not give her husband an allergic reaction . ms. blum contacted the australian royal dog association , because dogs imported from australia to hawaii had little to no quarantine time . ( quarantine time is when they isolate an animal from other living things to make sure they do n't have any disease ) coat and saliva samples from more than thirty poodles were sent from australia to blum 's doctor . unfortunately , mr. blum was allergic to all of the samples . wally conron , who worked for australia ’ s royal guide association 's breeding program , suggested crossing a labrador retriever and a standard poodle and see if one did n't trigger mr. blum 's symptoms . conron tried the test cross with a standard poodle named `` harley '' and a labrador retriever named `` brandy. ” harley and brandy had a litter of three puppies . coat and saliva samples from the puppy 's coats were sent to hawaii . this time , mr. blum was n't allergic to one of them . the puppy also had a good temperament and was very friendly . conron named the puppy `` sultan '' . conron trained sultan for eighteen months until he was ready to be a good service dog . sultan was then shipped to his new home . sultan is the first labradoodle on record .
