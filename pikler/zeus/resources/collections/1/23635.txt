Great Barrier Reef     the great barrier reef is the world 's largest coral reef . it is close to the coast of queensland , australia . it is made up of nearly 3000 coral reefs and over 600 islands . it is 327,800 kmÂ² big and 2600 km long . it has been listed an important world heritage site by unesco . the great barrier reef is the largest structure made by living things . it can be seen from outer space . the reefs are threatened . the biggest threat to the great barrier reef today is coral bleaching caused by high sea water temperatures as a result of global warming . during 2016 , the worst die-off ever recorded occured , due to seas warming around the great barrier reef . two-thirds of a 700-km ( 435 miles ) stretch of coral in nine months were killed . the reef research centre has found the remains of coral that are half a million years old . corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years . the corals have not always formed coral reefs . it is difficult to work out the age of the great barrier reef . this is because of the way a reef can grow and shrink as the sea level changes . a coral reef can grow in diameter , that is how wide they are , from 1 to 2 cm per year . they can also grow upwards from 1 to 15 cm per year . coral can not grow if the water is too deep ( 150 metres or more ) because it needs light from the sun . they can not grow out of the water ( above sea level ) .
