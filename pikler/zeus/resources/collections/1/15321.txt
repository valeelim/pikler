Polar bear     the polar bear ( `` ursus maritimus '' ) is a large bear which lives in the arctic . it is also called white bear or northern bear . it has black skin under the white fur . they are strong and fast , and can run as fast as 25 miles ( 40 km ) an hour for a short distance . polar bear fur is made up of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of `` guard hairs '' , which appear white to tan but are actually translucent . the fur keeps them very warm . the skin is not white ; it is black . therefore , they can absorb sunlight efficiently . they are strong and can swim very well . polar bears are similar in size to a normal bear but have a slimmer neck , longer legs and fur . they are mostly carnivorous . they eat mostly seals and fish . when polar bears hunt , they often wait at holes in the ice , where the seals come up to breathe . they can live off of one seal for many days , but it will make them hungry if they do . polar bears live alone . polar bears are black with clear fur , so in daylight , they appear white ; at night , they are invisible .
