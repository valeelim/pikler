John Knox     john knox ( c. 1510 â€“ 24 november 1572 ) was the man who brought the protestant reformation to scotland . he was one of the founders of the presbyterian church . knox joined the movement to change the roman catholic church in scotland . he married twice and had five children , and continued preaching until he died . a long-time fight between catholic france and protestant england for scotland began again because of the reformation . as the argument grew more heated , sometimes france had power , sometimes england . knox spent many months as a galley slave ; he also spent time in exile because of his protestant beliefs . during a return visit to his native land , knox 's preaching helped the protestant movement . several protestant noblemen came together and made a group called the lords of the congregation . when the group had more power , they invited knox back to scotland to stay . during 1500 and 1561 , the scottish parliament accepted the reformed confession of faith made by knox and other people . knox argued many times with mary , queen of scots . in his book `` history of the reformation in scotland '' he writes about his five `` conversations '' with the roman catholic queen . in one of these conversations , mary asked knox what right he had to the queen so directly and openly . knox replied , `` ... i am a worm of this earth , and yet a subject ... but i am a watchman , both over the realm ( land ) and the kirk [ church ] of god ... for that reason i am bound in conscience ( it is my duty ) to blow the trumpet publicly ( openly ) '' . mary 's violent life finally made even her catholic helpers lose their support . she gave up the throne . so , knox was able to make the protestant church in scotland . because of him , the presbyterian church was made .
