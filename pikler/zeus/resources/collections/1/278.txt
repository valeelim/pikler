Fecund universes     fecund universes is a multiverse theory of lee smolin . it relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology . in this theory , collapsing stars , or black holes , are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics . because these laws are only slightly different , each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe , as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism . it would reproduce by `` splitting '' in some sense . this theory relies on many models of our universe to model these `` mutated '' alternative universes , the ones that smolin supposes are generated or `` spun off '' by black holes . no human can ever be part of any of these `` other '' universes . observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common , and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes . smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see , since they are likely in a very late born universe , by simple probability . if there are many black holes , that is evidence for his theory ,
