Harmonic     a harmonic of a wave is the part of a signal 's frequency that is a whole multiple ( an integer ) of the fundamental frequency . the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform . if `` f '' is the fundamental frequency ( that is , 1 '' f '' ) , then the `` harmonics '' have frequencies 2 '' f '' , 3 '' f '' , 4 '' f '' ... , and so on . the second harmonic ( 2 '' f '' ) has a frequency twice that of the fundamental frequency , the third harmonic three times , and so on . this concept applies to wave motions of any form of energy , but is perhaps most often related to acoustics . frequencies that lie between one harmonic and another harmonic are called `` interharmonics '' . for example , 1â…“ '' f '' is an interharmonic between the fundamental frequency ( or first harmonic ) and the second harmonic . interharmonics is a term invented , or at least standardised , by the international electronics industry about 1999 , particularly for use in electrical energy . however , interharmonic frequencies also occur naturally in other radiant energies , for example music or any type of sound .
