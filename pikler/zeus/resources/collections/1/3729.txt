Beaker     a beaker is a kind of laboratory glassware . a beaker is a cylinder with a lip and a spout ( a bend in the rim of the beaker which makes it easier to pour liquids without spilling any ) . a beaker is usually about the same width as its height . this makes beakers very stable and easy to handle . they may be made of plastic , glass , or borosilicate glass . some beakers have marks on them to show about how much volume of liquid they hold - these can not be used for exact measurements . beakers are often used to make solutions and they are probably the most used piece of laboratory glassware .
