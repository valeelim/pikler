Tuba     the tuba is the biggest of all the brass musical instruments . they are the newest part of the symphony orchestra , first showing up in the mid-19th century . most orchestras have a tuba now . the standard tuba has about 16 feet of tubes . tubas are normally in the key of f , e '' b '' , cc , or bb '' b '' and can have 3 to 6 valves . because they are so big , some tubas have a `` compensating system '' . this means a fourth , fifth or sixth valve is used to make the instrument sound more in tune - especially the lowest notes . it takes a lot of breath to play the tuba . it is one of the loudest instruments in the orchestra but can also play very quietly . the tuba usually plays the bass ( lowest sounding ) part even though it can play relatively high as well . the tuba is used in all sorts of music and can be found in orchestras , wind bands , brass bands , jazz groups , pop groups , brass ensembles and even in tuba quartets ( in groups of 4 ) .
