Organic chemistry     organic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds that contain carbon . carbon has the ability to form a chemical bond with a wide variety of chemical elements and other carbon atoms . this allows a nearly unlimited number of combinations . the subject of carbon compounds is called organic chemistry because all known organisms , or living things , are made up of water and carbon compounds . organic chemistry largely involves the synthesis , or formation , of organic products by chemical reaction using different reactants and reagents , the substances used up during a reaction . several different areas of chemistry expand on the concepts and principles of organic chemistry , including biochemistry , microbiology , and medicine . the term organic originates from jons jacob berzelius , a 19th century swedish scientist , who used the term to refer to substances present in living things . during berzelius ’ time , the vital force theory was popular . this theory stated that a `` life force '' was needed to produce the organic compounds found only in living things . the vital force theory began losing support after an 1828 experiment conducted by friedrich wöhler . his work showed that urea , an organic compound , could be created from ammonium cyanate , an inorganic compound .
