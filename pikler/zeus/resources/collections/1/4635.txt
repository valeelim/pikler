Christopher Columbus     christopher columbus ( 1451–1506 ) was a genoese trader , explorer , and navigator . he was born in genoa , italy , in the year 1451 . `` christopher columbus '' is the english version of columbus 's name . his real name in italian was cristoforo colombo ; his name in spanish was cristóbal colón . in 1492 , columbus was trying to sail to asia . instead he landed in the bahamas . because of this , people often say that columbus discovered america . historians know now that this is not true . when the spanish learned that columbus had found a `` new world , '' many other people , called conquistadors , went there too . this led to the spanish colonization of the americas . columbus died on may 20 , 1506 , in valladolid , spain . columbus is often wrongly considered the first european person to have discovered america . this idea is wrong for many reasons . for example , the caribbean is not on the american mainland and columbus only found the mainland in 1498. even then he still said he had found parts of asia that the europeans did not know . also , the first european to find america was the viking leif erikson , around 1000 ad . finally , people do not agree that either erikson or columbus `` discovered '' america . native americans had been living there for thousands of years before them . these earlier discoverers did not change the world as columbus did .
