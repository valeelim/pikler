MP3     mpeg-1 and/or mpeg-2 audio layer 3 ( mp3 ) is a lossy data compression format for audio . using it makes smaller computer files containing digitized music and other sounds . the format is a lossy compression format . this means that each time something is compressed with it , some information is lost . this information can not be recovered . when encoding to mp3 ( converting some audio data to it ) , the encoder is smart . the human ear can not hear certain sounds if they are masked by other sounds . this means that when encoding certain sound samples , some sounds can be left out ( as they will not be heard ) . this makes it possible to compress audio by a factor of about 5 , without noticeable change to the sound of the music . with slight audible changes to the sound , compression factors of about 10 are possible . many people like to use mp3 files to copy music so they can listen to it on their computer . record companies do not like it when people use the internet to share these mp3 files with each other . they think it is a violation of their copyright . the record industries have a trade group called the riaa that has taken people to court for sharing music . an internet website called napster was shut down because of this . napster has since re-opened , but does not let people share mp3 files anymore .
