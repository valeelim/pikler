Animal     animals are eukaryotic organisms with many cells . they do not use light to get energy as plants do . the study of animals is called zoology . animals use different ways to get energy from other living things . they usually eat other living things , but some are parasites or have photosynthetic protists as symbionts . plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms , but most animals are mobile , meaning they can move around . animals take in oxygen , and give out carbon dioxide . this cellular respiration is part of their metabolism ( chemical working ) . in both these ways they are different from plants . also , the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi . there are many types of animals . the common animals most people know are only about 3 % of the animal kingdom . when biologists look at animals , they find things that certain animals have in common . they use this to group the animals in a biological classification . they think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million .
