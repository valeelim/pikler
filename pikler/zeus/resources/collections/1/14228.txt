Clarinet     the clarinet is a woodwind instrument . the clarinet has one reed . the reed is made of bamboo or plastic . the reed is attached to the mouthpiece with a clamp called a `` ligature '' , which is usually made out of metal . blowing through the mouthpiece makes the reed vibrate , and therefore makes the noise . the body of the clarinet is a cylindrical tube with holes . the holes are covered by the fingers to make musical notes . there are also buttons pressed by the fingers which allow pads over holes to open or close so all notes of the chromatic scale can be played . one kind of keyed clarinet is called the albert . another kind is called the system . the boehm clarinet is much used by classical orchestras and by jazz musicians . in north america and other western countries , the most popular clarinet is the clarinet pitched in b flat . this means that if a clarinet player plays a note that is written as a c , it sounds like a b flat on a piano . the b flat clarinet is used in concert , marching , and school bands . musicians in orchestras also play the a-clarinet ( a semitone lower ) , the sopranino e flat clarinet ( a fourth higher ) and the bass_clarinet in b flat ( sounding an octave lower ) .
