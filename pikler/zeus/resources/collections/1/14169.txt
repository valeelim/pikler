Taliban     the taliban is an islamic militant group operating in afghanistan and western pakistan . in the late 1990s it made a government , the islamic emirate of afghanistan . it was formed in 1994 in southern afghanistan and was helped by pakistan and saudi arabia . the taliban governed afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. during this time , its leaders put in place the strictest forms of sharia law ever seen in the muslim world ! much criticism of the taliban came from important muslim scholars . for example , if a thief was caught stealing something the taliban would cut-off one of his hands so that he does not use it to steal again , no matter what it was that he stole ! many criminals were put to death fast and without a fair trial . anyone who refused to follow the law was considered a non-muslim enemy . every male had to go to mosque for prayer ( except afghan non-muslims ) during praying times , which is 5 times daily . the taliban became known around the world for their very bad treatment of women .
