Fever     a fever is when a person 's body temperature is hotter than 38.5 degrees celsius ( 99.5 fahrenheit ) . normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors , including age and level of physical activity . it is typically cited as 37 degrees celsius ( 98.6 f ) , but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees celsius . the actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement . for a temperature taken from under the tongue , the measurement may be lower . rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 c ( 0.55 f ) higher , and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower . when people are ill , their body 's immune system fights the disease , and so the body temperature rises . fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs : the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises . about 38 °c ( 100.4 f ) degrees is called a low-grade fever , and above 39 °c ( 103 f ) degrees is a high-grade fever . children usually have a higher fever than adults ; their immune system is less mature . infants have the highest normal temperature , which decreases as people age . some animals , especially small ones like rabbits and cats , also have a higher normal temperature than humans .
