Nuclear physics     nuclear physics is the part of physics that studies the nucleus of the atom . everything on the earth is made up of atoms ; they are the smallest part of a chemical element that still has the properties of that specific element . when two or more atoms combine they create what we know as the molecule , which is the smallest part of a chemical compound which still has the properties of that specific compound . understanding the structure of atoms is key in studies such as physics , chemistry , biology , etc . atoms are made up of electrons , neutrons , and protons . the protons and neutrons are in the center of the atom , which is called the nucleus . the protons and neutrons are the heaviest part of the atom and make up most of its mass . the electrons move around the nucleus very quickly , making what is called an electron cloud . the electron cloud has a very small mass , but it makes up most of the space of the atom . the electrons have a negative charge , and the protons have a positive charge . due to the charges in the atom , that is how the atom stays together , by attraction of the electric charges present in the atom .
