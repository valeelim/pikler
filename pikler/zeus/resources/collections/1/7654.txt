Noah     noah ( meaning rest or comfort ) is a man in the abrahamic religions . he was the son of lamech , and the father of sons , shem , ham , and japheth . noah and his ark is in the book of genesis , which also describes noah as the 'first man to plant a vineyard ' ( chapter 9 ) . several other parts of the bible mention him , as does the quran . as described in the book of genesis , noah and his family kept believing in god in a time when most people were not . knowing this was true , god told noah he was going to flood the world , so he could drown out evil . he told noah to build a boat called an `` ark '' . noah was to put himself , his family , and two ( a male and a female ) of every kind of animal on it . people laughed at noah , but they were killed by the flood . noah and family stayed on the ark until they reached land . to find land noah sent out a dove , which returned with an olive branch . after the flood , god made a rainbow as a promise to say that he would never destroy the earth by flood again . when they were able to walk on dry land , the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth .
