Federal Reserve     the federal reserve ( sometimes called `` the fed '' ) is a large central bank in washington , d.c. that was founded in 1913. it lends money to other , smaller banks . the `` federal reserve board '' is a group of financial leaders who work for the federal reserve and decide how much to charge these banks for borrowing money ( this charge is called an `` interest rate '' ) . the federal reserve interest rate is decided by the federal reserve board after studying the condition of the us economy . when the economy is growing too fast , the federal reserve makes borrowing more expensive by increasing the interest rate , which means people and companies spend less , which discourages inflation . when economic growth slows , the interest rate is decreased so that borrowing will increase and there will be growth .
