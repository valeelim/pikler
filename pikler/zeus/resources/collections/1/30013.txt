2003 invasion of Iraq     the 2003 invasion of iraq ( march 20 , 2003 - may 1 , 2003 ) was the war fought by the united states , the united kingdom , australia , and some other countries against iraq , to end the rule of saddam hussein . the main reason that the war started was because the british and american governments believed that iraq had dangerous weapons of mass destruction ( such as chemical or nuclear weapons ) that could be used against other countries . this turned out after the invasion to not be true . another reason for the start of the war was that many people thought that abu musab al-zarqawi , one of the leaders of al-qaeda , was hiding in iraq after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . though saddam hussein was not involved in the planning of the september 11 attacks , many people accused him of giving al-qaeda a safe place to hide from the united states . the war was extremely controversial and led to a lot of negative feeling towards british prime minister tony blair and the american president , george w. bush .
