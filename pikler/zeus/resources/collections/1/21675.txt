Chinese postman problem     the chinese postman problem is a mathematical problem of graph theory . it is also known as route inspection problem . suppose there is a mailman who needs to deliver mail to a certain neighbourhood . the mailman is unwilling to walk far , so he wants to find the shortest route through the neighbourhood , that meets the following criteria : - it is a closed circuit ( it ends at the same point it starts ) . - he needs to go through every street at least once . if the graph travelled has an eulerian path , this circuit is the ideal solution . alan goldman of the u.s. national bureau of standards first coined the name 'chinese postman problem ' for this problem , as it was originally studied by the chinese mathematician mei-ku kuan in 1962. other websites . - chinese postman problem ( at mathworld )
