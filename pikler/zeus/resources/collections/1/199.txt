Dimension     dimensions are the way we see , measure and experience our world . by using up and down , right to left , back to front , hot and cold , how heavy and how long as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics . one way to define a dimension is to look at the degrees of freedom or the way an object can move in a specific space . there are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitions . there is no definition that can satisfy all concepts . in a vector space , ( a vector is an opened ended line ) a dimension is equal to the cardinality or number of directions of vectors or lines . it is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space . `` normal '' objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions , which are usually called length , width and depth . mathematicians call this concept euclidean space . dimensions can be used to measure position too . the distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length , width and height directions . these distances are a measure of the position .
