Virus     a virus is a microscopic parasite which can infect living organisms and cause disease . it can make copies of itself inside another organisms cells . viruses consist of nucleic acid + a protein coat . usually the nucleic acid is rna ; sometimes it is dna . viruses reproduce by getting their nucleic acid strand into a prokaryote or eukaryote cell . the rna or dna strand then takes over the cell machinery to reproduce copies of itself and the protein coat . the cell then bursts open , spreading the newly created viruses . all viruses reproduce this way , and there are no free-living viruses . viruses are ubiquitous ( everywhere ) in the environment , and all organisms can be infected by them . viruses are much smaller than bacteria . they were not visible until the invention of the electron microscope . a virus has a simple structure . it has no internal cellular structure , no cell wall or cell membrane , just the protein coat that holds the string of nucleic acid . with eukaryote cells , the virus ' protein coat is able to enter the target cells via certain cell membrane receptors . with prokaryote bacteria cells , the bacteriophage physically injects the nucleic acid strand into the host cell .
