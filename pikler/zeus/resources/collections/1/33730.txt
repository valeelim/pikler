Genetic engineering     genetic engineering ( ge ) , also called genetic modification , is a branch of applied biology . it is the changing of an organism 's genome using biotechnology . these methods are recent discoveries . the techniques are advanced , and full details are not given here . this is an overview of what can be done : - new dna may be inserted in the host genome by getting a dna sequence , and then putting this into the host organism by using a molecular biology vector . - genes may be removed , or `` knocked out '' , using an enzyme called a zinc finger nuclease . - gene targeting is a different technique which uses recombination to change a gene . it can be used to delete a gene , remove exons , add a gene , or introduce mutations . an organism that is altered by genetic engineering is a genetically modified organism ( gmo ) . the first gmos were bacteria in 1973 ; gm mice were made in 1974. insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982. genetically modified food has been sold since 1994 , including crops .
