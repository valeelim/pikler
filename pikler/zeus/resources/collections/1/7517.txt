Calendar     a calendar is a tool used to decipher the time of an event and for planning things that have not happened yet . this is done using days , called calendar dates . the `` dates '' are usually made based on how things in the sky seem to move . the year and month are based on motions of the sun and moon . by knowing what day something happened or will happen , people have an easier life . calendar systems have a beginning time or era . the era is often a religion-based event , such as the birth of jesus , but it may be a political event such as a coronation or the founding of a state . dates that are counted from the coronation are called `` regnal '' . the three principal calendars most used today are the gregorian , jewish , and islamic calendars . other calendar systems from many different parts of the world are also used . related pages . - anno domini ( ad ) - common era ( ce ) - friday ( muslim ) - saturday ( jewish ) - sunday ( christian ) - gregorian calendar ( christian ) - jewish calendar ( jewish ) - islamic calendar ( muslim )
