Harmony     harmony means playing several notes together to make “ chords ” . the word comes from the greek `` harmonia '' meaning `` to join things up '' . a tune by itself can sound nice , but it can be “ harmonized ” by adding an accompaniment of chords . studying how to do this is called harmonization . music students learn which chords sound nice after one another . these are called “ chord progressions ” . many music theorists have written books about harmony . music which is made of a tune with harmony underneath is called “ homophonic ” . in a way it is the opposite of polyphonic which means that each part ( each voice ) is a tune in itself . however , even polyphony needs to make pleasant harmony . harmony as we know it in european music had become fully developed by the baroque period ( 17th century ) . one can play a chord with three notes using the 1st , 3rd and 5th notes of the scale of the whatever key the music is in . this gives a chord which sounds like the “ home chord ” . this means that at least three notes are needed for harmony . in most homophonic music there are four : for example a choir will normally divide into soprano , alto , tenor and bass , or a string quartet will divide into violin 1 , violin 2 , viola and cello .
