Cruise ship     a cruise ship ( or cruise liner or ocean liner ) is a large ship with sleeping cabins and other facilities that takes people on holiday and vacation trips . hundreds of thousands of people take cruises each year . today 's cruise ships are like floating hotels . they have a complete `` hospitality staff '' ( to serve food and help passengers in other ways ) as well as the usual ship 's crew . the largest cruise ships have casinos , shops , many restaurants , theaters for both live entertainment and movies , several pools , day care , a gym , and a running track . the most expensive cruises often have more crew and staff than passengers . this means that the people who control the cruise can give many personal services . today , hundreds of cruise ships sail all over the world . some carry over 3,000 passengers . these are some of the largest ships ever built . for some places , such as antarctica , because it lacks other methods of regular transport , cruise ships are one of the few ways for tourists to visit .
