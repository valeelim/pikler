Star     a star is a giant ball of very hot gas . that gas is called plasma . stars are held together by gravity . they give out heat and light because they are so hot . stars are hot because nuclear reactions happen inside them . those reactions are called nuclear fusion . nuclear fusion makes light and heat and makes bigger and bigger chemical elements . stars have a lot of hydrogen . nuclear fusion changes hydrogen into helium . when a star gets old , it starts to change the helium into other bigger chemical elements , like carbon and oxygen . fusion makes a lot of energy . the energy makes the star very hot . the energy produced by stars moves ( radiates ) away from them . much of the energy leaves as light . the rest leaves as other kinds of electromagnetic radiation . the star nearest to earth is the sun . the energy from the sun supports almost all life on earth by providing light for plants . plants turn the light into energy in a process called photosynthesis . the energy from the sun also causes weather on earth .
