Mandarin Chinese     mandarin is the language of government and education of china and taiwan , with the notable exceptions of hong kong and macau where a local dialect of chinese called cantonese is more often used . mandarin is one of five major regional languages of china . it spreads wider than any other regional language , from the whole northern part of china down to yunnan province in the southwest corner of china . in that big area there are many regional differences in vocabulary , so somebody who moves from beijing to yunnan could not understand people there who were speaking their own language , yunnanhua . the problem is bigger than for a person in great britain or the united states to go to australia . therefore , starting in the 1920s , the chinese government set up a national language based on the beijing dialect and on the most widely understood words and pronunciations . mandarin is a standard language . it is nobody 's native language , but a good average between various language forms and a common language everyone can understand and communicate with . although it is based on the beijing dialect , it is not the same as beijing dialect .
