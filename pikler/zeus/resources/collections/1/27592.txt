Code     a code is a way of changing information into something else . sometimes this is done as a way of keeping a message secret . this is called encryption or cryptography . one source gives this explanation : a code is `` a word , number or some other symbol used to represent a word , phrase or syllable in plaintext '' . it is one of the earliest forms of cryptography . contrast code with cypher , in which the individual letters are encrypted ( changed ) . sometimes it is done as an easier way of sending a message . for example , when people on two different boats want to send a message , they may be too far away to shout , but they can send messages with a flag code . another code that people use is called morse code , which changes letters to dots and dashes , like this : computers use codes , by changing letters into 1 's and 0 's . this is called an ascii code . some people write codes as a kind of game . they think it is fun to make ciphers , and fun to break them . breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works , and then you can understand messages that are written in that code . cryptanalysis is also serious business . nations and other organizations have been breaking each other 's ciphers for many centuries .
