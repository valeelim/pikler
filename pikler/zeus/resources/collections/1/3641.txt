Month     a month is an amount of time used with calendars . it is about one twelfth of a year . it is a little longer than a natural period of the moon , 29.53 days . in some cultures , the idea for months came from moon phases . people have counted days based on moon phases for a very long time . months of some calendars are still strongly based on the moon . these are called `` lunar calendars '' . others , called `` solar calendars '' , ignore the moon , and depend entirely on the sun â€” for example , the gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days ( twelve months ) used in much of the world today .
