Economy of India     the economy of india is the 6th largest in the world with a gdp ( a year 's goods and services ) of $ 2.30 trillion ( u.s. ) . if you consider ppp ( purchasing power parity : how much that money can buy in india compared to other countries ) , the economy is third largest ( worth $ 8.52 trillion u.s. ) . however due to india 's huge population , the economy was still only $ 6,209 ( considering ppp ) per person per year in 2015. india 's economy includes agriculture , handicrafts , industries , and a lot of services . services are the main source of economic growth in india today , though two-thirds of indian people earn their living directly or indirectly through agriculture . in recent times , due to its large number of well-educated people who can speak english , india became a pioneer in information technology . for most of india 's independent history , it had strict government controls in many areas such as telecommunications ( communication over long distances ) , banking and foreign direct investment . since the early 1990s , india has slowly opened up its markets by reducing government control on foreign trade and investment.this was started by manmohan singh under the leadership of p.v.narasimha rao.from then , the indian economy grew at a rapid pace .
