Movement     movement , or motion , is the state of changing something 's positionâ€”that is , changing where something is . a flying bird or a walking person are moving , because they change where they are from one place to another . there are many kinds of science and math related to movement . for example , thanks to albert einstein , we know that all `` position '' is relative . this means that everything 's position depends on where they exist in relation to other things . for example , a ball is 5 feet away from a box , 3 feet away from a chair , and a foot away from a table . according to einstein , the ball 's position means how far the ball is from other things , so by telling you how far the ball was from other things , i told you its position . an object 's `` movement '' is also relative . its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it 's going to in relation to other things . there are many things involved in movement , such as speed , velocity , acceleration , gravity , magnetic attraction and repulsion , friction , and inertia . also , work is needed to produce movement . light moves at about 300,000 kilometres per second or 186,000 miles per second .
