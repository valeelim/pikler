Atom     an atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter . there are many different types of atoms , each with its own name , mass and size . these different atoms are called chemical elements . the chemical elements are organized on the periodic table . examples of elements are hydrogen and gold . atoms are very small , but the exact size changes depending on the element . atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers in width . one nanometer is about 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair . this makes atoms impossible to see without special tools . equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms . atoms join together to make molecules : for example , two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule . when atoms join together it is called a chemical reaction . every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles , called protons ( which are positively charged ) , neutrons ( which have no charge ) and electrons ( which are negatively charged ) . the protons and neutrons are heavier , and stay in the middle of the atom . they are called the nucleus . they are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus . this attraction is called electromagnetic force .
