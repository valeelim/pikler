Camembert cheese     camembert cheese , more generally known as camembert , is a french soft cheese . it originated in the village of camembert in normandy . since 1983 , the name `` camembert de normandie '' has been protected as appellation d'origine control√©e ( aoc ) . camembert is made from unpasteurized cow 's milk , and is ripened by the moulds `` penicillium candida '' and `` penicillium camemberti '' for at least three weeks . it is produced in small rounds , about 250 grams in weight , which are wrapped in paper and boxed in thin wooden boxes . when fresh , it is quite crumbly and relatively hard , but it characteristically ripens and becomes more runny and strongly flavoured as it ages . camembert can be used in many dishes , but it is popularly eaten uncooked on bread or with wine or meat , to enjoy the subtle flavour and texture which do not survive heating . camembert was reputedly invented in 1791 by marie harel , a farmer from normandy . however , the origin of the cheese we know today as camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialisation of the cheese-making process at the end of the 19th century . in 1890 , an engineer , m. ridel invented the wooden box which was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances , in particular to america where it became very popular . these boxes are still used today .
