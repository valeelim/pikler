FIFA World Cup     the fifa world cup is the most watched tournament in football ( soccer ) . the fédération internationale de football association ( fifa ) puts together the world cup every four years . more people watch the world cup finals than any other sporting event in the world—even more people than the olympic games . the most successful team has been brazil . the `` finals tournament '' is held every four years . on the other years there are only qualifiers ( qualifying tournaments ) . these games help to decide which teams will move on . over 160 national teams play in the beginning games . the best teams from the beginning games win a place in the finals . the finals now include 32 teams . before 1998 , only 24 teams were in the finals . many years before each world cup , fifa picks the host nation , the country where the finals will be held . being the host nation means that their team has qualified for the finals tournament automatically and does not need to play any qualifying games . the 32 teams in the finals then play for four weeks , usually between june and july , to decide the champion ( tournament winner ) .
