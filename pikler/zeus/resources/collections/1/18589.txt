Nile     the nile ( `` an-nīl '' ) is a river in africa . it is the longest river on earth ( about 6,650 km or 4,132 miles ) , though other rivers carry more water . it flows into the mediterranean sea near alexandria . it gets its name from the greek word νεῖλος `` neilos '' . the white nile flows from lake victoria in uganda , and through sudan to khartoum , where it is joined by the blue nile to form the nile , then through egypt . the blue nile flows through ethiopia . about 300 million cubic metres of water flow down the nile each day . the nile is very important to the countries where it flows . on the nile there are lots of boats because it was one of the easiest ways to get around . because of this , many cities in egypt were built next to the river . also , the pyramids are close to the nile . the nile has always provided most of the water used to grow crops in egypt and for anything else , since much of the rest of the country is in a desert . the nile was very important to ancient egyptians . in ancient times the nile flooded every year and the people would starve if there was not enough water for the crops . the ancient egyptians got papyrus from the nile .
