Arachnid     the arachnids are a class of eight-legged arthropods . they are a highly successful group of mainly terrestrial invertebrates : spiders , scorpions , harvestmen , ticks , and mites , and a number of smaller groups . almost all adult arachnids have eight legs , and arachnids may be easily distinguished from insects by this fact , since insects have six legs . however , arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages that have become adapted for feeding , defense , and sensory perception . the first pair , the chelicerae , serve in feeding and defense . the next pair of appendages , the pedipalps have been adapted for feeding , locomotion , and/or reproductive functions . like all arthropods , arachnids have an exoskeleton . they also have an internal structure of cartilage-like tissue , to which certain muscle groups are attached . arachnids have no antennae or wings . their body is organized into two parts : the cephalothorax , and the abdomen . there are some adaptations for life on land . they have internal respiratory surfaces . these may be trachea ( tubes ) , or a modification of gills into a 'book lung ' . this is an internal series of lamellae used for gas exchange with the air .
