Ethanol     ethanol , also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol , is a flammable , colorless chemical compound . drinks with 0.5 % or more ethanol are called alcoholic . when people talk about it , they often name it simply as `` alcohol '' . its chemical formula is choh , also written as cho . it is used as a solvent because it can dissolve many other chemicals and is not very toxic . yeast make most of the ethanol that people use . ethanol fuel can be used instead of gasoline in cars and other engines . engines can use pure ethanol or ethanol mixed with gasoline . in brazil , ethanol fuel made from sugar cane provides 18 percent of the country 's fuel for cars . because of this , brazil does not have to buy oil from other countries . to do this , brazil cut down much of the rain forests to grow more sugar cane , which is then fermented into ethanol . most cars in the u.s. can run on fuels that have of up to 10 % ethanol in them . car makers like ford , daimlerchrysler , and gm also make vehicles run that run higher ethanol blends . some of their engines can run on up to 85 % ethanol ( e85 ) . by mid-2006 , there were about six million e85-compatible vehicles on u.s. roads .
