Hiroshima     hiroshima ( 広島 ) is the capital city of hiroshima prefecture . it is the largest city in the chugoku region of western japan . about a million people live in hiroshima . at the time of the attack , hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd general army and 5th division , containing 40,000 japanese soldiers within the city 's limit , and was a beehive of war industry , which manufactured parts for planes and boats , bombs , rifles , and handguns , where children were shown how to construct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound and bedridden were assembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of kyushu . as with other japanese cities , many of the strategic targets in hiroshima were mixed with wooden and paper civilian homes and centers , which made it harder to conduct a successful precision attack , owing to the highly inaccuracy of the bombing technology in world war ii . as a result , the city became the first nuclear weapon used against a target in history . the bomb exploded over hiroshima at 8:16 on the morning of august 6 , 1945. much of the city was destroyed . an estimated 70,000 persons , of whom 20,000 were japanese soldiers and 20,000 were korean slave laborers , were killed , and another 70,000 were injured . the bomb was nicknamed `` little boy '' after president theodore roosevelt . a building near the blast center still remains and is called the atomic bomb dome .
