Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia     haile selassie i of ethiopia ( july 23 , 1892 - august 26 , 1975 ) was the emperor of ethiopia . he is also known as the religious symbol for god incarnate ( in the flesh ) among members of the rastafari movement , who call themselves by his name before becoming emperor - ras tafari . tafari was made into local governor of sidamo in 1907 , and harar province in 1911. as governor of harar , he had a huge following , but he agreed not to remove lij iyasu from power as regent , in exchange for lij iyasu not removing him as governor of harer . however , iyasu became a muslim , and also he did try to remove tafari as governor , breaking the agreement . tafari said that now the agreement was broken , he did not have to keep it either , and so he did remove iyasu as regent . because iyasu had gone over to islam , the nobles replaced him with empress zauditu on september 27 , 1916 and made tafari regent . from this time onward , he controlled ethiopia . he was made `` negus '' ( king ) in 1928 , and was crowned `` haile selassie i , king of kings of ethiopia , conquering lion of the tribe of judah , elect of god '' on november 2 , 1930. his coronation was given widespread publicity throughout the world , especially through two time magazine articles in a row . this publicity created interest on the far-away island of jamaica , where a belief in his divinity ( godliness ) soon arose because of his titles , and because they saw him as a symbol of black liberation .
