Chloroplast     chloroplasts are small organelles inside the cells of plants and algae . they absorb light to make sugar in a process called photosynthesis . the sugar can be stored in the form of starch . chloroplasts contain the molecule chlorophyll , which absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis . in addition to chlorophyll , a chloroplast uses carbon dioxide ( co ) and water ( ho ) to form sugar and gives off oxygen ( o ) . chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour . chloroplasts also contain various yellow and orange pigments to assist in photon capture for photosynthesis . each chloroplast is surrounded by a double walled semi-permeable membrane . in the layered stacks are flat disk-shaped thylakoids . they contain light-absorbing pigments , including chlorophyll and carotenoids , as well as proteins which bind the pigments . like mitochondria , chloroplasts also contain their own dna and ribosomes . chloroplasts are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell . they are thought to have originated as endosymbiotic cyanobacteria . this was first suggested by mereschkowsky in 1905 after an observation by schimper in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resembled cyanobacteria . almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event .
