Salamander     salamanders are amphibians . they are the order caudata ( or urodela ) . there are about 500 different species . salamanders live in water and on land , and look rather like lizards , with four legs and a tail . they hatch as larvae from eggs in the water . at that stage , they have gills that stick out . most salamanders live on land when they are adults , after their change of shape ( metamorphosis ) . on land , salamanders live in moist habitats . their method of respiration varies . some salamanders stay in the water , but look like adults . these are called newts . some salamanders retain gills into sexual maturity , such as the axolotl . this process is called neoteny . often , salamanders may have a chemical defence to predators ; they are poisonous to eat . in this case , they will have warning colouration . otherwise , if not poisonous , they will usually have camouflage . salamanders are the only tetrapods able to regenerate limbs , as well as other body parts . respiration differs between species of salamanders . species that lack lungs respire through gills . in most cases , these are external gills , visible as tufts on either side of the head , although the amphiumas have internal gills and gill slits . some salamanders that are terrestrial have lungs that are used in respiration , although these are simple and sac-like , unlike the more complex organs found in mammals . many species , such as the olm , have both lungs and gills as adults .
