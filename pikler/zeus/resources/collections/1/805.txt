Soul     many philosophies and religions say that a soul is the part of a living human being which is supernatural and lives after death . it can not be discovered by science , because it can not be tested in any controlled way . many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death . most atheists say that there is no such thing as a soul , and that the body is the only part of a person . in popular culture , soul usually means deep feeling and commitment . it is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music . however that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious . one popular idea about souls that is easy to express , is that a person `` is '' a soul , and `` has '' a body . the soul is the `` i '' in `` i exist '' that feels and lives life . what people call the mind could be `` part '' of the soul : one soul started this article , other souls have edited it , and another soul is reading it . this view , however , implies that the human body is a possession , and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker ( some people say that animals , heretics , and people of another religion do not have souls ) . like most uses of the verb to be , there is an ideology in these simple words .
