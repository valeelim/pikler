Exclave     an exclave is strip of land that belongs to a political entity ( like a country or a region ) but that is not connected to it by land ( islands are not counted ) . the strip of land is surrounded by other political entities . a good example is kaliningrad oblast ( the region around the russian city kaliningrad ) . it belongs to the russian federation , but is separated from the rest of that country by territory belonging to lithuania and poland . although both meanings are close , an exclave might not be an enclave . an enclave is completely surrounded by one other country . for example , kaliningrad is surrounded not by one state , but by two : lithuania and poland . it also borders the baltic sea . it is not an enclave . on the other hand , the spanish exclave of llivia is an enclave in france . many exclaves today have some of idea of becoming independent , especially if the exclave is far away from the mainland . a much more obscure use means , in medical discussion , a detached part of an organ , as of the pancreas , thyroid , or other gland .
