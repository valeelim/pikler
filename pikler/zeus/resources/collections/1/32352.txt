Polyp     polyps are one of two forms of the cnidarians . the other body form is the medusa . polyps have a vase-shaped body with tentacles around the mouth opening . polyps may be sexual or asexual . they can all reproduce asexually by budding . in some species , the polyps can also reproduce sexually . when medusae mate , the result may be polyps , when polyps replicate , the result may be medusae . the details vary between species . some species are polyps all the time ( such as `` hydra '' , and the whole of the class anthozoa ( corals and anemones ) . in many cases the asexual buds formed do not separate from the parent but remain , thus forming colonies or 'stocks ' . these may reach a great size , and contain a vast number of individuals . slight differences in the method of budding produce great variations in the form of the colonies . the reef-building corals are polyp-colonies , strengthened by the formation of a firm skeleton . jellyfish ( class medusozoa ) have two distinct life history stages ( body forms ) during their life cycle . the first is the polyp stage . often , this polyp is attached to the sea floor , or to another hard surface . a polyp that lives that way is called sessile .
