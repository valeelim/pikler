Aether     aether was the god of light in greek mythology . he was the son of erebus and nyx . aether is one of the primordial deities , the first-born elementals . damascius says that aether , erebus and chaos were siblings , and the offspring of chronos ( father time ) . according to epiphanius , the world began as a cosmic egg , encircled by time and inevitability ( most likely chronos and ananke ) in serpent fashion . together they constricted the egg , squeezing its matter with great force , until the world divided into two hemispheres . after that , the atoms sorted themselves out . the lighter and finer ones floated above and became the bright air ( aether and/or ouranos ) and the rarefied wind ( chaos ) , while the heavier and dirtier atoms sank and became the earth ( gaia ) and the ocean ( pontos and/or oceanus ) . see also plato 's myth of er .
