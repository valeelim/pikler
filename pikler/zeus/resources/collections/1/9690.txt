Parody     a parody is a special piece of art . parodies make fun of another piece of art by mocking it . the parody is an imitation of the original , but exaggerating it , showing clich√©s which have been used , to make the original look ridiculous or to make a comment about an issue affecting society . for example , in a serious western movie , the good guys always seem to shoot better and faster than the bad guys . in a western parody , this might be exaggerated by showing a good guy firing a single shot , and a dozen of the bad guys falling from their horses as a result . mel brooks is a director who has made many movies which are parodies : - `` blazing saddles '' is a parody of western movies in general , - `` spaceballs '' is a parody of the `` star wars '' movies , and science fiction in general , - `` men in tights '' is a parody of `` robin hood '' movies , the website uncyclopedia is also a parody of wikipedia . parodies can be anything from songs to poems to books to movies . newspaper columnists are well known for their strip cartoons which can very often parody public opinion on major issues affecting society , such as the recent credit crunch .
