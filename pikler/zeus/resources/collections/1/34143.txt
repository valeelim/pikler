Countertenor     a countertenor is a male singer who uses a falsetto voice to sing high notes like a female contralto or mezzo-soprano . countertenors were used a lot in the renaissance and baroque periods when females were not allowed to sing in church choirs . they did not have big , dramatic voices like castrati , so they were not normally used in opera . people forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries , although male altos continued to sing in english cathedral and church choirs . in the 20th century an english countertenor called alfred deller became very famous . he sang many songs from the baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice , for example songs by henry purcell who sang countertenor himself . today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like renaissance and baroque music .
