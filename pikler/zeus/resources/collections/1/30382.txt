Opus number     opus or the shortened form op . after the title of a piece of music means “ work ” . it is followed by a number . when a composer writes his or her first piece of music it could be called “ opus 1 ” . the next composition would then be called “ opus 2 ” , etc . giving pieces of music opus numbers helps us to know which piece of music it is . for example : beethoven wrote lots of piano sonatas . his piano sonata in a flat major op.26 is a sonata he wrote when he was a young man . many years later he wrote another piano sonata which is also in a flat major , and that one has the opus number 110. you can not always tell from a composer ’ s opus numbers the order in which the works were composed . until around the end of the 18th century opus numbers were only given to pieces of music which were published . some musicologists ( people who study and write about music ) have studied all the works by a famous composer and have given them a catalogue number . for example : mozart ’ s music does not have opus numbers . some of them are long operas , others are tiny little pieces for the piano he might have written in a hurry one day . a man called köchel made a list of every single work by mozart and gave them k numbers ( k for köchel ) . his numbering goes up to 622. this is useful , for example , to tell the difference between his symphony in g minor k183 and his symphony in g minor k550 .
