Hockey stick     a hockey stick is a long , wooden pole used to push , pass , or shoot in the sports of ice hockey and field hockey . the art of developing ice hockey sticks is a complex science and has become big business . ice hockey sticks are mostly made of composite materials and they have different `` flexes '' , meaning some sticks are more flexible than others . in ice hockey , the end or `` blade '' of the stick is normally curved , to help the player get better control of the puck and better shots at the goaltender . the goaltender has a bigger blade , to make it easier to stop shots . players sometimes use hockey sticks to hold back the bodies of other players , or to trip or hit them ; sometimes players who do this get penalties . in field hockey , sticks are shorter , but the blade is thicker , than in ice hockey . it is used to move a ball instead of a puck . more research has gone into studying how hockey sticks perform . the main difference between the two sticks is how they are used in the games . all the players in both ice and field hockey use hockey sticks .
