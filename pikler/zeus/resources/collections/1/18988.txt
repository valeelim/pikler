Encryption     encryption allows information to be hidden so that it can not be read without special knowledge ( such as a password ) . this is done with a secret code or cypher . the hidden information is said to be encrypted . decryption is a way to change encrypted information back into plaintext . this is the decrypted form . the study of encryption is called cryptography . cryptanalysis can be done by hand if the cypher is simple . complex cyphers need a computer to search for possible keys . decryption is a field of computer science and mathematics that looks at how difficult it is to break a cypher . a simple kind of encryption for words is rot13 . in rot13 , letters of the alphabet are changed with each other using a simple pattern . for example , `` a '' changes to `` n '' , `` b '' changes to `` o '' , `` c '' changes to `` p '' , and so on . each letter is `` rotated '' by 13 spaces . using the rot13 cipher , the words `` simple english wikipedia '' becomes `` fvzcyr ratyvfu jvxvcrqvn '' . the rot13 cipher is very easy to decrypt . because there are 26 letters in the english alphabet , if a letter is rotated two times by 13 letters each time , the original letter will be obtained . so applying the rot13 cipher a second time brings back the original text . when he communicated with his army , julius caesar sometimes used what is known as caesar cipher today . this cipher works by shifting the position of letters : each letter is rotated by 3 positions .
