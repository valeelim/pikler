Venus     venus is the second planet from the sun . it is a `` terrestrial planet '' because it has a solid , rocky surface like other planets in the inner solar system . astronomers have known venus for thousands of years . the ancient romans named it after their goddess venus . venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for the moon . it is sometimes called the `` morning star '' or the `` evening star '' as at some elongations it is easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning and , at other elongations , just after the sun goes down in the evening . venus comes closer to the earth than any other planet does . venus is sometimes called the sister planet of earth as they are quite similar in size and gravity . in other ways the planets are very different . venus ' atmosphere ( air ) is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulphuric acid . sulphuric acid is a chemical that is very poisonous to humans . the thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface , and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might live there . the pressure on venus ' surface is 92 times that of earth . venus has no moons . venus spins very slowly on its axis and it spins in the opposite direction to the other planets .
