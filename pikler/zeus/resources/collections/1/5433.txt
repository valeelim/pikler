Creating     creating is making new things that have not existed before , usually by combining two or three things that existed . art is almost always called creative , but so are other activities like music , mathematics , technology , business , craft , building , gardening and forestry , if they combine things to get new things . when several people cooperate in more than one process of creating , that is a creative network . this cuts risk since anything creative involves some chance that it will simply not work . what is `` not creative '' is usually called imitative , and includes anything that is mostly trying not to do what has never been done â€“ like law , sports , science , war and especially education . these involve more direct competition , so risk comes from the competitor who may do it better . the word team is used for such groups . most people fear change and new things , and so what is most stable and considered important by society tends to be imitative and done in teams . but unless society encourages creating it loses out to others by competition in business or technology , so there must be some creative networks , somewhere , in labs or art studios .
