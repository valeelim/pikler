List of stars with confirmed extrasolar planets     the following is a list of main sequence stars with confirmed extrasolar planets . note that the masses of the planets are lower bounds only . if a planet is detected by the spectral line displacement method referred to above , no information is gained about the inclination of the planet 's plane of orbit around its star , and a value for this is needed to calculate the mass . it has become customary to arbitrarily assume that the plane is exactly lined up with the line of sight from earth ( this produces the lowest possible mass consistent with the spectral line measurements ) . - hd 83443 - .35 m and .16 m - hd 16141 - .215 m. - hd 168746 - .24 m - hd 46375 - .249 m - hd 108147 - .34 m - hd 75289 - .42 m - 51 pegasi - .47 m ( 0.25-au ) - bd -10 3166 - .48 m - hd 6434 - .48 m - hd 187123 - .52 m - hd 209458 - .69 m - upsilon andromedae - .71 m ( 0.06au ) , 2.11 m ( 0.83au ) , and 4.61 m ( 2.5au ) - hd 192263 - .76 m - epsilon eridani - .86 m - hd 38529 - .81 m
