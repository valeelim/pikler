Magnetic resonance imaging     magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( nmri ) , are techniques that doctors use to give a visual representation of soft tissue ( flesh ) inside the body . magnetic resonance uses nuclear magnetic resonance to generate these images . to take an mri image , the patient lies on a movable bed . the bed enters a strong magnetic field and then radio waves are applied for a short time in a different direction . this sudden shift causes certain atoms in the patient 's body to make special signals . the mri scanner detects those special signals . the mri scanner then sends the signal information to a computer , and the computer creates an image of the inner body by using the signal information . the mri is used to diagnose disorders of the body that can not be seen by x-rays . the mri is painless and has the advantage of avoiding the dangerous x-ray radiation . it is an expensive medical procedure , due to the high cost of the equipment . some metallic objects may distort the image , like hip , shoulder and knee replacements but the exam can still be done . cochlear ( ear ) implants , some ( older ) aneurysm clips in the brain , and most pacemakers are not mri compatible . obese and severely claustrophobic patients often need sedation and/or imaging with an `` open '' magnet , which is much less confining . contrast agents may or may not be indicated for some patients , and those with compromised kidney function may not be able to receive the contrast , due to a serious but rare skin reaction .
