Laser     a laser is a machine that makes an amplified , single-colour source of light . the beam of light from the laser does not get wider or weaker as most sources of light do . it uses special gases or crystals to make the light with only a single color . then mirrors are used to amplify ( make stronger ) that colour of light and to make all the light travel in one direction , so it stays as a narrow beam , sometimes called a collimated beam . when pointed at something , this narrow beam makes a single point of light . all of the energy of the light stays in that one narrow beam instead of spreading out like a flashlight ( electric torch ) . the word `` laser '' is an acronym for `` light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation '' . a laser creates light by special actions involving a material called an `` optical gain medium '' . energy is put into this material using an 'energy pump ' . this can be electricity , another light source , or some other source of energy . the energy makes the material go into what is called an excited state . this means the electrons in the material have extra energy , and after a bit of time they will lose that energy . when they lose the energy they will release a photon ( a particle of light ) . the type of optical gain medium used will change what color ( wavelength ) will be produced . releasing photons is the `` stimulated emission of radiation '' part of laser .
