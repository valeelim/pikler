Octave     an octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name . if a musician sings or plays a scale ( ‘ do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do ’ ) the first and last ‘ doh ’ are an octave apart . it is called an ‘ octave ’ because there are eight notes in a scale ( ‘ octo ’ is latin for ‘ eight ’ ) . if a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “ somewhere over the rainbow ” ( i.e . the word ‘ somewhere ’ ) these two notes are an octave apart . two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar , almost like the same note . the scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast . for example : if someone plays middle c on a piano , a hammer hits the three middle c strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second . the c an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second . young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand , if their hands are too small . most adults can stretch an octave easily ( playing one note with the thumb , and the other with the little finger ) . advanced pianists can practice scales in octaves . violinists can play scales in octaves , too , playing on two strings at once , but this is very hard .
