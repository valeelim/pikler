Carthage     carthage is an ancient city-state in what is now tunisia . it began as a phoenician colony . in the `` aeneid '' , an old story by vergil , aeneas visited carthage . he made the queen of carthage , dido , angry and she killed herself as she loved him but he was going to leave her . carthage at the height of its power was the foremost power in the mediterranean sea , controlling parts of spain , sicily , north africa , sardinia , and the balearic islands . carthage was a rival for mediterranean sea power for the roman republic , who wanted to take over the whole western mediterranean sea . carthage was a large obstacle to that . so , in 264 bc , the romans responded to a plea for help by some rebels in messina , and landed an army in sicily . this started the first punic war . the romans then invaded the carthaginian holdings in sicily , and the carthaginian generals could not stop them . even at sea , the romans were able to copy the carthaginian bireme ships and win several major victories on the sea , even though the carthaginians had long fought at sea and the romans were new to this .
