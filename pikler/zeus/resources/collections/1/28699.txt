Nuclear fusion     nuclear fusion is the process of making a single heavy nucleus ( part of an atom ) from two lighter nuclei . this process is called a nuclear reaction . it releases a large amount of energy . the nucleus made by fusion is heavier than either of the starting nuclei . however , it is not as heavy as the combination of the original mass of the starting nuclei ( atoms ) . this lost mass is changed into lots of energy . this is shown in einstein 's famous `` e=mc '' equation . fusion happens in the middle of stars , like the sun . hydrogen atoms are fused together to make helium . this releases lots of energy . this energy powers the heat and light of the star . not all elements can be joined . heavier elements are less easily joined than lighter ones . iron ( a metal ) can not fuse with other atoms . this is what causes stars to die . stars join all of their atoms together to make heavier atoms of different types , until they start to make iron . the iron nucleus can not fuse with other nuclei . the reactions stop . the star eventually will cool down and die .
