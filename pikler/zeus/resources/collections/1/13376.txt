Remixing     in remixing , a person ( often a recording engineer or record producer ) takes a familiar song , splits it into different parts called `` tracks '' , and changes the song 's music , instruments , layout , and or vocals to create a new version of the same song . it is called `` remixing '' due to mixing being the putting together of all the parts of a song , and `` remixing '' being the putting together of the parts of the song differently than the original . remixers , that is , people who remix , are musicians who use a variety of tools , primarily electronic , to create the new song versions . remixing can be simply moving song parts around ; it can also be creating new music for an old song lyric . there are two common kinds of remixing : production and mashups . production remixing uses new instruments with the old song vocal , and mashups use two old songs mixed together to create a new song . `` production remixing '' requires more musical knowledge than mashups , because one must make their own music . this music generally is within the same key and has the same rhythm or melody as the old song .
