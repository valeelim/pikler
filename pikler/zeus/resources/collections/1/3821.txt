Polymer     a polymer is a molecule , made from joining together many small molecules called monomers . the word `` polymer '' can be broken down into `` poly '' ( meaning `` many '' in greek ) and `` mer '' ( meaning `` unit '' ) . this shows how the chemical composition of a polymer consists of many smaller units ( monomers ) bonded together into a larger molecule . a chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization . some polymers are natural and made by organisms . proteins have polypeptide molecules , which are natural polymers made from various amino acid monomer units . nucleic acids are huge natural polymers made up of millions of nucleotide units . cellulose and starch ( two types of carbohydrate ) are also natural polymers made up of glucopyranose monomer bonded together in different ways . some polymers are man-made . plastics , rubber , and fibers are made up of polymers . if the `` units '' called monomers in a polymer are all the same , then the polymer is called a `` homopolymer '' . homopolymers are named by adding the prefix poly- before the monomer name from which the polymer is made . for example , a polymer made by bonding styrene monomer molecules together is called polystyrene .
