Submarine     a submarine ( or sub ) is a vessel that goes under water . most large submarines are war vessels . some small ones are used for scientific or business purposes . these are often called `` submersibles '' and can not go far or stay long away from base . some rich people buy their own to explore under the sea and look at fish . a submarine is always called a boat , not a ship . in early times , submarines were often powered by hand . this is because boat engines had not been invented yet . they were almost always designed to be used for war . submarines would try to sink enemy ships by crude methods . these included drilling screws into their wooden hulls . some tried to blow up a ship . this often destroyed the submarine , too . later , during the first and second world wars , better submarines were made . many of these better submarines were created by germany . the submarines were powered by a diesel-electric system . a diesel motor would be used to turn a generator . the generator would charge a large number of batteries while the submarine was above the water . this power was then used to power the submarine when it went underwater . these submarines were dangerous for enemies . they were hard to see while underwater but it was easy to attack them when they were above the water and recharging .
