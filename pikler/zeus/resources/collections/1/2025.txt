Eurasia     eurasia is the combined landmass of the continents of europe and asia in the northern part of the earth . eurasia is made of europe and asia , which are on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them . the word is made by adding `` eur '' ( from `` eur '' ope ) to `` asia '' to make `` eurasia '' . some geographers say it 's all just one continent , because unlike the americas or africa , europe and asia are not divided by sea . the ancient greeks divided the world they knew into europe , asia and africa . since then , people have been talking about asia and europe as two continents so it is now a tradition . some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land ( called an isthmus ) like north america and south america . however , europe and asia are not divided by sea at all . sometimes eurasia is divided into west eurasia and east eurasia . west eurasia is europe and the middle east . historians sometimes add north africa to west eurasia because the sahara desert divides north africa from the other parts of africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea .
