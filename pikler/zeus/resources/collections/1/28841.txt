Oxbow lake     an oxbow lake is a lake , or area of water , in a u-shape . it is made by special bends in a river , called meanders , getting farther away from the river until they become separate . the river becomes straight and the bend becomes a lake . water flows at different speeds at different parts of the river . in the middle , farthest away from the sides ( or banks ) , the water flows fastest . at the banks , the water flows slowest . when the river bends , water flows faster on the outside of the bend than the inside . the fast water on the outside 'erodes ' the outside of the bend . this means it breaks bits of the bank off . at the same time , the slow water on the inside of the bend leaves behind mud , sand and parts of plants ( deposition ) . together , these make the bend move in the direction of the outside of the bend . the bend moves farther and farther along until it leaves the river . the river becomes straight and the bend is left as an oxbow lake .
