Feminism     feminism is a social and political movement . feminism is about changing the way that people see male and female rights ( mainly female ) , and campaigning for equal ones . somebody who follows feminism is called a feminist . feminism began in the 18th century with the enlightenment . the controversy over the differences between the genders led to the discussion of equality . the word `` feminism '' comes from the french word `` f√©minisme '' . this medical term was used to describe masculine women or men with feminized traits . when its use became popular in the united states of america , it was used to refer to groups of women who `` asserted the uniqueness of women , the mystical experience of motherhood and women 's special purity '' . feminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women . this idea was put forward by some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries such as mary wollstonecraft and john stuart mill . later feminists in the early 20th century also said that women should be allowed to vote in a democracy . many women felt very strongly that they should be allowed to vote and there were many protests . these women were called suffragettes . this is because they were fighting for universal suffrage which means everybody is able to vote . the suffragettes staged many protests for their rights . some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics . after women received the vote , feminism worked to make all of society more equal for women .
