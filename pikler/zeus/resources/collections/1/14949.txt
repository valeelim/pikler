Differential calculus     differential calculus , a branch of calculus , is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable , by using functions . it is a way to find out how a shape changes from one point to the next , without needing to divide the shape into an infinite number of pieces . differential calculus is the opposite of integral calculus . it was developed in the 1670s and 1680s by sir isaac newton and gottfried leibniz . unlike a number such as 5 or 200 , a variable can change its value . for example , distance and time are variables . at an olympic running race , as the person runs , their `` distance '' from the starting line goes up . meanwhile , a stopwatch or clock measures the `` time '' as it goes up . we can measure the average speed of the runner if we divide the distance they travelled by the time it took . but this does not say what speed the person was running at exactly 1.5 seconds into the race . if we had the distance at 1 second and the distance at 2 seconds , we would still only have an average , although it would probably be more correct than the average for the whole race .
