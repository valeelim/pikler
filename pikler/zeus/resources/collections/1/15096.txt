Crass     crass was one of the first anarcho-punk bands . the band was formed in essex , england in 1977. the band split up in 1984. the group was first of all made up of penny rimbaud ( playing drums ) and steve ignorant ( who sang ) . later they were joined by other people who also lived together in their shared house ( or commune ) called dial house . crass did their first concert at a squatted festival in huntley street , north london . soon after they played at the famous punk club the roxy in london 's covent garden area . however the group were made to come off of the stage because they were very drunk . they also did early concerts with punk band the uk subs , but not many people went to watch these concerts . after this members of crass decided to be more serious about what they were doing . they decided to wear black clothes all of the time , whether or not they were on stage . this was so that no member of the band would be seen as the group 'leader ' . they also made a banner that they hung up behind them when they were playing live . this had a logo on it that was made up of symbols like the christian cross , the swastika and the british flag , as well as a snake with two heads that is eating itself . the meaning of this logo was the idea that `` power will destroy itself '' .
