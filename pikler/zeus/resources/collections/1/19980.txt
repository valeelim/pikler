Fuzzy logic     fuzzy logic is a sort of computer logic that is different from boolean algebra founded by lotfi a. zadeh . it is different in the way that it allows values to be more accurate than on or off . while boolean logic only allows true or false , fuzzy logic allows all things in between . an example of this could be a computer game : a person is standing in a doorway while a thing explodes . the character is hit or not hit if boolean logic is used , but the doorway protects him from the explosion . therefore , he might only be hit 20 % , and takes less damage . to put it in more precise mathematical terms , classical logic has two values . these values are usually called `` false '' ( 0 ) or `` true '' ( 1 ) . with fuzzy logic , a ( calculated ) value of 0.8 or 0.971 is possible . it is important to know the difference between fuzzy logic and chance . a coin that is thrown has a chance of 0.5 for landing heads up . if it is thrown 1000 times , it is expected that it will land with heads side up 500 times . with fuzzy logic , a thing with a `` truth value '' of 0.5 will have a value of 0.5 no matter how many times it is done . it is not a 50 % chance of true or untrue , it is 50 % true and 50 % untrue at the same time .
