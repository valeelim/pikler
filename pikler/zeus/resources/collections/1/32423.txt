Myocardial infarction     an acute myocardial infarction , also called a heart attack , happens when a blood vessel in the heart suddenly becomes blocked . blood vessels carry blood and oxygen . when a blood vessel in the heart gets blocked , blood can not get to part of the heart . this part of the heart does not get enough oxygen . this is called ischemia . when the heart muscle becomes ischemic ( does not get enough blood and oxygen ) , the ischemia often causes chest pain . this is called angina pectoris . if the ischemia lasts long enough , the heart muscle that is not getting enough oxygen dies . this is called an infarction . `` myocardial infarction '' means `` infarction ( muscle death ) in the heart muscle . '' a heart attack is a medical emergency . the first few minutes are very important for keeping the person alive . some of the damage from the heart attack can be repaired if the person gets treatment during the first hour of the attack . most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease ( cad ) . in coronary artery disease , a wax-like material called plaque builds up on the inside walls of arteries in the heart . this is called atherosclerosis . plaque is made of cholesterol and other cells . the amount of plaque increases slowly . as more plaque builds up , the insides of the heart 's blood vessels get narrower . this means that less blood can flow through the blood vessels . this can cause platelets ( which make the blood clot ) to build up in front of the plaque . this causes a blood clot in the blood vessel . if the clot breaks free and gets stuck in part of the blood vessel made narrower by the plaque , the plaque and the clot together block the blood vessel completely . this makes it impossible for blood to get to part of the heart , and causes a heart attack .
