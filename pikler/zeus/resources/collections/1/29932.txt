Dialects of English     there are several dialects of english used in different parts of the world . american english or u.s. english is the dialect ( or rather , a variety of dialects ) of english language spoken in the united states . it is different in some respects from other variations of english , such as british english . historically , many types of american english can be traced back to old local dialects of england . awareness of american english is greater now in many parts of the world where another form of english is more common . this is partly because of people 's exposure to american english via the media , for example cnn television , and the internet , where the most common form of english is american english . the increasing global awareness of american english as well as other versions of english may lead to localised versions of english continuing the english language tradition of absorbing new words . for example , the english language spoken in india , which has more than one billion people , will assume more american english words to go along with its british english base and many other words adopted into english usage in india from indian languages such as hindi .
