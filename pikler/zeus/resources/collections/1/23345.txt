Containment building     containment building is a building with a nuclear reactor in it . it is built around the reactor to keep the radiation from getting out , if something happens to the reactor . the containment building is the last barrier to the radiation getting into the environment . containment systems for nuclear power reactors are distinguished by size , shape , materials used , and suppression systems . the kind of containment used is determined by the type of reactor , generation of the reactor , and the specific plant needs . the chernobyl accident was very bad partly because soviet reactors had no containment buildings . the diagram shows the order of defense layers for a nuclear reactor . the first layer of defense is the inert , ceramic quality of the uranium oxide itself . the second layer is the air tight zirconium alloy of the fuel rod . the third layer is the reactor pressure vessel made of steel more than a dozen centimeters thick . the fourth layer is the pressure resistant , air tight `` containment building '' . the fifth layer is the exclusion zone around the reactor .
