Root     the roots of a plant is the part that is usually buried in the soil . roots are usually always under the soil , thoughâ€“sometimes roots can be above the ground . this is called an aerial root . also , stems can sometimes be under the soil ( potatoes , for example ) . roots do not have leaves , and are different from stems inside . plants need their roots especially for three reasons : the roots take water and nutrients , a sort of food , from the soil . they also often store this food . and they fix the plants to the ground . however , most plant roots do not work at their best unless they have help from fungi . the symbiosis between roots and fungus is known as mycorrhiza . there are two sorts of root systems : - the taproot system : there is one very big root that goes down into the ground , and many smaller roots that come out of it - the diffuse root system : there are many roots that go in all directions some roots go very deep into the ground . one root that was found in arizona , usa , was 60 m below the surface .
