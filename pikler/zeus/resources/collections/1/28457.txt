Handcuffs     handcuffs are a type of restraint , mainly used by police , to prevent suspects from escaping , or hurting anyone . they do this by securing a person 's wrists together . they are usually metal and are made up of two parts linked together by a chain . handcuffs can not be removed without the right key , so a handcuffed person can not move their wrists more than a short distance apart . there are three main types of handcuffs : chain , hinged , and solid bar . while they are harder to carry , rigid handcuffs allow a number of differences in cuffing . both rigid and hinged cuffs can be used one-handed to apply pain-compliance/control techniques . different accessories are available to improve the security or increase the hardness of handcuffs . these include boxes that fit over the chain or hinge and can be locked with a padlock . in 1933 the royal canadian mounted police used a type called `` mitten handcuffs '' . these stopped criminals from being able to grab the officer 's objects . it was used by some in law enforcement but it was never popular .
