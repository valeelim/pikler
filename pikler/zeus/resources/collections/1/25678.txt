Imperialism     imperialism is a policy ( way of governing ) in which large or powerful countries seek to extend their authority beyond their own borders . the policy of imperialism aims at the creation of an empire . imperialist countries take control of other countries . they may use military force to do this . however , they may also avoid using military force . they may simply establish economic and/or political control over the other country . imperialist policies of countries or kingdoms have goals of taking over more land to create bigger empires . the ruler of an empire gains natural resources such as agricultural and mining products . human resources are also gained . conquered peoples may be forced into slavery or into low-wage work . they may also be called into military service on behalf of the empire . trade markets are also gained . the people under an imperial government may be forced to buy products from that government or from that government 's industries . thus , a policy of imperialism can vastly enrich the imperialist country . this benefit can extend over a long period of time .
