Scalar     scalars are simple numbers . they are used for measuring things . many things can be measured , and the measure can be explained by only giving the number . suppose we are measuring a rod . we could give the measured length as 2 metres or 3 cm etc . depending on the length of the rod under observation . here only the figure 2 or 3 along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod . other examples of scalars are : - unit of mass . ( kilograms ) - unit of measuring luminosity . ( candela ) - unit of length . ( metres ) i.e . mass is measured by scalars , distances are measured by scalars . the other family of measurement falls under the category of vectors .
