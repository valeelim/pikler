Foolishness     foolishness is when someone acts without wisdom or sense . a foolish decision is one made without careful reasoning or judgement . an act of foolishness is called folly . a person who shows foolishness may be called a fool . it is different to stupidity , which is the lack of intelligence . a `` fool 's errand '' is a useless piece of work . a `` fool 's paradise '' a happy state for which there is no good reason . the `` wise fool '' is a common literary character , a person who appears at first to be unintelligent but then reveals him or herself to possess a grest deal of wisdom . an example of this is sancho panza in cervantes ' `` don quixote '' . sancho is an uneducated peasant who at first seems to have little sense or experience . however , as the tale unfolds , he reveals himself to possess a wealth of common sense , first expressed through endless proverbs , but then through his own skill . in this sense he provides a comic juxtaposition to quixote himself , who is highly educated but insane ; both of them supply what the other lacks .
