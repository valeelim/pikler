Lava     lava is magma that flows onto the earth 's surface . like magma , lava can be either viscous ( ~thick ) or fluid ( ~thin ) . blocky lava is so thick and slow that it barely moves along the ground . other types of lava , like `` pahoehoe '' , `` aa '' , and `` pillow lava '' , are thinner and flow faster . `` blocky lava '' is cool , stiff lava that can not travel far from where it was erupted . blocky lava usually out from a volcano only after an explosion has let out lots of the gas pressure from the place where there is magma . blocky lava makes piles of sharp chunks . pronounced `` pah hoy hoy '' , `` pahoehoe '' gets its name from the hawaiian word for `` ropy '' because its surface looks like of rope . pahoehoe lava flows slowly , like wax dripping down from a candle , making a glassy surface with round wrinkles . `` aa '' is a hawaiian word that is about a type of lava that has a sharp , surface . this stiff lava pours out quickly and makes a crust that breaks easily . the crust is torn into sharp pieces as the hot lava underneath still moves .
