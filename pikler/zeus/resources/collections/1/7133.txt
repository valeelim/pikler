Calabi-Yau manifold     a calabi–yau manifold , or 'calabi–yau space ' , is a special type of manifold . it is described in certain branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry . the calabi–yau manifold 's properties , such as ricci flatness , have applications in theoretical physics . particularly in superstring theory , the extra dimensions of spacetime might take the form of a 6-dimensional calabi–yau manifold . this led to the idea of string theory mirror symmetry .
