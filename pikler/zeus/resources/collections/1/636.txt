Protein     proteins are long-chain molecules built from small units known as amino acids . they are joined together with peptide bonds . they are biochemical compounds consisting of one or more polypeptides folded into a round or fibrous shape . a polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids . the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the dna sequence of a gene . the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids . shortly after synthesis , some amino acids are chemically modified . this alters the folding , stability , activity , and function of the protein . sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached , as cofactors . proteins are essential to all cells . like other biological macromolecules ( polysaccharides and nucleic acids ) , proteins take part in virtually every process in cells : 1. many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism . 1. other proteins have structural or mechanical functions , such as in muscle and in cells . the cytoskeleton is a system of scaffolding that keeps cell shape .
