Platonic realism     platonic realism is the theory of reality developed by plato , and explained in his theory of forms . platonic realism states that the visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition , like shadows cast on a wall by the activities of their corresponding universal ideas or forms . whereas the visible world of particulars is unreal , the forms occupy the unobservable yet true reality and are real . platonism is a similar , yet sometimes modified , view of reality . among the natural philosophers in ancient greece , the problem of universals was the mystery of where particular things derive their traits that we perceive as universalsâ€”for instance `` red '' or `` apple '' or `` good '' or `` woman '' or `` truth '' . plato explained that the particular things of the visible world are imperfect , transient copies of the universal ideas that are the perfect , lasting forms . existing exist outside space and time , the forms are the universals and act as templates from which particulars manifest . in his `` metaphysics '' , aristotle , a student of plato , explained that socrates and his own student plato held it significant that the world is in flux , much as heraclitus had commented , `` you can not step into the same river twice '' , a theme of the eleatics , a group of pre-socratic philosophers .
