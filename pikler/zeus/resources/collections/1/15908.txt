Intestine     the intestines of an animal are like a hollow tube so that food and bile from the stomach can reach the small intestine and large intestine . the first part of the small intestine is called the duodenum . it is where most of the food is broken down by enzymes . further on , the small intestine absorbs useful compounds from the digested food . it does this through small villi or tiny microvilli . these are very small , hair-like structures in the walls of the intestine . the large intestine is also called the bowel . it absorbs water , and any nutrients still remaining . it also absorbs vitamins made by the gut flora in the colon . finally it expels waste through the anus .
