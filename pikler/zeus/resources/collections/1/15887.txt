Reptile     reptile is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates . it is not used so much by biologists , who use more accurate terms . the name `` reptile '' comes from latin and means `` one who creeps '' . all living reptile species are cold blooded , have scaly skin , and lay cleidoic eggs . they excrete uric acid ( instead of urea ) , and have a cloaca . a cloaca is a shared opening for the anus , urinary tract and reproductive ducts . reptiles also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals . many important groups of reptiles are now extinct , for example the mosasaurs . we used to say the dinosaurs were extinct , but they survive in the form of their feathered descendants ( birds ) . ancient reptiles that do survive include the turtles , the crocodiles and the tuatara , the lone survivor of its group . the great majority of present-day reptiles are snakes and lizards . the study of living reptiles is called `` herpetology '' . some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles . crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards . theropod dinosaurs are even more closely related , because birds evolved from them .
