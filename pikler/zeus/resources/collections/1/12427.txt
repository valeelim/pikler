Mathematical constant     a mathematical constant is a number , which has a special meaning for calculations . for example , the constant Ï€ ( pronounced `` pie '' ) means the ratio of the length of a circle 's circumference to its diameter . this value is always the same for any circle . in contrast to physical constants , mathematical constants do not come from physical measurements . -- tables structure -- - value numerical of the constante . - latex : formula or series in tex format . - formula : for use in programs like mathematica or wolfram alpha . - oeis : link to : on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences ( oeis ) , where the constants are available with more details . - continued fraction : in the simple form [ to integer ; frac1 , frac2 , frac3 , ... ] ( in brackets if periodic ) - tipo : - r - rational number - i - irrational number - t - transcendental number - c - complex number `` you can choose the order of the list by clicking on the name , value , oeis , etc..
