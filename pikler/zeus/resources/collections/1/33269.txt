Carpet     a carpet is a rectangular piece of woven textile . generally , carpets are used to make spaces more beautiful and to make walking on the floor quieter . carpets are warmer and softer than hard floors such as hardwood , tile , or concrete . carpets may be many different sizes . rugs and carpets originated in central asia , but the idea of machine manufacture was invented in europe . so there are two different kinds of things : one is hand-made by traditional methods , and the other woven by machine . this accounts for the very great difference in style and price between traditional rugs and modern wall-to-wall carpeting . the name `` carpet '' comes from old italian carpita , `` carpire '' means to pluck . the term `` carpet '' is used mostly to describe textiles placed on the floor most of the times stretched from wall to wall . rugs are smaller in size , often placed over a carpet , and often decorated . in islam , rugs are used as prayer mats , for people to kneel on when they pray . it is common , especially in the middle east , for rugs and carpets to be used as wall decoration , and they are designed with decoration in mind . mass-manufactured carpets in western countries are utilitarian : for hard use on the floor , and usually self-coloured ( that is one color over the whole carpet ) . traditional rugs from the middle east are hand-made and may be very expensive by the time they reach shops in the western world .
