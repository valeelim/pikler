Trinitrotoluene     tnt ( trinitrotoluene , also called trotyl , tritol , tolite and tol ) is a powerful , shattering ( brisant ) nitroaromatic explosive , somewhat similar to dynamite ( which is based on the nitric acid ester nitroglycerin , however ) . sometimes tnt is used to mean dynamite , or dynamite is used to mean tnt , because they can both be used in similar ways ; however the two materials are distinct , different chemicals with only some of their properties ( such as the brisance , their shattering power ) being similar while other properties ( such as stability and sensitivity ) are entirely different . traces of tnt can be detected by analytical forensic chemical investigation even in extremely small amounts . for example , if a person has been involved in a crime using tnt , scientists can track it down by testing hair or clothing samples to see if tnt traces are found on them . these traces can remain in the hair or in the fabric of the clothes even after many washings . tnt is a nitroaromatic explosive and it can be dangerous both as an explosive and for being poisonous if handled incorrectly . soldiers , engineers and workers who must work with tnt should therefore observe strict safety measures when handling this explosive .
