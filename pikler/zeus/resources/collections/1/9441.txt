Pipeline     a pipeline is a long tube , that is used to transport liquids or gases over long distances . pipelines are made of metal . while the transport of liquids and gases is common , some pipelines are used to transport coal or iron ore , which are mixed with mud . such pipelines are sometimes called slurry pipelines . even though a pipeline is very expensive to build , the low operating cost often makes it the cheapest transport . many stadiums use a central tank for beer . each bar is served by a pipeline from the central tank . even though mail and other goods can also be delivered that way , the system is generally not referred to as `` pipeline '' . in this case , capsules are used . these are propelled by air . pipeline networks are made of different components . these are : - the supply station is where the pipeline starts . very often , there are tanks that act as a buffer - there are several pumps and compressors , which move the product through the pipeline . - partial delivery stations allow to deliver part of the product
