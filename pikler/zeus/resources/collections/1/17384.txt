Red shift     red shift is a way astronomers use to tell the distance of any object that is very far away in the universe . it is one example of the doppler effect . the easiest way to experience the doppler effect is to listen to a moving train , which , as it moves `` towards '' a person , sounds like it has a higher tone , since the frequency of the sound is squeezed together a little bit . as the train speeds `` away '' , the sound gets stretched out , and is lower in tone . the same happens when a light-emitting object moves very fast . an object , like a star or a galaxy , that is far away and moving toward us , will look more blue than it normally does . this is called blue shift . a star or galaxy moving away from us will look more red than it would if the source were not moving in our frame of reference . this is where red shift got its name , since the colors are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum . the reason astronomers can tell how far the light gets shifted is because certain chemical elements , like the calcium in bones or the oxygen people breathe , have a unique `` fingerprint '' of light that no other chemical elements have . they can see what colors of light are coming from a star , and see what it is made of . once they know that , they check to see the difference between where the fingerprint , called spectral lines , are actually at , and then look at where they are supposed to be . when they see that , they can tell how far away the star is , whether it is moving toward us or away from us , and also how fast it is going , since the faster it goes , the farther the distance the spectral lines are from where they should be .
