White dwarf     a white dwarf is a compact star . their matter is squashed together . gravitation has pulled the atoms close together , and taken off their electrons . the mass of a white dwarf is similar to the mass of the sun , but its volume is similar to that of the earth . white dwarfs are the final evolutionary state of all stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star . over 97 % of the stars in the milky way will become white dwarf stars . after the hydrogenâ€“fusing lifetime of a main-sequence star ends , it will expand to a red giant which fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core . if a red giant does not have enough mass to fuse carbon , around 1 billion k , inactive carbon and oxygen will build up at its center . after shedding its outer layers to form a planetary nebula , it will leave behind the core , which is the white dwarf . the material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions , so the star has no source of energy . it is not supported by the heat of fusion against gravitational collapse .
