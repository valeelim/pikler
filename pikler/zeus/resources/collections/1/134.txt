Creativity     creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable , or the process of making something new and useful or valuable . it happens in all areas of life - science , art , literature and music . as a personal ability it is very difficult to measure . the reason is that we do n't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others . judging what is creative is also controversial . some people say only things which are historically new are creative , while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them , then it is also creativity . some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes . others recognize that even apes , other primates , other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative ( for example - primates using tools ) . liane gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity , not imitation . therefore , these people say , human science should focus on it ( pay special attention to it ) : ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas . politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity . imitation would not be the focus of education . linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture , rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar .
