Gregorian calendar     the gregorian calendar is the calendar that is used throughout most of the world . it began to be used from 1582. it replaced the previous julian calendar because the julian calendar had an error : it added a leap year ( with an extra day every four years ) with no exceptions . the length of the julian year was exactly 365.25 days ( 365 days and 6 hours ) , but the actual time it takes for the earth to go around the sun once is closer to 365.2425 days ( about 365 days , 5 hours and 49 minutes ) . this difference is about eleven minutes each year . this made the seasons get out of track , since the real first day of spring in western europe ( the equinox - day and night the same length ) was happening earlier and earlier before the traditional march 21 as the centuries went by . by the 1500s , it was starting around march 11 , ten days 'too early ' according to the calendar . so what they did was to move the calendar forward ten days in 1582 , and at the same time to make sure it did not happen again . to do this , they made an exception to the previous 'leap year rule ' ( add february 29 every four years ) . there would be no february 29 for every year that ends in 00 - unless it could be divided by 400. so the year 2000 was a leap year , because it could be divided by 400 , but 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 would be common years , with no february 29 .
