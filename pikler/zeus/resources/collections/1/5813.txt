Kinetic energy     kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because of its motion . this energy can be converted into other kinds , such as gravitational or electric potential energy , which is the energy that an object has because of its position in a gravitational or electric field . the translational kinetic energy of an object is : where the rotational kinetic energy of an object is : where
