Janus     janus was a two-faced god of roman mythology who kept the gate of heaven . he was the god of beginnings and ends , and so of gates , doors , doorways and passages . he is usually depicted as having two faces , since he looks to the future and to the past . the romans named the month of january ( ianuarius ) in his honor . in january we look back on the last year and forward to the next . janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict , and hence war and peace . the doors of his temple were open in time of war , and closed to mark the peace . as a god of transitions , he was remembered at births , and journeys : he was concerned with travelling , trading and shipping . it was also said that his face was split in two since a door can let you in or out . an unusual feature of the mythology is that the ancient greeks had no version of janus .
