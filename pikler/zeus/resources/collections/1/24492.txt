Irish language     irish , `` irish gaelic '' , or `` gaeilge '' is a language spoken in ireland . irish is a celtic language . this means that irish is similar to scottish gaelic , breton , cornish , manx and welsh . many people who speak irish can understand some scottish gaelic , but not welsh . this is because the celtic languages are divided into two groups . one group is called the p-celtic languages and the other is called the q-celtic languages . irish and scottish gaelic are q-celtic languages and welsh is a p-celtic language . irish has no `` yes '' or `` no '' words . there were great poets who wrote in irish . their poems became the songs of the people . people told stories about the heroes of old times . many of the poems were about them . at one point queen elizabeth i of england and ireland promoted irish with a view to using it to translate the bible into that language and tried to learn it herself . christopher nugent , ninth baron of delvin gave her a primer about it . until the nineteenth century , most people in ireland spoke irish , this changed after 1801 because after ireland joined the united kingdom , its state schools were incorporated into the british system and required to only teach or even allow english speaking . the roman catholic church also began to discourage irish and daniel o'connell , though a nationalist and an irish speaker himself , discouraged it , because most job opportunities were in the usa and the british empire .
