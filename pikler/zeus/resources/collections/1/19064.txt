Electron microscope     an electron microscope is a scientific instrument which uses a beam of electrons to examine objects on a very fine scale . in an optical microscope , the wavelength of light limits the maximum magnification that is possible . as electrons have a smaller wavelength , they can achieve a higher magnification , and can see very small objects - typically around 1,000 times smaller than those seen in an optical microscope . the outline of objects , as revealed by the flow of electrons , is changed into a picture using visible light for people to see . a beam of electrons is sent towards the specimen - some electrons are reflected , while some pass through . those that pass through are detected and used to form an image of the specimen at a magnification of about 500,000 times . this microscope is more powerful than a light microscope . similar to a transmission electron microscope , but the reflected electrons are detected . by measuring the reflected electrons , some information about the surface of the specimen can be gathered .
