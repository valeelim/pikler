Asthma     asthma ( or asthma bronchiale ) is a disease that hurts the airways inside the lungs . it causes the tissue inside the airways to swell . asthma also causes the bands of muscle around the airways to become narrow . this makes it hard for enough air to pass through and for the person to breathe normally . asthma also causes mucus-making cells inside the airways to make more mucus than normal . this blocks the airways , which are already very narrow during an asthma attack , and makes it even more difficult to breathe . a person having an asthma attack often makes wheezing sounds when trying to breathe . this is the sound of air trying to pass through the very narrow airway . they also have shortness of breath , which means they can not take a full deep breath . chest tightness may happen which feels like their chest is being squeezed . they may also cough a lot . asthma attacks can be a medical emergency because they can be `` fatal '' ( cause a person to die ) . there is no cure for asthma . there are treatments such as different kinds of medicines to help people with asthma . there are also things that people with asthma can do to help themselves to keep their asthma from getting worse .
