Error     an error is a mistake : that is its basic meaning . however , there are some differences in how the word is used in different subjects . elementary errors in arithmetic show a wrong pattern of thought . for example , if a child misplaces the decimal point in some decimal arithmetic , that shows he or she has not understood the idea . by explaining how decimal points should be placed , a teacher can correct all future calculations of this kind . the error is a sign of a general misunderstanding , which , when cured , may never happen again . in this way , errors can help learning . this idea can be developed in many other subjects . errors can help learning if corrected , and that is used by many textbooks with end-of-chapter questions . the idea of the questions ( which often have end of book answers ) is to help the reader find out what needs correcting . the principle of learning is called knowledge of results . a statistical error is `` the amount by which a sample differs from its expected value '' . the expected value is based on the whole population from which the individual was chosen .
