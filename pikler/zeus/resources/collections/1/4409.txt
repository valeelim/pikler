Lists of tropical cyclone names     within the north atlantic ocean , tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the national hurricane center ( nhc ) when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 km/h , ( 40 mph ) . six lists of names are used in alphabetical order , and maintained by the world meteorological organization with them rotating on a yearly basis . significant tropical cyclones have their names removed from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organization regional association iv hurricane committee meeting . if all of the names on a list are used , storms are named after the letters of the greek alphabet ( alpha , beta , gamma , etc. ) . greek names , unlike the names in the regular lists , can not be removed . if a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement , the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the greek letter would still be available for future storms .
