Japanese language     japanese ( 日本語 ) `` nihon-go '' in japanese ) is the language spoken in japan , in east asia . japanese is an isolated language . one theory says japanese and korean are related , but this is seen as obsolete . other theories about the origin are the austronesian languages or a connection to dravidian languages . interestingly , a different term is used for japanese as a course of study by citizens : it is `` kokugo '' ( 国語 ) , which means national language . nonetheless , japanese is still referred to as 日本語 by the japanese . japanese uses three separate writing systems : hiragana , katakana , and kanji . the first two are phonetic systems ( writing that shows the pronunciation of japanese words ) , and kanji is the japanese variation of chinese characters ( which show the meaning of japanese words ) . the three systems are used interchangeably , and all three systems can often be found in the same sentence . the three systems are each reserved for different purposes . in english , the order of the words is very important . for example , the sentences `` is it ? '' and `` it is . '' mean different things . in japanese a lot of these differences are made by adding or changing the endings of words . so a japanese word has a stem called a `` body '' , and additional parts ( called suffixes ) . by changing the suffix you can change the meaning of the word .
