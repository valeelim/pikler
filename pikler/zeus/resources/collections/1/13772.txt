Hearing     hearing is one of the five senses . the ears are used for detecting ( listening to ) vibrations in the air known as sounds . most animals can hear . most land vertebrates hear through ears . fish hear in several different ways . many use their swim bladder to hear , and many use their lateral line . in mammals , sound travels through three main parts of the ear to be heard . these are the outer , middle and inner ear . - outer ear - this is the part of the ear that we can see called the pinna as well as the inside of the ear called the ear canal . sound first travels through the pinna and ear canal then to the eardrum at the end of the canal which the sound makes vibrate . - middle ear - sound continues to travel deeper into the ear and is helped by three of the smallest bones in the body - hammer , anvil and stirrup - to reach the inner ear . - inner ear - here the sound reaches a small tube shaped like a snail shell , called the `` cochlea '' . inside the cochlea is a fluid , which moves tiny hairs that send signals to the brain which interprets sounds for you to understand and hear
