Ancient Egypt     ancient egypt , or the egyptian empire , was a society that began about 3150 bc , and lasted until 20 bc when it was invaded by the roman empire . egypt grew along the river nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium bc . its land went from the nile delta to nubia , a kingdom which today is mostly in the sudan . for most of its history , egypt was prosperous , since the water from the nile made sure that the egyptians would have good crops . crops were grown after the nile flood water went down . the egyptians created a way of writing using hieroglyphs , built huge temples and tombs , traded with other areas , and had a powerful army . their religion had many gods , and its priests were powerful and rich . their rulers , called pharaohs , were thought to be close to the gods . archaeologists , who study objects left by ancient people , have found that people have lived along the nile for a very long time . the fertile flood plains of the nile allowed people to begin farming . by the 10th millennium bc , the people in egypt had begun growing cereal grains like wheat and barley . because they were farming , they stayed in one place , and because they were settled , their society became more complex . this was an important step in the history of human civilization .
