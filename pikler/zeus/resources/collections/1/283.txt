Fine     if someone is found guilty of a crime , their punishment may be to pay a fine , a certain amount of money . in many countries , fines can be ordered by police , court judges and some government officers . when agreeing to a contract with a business , a customer may agree to certain rules . if the customer breaks the rules , then they agree to pay a fine for doing so . for example , when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by friday , they agree that if they do not return the car by friday , they must pay a $ 50 fine to the business .
