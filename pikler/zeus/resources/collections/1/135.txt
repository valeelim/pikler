Catharism     the cathar faith was a version of christianity . they were usually considered gnostics . the word 'cathar ' comes the greek word `` katharos '' meaning 'unpolluted ' ( from tobias churton , `` the gnostics '' ) or `` the pure ones '' . the cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god . they believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world , but inside their bodies there was a spirit , and that spirit needed to return to the good god . they were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person 's spirit in a new body . they believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing . they were opposed to the doctrine of sin . women were prominent in the faith . they were pacifists . they did n't eat anything that was made from other animals , including meat and cows milk . the only exception to this was fish . fish was ok to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water .
