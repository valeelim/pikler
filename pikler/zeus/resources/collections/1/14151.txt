Product (mathematics)    product ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a product is a number or a quantity obtained by multiplying two or more numbers together . for example : 4 × 7 = 28 here , the number 28 is called the product of 4 and 7. the product of 6 and 4 will be 24 , because 6 × 4 = 24. a short way to write the product of many numbers uses the capital greek letter pi : formula_1 . this notation works the same as the sigma notation . informally , given a sequence of numbers ( or elements of a multiplicative structure with unit ) say formula_2 we define formula_3 . a rigorous definition is usually given recursively as follows an alternative notation for formula_5 is formula_6 . from the above equation we can see that `` any '' number with an exponent can be represented by a product , though it normally is not desirable . unlike summation , the sums of two terms can not be separated into different sums . that is , this can be thought of in terms of polynomials : one generally can not separate terms inside them before they are raised to an exponent . but the product does ,
