Death     death is the end of life in an organism . all biological and living activity of the living thing stop , including the mind and the senses . the usual signal for death is that the heart stops beating and can not be restarted . this can be caused by many things . all living things have a limited lifespan , and all living things eventually die . living things which have died are normally described as being dead . death of humans is often investigated for the cause , in case of crime ( such as murder ) or disease that may continue to kill other humans . about 150,000 people die every day around the world . about two thirds of these people die because of age . in addition to the physical body , some believe humans also have a soul and believe that the soul can continue without a body ( afterlife ) , move into another body ( reincarnation ) , or cease to exist ( annihilationism ) . religions have different beliefs about this issue . many cultures have their own customs and rituals to respect the dead . when people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal , those things or events are usually described as being deadly , or fatal . in the case of diseases , they are described as `` terminal '' . humans are no different from any other lifeform . our bodies have an ability for self-repair , but that ability is limited . finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called pathology . in medicine , death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes . there are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes , such as near-drowning in very cold water . if machines are used to help the heart and lungs work , then the moment of death is more difficult to know .
