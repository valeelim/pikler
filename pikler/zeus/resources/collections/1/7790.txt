Rainbow     a rainbow is an arc of color in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain . the pattern of colors starts with red on the outside and changes through orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo to violet on the inside . a rainbow is created when white light is bent ( refracted ) while entering a droplet of water , split into separate colours , and reflected back . a rainbow is actually round like a circle . on the ground , the bottom part is hidden , but in the sky , like from a flying airplane , it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the sun . rainbows often appear after storms , and are popular symbols for peace and harmony in many cultures . the rainbow effect can be seen when : - there are water drops in the air ; and - the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle . rainbows always appear opposite the sun : they form circles around the shadow of your head ( which is the point opposite the sun ) . sunlight is white , and is a mixture of many different colors . water and other materials bend the different colors at different angles , some more strongly than others . this is called dispersion . by splitting up white light into separate colors , rainbows appear colorful even though the light hitting them is white .
