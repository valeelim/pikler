Peace     peace is a time without any fights or wars . in a larger sense , peace ( or peacefulness ) can mean a state of harmony , quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all , like a still pond with no dogs peace within and among states is a goal of many people and organizations . one organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the league of nations after world war i. when it failed to stop world war ii , it was replaced by the united nations which tries to make the world peaceful . this means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first , the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first . this idea was used by the united nations to defend both south korea and kuwait when they were attacked . martin luther king jr. wrote in a letter he sent from the birmingham jail that , `` true peace is not merely the absence of tension : it is the presence of justice . '' in other words , real peace is more than just problems being gone : there must be fairness to have peace .
