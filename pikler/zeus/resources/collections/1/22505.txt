Pasteurization     pasteurization ( or pasteurisation ) is a process of heat processing a liquid or a food to kill pathogenic bacteria to make the food safe to eat . it involves heating the food to kill most harmful microorganisms . producers pasteurize dairy and other foods to make them safe to eat . the process is named after louis pasteur . he was the first person to learn how to do it successfully . the first pasteurization was done by louis pasteur and claude bernard on 20 april 1862. unlike sterilization , pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food . instead , pasteurization gets a `` log reduction '' in the number of microorganisms . it brings their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease if the product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its sell-by date . commercial sterilization of food is not common , because it tends to destroy the flavour of the food . pasteurization is usually done to milk , which was first suggested by franz von soxhlet in 1886. there are two popular ways to pasteurize milk . first , high temperature/short time ( htst ) , and second , ultra-high temperature ( uht ) . htst is the most common method . milk only labeled `` pasteurized '' ( or `` past '' ) is usually treated with the htst method , whereas milk labelled `` ultra-pasteurized '' or `` uht '' must be treated with the uht method . htst is when the milk is at a temperature of 72 degrees celsius ( or 161.5 degrees fahrenheit ) for at least 15 seconds . uht is when the milk is at a temperature of 138 °c or 280 °f for at least two seconds .
