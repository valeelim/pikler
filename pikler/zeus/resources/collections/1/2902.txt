Centripetal force     centripetal force ( or acceleration ) is a type of force that acts on any body that revolves around a centre . this force contributes to keeping the body in circular motion . this force is always directed towards the centre . the opposite force ( by isaac newton 's third law of motion ) is called centrifugal force . this is the force that acts on the body in a direction away from the centre , which contributes to making the body try to fly away . when you hold a rope with a heavy object attached to it , and rotate it around , the rope becomes tight and keeps the body from flying away . this is caused by centripetal force . an example is a roller coaster which uses centripetal force to keep the carts going in a circular motion .
