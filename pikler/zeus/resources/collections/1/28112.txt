Electric current     an electric current is a flow of electric charge . the equation of current is : the si unit of electric current is the ampere ( a ) . this is equal to one coulomb of charge in one second . current can be found in wires , batteries , and lightning . in conducting materials , some electrons are very loosely bound to the atoms of the material . when large amounts of these atoms come together , there is a sort of electron cloud that `` hovers '' near the atoms of the material . if you examine a cross-section of the piece of conducting material , the electrons will move very quickly through it . this motion is caused by temperature , and electrons flowing in one direction tend to equal the electrons flowing from the other direction , so this is not what causes current to flow . electrons flow from one atom to another , a process has been compared to the passing of water buckets from one person to another in a bucket brigade . when an electric field is put on the wire , the electrons respond almost instantly by drifting slightly in the opposite direction of the field . they gain energy from the field , which is lost very quickly when they bump into other electrons in the material . as long as the field is in place , however , the electrons will gain back that energy that they lost , and the process will continue . this `` jolt '' that electrons receive from the electric field is the source of current , not the overall flow of electrons themselves . from this discussion , we can see two things that current is `` not '' :
