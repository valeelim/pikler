Michelson interferometer     the michelson interferometer is the tool used for optical interferometry . it was invented by albert abraham michelson , famous for proving the inexistence of luminiferous aether in the michelson-morley experiment . there are two mirrors in the interferometer , one fixed and the other is movable through a micrometer . there is also a beam splitter that separates the laser or light beam and a screen that shows the interference pattern . a wide laser or light beam is first shot at the beam splitter . reflection takes place as the beam hits the beam splitter , part of it reflects towards mirror 1 while the rest towards mirror 2. the two beams again reflect off mirror 1 and 2 and travel back to the beam splitter , the two beams that goes through the beam splitter will combine and form an interference pattern at the screen . the interference pattern will appear as bands and each band represents 2 path length difference or 1 wavelength , that is because the crest of wave 1 has caught up with the crest of wave 2 ( or the other way around ) , causing a constructive interference . if given the change in distance of the movable mirror and number of bands on the screen , we can easily calculate the wavelength of the light source .
