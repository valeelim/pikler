Flaying     flaying is a form of torture , mutilation , and execution . it is the act of stripping the skin and flesh from the bones . flaying an enemy while alive is an ancient practice . accounts attribute the practice to the ancient assyrians , who were said to flay the skin from a captured enemy or rebellious ruler and nail it to the wall of his city , as warning to all who would defy their power . searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of traitors in medieval europe . a similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in france ; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of michel foucault 's `` discipline and punish '' ( 1979 ) .
