Sacrament     in christianity , a sacrament is a special rite . it is a visible token of the reality of god . the roman catholic church knows seven such sacraments . these are - baptism - usually given shortly after birth , it is meant to forgive original sin . - confirmation - done when reaching maturity - holy eucharist - the body and blood of jesus christ is eaten to remember the last supper . - marriage - holy orders - the deacon , the priest and bishop . - penance and remission of sins - anointing of the sick - used to be known as last rites , given shortly before death following martin luther 's tradition , many protestant churches see only baptism and lord 's supper as sacraments . they also have most of the other rites , but do not consider them to be sacraments . eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox churches basically have the same views as the roman catholic church . they say however , that many things the church does ( as church ) , can be seen as sacraments , in some way .
