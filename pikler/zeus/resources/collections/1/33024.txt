Coral fungi     coral fungior claviroid fungi , are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral , but can also be shaped like forks , worms or clubs . they are rubbery and sometimes are brightly coloured . originally , such fungi were put in the genus `` clavaria '' , and called `` clavarioid '' , which means `` clavaria '' -like . it is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related . since they are often studied as a group , we keep the informal ( non-taxonomic ) name of `` clavarioid fungi '' , and it is frequently used in research papers . most coral fungi grow on the ground , but some grow on logs and stumps . they are usually found in forests but some can also be found in fields . although they are not poisonous , some kinds are a laxative and some can cause stomach upset .
