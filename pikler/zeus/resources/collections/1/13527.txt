Calcium     calcium is a chemical element . its symbol on the periodic table ( a list of all the elements ) is ca . its atomic number is 20 . ( the atomic number says where calcium sits in the periodic table . ) it has 20 protons and 20 electrons ( if is an atom , see ion ) . the most common isotopes are ca-40 and ca-44 . its mass number is about 40.08. calcium is very important in the human body , for making bones and for other purposes . calcium is a soft white-gray metal . it is a solid and is opaque . it is an alkaline earth metal . its melting point is hotter than most other reactive metals . it is a little harder than lead . it has two allotropes . it does not conduct electricity as well as copper , but is much lighter in weight . it reacts with water to produce hydrogen and calcium hydroxide . it reacts with water very fast when it is powdered . when it is in a chunk , it starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium . if a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide , it dissolves it , making the calcium react very fast . it burns when powdered to make a reddish flame . this makes calcium oxide . it also makes calcium nitride when heated . it can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine .
