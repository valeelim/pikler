Rhea Silvia     rhea silvia is the mother of the twin brothers romulus and remus in roman mythology . she was the daughter of numitor silvius , king of alba longa . when numitor 's brother amulius became king by force , he made rhea silvia a vestal virgin , so she would not have children who could be kings instead of him . but the god mars seduced her and she had the twins romulus and remus . because of that she was buried alive ( put in the earth so she died because she could not breathe ) , which was the common punishment for a vestal virgin who did not remain a virgin . her sons were thrown into the tiber by the servant , but were saved by the river god tiberinus , who also saved rhea silvia and married her . tiberinus , whence the name of the river tiber comes , married rhea silvia while the twins , romulus and remus , were raised by a she-wolf . a few months later a shepherd found them and raised them . when they where a bit older they decided to name a city after its ruler , the only problem is they both wanted to rule . so in the end they decided to fight and romulus won , while his brother died , and named the city rome .
