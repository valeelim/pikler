Complex number     a complex number is a number , but is different from normal numbers in many ways . a complex number is made up using two numbers combined together . the first part is a real number . the second part of a complex number is an imaginary number . the most important imaginary number is called formula_1 , defined as a number that will be -1 when squared ( `` squared '' means `` multiplied by itself '' ) : formula_2 . all the other imaginary numbers are formula_1 multiplied by a real number , in the same way that all real numbers can be thought of as 1 multiplied by another number . arithmetic functions such as , addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division can be used with complex numbers . they also follow commutative , associative and distributive properties , just like real numbers . complex numbers were invented to answer special equations that have exponents in them . these began to pose real problems for mathematicians . as a comparison , using negative numbers , it is possible to find the `` x '' in the equation formula_4 for all real values of `` a '' and `` b '' .
