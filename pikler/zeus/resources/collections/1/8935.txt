Cornish language     cornish is a very old language from the unitary authority area of cornwall in the southwest of england , uk . cornish is a celtic language and is very similar to welsh , and slightly to gaelic . a long time ago cornish was the only language spoken in cornwall , but more and more people began to speak english instead of cornish . in 1550 , when the prayer book was written in english instead of latin , the cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion . because many cornish speakers died and because they would now hear the bible in english the language was used less and less . by 1800 there were only a few people who could speak cornish , and no-one spoke it to each other any more . the language was then considered endangered . pople say that a woman called dolly pentreath was the last person who could speak cornish . this is not quite true , but she was one of the last people to use it instead of english . some people learned about cornish by traveling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books . some people wanted to learn the language and speak it , so in 1904 a learned man called henry jenner wrote a book to help people . after this some people began to learn the language and speak it again .
