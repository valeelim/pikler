Head of state     the head of state of a country is its highest leader . however , the head of state may not have very much real power . in a modern republic , the head of state is a president , usually elected by the people or by a parliament . in a monarchy , the head of state is the king or queen . some countries have different systems - for example the head of state of the vatican city is the pope . in a modern monarchy , the head of state usually has little real power . instead , the most powerful person is the head of government . this is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in an election . in these cases the king is considered to be the leader of the country , but must always take the decisions that the head of government advises them to make . the king or queen carries out national ceremonies . the united kingdom works like this , with the prime minister heading the government . a president may be the most powerful person in the country . this is true in the united states . however , sometimes there is a head of government , as well as a president . the president then acts very much like a king or queen , leaving the real decisions to the head of government . the republic of ireland works like this .
