Tram     a tram ( tramcar , trolley , streetcar , or street railway ) is a passenger vehicle that is like a light train . it carries people to places within a city . because a single tram can carry many people at the same time , riding on a tram instead of driving a car is a good way to help prevent pollution and stop the roads getting too busy . the word `` tram '' is used mainly outside north america , while within north america these vehicles are called `` streetcars '' or `` trolleys '' as they run mainly on streets . more modern and larger trams manufactured since the 1970s , such as the one in the second picture from warsaw , are called light rail vehicles . these vehicles are bigger because they are very often made of two or more parts , with a bendy section in the middle which works like a human joint . in railway jargon , these types of vehicles are called `` articulated '' . these may sometimes have their own right-of-way instead of traveling on the street and their stops are usually farther apart than the stops of trams so that they can travel faster .
