Crazy Horse     crazy horse ( born about 1838 â€“ died september 5 , 1877 ) was an oglala sioux native american chief . there is a huge sculpture being carved of him in south dakota , united states . when crazy horse was first born he was given the name 'curly ' . when he was young , he had a vision when he was not supposed to and his family did not know where he was . his father found him and was very unhappy at what young curly had done . as crazy horse grew into a man , he was given his father 's name crazy horse . his father then changed his own name to worm . crazy horse had good medicine , so he was never killed when he went into battle . he led his people to the little bighorn river in northern montana to join forces with other sioux bands like the hunkpapa and miniconjou , and with other tribes like the cheyennes and arapahos . there they fought general george armstrong custer , killing and defeating him and his many horsemen . eventually crazy horse made a tough decision to lead his people , the oglalas , to a reservation because they were starving . game was scarce and the bison ( buffalo ) were nearly gone . he had no choice but to leave the black hills . when he arrived at fort robinson , he was forced to give up his weapons and horses . this made him very unhappy . one day , even though he was granted time to go on a hunt , he was lied to and , trying to get away , he was stabbed in his liver and died later that night , thus ending the great sioux war .
