Booting     booting is what happens when a computer starts up . when you boot a computer , your processor looks in system rom ( the bios ) for instructions and does them . they normally 'wake up ' peripheral equipment and search for the boot device . the boot device either loads the operating system or gets it from someplace else . people use the word `` boot '' to mean `` to start a computer '' or other device with electronics built in . for example , if a person wants to ask a friend to turn on a satellite phone , they would say `` could you boot up the satellite phone ? '' . most operating systems call the first data storage device it uses a boot device . it may also be called a bootstrap loader . this is because the computer is making itself go , as in the idiom . when we start a computer , we can often see the simple instructions the computer uses to start , then more complicated pictures or software . the phrase `` to boot '' in this meaning is short for `` to bootstrap '' . this use is part of net jargon along with similar multi-use words like internet or web . often the computer is just called a box , so a phrase like `` to boot the box '' means `` to start the computer '' .
