Great auk     the great auk was a large bird , that could not fly . people hunted it for meat and feathers . it grew rare , because it was too easy to kill , and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones . the last known great auks ( there were two auks ) were killed on june 3 , 1844 in iceland . it lived mostly in the water , like a duck . penguins got their name from the great auk . the word `` penguin '' was the celtic word for `` great auk '' . when sailors saw penguins for the first time , they thought they looked like great auks . the great auk was covered in black feathers , but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen . it had very short wings , like stubs , which meant it could not fly . on land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall . they spent most of their time at sea , coming to shore in the summer to breed . they lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north atlantic ocean from canada to norway . females laid one egg on bare rock . in winter they went as far south as florida and southern spain .
