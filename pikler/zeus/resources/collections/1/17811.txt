Friction     friction is a force that acts to stop the movement of two touching things . the energy lost to friction is turned into sound and heat . two kinds of friction are static and kinetic . static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects . kinetic friction is used when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion . some facts about friction are : - friction can be thought to be caused by bumps on two touching surfaces . these bumps are called asperities . as these two rough surfaces move against each other they get stuck and prevent motion until the asperities are broken or slid over . even the smoothest materials have these asperities . - as the force that is pushing on an object increases , the static friction increases too . however , if the force gets bigger than the maximum static friction , it makes the object accelerate ( begin to move ) . the thing will begin to accelerate as soon as the static friction is less than the force pushing on it . after that point kinetic friction will act on the object .
