C (programming language)    c ( programming language ) the c programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system unix and is an imperative programming language . c was developed in the early 1970 by ken thompson and dennis ritchie . it is a procedural language , which means that people can write their programs as a series of step-by-step instructions . c is a compiled language . because the ideas behind c are kept close to the design of the computer , the compiler ( program builder ) can generate machine code/native code for the computer . programs built in machine code are very fast . this makes c a good language for writing operating systems . many operating systems , including linux and unix , are programmed using this language . the language itself has very few keywords , and most things are done using libraries , which are collections of code for them to be reused . c is available for many different types of computers . this is why c is called a `` portable '' language . a program that is written in c and that respects certain limitations can be compiled for many different platforms .
