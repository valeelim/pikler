Brain     the brain is the part of the body which lets us , as well as animals , make sense of things . it gets input from sense organs , and changes behaviour in response to this information . in humans , the brain also controls our use of language , and is capable of abstract thought . the brain is the control centre of the whole body . the brain is made up of a special type of cells . they are connected with each other and with the nerves in our body . in all animals the delicate brain is protected in some way . in ourselves , and all vertebrates , it is protected by the bones of the skull . the brain does the thinking , learning , and feeling for the body . for humans , it is the source of consciousness . the brain also controls basic autonomic body actions , like breathing , digestion , heartbeat , that happen automatically . these activities , and much else , are governed by unconscious functions of the brain and nervous system . all the information about the world gathered by our senses is sent through nerves into the brain , allowing us to see , hear , smell , taste and feel things . the brain processes this information , and we experience it as pictures , sounds , and so on . the brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do , for example by telling muscles to move or our heart to beat faster .
