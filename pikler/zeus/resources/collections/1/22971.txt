Musical note     in music , a note is a small bit of sound , similar to a syllable in speaking a language . for example : in the first two lines of the song `` twinkle , twinkle little star , how i wonder what you are '' there are 14 notes : one for each syllable . confusingly , the word `` note '' can also mean the pitch of a note ( how high or low it is ) . for example : the whole of the song `` twinkle , twinkle , little star '' can be played using six different notes : c , d , e , f , g and a. the word `` note '' can also mean the written symbol of the note . nearly all music is made up of notes . music without notes might be sound effects . in some western countries , like united kingdom , germany and the usa , the notes ( in the sense of the pitches ) are given a letter of the alphabet according to their pitch . from lowest sounding to highest sounding : a , b , c , d , e , f , g. this pattern repeats , so that after g will come a. this a is an octave higher than the first a. because there are 12 notes needed in western music , these 7 notes can have modifiers ( `` symbols or words that change them '' ) . the two main modifiers are sharps , which raise the pitch a half-step , and flats , which lower the pitch a half-step . the symbol for a sharp is ♯ ( like the hash symbol ( american : number symbol ) : # ) . the symbol for a flat is ♭ ( like a lower-case italic `` b '' ) . to un-flat or un-sharp a note , the natural symbol , ♮ , is written before the note . when writing in words ( like this page ) , the symbols are written after the note name , for example : `` b♭ '' means b flat and `` f♯ '' represents f sharp . however , when writing in music notation , the flat , sharp or natural signs are written before the note . a way to remember this is to say : if the sign came after the note , it would be too late , and you would have already played it , so it must go before so that you know what is coming .
