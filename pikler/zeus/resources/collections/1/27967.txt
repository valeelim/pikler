Placenta     the placenta is a temporary organ found in eutherian female mammals while they are pregnant . the placenta is connected to the fetus by the umbilical cord , which is made of blood vessels and connective tissue . when the fetus is delivered , the placenta is delivered afterwards . the placenta is often called the afterbirth . one of the placenta 's jobs is to make sure blood from the mother and fetus never mixes . the placenta acts as an exchange surface between the mother and the fetus . nutrients and oxygen are passed over by diffusion only . if the mother 's and fetus 's blood mixed , it could be deadly for both of them . if the mother and the fetus had different blood types , they might both die if their blood mixed . the placenta has two parts , one of which is genetically and biologically part of the fetus , the other part of the mother . it is implanted in the wall of the uterus , where it receives nutrients and oxygen from the mother 's blood and passes out waste . this forms a barrier called the placental barrier , which filters out some substances which could harm the fetus .
