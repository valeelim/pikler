Speed of light     the speed of light in empty space is a universal physical constant . this means it is the same everywhere in empty space and does not change with time . physicists often use the letter to denote the speed of light in empty space ( vacuum ) . it has the value 299,792,458 meters per second ( or about 186,282.397 miles per second ) . a photon ( particle of light ) travels at this speed in a vacuum . according to special relativity , is the maximum speed at which all energy , matter , and physical information in the universe can travel . it is the speed of all massless particles such as photons , and associated fields—including electromagnetic radiation such as light—in a vacuum . it is predicted by the current theory to be the speed of gravity ( that is , gravitational waves ) . such particles and waves travel at regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial frame of reference of the observer . in the theory of relativity , interrelates space and time , and appears in the famous equation of mass–energy equivalence `` e '' = '' mc '' .
