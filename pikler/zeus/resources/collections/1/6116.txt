Village     a village is a place where people live , normally in the countryside . it is usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town or city . in some places , it may be a kind of local government . the dwellings in a village are clustered fairly close to one another , not scattered broadly over the landscape . in the past , villages were where most people lived . villages were a usual form of community for societies that do subsistence agriculture , and for some non-agricultural societies . after the industrial revolution , when people started making a lot of things in factories , people lived more in towns . moving to towns is called urbanization . when villages grow a lot they can grow into towns and then cities . this is what happened to dubai and chicago . in the u.k. the biggest difference between a hamlet and a village is that villages have a church . the word `` village '' is not used in most states . however , in twenty us states , a `` village '' is a sort of local government , similar to a city but with less power and for a smaller place . but this is not so in all the united states . in many states , there are villages which are bigger than the smallest cities in the state . the difference is not the population , it is how much power the different sorts of places have , and what they do for people living there .
