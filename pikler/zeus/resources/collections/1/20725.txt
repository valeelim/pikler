Anthropomorphism     anthropomorphism is making something which is not a human , more human-like in a story or art . this can mean making the thing shaped more like a human . it can mean giving it human emotions , goals , or the ability to talk . it is often used in stories . the thing or object may be an animal , plant , deity , sound , storm , idea , or anything else . the story of the `` three little pigs '' has a wolf and pigs who talk and act like humans . mickey mouse also talks and acts like a human . these are examples of a type of anthropomorphism called furry . the novel `` the call of the wild '' also uses anthropomorphism . the main character is a dog named buck . many other characters are dogs and wolves . in the story , the animals think and act more like humans than real dogs do . humans are good at knowing why other humans do things . humans are not as good at knowing why non-human things ( like animals ) do things . this can lead to people assuming non-human things will act or think like humans . this is the reason art that shows gods or alien life often shows them as human-like .
