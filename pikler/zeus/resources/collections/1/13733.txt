Record label     a record label or record company makes and sells audio and video recordings , on various formats including compact discs , lps , dvd-audio , sacds , and cassettes . the name `` record label '' is from the paper label at the center of a gramophone record ( what is also known as a `` phonograph record '' in american english ) . most major record labels are owned by a few large multinational companies ( big four record labels ) that make up the almost all of the global recording industry , although there is a recent resurgence in independent record labels . recording companies often spend a lot of time and money in discovering new musicians or developing the talent of artists they already have signed up with a contract . the association of the brand with the artists helps define the image of both the brand and the artist . in spite of the fact that both parties need each other to survive , the relationship between record labels and artists can , at times , be a difficult one . many artists have had albums changed or censored in some way by the labels before they are releasedâ€”songs being edited , artwork or titles being changed , etc . record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made . often the record label 's decisions are correct ones from a commercial perspective , but this typically frustrates the artist who feels that their artwork is being destroyed .
