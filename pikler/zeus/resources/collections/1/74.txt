Breakfast sausage     breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs . breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage , such as polish or italian-style sausages . breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages , which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased ( unless they are frozen ) . uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer . individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water , because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans . pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked . they are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast , often with cooked eggs , pancakes , and toasted bread . breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes , such as `` toad in the hole '' a cooked batter dish . different types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found . there are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat . breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll , or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness .
