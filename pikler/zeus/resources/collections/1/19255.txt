Chlorofluorocarbon     chlorofluorocarbons ( cfc ) are gases used for various purposes including solvents , refrigerants and aerosol sprays . they are organic chemicals and contain carbon , ( sometimes hydrogen , ) chlorine , and fluorine . they were much used in the middle 20th century , replacing chemicals that were toxic or flammable or had other problems . in 1978 , sweden became the first country that banned cfc products . later , the us and canada did the same . now , cfc products are not allowed in most countries , because they cause ozone depletion . cfcs also are greenhouse gases . an alternative is hydrofluorocarbons ( hfcs ) . these do not destroy the ozone layer or increase global warming . related pages . - thomas midgley ( american inventor ) - freon
