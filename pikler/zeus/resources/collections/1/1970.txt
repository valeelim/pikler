Climate     climate means the usual condition of the temperature , humidity , atmospheric pressure , wind , rainfall , and other meteorological elements in an area of the earth 's surface for a long time . climate is different from weather . weather is the condition of these elements right now , for shorter periods of time that are up to two weeks . the latitude , ground , and height can change the climate of a location . it is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby . climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation . the most commonly used classification was the köppen climate classification , first made by wladimir köppen . the thornthwaite system , which was used from 1948 , not only uses temperature and precipitation information , but evapotranspiration too . this makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are , and about the things that could happen when climates change . the bergeron and spatial synoptic classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from .
