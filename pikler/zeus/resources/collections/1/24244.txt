Rodent     rodents are a very successful group of mammals . they form the order rodentia . they have four incisors . these keep growing , and must be kept worn down by gnawing ( eroding teeth by grinding them on something hard ) ; this is the origin of the name , from the latin `` rodere '' , `` to gnaw '' , and `` dent '' , `` tooth '' . most rodents are small . examples of commonly known rodents are mice , rats , chipmunks , and squirrels . some other small rodents sometimes kept as pets are guinea pigs , hamsters , and gerbils . examples of larger rodents are porcupines , beavers , and the largest living rodent , the capybara , which can grow to between 105 and 135 cm ( 40-55 in ) in length , and weigh 35 to 65 kg ( 75-140 lbs ) . almost half of all mammal species are rodents . more examples of rodents are voles , prairie dogs , groundhogs , and chinchillas . rabbits , hares , and pikas are sometimes called rodents , because they also have teeth that keep growing . but in 1912 biologists decided to put them in a new , separate order , lagomorpha , because they have two extra incisors in their upper jaw .
