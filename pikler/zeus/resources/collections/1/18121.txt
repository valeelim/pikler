Office     an office is generally a room or other area where administrative work is done . it may also be a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it . for example , the office of treasurer . an office is a design phenomenon . it can be a small office such as a bench in the corner of a very small business . it can also be anything up to and including large buildings full of offices . in modern use an office usually means the location where white-collar workers are employed . men have done administrative work for many centuries . but it is not clear when the room where paperwork was created began to be thought of an office . in the earliest european history it may have been a room in a palace where some kind of accounting was done for the king . earlier forms of keeping records were known but were not confined to a room or rooms . for example , in ancient china string was knotted to keep count of things as a record . but the record-keeper 's `` office '' was not a room but wherever he needed to be to count something .
