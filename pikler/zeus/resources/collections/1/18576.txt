Bahá'í Faith     the bahá'í faith is an abrahamic religion started in the 1800s by an iranian person called bahá'u'lláh who was born in tehran , iran . followers of this religion call themselves bahá'ís . the name bahá'u'lláh is arabic for `` the glory of god '' . `` glory '' is a word that means `` importance '' , `` power '' , and `` beauty '' . bahá'ís believe bahá'u'lláh is a representation of god , or speaks for god , and he shows people god 's importance , beauty , and brightness . bahá'ís are monotheists ( which means that they believe in one god ) . they believe bahá'u'lláh carried a message from god . bahá'u'lláh said he was not the only person to carry a message from god , and he was not the last to carry a message from god . he taught that the people who started the other major religions also represented and carried messages from god , such as jesus , moses , abraham , muhammad , krishna , the buddha and others . he called these people `` manifestations of god . '' they believe the messages from the manifestations of god get more and more difficult to understand . they say the ones that came earlier on had a more simple message than the ones that came later . because god is greater than the whole universe , bahá'u'lláh said that human beings can not completely know god . he said that god wants people to know as much about him as they can . bahá'u'lláh wrote god sends special people to manifest ( show ) himself to ordinary humans . without the manifestations of god we could not know god . bahá'ís believe the god they pray to is the same god abraham spoke to , jesus talked about , and krishna said in gita . since bahá'u'lláh was born in a muslim family , bahá'ís are sometimes mistaken as muslims . bahá'u'lláh is considered the prophet/manifestation of the present day . bahá'ís say that he is not the last prophet/manifestation of god . they think there will not be another prophet for 1,000 years after baha'u'llah 's death .
