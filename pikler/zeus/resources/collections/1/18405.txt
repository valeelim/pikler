Triple point     the triple point of water or any substance is the combination of temperature and pressure at which it exists in its solid , liquid , and gaseous state all at once , in equilibrium . the temperature of the triple point of water is a commonly used physical constant which is used to define temperature scales and calibrate temperature-measuring systems . `` by definition '' , the temperature of the triple point of water is 273.16 kelvin , or 0.01 Â°c . one degree celsius is defined as 1/273.16 part of the triple point of water . this fixes the temperature scale as defined in the its 90 , which is the international temperature scale of 1990. this scale is developed as a practical approximation of the thermodynamical temperature scale .
