Shadow     a shadow is a dark area on a bright surface . it is caused by something blocking a source of light . a shadow 's outline , called a `` silhouette '' , will have the same shape as the object blocking the light . depending on the environment of its passage , the intensity and angle of his fall , its color characteristics , direction and distance from the object and the surface , and the last - of each other , the nature of texture , reflectivity , transparency and shape of them - can change the sharpness and hardness of circuits , the degree of contrast with the surface , the depth and darkness of coloring this silhouette ( with barely perceptible , pale gray or dull color - to very dark color , and velvety-black ) . if there is contact between the object and the surface , the shadow will certainly have a `` touch '' with him , and in the absence thereof - object casts a shadow on the surface as well as the silhouette figures , repeating its outlines , and meet all of the above conditions , but isolated from it ( number of amendments makes no factor of this contact , affecting the uniformity in color and silhouette ) . the shadow will be completely or partially cover the objects in between it and the objects closest to the radiation source . it occurs on the surface of the object itself - from the light source , and the presence of one such source and opacity , it will be deeper than - the bed to an independent surface , but the dark side of the object can also be obtained from the reflection of the surface or other objects . this empirical determination significantly epistemologically different from the one given to this phenomenon : physics , which operates the concepts of phase states of matter , the wave nature of light and optics - the psychology of color perception and physiology of vision .
