Evil     evil means something which is morally bad or wicked . it is the opposite of good . people may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the ten commandments is evil . a person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil . in theology , there is a question : `` if there is a god , why does god let evil happen ? '' some think that evil proves that there is not a god . others think that god lets evil happen so that people can choose `` not '' to do evil . the study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics . ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil . it attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good . a version of the problem of evil , perhaps by epicurus , goes as follows : 1. if a perfectly good god exists , then evil does not . 1. there is evil in the world . 1. therefore , a perfectly good god does not exist . another argument goes : 1. god exists . 1. god is omnipotent , omniscient , and perfectly good . 1. a perfectly good being would want to prevent all evils .
