Topology     topology is the study of how spaces are organized , how the objects are structured in terms of position . it also studies how spaces are connected . it is divided into `` algebraic topology '' , `` differential topology '' and `` geometric topology '' . topology has sometimes been called rubber-sheet geometry , because in topology of 2 dimensions , there is no difference between a circle and a square ( a circle made out of a rubber band can be stretched into a square ) but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight ( you can not stretch a figure eight into a circle without tearing ) . the spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces . they vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions . in many problems , we often divide a large space into smaller areas , for instance , a house is divided into rooms , a nation into states , a type of quantity into numbers , etc . each of these smaller areas ( room , state , number ) is next to other small areas ( other rooms/states/numbers ) , and the places where the areas meet are connections . if we write down on paper a list of spaces , and the connections between them , we have written down a description of a space -- a topological space . all topological spaces have the same properties ( connections , etc . ) and are made of the same structure ( a list of smaller areas ) . this makes it easier to study how spaces behave in general , and to use general algorithms . for instance , to program a robot to navigate a house , we simply give it a list of rooms , the connections between each room ( doors , etc . ) , and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room .
