Fact     a fact is a statement that is real or true , or a thing that can be shown to be real or true . a fact is something that has really happened or is actually the case . the usual test for a statement of fact is whether it can be seen to be true . standard reference works are often used to check facts . scientific facts are verified by careful observation or measurement ( by experiments or other means ) . a fact is a `` statement '' ( what a person says ) about something that is true . a fact can answer questions like , `` what color is it ? '' or `` who made that ? '' an opinion is different from a fact . but you can say facts about a person 's opinion . for example , someone can ask a question like `` what is alice 's opinion about the book ? '' you can answer this question with a fact , for example `` alice said she likes the book . '' then it is a fact that alice `` says '' she likes the book . but maybe alice does not like the book . so it not a fact that alice likes the book , but it is a fact that alice `` says '' she likes the book .
