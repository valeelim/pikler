Seizure     a seizure happens when the nerves in a person 's brain act strangely . nerves send information , partly through electrical signals . usually , nerves in the brain ( called neurons ) do not fire at the same time . during a seizure , groups of nerves start firing together , too fast . this causes there to be too much disorganized electrical activity in the brain . most people think a person with a seizure will shake and twitch . some will , but there are also other kinds of seizures . there are many different types of seizures . they are named by how much of the brain they affect and what happens to the person when they are having that type of seizure . in partial seizures , only a small part of the brain is involved in the seizure . these seizures can be more specifically called : - simple partial : the person stays awake the whole time the seizure is happening . they may twitch ( especially in just one part of their body ) , feel dizzy , or smell and taste things that are not there . - complex partial : the person `` zones out '' during the seizure and may seem confused , experience deja vu , laugh , feel afraid , see things that are not there , or smell something bad . the person may also do something over and over again , like button and rebuttal a shirt .
