Adverb     an adverb is a word used to tell more about a verb , and it almost always answers the questions `` how ? `` , `` when ? `` , `` where ? `` , `` how often ? `` , and `` in what way ? '' . words like `` slowly '' , `` loudly '' , `` carefully '' , `` quickly '' , `` quietly '' or `` sadly '' are all adverbs . adverbs usually , but not always , end in `` -ly '' . examples of adverbs in a sentence ( with the adverb in italics ) : that is a weird word and is seen differently - how did the man walk ? the man walked `` slowly '' . - how did the dogs bark ? the dogs barked `` loudly '' . an adverb can also modify ( describe ) an adjective or another adverb examples : - adverb modifying a verb : he writes well - adverb modifying another adverb : he writes very well - adverb modifying an adjective : he is very well in the first two examples the word 'well ' is an adverb . in the last example , it is an adjective . this is one example in which the same word can be both an adjective and an adverb but not in the same sentence . as a rule , the same word can play different roles but not in the same sentence . it all depends on what the word is doing in the sentence . it could be a noun , an adjective , an adverb , a verb , etc . example : take the word 'cool ' . in the sentence , `` he walks cool '' , the word 'cool ' is an adverb . in the sentence , `` cool the hot dish '' , the word 'cool ' is a verb . in the sentence , `` it is a cool evening '' , the word 'cool ' is an adjective . in the first example , `` he walks cool '' , the word 'cool ' really means 'coolly ' as in `` play it cool '' ( do not get excited ; be calm ) .
