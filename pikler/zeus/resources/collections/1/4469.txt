The Holocaust     the holocaust , sometimes called the `` shoah '' ( `` '' ) , was when nazi germany killed people in a planned and forced way during world war ii . about six million jews were killed , as well as five million of others that the nazis said were bad ( e.g. , romani/roma people , homosexuals , communists , people who were not white , people with disabilities , slavs , transgender people , and jehovah 's witnesses ) . these people were rounded up , put in ghettos , forced to work in concentration camps and then killed in big gas chambers . there was hatred and persecution of jews ( anti-semitism ) in europe for hundreds of years . many people wrongly thought that all jews were rich , mean , and not social . these simple ideas were popular in the german-speaking world and elsewhere in the late 1800s . adolf hitler was born in austria during this time , when many people disliked jews . he may have been jealous of jewish success in austria . however , in a book he wrote called `` mein kampf '' ( `` my struggle '' ) , he said it was the jews ' fault that germany and austria lost world war i. he also wrote that germany 's economic problems were the jews ' fault . many people agreed with hitler â€™ s ideas and supported him as the leader of the nazi party .
