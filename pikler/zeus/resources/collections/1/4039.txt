Snow     snow is a form of ice . snow forms when water in the atmosphere becomes frozen . snow comes in all different shapes and sizes . at the freezing point of water ( 0° celsius , 32° fahrenheit ) , snow melts and becomes liquid water . sometimes , the snow will melt very fast and become water vapor . this is called sublimation . the opposite , where water vapor becomes snow , is called deposition . snow is used for some winter sport activities like skiing and sledding . sometimes people make artificial snow so they can ski . people also commonly build things out of snow for fun . snow can also be dangerous , as it can lower visibility and make driving very difficult . when it snows , the snow will melt a little during the daytime and freeze again at night . this makes ice which can make driving conditions very treacherous . snow plows are used to remove snow from roads to make driving easier and safer . also , sand or salt may be added to the road to help tires grip the road . when salt is mixed with snow , the snow will melt more easily . this is because salt water has a lower melting point than fresh water ( water without salt ) .
