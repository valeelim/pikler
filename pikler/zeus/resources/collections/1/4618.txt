Herbivore     herbivores are animals that eat plants . they are `` herbivorous '' animals . humans are believed to be omnivores , because they eat meat as well as vegetable matter . however , research has shown that humans are more suited to a herbivore or frugivore diet because of the shape and make up of our hands , feet and teeth . people who eat mostly plants are usually called vegetarians or vegans . herbivores ( such as deer , elephants , horses ) have teeth that are adapted to grind vegetable tissue . many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants , for example roots and seeds . usually , such animals can not chew or digest meat . but some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein . some herbivores can be classified as `` frugivores '' , because they eat mainly fruit ; or `` browsers '' , which eat mostly leaves . animals that eat mostly grass are `` grazing '' animals . the diets of some herbivorous animals change with the seasons . in the temperate zones of the earth , some seasons are hot and some are cold , so different plants are available at different times of the year .
