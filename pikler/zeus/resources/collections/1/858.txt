Universe     the universe is commonly defined as everything that exists . it includes all kinds of physical matter and energy , the planets , stars , galaxies , and all the contents of space . astronomers can use telescopes to look at very distant galaxies . like this they see what the universe looked like a long time ago . this is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us . from these observations , it seems the physical laws and constants of the universe have not changed . physicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the big bang . they are also unsure whether the size of the universe is infinite . many people in history had ideas to explain the universe . most early models had the earth at the centre of the universe . some ancient greeks thought that the universe has infinite space and has existed forever . they thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars , the sun and various planets . the spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving earth .
