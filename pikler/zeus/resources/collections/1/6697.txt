Hedonism     hedonism is a type of philosophy . hedonism can be generally summed up as a belief that `` pleasure is the highest good '' or that `` whatever causes pleasure is right . '' in hedonism , people think that what makes them happy is good . things that avoid pain are also good . hedonism is focused around pleasure . there are different beliefs in hedonism . some people believe it is important to get as many pleasurable experiences as possible , others believe that the quality of the pleasure matters . they think there are higher and lower pleasures . many people also believe hedonism is related to sex . this is not true . sex can be a very pleasurable experience , but when philosophers talk about hedonism , they think more about the pleasure of reading a good book , listening to classical music , or discussing with other philosophers . two types of hedonism are cyrenaicism and epicureanism . cyrenaicism is where people make themselves happy in the fastest amount of time . epicureanism is where people like to be happy but they do so slowly so that they cause less pain to themselves . they also look more into the future and go for the higher pleasures in life .
