Etruscan mythology     the etruscans were people in central italy who became part of rome . many of the gods below became part of the roman pantheon . very little etruscan writing has survived : only two short , incomplete texts , and some grave inscriptions ( writing on stone ) . no-one can read or write the etruscan language very well now . roman people wrote about the etruscans but what they wrote is now lost . the main three gods were tinia , uni and menrva .
