Dutch language     dutch ( `` nederlands '' ) is a language which comes from the netherlands and is the country 's official language . it is also spoken in the northern half of belgium ( the region called flanders ) , and in the south american country of suriname . a language known as `` afrikaans '' was developed from dutch by the people in southern africa and is now spoken mainly in south africa but also in nearby namibia . about 22 million people around the world speak dutch . dutch is a west germanic language the west germanic branch is divided into english , frisian , german and dutch . it is why dutch is very much like english in its vocabulary and grammar , though it resembles german more than english does . the north germanic languages of danish , norwegian , swedish and icelandic are also part of the germanic language branch . dutch is also in some cases like these languages . the dutch of before 1170 is called `` old dutch '' ( oudnederlands ) . the dutch between 1170 and 1500 is called `` middle dutch '' ( middelnederlands ) , which is also called `` diets '' . that 's why dutch is called dutch in english . the word `` dutch '' itself came from the proto-germanic word `` '' , which means `` language of the common people '' and which at the time was also used to refer to the germans and their language . over time , the modern english usage is now used to refer to that of the netherlands and not the germans . the dutch word for german , `` duits '' , comes from the same origin .
