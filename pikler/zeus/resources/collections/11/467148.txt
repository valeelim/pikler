Foundation (engineering)    foundation ( engineering ) a foundation is the lowest part of a building . a building needs a strong foundation if it is to stand for a long time . to make a foundation , engineers dig a trench in the ground . they dig until they reach solid ground . when the trench is deep enough , it is filled it with strong , hard material . sometimes concrete is used . concrete can be made stronger by putting long thin round pieces of steel into the trench . when the concrete dries , the steel ties the foundation together . we call this reinforced concrete . once the foundation has been packed down tightly , or dried hard , construction can start .
