Null vector     a null vector is a special vector , which is the identity element for the addition of vectors , in a given vector space . as an example , the null vector of n-dimensional coordinate space is a vector whose components are all 0. null vectors are used to define key concepts of linear algebra , such as linear independence , basis , and kernel . they are used to solve linear equations .
