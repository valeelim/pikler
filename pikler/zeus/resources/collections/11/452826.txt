Presbyornis     presbyornis is an extinct genus of water bird . it was a wading bird , often walking in shallow water on its long legs . `` presbyornis '' was one of the first anseriforms . because of its long legs and neck , it was initially mistaken for a flamingo . later it was reclassified as an anseriform when the duck-like anatomy of its skull and bill was found . it is from an extinct group closely related to ducks and geese . judging from numerous fossil findings , `` presbyornis '' probably lived in colonies around shallow lakes . its broad , flat bill was used to filter food ( small plants and animals ) from the water , in the manner of today 's dabbling ducks . the fossil record includes many complete skeletons from green river formation sites ( early eocene ) . this suggests that the birds nested in colonies , similar to many colony-nesting waterfowl or shorebirds today . species of this bird have also been found in maryland , utah , england , and mongolia . fossils are held in the smithsonian institution , the natural history museum , london , and the kuvp .
