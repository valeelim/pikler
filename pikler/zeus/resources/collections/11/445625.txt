Hell Creek Formation     the hell creek formation is a series of rocks where fossil dinosaurs are found . the strata are mostly upper cretaceous and some lower paleocene rocks in north america . the name comes from hell creek , near jordan , montana . the formation includes portions of montana , north dakota , south dakota , and wyoming . it is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays , mudstones , and sandstones deposited during the end of the cretaceous period and the beginning of the palaeogene . it was laid down by fluvial activity in river channels and deltas and occasional peaty swamp deposits . all this was along the low-lying eastern continental margin fronting the late cretaceous western interior seaway . the climate was mild , and the presence of crocodilians suggests a sub-tropical climate , with no prolonged annual cold . the famous iridium-enriched cretaceousâ€“palaeogene boundary , which separates the cretaceous from the cenozoic , occurs as a distinct thin marker bedding above and occasionally within the formation , near its boundary with the overlying fort union formation .
