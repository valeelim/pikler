Cloud chamber     a cloud chamber is a sealed box with a supersaturated vapour of water or alcohol . when a charged particle ( e.g . an alpha or beta particle ) goes through it , the vapour is ionized . the resulting ions act as nuclei , around which a mist forms from the vapour . the high energies of alpha and beta particles mean that a trail is left by ions produced along the path of the charged particle . these tracks have distinctive shapes ( for example , an alpha particle 's track is broad and shows more evidence of deflection by collisions , while an electron 's is thinner and straight ) . when any uniform magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber , positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions , according to the lorentz force law . the cloud chamber was invented by charles wilson ( 1869â€“1959 ) , a scottish physicist who received the nobel prize in physics in 1927 for this work . the first cloud chamber was made in 1911. the invention was used in the early days of atomic physics . it is often called the 'wilson chamber ' . since then a number of other types of particle detectors have been invented .
