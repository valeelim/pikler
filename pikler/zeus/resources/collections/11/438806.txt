Polymyalgia rheumatica     polymyalgia rheumatica ( `` pmr '' , sometimes called just polymyalgia ) is a disease that causes pain in the muscles . most people with pmr have pain during the morning . sometimes the pain is in the late afternoon or evening . about 15 % of people having pmr may also have temporal arteritis . pmr usually affects women . men can have it also . pmr usually happens in people age fifty and older . people under age 50 can be affected , although only rarely . recent research now seems to point to both polymyalgia and celiac disease having a common cause : an intolerance to gluten found in wheat , barley and rye . celiac disease has been known since the 1940s , but recent research has shown that although the cause is the same , symptoms are different . celiac disease causes painful gastrointestinal symptoms , but polymyalgia causes pain , swelling , stiffness , and limited range of motion in the shoulders , neck , upper arms , and hips .
