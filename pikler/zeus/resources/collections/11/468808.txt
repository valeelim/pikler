THX     thx is the trade name of a high-fidelity sound reproduction standard . it was used for movie theaters , screening rooms , home theaters , computer speakers , gaming consoles , and car audio systems . thx stands for `` tomlinson holman 's experiment '' . thx was developed by tomlinson holman at george lucas 's company lucasfilm in 1982 to ensure that the soundtrack for the third `` star wars '' movie , `` return of the jedi '' , would be accurately reproduced in the best venues . the thx system is not a recording technology , and it does not specify a sound recording format . all sound formats , whether digital ( dolby digital , sdds ) or analog ( dolby sr , ultra-stereo ) , can be `` shown in thx . '' thx is mainly a quality assurance system . thx-certified theaters provide a high-quality , predictable playback environment to ensure that any movie soundtrack mixed in thx will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer . thx also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard . certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements ; architectural requirements include a floating floor , baffled and acoustically treated walls , no parallel walls ( to reduce standing waves ) , a perforated screen ( to allow center channel continuity ) , and nc30 rating for background noise .
