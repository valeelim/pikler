Plating     plating is a surface covering in which a metal is put on another metal surface . plating has been done for hundreds of years , and it is important for modern technology . plating is used to decorate objects , prevent corrosion , to harden , to improve wearability , to reduce friction , to allow painting , to alter conductivity , and for other purposes . jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish . objects can be plated with films as thin as a single atom , so plating finds uses in nanotechnology . there are several plating methods , and many variations . in one method , a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet , and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them ( a version of this is sheffield plate ) . electroplating is a very common method .
