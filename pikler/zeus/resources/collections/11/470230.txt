Statistical significance     statistics uses variables to describe a measurement . such a variable is called significant if the probability that its outcome was obtained by chance is less than a given value . statistical hypothesis tests are used to check significance . the concept of statistical significance was originated by ronald fisher when he developed statistical hypothesis testing , which he described as `` tests of significance '' , in his 1925 publication , `` statistical methods for research workers '' . fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty ( 0.05 ) as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis . in their 1933 paper , jerzy neyman and egon pearson recommended that the significance level ( e.g . 0.05 ) , which they called Î± , be set ahead of time , before any data collection . despite his initial suggestion of 0.05 as a significance level , fisher did not intend this cutoff value to be fixed , and in his 1956 publication `` statistical methods and scientific inference '' he recommended that significant levels be set according to specific circumstances .
