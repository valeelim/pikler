Sandfly     sandflies are a group of flies , many of which feed on blood and are vectors of parasites . the group is the phlebotominae , a subfamily of flies . parasitic diseases spread by the flies include leishmaniasis , bartonellosis and pappataci fever . in the new world leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus `` lutzomyia '' . `` lutzomyia '' often live in caves , where their main hosts are bats . in the old world sand flies in the genus `` phlebotomus '' spread leishmaniasis . phlebotomine females , and only females , suck blood from various mammals , reptiles and birds . some species are selective , whereas others bite any suitable host they find . as far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first . proteins and other nutrients in the blood enable the female to produce eggs . the flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding . they then suck up the exposed blood . like practically all blood-feeding parasites , they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting , plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine ; this distend capillary vessels , thereby promoting blood flow .
