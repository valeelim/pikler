Breast augmentation     breast augmentation is a surgical procedure used to increase the size of the breasts . usually , implants are used , but another technique called fat grafting is sometimes used . the size increase can be as small as one cup size , or as large as 10 cup sizes or more . the larger the increase , the greater the risk of complications . complications may include leaking of the implants , which may require the implants to be replaced . with larger breasts the whole weight balance of the body is changed , which may cause stress to the muscular and skeletal systems . a surgical implant is either an implant filled with saline-solution , or an implant filled with silicone-gel . the fat-graft transfer uses grafts of adipose fat tissue from the woman â€™ s own body . a full assessment of this method is not yet available . the method does not allow for the huge size increase possible with implants , and slim women may not have enough fat tissue to allow the method to be used . implants are inserted into the breast and filled with silicone or a saline solution . this is the most common method of augmentation .
