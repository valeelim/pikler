Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing     the ironworkers memorial second narrows crossing ( also known as the ironworkers memorial bridge and second narrows bridge ) is the second bridge that crosses over the burrard inlet . it goes from vancouver to north shore of burrard inlet ( includes district of north vancouver , the city of north vancouver , and west vancouver ) . it began construction in 1957. on june 17 , 1958 , when one of the cranes was stretching from the north side of the bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch , several of the spans collapsed . this caused 79 workers to fall 30 metres ( 100 ft ) into the water . 18 of them were killed either instantly or shortly after , possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts . when a diver went down to search for the bodies , he drowned and that brought the total of deaths for the collapse to 19. the bridge opened on august 25 , 1960 and was renamed the ironworkers memorial second narrows crossing in 1994 to honour the workers that had died in the collapse .
