Meaning     meaning is a term in linguistics and philosophy . it is also a word in everyday life . the basic idea is this : meaning is the information which is sent by speech or messages . what that information is can be inferred by a listener or reader . meaning makes sense as part of a conversation between two or more people . the bits of a conversation , like questions and answers , suggestions and explanations , work to help the meaning get across . requests and instructions are other types of communication which depend on meaning . although humans use language to carry meaning , non-verbal communication definitely has meaning . in fact it is far more ancient than human language , and interpreting its meaning is mostly done by the unconscious mind . messages travel by scent and sight as well as sound . humans do some of this as well as almost all animals . in humans , facial expressions and the sense of touch are very important . all these things have meaning .
