We begin bombing in five minutes     on august 11 , 1984 , united states president ronald reagan , while running for re-election , was preparing to make his weekly saturday radio address on national public radio . as a sound check prior to the address , reagan made the following joke to the radio technicians : the joke was a parody of the opening line of that day 's speech : many americans were scared about a nuclear attack until reagan admitted it was a joke . though this was not the first time reagan had joked prior to giving a speech or address , the soviets were offended and began mocking reagan .
