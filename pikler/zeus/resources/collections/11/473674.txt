Insulated glazing     insulated glazing , otherwise known as double glazing or triple glazing , refers to the layers of glass in a window . a double glazed window is two panes of glass ( also called a lite ) with a sealed air ( or gas ) space in the middle . the edges are sealed together with an air-tight spacer . this is used so that heat can not escape through the air space by conduction or convection . heat radiation is not affected as it can travel through a vacuum space . to increase the r-value of insulated windows are sealed with argon gas . < br >
