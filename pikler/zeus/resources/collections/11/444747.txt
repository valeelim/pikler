Equation solving     equation solving is field of mathematics that is about finding the functions or values that will make an equation true . an equation says that two expressions are equal . these expressions contain one or more unknowns , which are usually called free variables . there are a number of changes ( transformations ) that can be done to make it easier to find the solution . there are many kinds of equation , and some have no solution in the domain ( field ) where they are studied . other kinds of equation can not be solved exactly , and approximation needs to be used . similarly , a system of equations may have no solutions , or an infinite number of solutions . methods for solving equations include : - brute force , trial and error , estimated guess : it is often possible ot find a solution for equations where there are only a limited ( usually small ) number of possibilities . this is the case for some diophantine equations . - elementary algebra can be used for some `` simple equations - there are algorithms for solving systems of linear equations . very often , linear algebra can be used .
