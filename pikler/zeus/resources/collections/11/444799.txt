BASE jumping     base jumping is a fringe sport in which a person jumps from a fixed place and uses a parachute to slow down before the ground is reached . `` base '' is an acronym that stands for each of the four jump location categories : from buildings , antennas , spans ( bridges ) and the earth . this last is similar to `` jumping off a cliff '' . base jumping is an extreme sport . this means it involves speed , height , danger or spectacular stunts . the idea for base jumping came from skydiving . base jumping is much more dangerous than skydiving from aircraft . base jumps are usually made from much lower altitudes than skydives . also , the jumper leaps closer to the platform or standing space . base jumpers fall through the air at slower speeds than skydivers , because they begin the jump closer to the ground . as a skydiver falls , he accelerates while falling and gains speed with each second . so a base jumper does not always reach terminal velocity . because faster speed while falling through the air gives jumpers more control of their bodies , and a quicker parachute opening , the longer the delay in the air , the safer .
