Ligature (typography)    ligature ( typography ) in writing and typography , a ligature is when two or more graphemes ( ~letters ) are joined as a single glyph . ligatures usually replace two characters next to each other . the idea comes from handwriting and manuscripts . example : the common ampersand ( `` & '' ) represents the latin conjunction `` et '' , meaning `` and '' . the ampersand 's symbol is a ligature , joining the old handwritten latin letters `` e '' and `` t '' of the word `` et '' , so that the word is represented as a single glyph . sometimes ligatures are made to make things more easy to read , or simply to make the writing/font nicer to look at . this is important in some forms of design work . type designers , who create fonts ( or 'typefaces ' ) , make ligatures for some combinations of letters . today , most fonts are made on computers ( these are called 'digital typefaces ' ) . when two particular letters are typed together , the ligature will appear . the ligature look like the two different letters but slightly changed ( sometimes joined together ) . it is actually a separate symbol that has been drawn by the creator , and is programmed to appear when two letters are put next to each other .
