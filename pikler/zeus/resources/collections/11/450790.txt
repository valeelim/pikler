Simple harmonic motion     a body is said to be vibrating if it moves back and forth or to and fro about a point . another term for vibration is oscillation . a special kind of vibratory or oscillatory motion is called `` simple harmonic motion '' . in mathematics and physics , when something moves so that its distance from a fixed point ( plotted on a graph against time ) looks like a sine wave , the movement is called simple harmonic motion . this sort of movement will happen whenever the force towards the fixed point is proportional to the distance from the point and always acts towards that point . examples include a weight on a spring and a pendulum ( approximately ) . the amplitude is the biggest distance from the fixed point . the period is the time taken to get back to the same point again ( with the same speed and in the same direction ) . `` simple harmonic motion can be defined as '' : `` simple harmonic motion occurs when the net force is directly proportional to the displacement from the mean position and is always directed towards the mean position ''
