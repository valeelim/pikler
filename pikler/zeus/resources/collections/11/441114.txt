Centimetre-gram-second system of units     the centimetre-gram-second system ( abbreviated cgs or cgs ) is a variant of the metric system . the derived units are on the centimeter as the unit of length , the gram as a unit of mass and the second as a unit of time . the system evolved in the nineteenth century when it was used to define both electrical and mechanical units . the cgs units of energy and force are the `` dyne '' and the `` erg '' . - the `` dyne '' is defined as the force needed to accelerate a mass of one gram by one centimetre per second squared ( cm s ) . - the `` erg '' is defined as the work done when a mass of one gram is moved a distance of one centimetre against a force of one dyne . the coherent cgs unit of pressure was the `` barye '' ( symbol ba ) . a `` bayre '' is one dyne per square centimeter . many non-coherent units of pressure were used in the cgs system . they include : - the `` atmosphere '' ( atm ) . a standard atmosphere is 1.01325Ã—10 ba . - `` millimetres of mercury '' ( mmhg ) . one millimeter of mercury is 133.32 ba .
