Von Neumann architecture     von neumann architecture or the von neumann model is an early computer design description . it was written by mathematician and physicist john von neumann and others in the `` first draft of a report on the edvac '' . it describes a design of an electronic digital computer . there are subsections of a processing unit with an arithmetic logic unit , processor registers , a control unit with an instruction register and program counter , memory to store data and instructions , and input and output devices . this means a stored-program computer . it has an `` instruction fetch '' , the step getting the instruction from memory , and a data operation , the instruction actually happening . these can not be done at the same time because they use the same bus . this limit is called the von neumann bottleneck . these are some examples of von neumann model computers . - electronic delay storage automatic calculator ( edsac ) - manchester mark 1 - edvac - ias machine - oracle ( computer ) through the 1960s and 1970s computers became smaller and faster , leading to improvements in the design . this is sometimes called `` streamlining '' the design .
