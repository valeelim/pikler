Roman invasion of Britain     the roman conquest of britain began in ad 43 under emperor claudius . his general aulus plautius became first governor of roman britain ( ) . britain had been the target of invasions by the roman republic and roman empire . it had diplomatic and trading links with the romans after julius caesar 's expeditions in 55 and 54 bc . roman economic and cultural influence was already part of the british late pre-roman iron age , in the south . between 55 bc and the 40s ad , britain was not invaded . augustus prepared invasions in 34 bc , 27 bc and 25 bc . the first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire , the second because the britons seemed ready to come to terms . strabo 's `` geography '' , written during this period , says that britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered . by the 40s ad , the political situation in britain was apparently in some chaos . caligula planned a campaign against the britons in 40 , but it never happened . caligula 's preparations made claudius ' invasion possible three years later . for example , caligula built a lighthouse at ( modern boulogne-sur-mer ) that provided a model for the one built soon after at dover .
