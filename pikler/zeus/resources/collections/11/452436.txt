Bryn Celli Ddu     bryn celli ddu is a prehistoric site on the welsh island of anglesey near llanddaniel fab . its name means 'the mound in the dark grove ' . it was robbed in 1699 and archaeologically dug between 1928 and 1929. during the neolithic period a stone circle and henge stood at the site . there were 14 stones in the circle , and the henge was about 30 m in diameter , with a ditch about 5 m across . the ditch was about 2 m deep . there was probably a path or causeway across the ditch to the henge . a small human bone from the ear , covered with a flat stone , was found in an area of burnt material in the centre . the amount of silt in the ditch showed that it had been used for a long time . the stone circle was pulled down in the early bronze age . five of the stones were removed , two were pushed over , and six were smashed , and one was buried . a passage grave was built in the centre of the henge . the passage is about 8.5m long and 1 m wide . the burial chamber is about 2 m wide , made from six large upright stones , covered with two capstones . a stone , carved with a twisting , serpent like design was in the burial chamber . it has been moved to the national museum of wales and replaced with a copy standing outside . the earth barrow covering the grave was made in after the 1928 dig ; the original was probably much bigger .
