Apomorphy     an apomorphy in biology is a derived state , or innovation . for example , amongst mammals , babies can digest their mothers ' milk . that is something all mammals share . it is an apomorphy unique to mammals , and so is the production of milk by mammalian mothers . apomorphies which are found in every species of a group of animals are the basis of taxonomy . if a group of animals all have a unique apomorphy , the most likely reason is that they descended from a common ancestor . when a group of animals share a large number of apomorphies this becomes a near-certainty . mammals share a long list of characters which are unique to them . clades are identified ( or defined ) by synapomorphies ( from syn- , `` together '' ) . these are a group of apomorphies which they all have , but other groups do not . for example , the five digits ( fingers and toes ) like ours is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates . the tetrapods are the first vertebrates with such digits . snakes and other tetrapods which do not have digits are tetrapods because other characters , such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls , show they descended from ancestors that which had digits .
