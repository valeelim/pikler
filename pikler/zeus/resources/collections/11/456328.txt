Rhizaria     the rhizaria are a supergroup of mostly unicellular eukaryotes . a multicellular form has recently been described . this supergroup was proposed by cavalier-smith in 2002. it has many species . they vary considerably in form , but for the most part they are amoeba-like with pseudopods . many produce shells or skeletons , which may be quite complex in structure . they make up the vast majority of protozoan fossils . nearly all have mitochondria with folds . there are three main groups of rhizaria : - cercozoa – various amoebae and flagellates , usually with pseudopods and common in soil - foraminifera – amoeboids with reticulose pseudopods , common as marine benthos - radiolaria – amoeboids with skeletons , common as marine plankton rhizaria is part of the bikont clade , which also comprises the archaeplastida , the chromalveolata , the excavata , and some smaller , groups . as bikonts , they all descend from a heterotrophic eukaryote with two flagella . historically , many rhizarians were considered animals , with their movement and heterotrophy as justification . however , when the five-kingdom system took prevalence over the animal-plant dichotomy , the rhizarians were put into the kingdom protista . then , after carl woese published his three-domain system , taxonomists turned their attention to the eukaryote domain . the protists are paraphyletic , so needed to be split into monophyletic clades . after much debate , which continues to this day , rhizaria emerged as one of those monophyletic groups .
