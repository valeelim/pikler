Unit vector     a unit vector is any vector that is one unit in length . unit vectors are often notated the same way as normal vectors , but with a mark over the letter ( e.g . formula_1 is the unit vector of a . ) to make a vector into a unit vector , divide it by its length : formula_2 three common unit vectors used in component form are formula_3 , formula_4 and formula_5 , referring to the unit vectors for the x- , y- and z-axes respectively . they are commonly just notated as i , j and k. they can be written as the following : formula_6
