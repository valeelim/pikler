Pincer movement     the pincer movement , or double envelopment , is a tactic in which forces attack both flanks ( sides ) of an enemy formation at the same time . the pincer movement can be used when opposing forces towards the center of an army . that army responds by moving its outside forces to the enemy 's flanks to surround it . at the same time , a second layer of pincers may attack on the more distant flanks to cut off the enemy . a full pincer movement leads to the attacking army facing the enemy in front , on both flanks , and in the rear . if attacking pincers link up in the enemy 's rear , the enemy is . such battles often end in surrender or destruction of the enemy force . the encircled force can try to break out or counterattack . a successful flanking maneuver can be difficult to accomplish . sun tzu , in `` the art of war '' , talked about the maneuver . but he made the point to leave a surrounded enemy an escape route . otherwise , faced with death , a surrounded enemy would fight much harder . this advice seems to have been followed by general george patton when his sweeping pincer movement trapped the german army in the falaise pocket in august 1944 .
