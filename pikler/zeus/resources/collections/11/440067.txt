Fuze     in military munitions , a fuze is the part of an explosive device that makes it explode . in some devices ( notably torpedoes ) a fuze may be identified by function as the `` exploder '' . the term `` fuze '' is used to indicate an advanced device with mechanical and/or electronic parts . time fuzes detonate after a set period of time . impact , or contact fuzes detonate when they hit something , usually the target . a proximity fuze uses sensors which can be one or more combinations of the following : radar , active sonar , passive acoustic , infrared , magnetic , photoelectric , seismic or even television cameras . whatever the sensor used , percussion fuzes cause the explosion to occur close to the target . the target will either be destroyed or severely damaged . most english-language countries use the `` z '' spelling to distinguish between simple burning fuses and pyrotechnical or explosive devices .
