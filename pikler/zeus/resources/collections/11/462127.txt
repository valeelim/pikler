Plasmodesma     plasmodesma ( plural is 'plasmodesmata ' ) is a microscopic channel across the cell wall of a plant cell . it allows transport and communication between neighbouring cells . plasmodesmata also evolved independently in some algae . unlike animal cells , every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls . although cell walls are permeable to small soluble molecules , plasmodesmata allow direct , regulated , intercellular transport of substances between cells . similar structures connect animal cells . stromules form between plastids in plant cells .
