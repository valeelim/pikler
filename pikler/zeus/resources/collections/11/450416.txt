Vector Laplacian     pierre-simon de laplace used an operator in order to be able to model the movement of stars . this operator , later named laplace operator , is used on functions of scalars . the laplace operator , which is also called scalar laplacian , applies to scalar fields and returns a scalar quantity . the vector laplacian applies to the vector fields and returns a vector quantity . when computed in rectangular cartesian coordinates , the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar laplacian applied on the individual elements . in physics , the vector laplacian is commonly used for the wave equations that are used to model electromagnetic fields .
