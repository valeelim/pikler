Tertiary source     a tertiary source ( also called thirdhand ) is an index or a summary of primary and secondary sources . in research , tertiary sources are used as a guide to help find primary and secondary sources of information . tertiary sources are very useful to find search terms for online literary searches . while tertiary sources are easy to find they are usually not considered useful for college-level research projects . some examples of tertiary sources are encyclopedias , dictionarys , newspapers and magazines . encyclopedias are useful to gain a general overview of a subject . at best they are a starting point in doing research . they are useful to gain an immediate understanding of otherwise unfamiliar subjects . encyclopedias , however , are not usually a reliable source for the details of a subject . as your research progresses they should be replaced with secondary or primary sources . newspapers and magazines should be used with some caution . some are reliable but many tend to misrepresent or oversimplify research reported in secondary sources .
