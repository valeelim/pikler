Camelops     camelops is an extinct genus of camel which lived in north america during the pleistocene . from two million years ago to about 10,000 years ago . they were prey for the wolves , bears , lions and `` smilodon '' . `` camelops '' disappeared at the end of the last ice age , as did many other animals . evidence of its environment comes from natural trap cave in wyoming , and from rancho la brea in the modern los angeles area . these studies suggest that it was not , like modern camels , adapted to desert conditions . it lived in woodland and grasslands with mixed vegetation . before the climate change at about 11,000 years ago it lived in `` conifer parklands '' on the montana-wyoming border , and in `` coastel shrublands '' in california . after the climate change , what had been woodland became `` deserts and treeless steppes of the sort so extensive in the present western u.s.a '' . even the type of grass which grew there changed . evidently , for this animal , the climate change was very significant . also , the arrival of man as a hunter may have made the situation worse . a few clovis points have been found in the cave site .
