Similarity (geometry)    similarity ( geometry ) similarity is an idea in geometry . it means that two polygons , line segments , or other figures have the same shape . similar objects do not need to have the same size . two shapes are similar if their angles have the same measure and their sides are proportional . two circles , squares , or line segments are always similar . triangles are special in similarity . this is because triangles can be similar if only their angles are equal , or only their sides are proportional . all other polygons must meet both of the conditions . similarity is very similar to congruence . congruent shapes have the same sides and angles . in fact , all shapes that are congruent to each other are also similar .
