Spandrel     a spandrel is the space between two arches . it is the space between an arch and a rectangular fence or the space between the right and left exterior curve of an arch and an enclosing right angle . in structures with more than one floor , the term `` spandrel '' can also mean the space between the top of the window in one floor and the threshold of the window in the floor above . spandrels have different meanings in architecture and art history . arches commonly exist in bridge constructions , so spandrels may appear in such structures . historically , most arch expansions had solid spandrels , meaning that the areas between arches were completely filled in with masonry . this was true until the use of steel and reinforced concrete began in the 19th and 20th centuries . structures of domes can also contain spandrels . where domes are needed to rest on a square or a rectangular base , the dome is raised above the level of the supporting pillars with three-dimensional spandrels called pendentives . these triangular segments take the weight of the dome and place it onto the poles .
