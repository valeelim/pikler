Prime number theorem     the prime number theorem is a theorem from number theory . prime numbers are not distributed evenly across the number range . the theorem formalizes the idea that the probability of hitting a prime number between 1 and a given number becomes smaller , as numbers grow . this probability is about n/ln ( n ) , where ln ( n ) is the natural logarithm function . this means that the probability of hitting a prime number with 2n digits is about half as likely than with n digits . for example , among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits , about one in 2300 is prime ( ln 10 ≈ 2302.6 ) , whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits , about one in 4600 is prime ( ln 10 ≈ 4605.2 ) . in other words , the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first `` n '' integers is roughly ln ( `` n '' ) . fifteen-year old carl friedrich gauß suspected that there was a link between prime numbers and logarithms in 1793. adrien-marie legendre also suspected such a link in 1798. jacques hadamard and charles-jean de la vallée poussin proved the prime number theorem , in 1896 , over a century after gauß .
