Polyphaga     the polyphaga is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles . the name is got from two greek words : `` poly '' - , meaning 'many ' , and `` phagein '' , meaning 'to eat ' , so the suborder is called the “ eaters of many things ” . polyphaga has 144 families in 16 superfamilies , and shows an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation . it has over 315,000 described species , about 90 % of all beetle species so far discovered . there are 5 infraorders : - bostrichiformia — including furniture beetles and skin beetles . - cucujiformia — includes lady beetles , longhorn beetles , weevils , checkered beetles and leaf beetles . - elateriformia — includes click beetles and fireflies - scarabaeiformia — includes scarab beetles and stag beetles . - staphyliniformia — includes rove beetles and water scavenger beetles . the infraorder cucujiformia includes most phytophagous [ plant-eating ] beetles . adoption of a plant-eating lifestyle promoted speciation and diversity in beetles , with cucujiformia , especially weevils , forming a major radiation . much of this adaptive radiation has taken place at the same time as the evolution of the flowering plants . `` 99 % of phytophagous beetles feed on flowering plants '' .
