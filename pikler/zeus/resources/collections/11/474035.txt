Right to housing     the right to housing is the idea that everyone should have the possibility to live somewhere , to housing and shelter free from homelessness . many countries recognise it . it is also in the universal declaration of human rights , and the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights . this means it is part of international law . the base for the right to housing in international law can be found in article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights . the declaration recognises the right as part of the right to an adequate standard of living . it states that : article 11 ( 1 ) of the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights ( icescr ) also guarantees the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living among economic , social and cultural rights . in international human rights law the right to housing is regarded as a freestanding right . this was clarified in the 1991 general comment no 4 on adequate housing by the un committee on economic , social and cultural rights . the general comment provides an authoritative interpretation of the right to housing in legal terms under international law .
