Luminous paint     luminous paint or luminescent paint is a kind of paint that gives off visible light and that glows in the dark . there are several ways this can be done : - it is possible to convert invisible uv light into visible light . typically , blue light , and the near-blue part of uv light is changed to a bigger wavelength , such as blue-green , yellow or red . this effect is known as fluorescence . at the same intensity , tones of red or yellow appear brighter to the human eye . this kind of paint is used for high-visibility clothing , for example . - it is possible to store the energy of the light , and to emit this energy in the form of visible light later on . the effect is known as phosphorescence . emergency exits are marked with this kind of paint . - a radioactive substance can be used ; the energy of this radioactive decay can be converted into visible light . today , the radiation of these substances is shielded easily , since the substances used only emit alpha radiation , or low-energy beta radiation . at the beginning of the 20th century , radium isotopes were used , which led to a number of cases of radiation poisoning ; one of the most prominent cases is that of the radium girls .
