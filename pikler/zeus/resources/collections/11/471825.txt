Tay Bridge disaster     the tay bridge disaster was one of the great engineering disasters of the 19th century . it happened in a violent storm on 28 december 1879. the first tay rail bridge collapsed while a train was passing over it from wormit to dundee , killing all aboard . the original tay bridge was designed by noted railway engineer thomas bouch , who received a knighthood when the bridge was completed . it was a lattice-grid design , combining cast and wrought iron . the design was well known : it was used with success in the crumlin viaduct in south wales in 1858 , after the use of cast iron in the crystal palace . a previous cast iron design , the dee bridge which collapsed in 1847 , failed due to poor use of cast-iron girders . later , gustave eiffel used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the massif central ( 1867 ) . proposals for constructing a bridge across the river tay date back to at least 1854. the north british railway ( tay bridge ) act received the royal assent on 15 july 1870 and the foundation stone was laid on 22 july 1871 .
