Cat righting reflex     the cat righting reflex is a cat 's natural ability to turn itself around as it falls so it will land on its feet . this righting reflex starts to happen at 3–4 weeks of age . the cat has entirely learned how to do this by 6–7 weeks . cats are able to do this because they have a flexible backbone and a clavicle that does not move . the minimum height needed for this to happen safely in most cats is about 12 inches . cats without a tail can also do this . this is because a cat mostly moves its hind legs and does not use much angular momentum to set itself up for landing . so a tail is not really needed for this skill . using this righting reflex , cats can often land without injury . but , this is not always true , since cats can still break bones or die from extreme falls . in a 1987 study , written in the `` journal of the american veterinary medical association '' , 132 cats were looked at after having fallen from buildings . the injuries per cat were more , depending on the height fallen ; up to seven stories high . above seven stories , the injuries were less . the study authors think that after falling five stories , the cats reached terminal velocity . at that time , the cats relaxed and spread their bodies to increase drag .
