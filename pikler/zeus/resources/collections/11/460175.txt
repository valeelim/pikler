Legibility     legibility is the degree to which the print can be seen and read . each glyph ( individual character ) in text has a shape we recognise in reading . the complete set of letters and symbols in a design is called a font ( or fount ) . the choice of font is therefore the first thing which affects legibility . a second factor in legibility is the setting , the way the type is used in practice . this includes line length , line spacing ( `` leading '' ) , justification , typestyle , kerning , tracking , point size , etc .
