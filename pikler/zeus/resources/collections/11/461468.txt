Trilemma     a trilemma is a difficult choice where there are three different options , and where each option looks unfavorable . one of the earliest uses of the definition of trilemma is that of the greek philosopher epicurus , who says there is no omnipotent and omnibenevolent god . david hume summarized this trilemma as follows : 1. if god is unable to prevent evil , then he is not all-powerful . 1. if god is not willing to prevent evil , then he is not all-good . 1. if god is both willing and able to prevent evil , then why does it exist ? although traditionally ascribed to epicurus , it has been suggested that it may actually be the work of an early skeptic writer , possibly carneades . in studies of philosophy , discussions and debates related to this trilemma are often referred to as being about the `` problem of evil '' . other pages . - dilemma
