Perennial stream     a perennial stream or perennial river is a stream or river ( channel ) which always flows in some parts all year round during years of normal rainfall . perennial streams are different to intermittent streams ; which normally stop flowing for weeks or months each year . they are also different to ephemeral streams that flow only for hours or days after rainfall . during unusually dry years a perennial stream may stop flowing . in a drought , they may not flow for months . the differences between perennial , intermittent , and ephemeral streams are not exact and can change if different measures are used by different groups . in dry weather it may not be possible to see the water flowing , or see any water at all . in streams with gravel or rock ) bottoms , the water may be flowing beneath or between the rocks . in biology , a stream is flowing if there is enough water to support aquatic life , including fish and gill-breathing amphibians , benthic insects , crustaceans , and mollusks . these can live in a shallow flow beneath rocks or logs . the flow may be so small that it can not be measured by stream flow measurement instruments .
