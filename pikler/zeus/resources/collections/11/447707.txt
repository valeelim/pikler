Data science     data science is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data . it uses various techniques from many fields , including signal processing , mathematics , probability models , machine learning , computer programming , statistics , data engineering , pattern recognition and learning , visualization , uncertainty modeling , data warehousing , and high performance computing with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data . data science is not restricted to only big data , although the fact that data is scaling up makes big data an important aspect of data science . a practitioner of data science is called a data scientist . data scientists solve complex data problems using various elements of mathematics , statistics and computer science , although expertise in these subjects are not required . however , a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines , meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science . good data scientists are able to apply their skills to achieve a broad spectrum of end results . the skill-sets and competencies that data scientists employ vary widely .
