Henry Moseley     moseley worked on many theories about the atomic number . this soon became known as moseley 's law in x-ray spectra . moseley 's law helped prove many ideas in chemistry by organizing the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a quite logical order based on their physics . moseley was shot and killed during the battle of gallipoli on 10 august 1915 , at the age of 27. some people say that he could have won the nobel prize in physics in 1916 if he was never killed .
