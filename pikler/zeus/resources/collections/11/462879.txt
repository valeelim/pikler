Pointer (computer programming)    pointer ( computer programming ) in computer science , a pointer is a variable whose value is a location in the computer 's memory . if rick stands in a room and points to his friend sally , then rick is a pointer whose value is sally 's location . a programmer must `` dereference '' the pointer to retrieve the object it points to . pointers do not take up much memory ( ram ) . copying a pointer to a large object is faster than copying the large object itself because only the location needs to be copied , instead of the whole object . pointers are used in linked lists . each record of a linked list has a pointer to the next record . these pointers chain the records together . this means that the records in a linked list can be sorted and arranged by changing their pointers .
