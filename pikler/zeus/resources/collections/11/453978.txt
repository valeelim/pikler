Menai Suspension Bridge     the menai suspension bridge ( ) is a suspension bridge in wales . it runs from the island of anglesey to holyhead . it was designed by thomas telford . they started building it in 1819 and it was finished in 1826. before the bridge was built , the only way people could get to anglesey island was by a ferry from holyhead . the water of the menai strait is very rough and dangerous , so it was hard for people to use their own boats or swim to the island . the people who lived on anglesey sold cattle that they raised . the cattle were forced to swim through the dangerous water , with many of them often dying . if the cows survived the trip , they were sent to london and other places to be sold . an engineer named thomas telford was working near holyhead when he thought it would be a good idea to build a suspension bridge to anglesey . a suspension bridge was big enough that tall ships could go underneath them . he asked the british parliament if he could build the bridge and they said yes .
