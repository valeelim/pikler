Host defence peptide     host defence peptides ( or antimicrobial peptides ) are part of the innate immune response . they are found among all classes of life . they act against invading microorganisms . the peptides kill gram negative and gram positive bacteria . this includes strains which are resistant to conventional antibiotics . the peptides also work against mycobacteria ( including `` mycobacterium tuberculosis '' ) , enveloped viruses , fungi and even transformed or cancerous cells . these peptides are excellent candidates for medical use . they complement conventional antibiotic therapy . they have a broad range of activity , and are bactericidal as opposed to bacteriostatic . they need only a short contact time to kill bacteria . there are big differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells as targets for antimicrobial peptides . these peptides are potent , broad spectrum antibiotics . unlike most antibiotics it seems that antimicrobial peptides may also improve immunity by working as immunomodulators ( beefing up the immune system ) .
