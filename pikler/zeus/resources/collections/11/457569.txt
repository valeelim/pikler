Wavefunction collapse     when a scientific experiment is done properly , it will give a measurable result . at each moment , the system ( experiment ) will be in one of several possible states . at the end , the experiment will be in a final state . at each point in time , the state of the system can be measured . experiments done in quantum mechanics work the same way . the difference to classical mechanics is that at each point in time , several states are superposed ( overlapping ) to describe the state the experiment is in . these states are called eigenstates . in the same way as with classical mechanics , if a measurement is done , there is a single result . this result is the eigenvalue of one of the eigenstates . this means that measurement will reduce the several possible states to a single state by adding them together . after the measurement , the system will be in the state that was measured . in the copenhagen interpretation , this reduction is known as wavefunction collapse . collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time . the other is continuous evolution via the schr√∂dinger equation .
