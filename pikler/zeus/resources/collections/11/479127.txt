Noctiluca     noctiluca , usually `` noctiluca scintillans '' , is the sea sparkle . it is a free-living marine-dwelling species of dinoflagellate . it shows bioluminescence when disturbed : this produces a `` milky seas effect '' . the bioluminescence is produced in the cytoplasm of this single-celled protist . it is done by a luciferin-luciferase reaction in thousands of spherical organelles , called scintillons . nonluminescent populations in the genus `` noctiluca '' lack these scintillons . `` noctiluca '' is a heterotroph ( non-photosynthetic ) that engulfs by phagocytosis . they eat plankton , diatoms , other dinoflagellates , fish eggs and bacteria . the diatom `` thalassiosira '' is known as a favourite food source of `` noctiluca '' . `` n. scintillans '' also takes in tiny phytoplankton which live as endosymbionts . they do photosynthesis for their larger host . diatoms are often found in the vacuoles ( internal membrane-bound storage compartments ) of `` noctiluca '' . the green non-feeding symbionts can grow photoautotrophically for generations .
