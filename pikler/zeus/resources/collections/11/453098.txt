Aglet     an aglet , or aiglet , is the small tip on the end of a shoelace or rope . it can be plastic or metal . it keeps the fibres from fraying or unwinding . this makes it easier to hold , and easier to feed through a hole , such as a grommmet , eyelet , or lacing guides . the word `` aglet '' ( or `` aiglet '' ) comes from the old french word , `` aguillette '' ( or `` aiguillette '' ) , which means `` needle '' . this in turn comes from `` acus '' , latin for `` needle '' . an aglet is like a small needle at the end of a cord . there are two main types of aglets . some are purely functional , that is to simply stop fraying , while others can also be decorative . decorative aglets are on the end of decorative cords , such as bolo ties , or on the aiguillettes of military dress uniforms . aglets today are most often made of plastic ; they also have been made of metal , glass , and stone . many were highly ornamental and made of metals such as silver . before the invention of buttons , they were used on the ends of ribbons to hold clothing together . sometimes they were formed into small figures . shakespeare called these an `` aglet baby '' in `` the taming of the shrew '' .
