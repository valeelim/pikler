100,000-year problem     the amount of incoming solar radiation , also called insolation determines the temperature on earth . this temperature rises and falls according to the strength of radiation given off by the sun , the distance from the earth to the sun , and the tilt of the earth 's axis of rotation . however , the recent change between glacial and inter-glacial states that occurs on a circa 100,000 year ( 100 ka ) timescale , does not correlate well with these factors . this is known as the 100,000 year problem . due to variations in the earth 's orbit , the amount of insolation varies ; there are periods of around 21,000 , 40,000 , 100,000 , and 400,000 years . variations in the amount of solar energy drive changes in the climate of the earth , and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of start and termination of glaciations . looking at strata , isotope analysis can be performed . one of the most precise methods consist in using oxygen-18 . the amount of oxygen 18 mainly depends on the amount of ice that can be found and on the temperature of the planet .
