Parity of zero     parity of zero is the question whether the number zero is even or odd . general consensus is that the number is even . even numbers are defined to be integer multiples of two . that way , the numbers two , four and six are even , because they are one times two , two times two , and three times two . with that explanation , zero is also even , because it is zero times two . another explanation is from number theory : the integers are arranged in such a way that even numbers are followed by odd ones , and odd ones by even ones . zero is preceded by minus one , and followed by one . both numbers are odd . so it must be even . there is also a problem : the term `` even '' meaning `` integer multiple of two '' is a convention ; people agreed on it . it is not a formal definition . another case where people used a convention they agreed on was that of prime number : before the 20th century , there were many inconsistent definitions of prime : mathematicians such as goldbach , lambert , legendre , cayley , and kronecker wrote that 1 was prime . the modern definition of `` prime number '' is `` positive integer with exactly 2 factors '' , so 1 is not prime . this definition is rational : it naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes . for example , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime
