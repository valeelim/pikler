Lorenz attractor     the lorenz attractor ( also called lorenz system ) is a system of equations . edward n. lorenz formulated the equations as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection . the equations are ordinary differential equations , called lorenz equations . they are notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions . in particular , the lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the lorenz system which , when plotted , resemble a butterfly or figure eight . the notion of butterfly effect is coupled with that of the lorenz attractor . lorenz first used the phrase in a speech he gave in 1972 .
