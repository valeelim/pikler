Off-site data protection     in computing , off-site data protection , or vaulting , is the strategy of sending critical data off the main site . the place where the data is stored is often called the data vault . in many organisations , there is some data which is so important that it must be protected . protection against hacking can be done by means of software , but protection against physical damage is a different problem . the solution is to put the data in more than one place , so a major disaster , ( such as fire or explosions ) does not prevent the recovery of the computer system with all its most important data . data is usually taken off-site using media such as magnetic tape or optical storage . data can also be sent electronically to a remote backup service , which is called `` electronic vaulting '' or `` e-vaulting '' . sending backups off-site makes sure systems and servers can be reloaded with the latest data in the event of a disaster , accidental error , or system crash . sending backups off-site also ensures there is a copy of data that is not stored on-site . off-site backup services are convenient for companies that backup data on a daily basis ( classified and unclassified ) .
