Nematophyte     the nematophytes are a paraphyletic group of land organisms , probably including some plants as well as algae . they are known only from the fossil record , from the silurian period until the early devonian rhynie chert . the lack of a clear definition of the nematophytes has led to it being used as a wastebasket taxon . all manner of tubes and cell-patterned cuticles from the silurian are called `` nematophytic '' .
