Solar thermal energy     solar thermal energy is a way of producing electricity in which the sun 's energy is concentrated by mirrors or lenses to either heat a fluid-filled pipe or drive a stirling engine . the oil which is hot is circulated into a water storage system where it is used to change water into superheated steam , that then turns a turbine to generate electricity . the heat that is produced through this process powers a stirling engine . the stirling engine provides electricity and mechanical energy by having the fluid from within a cylinder expand , which then drives a piston that turns a shaft . solar thermal energy is primarily used domestically for space heating , hot water , and in some cases air conditioning . solar thermal energy is renewable and no fuels are required during the process to generate electricity or mechanical energy . it is also carbon free except for production and transportation , otherwise it is non-polluting . solar thermal can also be combined with photovoltaics ( pvs ) , in highly efficient cogeneration systems . some downsides are that solar thermal generates low grade energy , installation and construction costs are very high , it is expensive compared to conventional water heaters , and is hard to compete against cheap natural gas . an example of a solar thermal electric generation plant is the ivanpah solar electric generating system that uses 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors , that focuses sunlight to the top of 459-foot towers , where water is turned into steam to power turbines .
