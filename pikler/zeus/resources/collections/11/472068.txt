Regression toward the mean     regression toward the mean simply says that , following an extreme random event , the next random event is likely to be less extreme . regression toward the mean was first described by francis galton . he found that offspring of tall parents tended to be shorter . also , offspring of shorter parents tended to be taller . galton stated that processes that did not follow regression towards the mean would quickly go out of control . in 1886 , galton published a paper called `` regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature '' . in the paper , he observed that extreme characteristics ( e.g. , height ) in parents are not passed on completely to their offspring . rather , the characteristics in the offspring `` regress '' towards a `` mediocre '' point . today , this point is called the mean . by measuring the heights of hundreds of people , he was able to quantify regression to the mean , and estimate the size of the effect . galton wrote that , “ the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective mid-parental deviations ” . this means that the difference between a child and its parents for some characteristic is proportional to its parents ' deviation from typical people in the population . if its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women , on average , the child will be shorter than its parents by some factor times two inches . today , this factor has been calculated to be one minus the regression coefficient . for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about two thirds : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ’ deviation from the population average .
