Graph (mathematics)    graph ( mathematics ) in graph theory a graph is used to represent the connection between two sets . one of the sets contains nodes ( which are officially called vertices ) , the other one contains the connections ( which are officially called edges ) . there are two classes of graphs , which are distinguished by the nature of the edges . some edges can be travelled in both directions , other can only be travelled in one direction . edges that can be travelled in one direction only are called `` directed '' , and the graph is called a `` directed graph `` or '' digraph '' . the ones which do not have a direction are called `` undirected '' , and the graph is called an `` undirected graph '' . if two vertices are connected by an edge , they are called `` adjacent '' . the order of a graph , written as formula_1 , is given by the number of vertices . a graph 's size is formula_2 , the number of edges . the degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it , where an edge that connects to the vertex at both ends ( a loop ) is counted twice .
