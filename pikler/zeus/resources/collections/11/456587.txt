My Plague     `` my plague '' is the third single off american metal band slipknot 's second studio album `` iowa '' . the song was released on july 8 , 2002. there was a remix for the song called `` new abuse mix '' that was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 movie `` resident evil '' . the remix cut a screamed layer of vocals and replaced it with a more monotone , drone-like sounding layer . the new version was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional `` '' kill you , fuck you , i will never be you '' section . some of the profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases ; like the phrase `` ... the everyday bullshit things that you have done '' was changed to , `` ... the everyday abusive things that you have done '' and `` you fucking touch me , i will rip you apart ... '' was replaced with `` ... and if you touch me , i will rip you apart ... '' '' . the whole second verse of the chorus was removed . in 2003 , the song was nominated for a grammy award in the best metal performance category but it lost to korn 's `` here to stay '' .
