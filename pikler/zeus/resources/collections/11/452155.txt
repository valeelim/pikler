Kármán line     the kármán line is the altitude where space begins . it is about 62 miles ( 100 km ) high . it commonly represents the border between the earth 's atmosphere and outer space . this definition is accepted by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( fai ) . the fai is an international standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics . the line is named after theodore von kármán ( 1881–1963 ) , a hungarian-american engineer and physicist . he was active in aeronautics and astronautics . he was the first to calculate that around this altitude , the atmosphere becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight . an aircraft at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to obtain enough lift to support itself . there is a sudden increase in temperature of the atmosphere and solar radiation just below the line . this places the line within the greater thermosphere .
