Blood–brain barrier     the blood–brain barrier ( bbb ) is a highly selective permeability barrier . it controls what gets from the bloodstream into the brain , and what does not . for example , things that the brain needs to survive ( water , glucose , and amino acids ) can get through the barrier . however , the barrier stops many harmful things , like bacteria and viruses , from getting into the brain . this helps protect the brain from getting an infection . the blood-brain barrier is formed by capillary endothelial cells . it allows the passage of water , some gases , and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion . it also allows the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids which are crucial to nerve function . on the other hand , the blood-brain barrier may prevent the entry of neurotoxins by means of an active transport mechanism . a few small areas in the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier . paul ehrlich , a german doctor , discovered the blood-brain barrier . he injected dye into mice 's bloodstreams . the dye got to every organ except the brain . the blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting through to the brain . then one of ehrlich 's students injected the dye right into the mice 's brains . this time the brain turned blue , but no other organs did . the blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting out of the brain into the bloodstream ( which would have carried the dye to every other organ in the body ) .
