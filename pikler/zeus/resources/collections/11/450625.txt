Turbidity     turbidity is a measure of how well light penetrates water . it is caused by particles ( total suspended or dissolved solids ) that are generally invisible to the naked eye . the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality . fluids can contain suspended particles of many different sizes . some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom if a liquid sample is left to stand . very small particles settle very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal . these small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid or murky . turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton . naturally occurring algal blooms can cause turbidity . human activities that disturb land can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due runoff . these can include construction , mining and agriculture . pollution from paved surfaces such as roads , bridges and parking lots is another source . certain industries such as quarrying , mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from rock particles entering the water .
