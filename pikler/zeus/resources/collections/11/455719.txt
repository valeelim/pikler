Active galactic nucleus     an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a compact region at the centre of a galaxy . this central region radiates huge luminosity over the electromagnetic spectrum . the radiation from an agn is thought to be caused by mass dragged in by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the host galaxy . this electromagnetic radiation is observed in the radio , microwaves , infrared , optical , ultra-violet , x-ray and gamma ray wavebands . a galaxy hosting an agn is called an active galaxy . agn are the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe . they can be used to discover distant objects . all theories about the cosmos have to account for agns . they are one of the basic facts about the universe . so-called relativistic jets are extremely powerful jets of plasma which come from some agns , notably radio galaxies and quasars . their lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of light years .
