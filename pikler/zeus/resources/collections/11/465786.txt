Inoculation     inoculation ( also known as variolation ) is a historical method of making people immune to smallpox . unlike a vaccine , inoculation uses infected material ( for example scabs ) from an infected patient . the benefit of inoculation is it gives the individual a less dangerous type of the virus . another benefit of inoculation is the fact it has a death rate of 0.5 % - 2 % ( as opposed to the 35 % death rate of smallpox ) . inoculation was eventually replaced after edward jenner discovered a vaccine against smallpox . china may have used inoculation in the 10th century . the emperor of china at the time lost his eldest son to smallpox . he wanted a way to help prevent smallpox from killing anymore members of his family . he summoned many people from throughout the empire to attempt to find a cure to smallpox . a man carried out inoculation to immunise his family . however the source of the story was supposedly written 100 's of years after the event . inoculation was not widely used in china until the 'longqing emperor ' in the 16th century . this was written by yu tianchi . inoculation using the most deadly strain of the virus was banned from use in china to prevent high death rates . inoculation is documented to have been used in india in the 18th century . it may have been used earlier than that but there is no evidence to prove this .
