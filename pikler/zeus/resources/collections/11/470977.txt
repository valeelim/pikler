Crate     a crate is a type of container often used in shipping . it can be made of wood , but crates made to carry bottles are often plastic . steel and aluminium crates are also used . the word crate comes from the word : . the earliest packaging materials were made of wood and wood fiber . the first crates used to transport anything were hampers or baskets . they were made of twigs , strips of wood , roots , and reeds . whatever was available that could be woven into a container . baskets were used to hold and transport food and goods . later glass and ceramic jugs were protected by baskets . the first documented reference to a shipping crate in the united states is in a 1930 handbook , `` technical bulletin no . 171 '' written by c. a. plaskett for the us department of agriculture . his writing implies that crates were defined before that time . c. a. plaskett was known for his extensive testing and defining of various components of transport packaging . while both can be used for shipping , a crate is different from a box . a crate has a frame while a box generally does not . crates are rigid containers built for the purpose of protecting the contents . crates can be made of wood , plastic , metal or other materials . crates usually need to be designed to exactly fit what it is they are protecting . reusing a crate that does not fit the contents can waste space and harm the contents .
