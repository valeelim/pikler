Replacement child     a replacement child is a child conceived by parents to replace an older dead sibling . he or she is usually of the same sex as the child they replaced . often they are given the same name . the replacement child provides consolation to the parents for the loss of the earlier child . it is also frequently believed they are a reincarnation of the lost child . as a result a replacement child represents the hopes and dreams parents had for the dead child . the replacement child or replacement child syndrome became popular in periods of high infant mortality . but it continues in modern times in some places . in some religions and cultures , it was bad luck to mention a dead child 's name . even among european royal families , a dead child was often referred to by his or her title and not their name . among the replacement children of holocaust the names of the dead were often not spoken of . the name was memorialized in the replacement child ( because they were alive the name could be used ) .
