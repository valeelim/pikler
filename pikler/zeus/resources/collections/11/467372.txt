Diastase     diastases are a group of enzymes which break down starch into the sugar maltose . diastase was the first enzyme discovered . it was got from malt solution in 1833 by anselme payen and jean-françois persoz , chemists at a french sugar factory . the name `` diastase '' comes from the greek word διάστασις ( diastasis ) . it means a parting or separation . the enzymes simply split the starch molecule . today , diastase means any α- , β- , or γ-amylase that can break down carbohydrates . the commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from the name diastase . the breakdown of starches follows a general diastase-catalysed reaction : a–b + ho → a–oh + b–h
