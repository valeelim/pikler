Service oriented architecture     service-oriented architecture ( soa ) is a concept in computer programming . it is a way of creating a program or application that is focused around distinct tasks or services . with an soa model , each piece of the program or application performs a specific task ( such as retrieving a piece of data , performing a mathematical operation , etc ) . the tasks are performed completely independent of each other . since each component of the program works independently , each component can be tested by itself without needing the whole program to be completed first . the program can be built piece by piece with confidence that each piece works . often times , a company has already created a program or application to perform a specific task . if that is the case , this legacy program , ( program that has already been written ) or a piece of this legacy program can be reused without the need to re-code that specific task . consequently , programs with soa can be developed faster than traditional programs in some circumstances .
