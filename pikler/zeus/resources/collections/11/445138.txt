Hilbert's tenth problem    hilbert 's tenth problem hilbert 's tenth problem is a problem in mathematics that is named after david hilbert who included it in hilbert 's problems as a very important problem in mathematics . it is about finding an algorithm that can say whether a diophantine equation has integer solutions . it was proved , in 1970 , that such an algorithm does not exist . as with all problems included in hilbert 's problems , it was unresolved and considered very difficult when the famous list was published in 1900. the first significant step towards finding the solution was made in 1950 by julia robinson , who created a hypothesis ( known as the jr hypothesis ) around which all later progress was centred . the problem was finally solved with a negative answer in 1970 when yuri matiyasevich proved the jr hypothesis . previous research had shown that this was enough for a negative answer to the problem . the negative answer means that we can not make an algorithm that can say whether a diophantine equation has integer solutions .
