White River (Arkansas)    white river ( arkansas ) the white river is a 722-mile ( 1,162-km ) long river that flows through the u.s. states of arkansas and missouri . the source of the white river is in the boston mountains of northwest arkansas , in the ozark–st . francis national forest southeast of fayetteville . the river flows northwards from its source in northwest arkansas . it loops up through southwest missouri into table rock lake at branson , missouri . in branson the river enters lake taneycomo , controlled by the powersite dam . the powersite was the first dam on the white river . the flow continues downstream into bull shoals lake . from there it travels back into arkansas , and then heads generally southeast to where it flows into the mississippi river . despite being much shorter than the arkansas river , it carries nearly as much water—normally more than , and occasionally more than during floods . lake taneycomo was created in 1913 when the empire district electric company built a dam just south of forsyth , missouri . beaver lake , table rock lake , and bull shoals lake are man-made lakes or reservoirs created by the u.s. army corps of engineers . this was under the authority of the flood control act of 1938. a total of eight dams restrict the upper white river . six are in arkansas and two in missouri . the white river national wildlife refuge lies along the lower part of the river . none of the original white river remains in missouri . it has been replaced by a series of dams that flooded it 's valleys . the white river was once known as one of the best smallmouth bass fisheries in the world . smallmouth still inhabit the impoundments but trout have replaced the smallmouth in much of the river , as the dams release much colder water .
