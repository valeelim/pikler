Biochemical cascade     a biochemical cascade ( or signalling pathway ) is a series of chemical reactions . it is started by a stimulus ( first messenger ) acting on a receptor . the 'message ' is passed on to the cell interior through other reactions . these later chemical reactions amplify ( build up ) the initial signal . eventually there is a cell response to the initial stimulus . the passing series of chemical changes is a cascade , and the whole process is called signal transduction .
