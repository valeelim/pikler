Behavioral economics     behavioral economics is a smaller part of economics that combines what we know about psychology with what we know about economics . normally , economics does not consider the way humans actually think , but instead , simplifies decision-making to make economic models easier to understand . however , this is not a complete picture of how the world , and economics , really works . normally , economists assume people are rational , meaning they make good decisions at the right times using all information . in real life , people do not do this . they are subject to problems with self-control , problems with time , and make different choices depending on how decisions are presented to them . behavioral economists look at the world given problems and limitations that result when real humans are faced with decisions . the study of behavioral economics really began to develop in the middle and towards the end of the 20th century . psychologists amos tversky and daniel kahneman wrote a paper called “ prospect theory , ” which was about how the way choices are presented to somebody is just as important as the choices themselves when an individual is making a decision . later , hersh shefrin and richard thaler created a savings model which explains how people do not figure out how much to save and spend to stay at a constant level . people would rather spend more now , because humans prefer gratification in the near future . by 1994 , harvard university hired a professor to teach behavioral economics as its own subject . now , behavioral economics helps explain many complex things that people do . there are many applications of the research , such as how to make public policy more effective or marketing and advertising applications . also , there are other areas of study branching off from behavioral economics , like behavioral finance , which deals with how people make investments .
