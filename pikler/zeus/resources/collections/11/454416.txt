Districts of Wales     in 1974 , wales was re-divided for local government purposes into thirty-seven districts . districts were the second tier of local government introduced by the local government act 1972 , being subdivisions of the eight counties introduced at the same time . this system of two-tier local government was abolished in 1996 and replaced with the current system of unitary principal areas . each district was administered by an elected district council . the council was entitled to petition for a charter granting borough status , whereupon the district became a `` borough '' and the district council a `` borough council '' headed by a mayor . in addition , a district could be granted letters patent granting city status .
