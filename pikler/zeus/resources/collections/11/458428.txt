Red River Rebellion     the red river rebellion was an uprising by the m√©tis people in modern manitoba . the national government of canada bought the area , then known as `` rupert 's land '' , from the hudson 's bay company in 1869. the government then ordered surveys to be started of the new territory . the metis were afraid that they would then lose their lands , since many did not have clear titles . they were also afraid that the canadian government officials , many of which were protestants , would not allow the metis to continue being catholics . the metis then orgainized their own provisional government , with louis riel as their leader , in the summer of 1869. they sent a list of demands to the canadian government , including protection of the french language . after several months of negotiations , the parliament of canada passed the manitoba act of may 1870. the act admitted manitoba into the canadian confederation and included many of the metis ' demands .
