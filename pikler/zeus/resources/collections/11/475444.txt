Infrared telescope     an infrared telescope is a telescope that detects infrared radiation ( heat energy ) . all objects in the universe that have a temperature above absolute zero give off some form of electromagnetic radiation . infrared light is one of several types of radiation present in the electromagnetic spectrum . astronomers use several different types of telescopes to detect different types of emitted radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum . some of these are gamma ray , x-ray , ultra-violet , regular visible light ( optical ) , as well as infrared telescopes . ground-based infrared telescopes are affected by earth 's atmosphere . they work best in the shorter part of the infrared , a micrometer or two . putting an infrared telescope in outer space or above the clouds ( water vapor ) is big help , especially for longer wavelengths ( several micrometers ) which cooler objects emit . examples would be asteroids and interstellar clouds .
