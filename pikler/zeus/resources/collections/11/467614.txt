Flanking maneuver     in military tactics , a flanking maneuver ( also called a flank attack ) , is an attack on the sides or rear of an opposing force . if a flanking maneuver succeeds , the opposing force would be surrounded or have to fight from two or more directions . this reduces the ability of the outflanked force to move or defend itself . unlike an envelopment , which depends on the enemy 's defensive position , any obstacles and the terrain , a flanking maneuver uses the enemy 's forward movement to create an attackable flank . a psychological advantage may also be present . the confusion and threat from multiple directions can often cause shock and panic . this may cause soldiers to run from the battle . a larger-scaled tactical flanking is called a strategic flanking . this is where the targets of the flanking could be as large as divisions or even entire armies . a flanking maneuver works best when an enemy is engaged at their front . often an opposing force must be maneuvered into a position where a flanking attack would work . an ideal situation is getting them into a position where their front is narrow and the flanks are long . a classic example of a flanking maneuver was by confederate general stonewall jackson against the union army of the potomac at the battle of chancellorsville .
