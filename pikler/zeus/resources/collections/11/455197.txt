Tidal locking     tidal locking ( or captured rotation ) is when one side of an astronomical body always faces another . it is also called synchronous rotation . the classic example is the moon : the same side of the moon always faces the earth . a tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner . this makes one hemisphere constantly face the partner body . usually , at any given time only the satellite is tidally locked around the larger body . if the two bodies are similar in mass , and their distance apart is small , the tidal force will lock `` each '' to the other . this is the case between pluto and charon . if the moon were not spinning at all , it would alternately show its near and far sides to earth , while moving around earth in orbit . it is possible to work out how long it takes for a particular case of tidal locking to occur . it is just a rough estimate , because some factors are poorly known . an example is the rigidity of a planetary body and its change in shape under tidal force . tidal locking is an aspect of orbital resonance .
