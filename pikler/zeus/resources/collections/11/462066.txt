Data vault modeling     data vault modeling is a database modeling method that tries to preserve different sets of historical data from different sources . it is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing , tracing of data , loading speed and resilience to change . data vault modeling focuses on several things . first , it emphasizes the need to trace where all the data in the database came from . each row has extra attributes that describe where the data came from , and at what time it was loaded . this feature lets auditors find the source of the values . data vault modeling does not distinguish between data that conforms to the business rules and data that does not . the data that does not conform is generally called `` bad data '' . dan linstedt , who developed the technology , said that a data vault modeling stores `` a single version of the facts '' . in other data warehouse modeling schemes , the data warehouse generally stores `` a single version of the truth '' , data that does not conform to the business rules is removed .
