Hyaenodont     the hyaenodontidae ( `` hyaena teeth '' ) is a family of the extinct order creodonta , which contains several dozen genera . the hyaenodonts were important mammalian predators that arose during the late paleocene and persisted well into the miocene . they were more widespread and successful than their sister family , the oxyaenids . they had long skulls , slender jaws , slim bodies , and a tendency to walk on their toes rather than flat-footed ( plantigrade ) . they ranged in size from 30 to 140 cm at the shoulder . `` hyaenodon gigas '' , the larger species , was as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder , 10 feet long and weighed about 500 kg , but most were in the 5â€“15 kg range , equivalent to a mid-sized dog . fossil evidence of their skulls shows that they had a particularly acute sense of smell , while their teeth were adapted for shearing , rather than crushing . their lack of crushing teeth means they could not crush the bones of any but the smallest prey . this contrasts with modern hyaenas , which can crush bones of larger prey . this gives then a good source of calcium , and access to the highly nutritious bone marrow . modern bears and dogs also have bone-crushing capability , though not to the same extent as hyaenas . hyaenodonts thus thus lacked dental versatility for processing any foods other than meat .
