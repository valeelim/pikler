Luminous blue variable     luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are massive evolved stars . they show unpredictable and sometimes dramatic variations in their spectra and their brightness . these unstable supergiants or hypergiants are also known as s doradus variables . s doradus is one of the brightest stars of the large magellanic cloud . lbvs are extraordinarily rare with just 20 listed in the general catalogue of variable stars as sdor , and some of these are no longer considered to be lbvs . in their `` quiescent '' state they are typically b-type stars , occasionally slightly hotter , with unusual emission lines . they are found in a region of the hertzsprungâ€“russell diagram known as the `` s doradus instability strip '' . there the least luminous have a temperature around 10,000 k and a luminosity about 250,000 times the sun . the most luminous have a temperature around 25,000 k and a luminosity over a million times the sun . these are some of the most luminous of all stars . their relationship to supernovae is unclear .
