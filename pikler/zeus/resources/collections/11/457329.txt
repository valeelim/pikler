Helix (genus)    helix ( genus ) helix is a genus of large air-breathing land snails , terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs . the genus `` helix '' is known from the oligocene onwards . this genus is native to europe and the regions around the mediterranean sea . the best-known species include `` helix aspersa '' , the common , or brown garden snail , and `` helix pomatia '' , the roman snail , burgundy snail , or edible snail . `` h. pomatia '' and some other species are eaten as escargots . `` helix '' snails have been introduced throughout the world , where some , especially `` h. aspersa '' , have become garden pests . snails in this genus create and use love darts during mating . `` helix '' snails prefer cool , damp environments , as they easily get dry . snails are most active at night and after rainfall . during unfavourable conditions , a snail will remain inside its shell , usually under rocks or other hiding places , to avoid being discovered by predators . in dry climates snails will naturally congregate near water sources , including artificial sources such as waste-water outlets of air conditioners .
