Ground beetle     ground beetles are the carabidae , a large , cosmopolitan family of beetles . there are more than 40,000 species worldwide , about 2,000 of which are found in north america and 2,700 in europe . there are a large number of subfaamilies . although their body shapes and colouring vary , most are shiny black or metallic . they have ridged wing covers ( elytra ) . the elytra are fused in some large flightless species . almost all carabids have a groove on their foreleg with a comb of hairs used to clean their antennae . they defend themselves with noxious secretions . this is typical for the ancient beetle suborder adephaga to which they belong . they have paired glands in the lower back of the abdomen . these are well developed , and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators . in bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion with a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas . this can injure small mammals , such as shrews , and may kill invertebrate predators outright . to humans , getting `` bombed '' by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience . this ability has evolved twice â€“ in the flanged bombardier beetles ( paussinae ) which are among the most ancient ground beetles , as well as in the typical bombardier beetles ( brachininae ) which are part of a more `` modern '' lineage .
