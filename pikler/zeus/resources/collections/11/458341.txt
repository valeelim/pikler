Kulindadromeus     kulindadromeus is a herbivorous dinosaur , an ornithischian from the jurassic of siberia , russia . the fossil shows clear signs of feather-like structures on its body . this is important because it was not known whether this group had proto-feathers . these structures probably had the function of temperature regulation : they were not flight feathers . the original specimen was a partial skull with lower jaws . the volcanic ash layers of the formation form a `` konservat-lagerst√§tte '' with exceptional preservation . from 2010 onwards , more fossil material has been discovered , including subadult and juvenile individuals . specimens show large parts of its body surface ( skin or 'integuent ' ) . there are rows of scales on top of its tail and a covering of scales branching into feather-like structures . until its discovery proto-feathers were thought to be only in the theropoda . the feather remains discovered are of three types . the first type consists of hair-like filaments covering the trunk , neck and head . these are up to three centimetres long and resemble the `` dino-fuzz '' already known from theropods like `` sinosauropteryx '' . the second type shows groups of 1.5 centimetres-long filaments , each group coming from a base plate . these are on the upper arm and thigh . the base plates are ordered in a hexagonal pattern but do not touch each other . the third type is unique . it was found on the upper lower legs and consists of bundles of six or seven ribbon-like structures , up to two centimetres long . each ribbon is made from about ten parallel filaments up to 0.1 millimetres wide .
