Ghoti     ghoti is an artificial word used to illustrate irregularities in english spelling . it is a respelling of the word `` fish '' : i.e. , it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈfɪʃ/ . it is made of these phonemes : - gh , pronounced /f/ as in tough /tʌf/ ; - o , pronounced /ɪ/ as in women /ˈwɪmɪn/ ; and - ti , pronounced /ʃ/ as in nation /ˈneɪʃən/ . using the same method , `` ghoti '' can be a silent word , where : - gh as in though ; here , and in the next examples , the bold letters are not pronounced . - o as in people ; - t as in ballet ; - i as in business in fact , `` ghoti '' is likely to be spontaneously pronounced [ goʊtaɪ ] or [ gəʊtaɪ ] ( like `` go '' + `` tie '' ) but certainly not like `` fish '' since : `` gh '' is never pronounced [ f ] ( cf . `` ghost '' ) at the beginning of a word neither `` ti '' is pronounced [ ʃ ] at the end of a word . spelling in english is discussed in orthography .
