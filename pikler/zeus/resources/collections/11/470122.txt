Student's t-distribution    student 's t-distribution \ ! < /math > | - Ïˆ : digamma function , - `` b '' : beta function| mgf = undefined| - `` k '' ( `` x '' ) : modified bessel function of the second kind student 's t-distribution is a probability distribution which was developed by william sealy gosset in 1908 . `` student '' is the pseudonym he used when he published the paper which describes the distribution . gosset worked at a brewery and was interested in the problems of small samples , for example the chemical properties of barley . in the problems he analyzed , the sample size might be as low as three . one version of the origin of the pseudonym is that gosset 's employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers instead of their real name , so he used the name `` student '' to hide his identity . another version is that the brewery did not want their competitors to know that they were using the `` t '' -test to test the quality of raw material . because of the small sample size , estimating the standard deviation is not possible . also , in many cases gosset encountered , the probability distribution of the samples was not known .
