Electroreception     electroreception is the ability animals have to sense electrical sources . it is mostly found in aquatic or amphibious animals . this is because water helps the signals travel better than air . some exceptions are the echidnas , cockroaches and bees . electroreception is used in electrolocation . until recently , people thought only vertebrates had electroreception . however , research has shown that bees use electroreception to find flowers . electroreception is found in lampreys , cartilaginous fishes ( sharks , rays , chimaeras ) , lungfishes , bichirs , coelacanths , sturgeons , catfishes , gymnotiformes , monotremes , and at least one species of cetacean . fish have electroreception from their lateral lines . in most groups electroreception is used for predation . the western long-beaked echidna has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill . its relative , the duck-billed platypus , has 40,000. electroreceptive animals use this sense to find where objects are . this is important in ecological niches where the animal can not see . for example , animals can not use their vision in caves , in murky water , and at night . many fish use electric fields to find buried prey . some shark pups `` freeze '' when they feel the electric signal of their predators .
