Chemical synapse     chemical synapses are synapses that use chemical messengers called neurotransmitters to transmit signals . they are found all over the body . especially in the central nervous system and the brain . neurons use electrical signals to carry information . these signals are called action potentials . there are an estimated 86 billion neurons in the average human brain . neurons do n't act alone . they need to connect to other neurons and pass messages between each other . the electrical signal can not pass the gap between neurons alone . this is why neurotransmitters are needed to pass signals from one neuron to the next . in this sense they differ from electrical synapses which pass electric signals directly to the next neuron . chemical synapses can be further classified depending upon function and structure . the structure of a typical chemical synapse comes in three parts : - the pre-synaptic terminal is usually on the axon . this releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft . the pre-synaptic terminal is the first part of synaptic transmission and so has a `` pre- '' suffix .
