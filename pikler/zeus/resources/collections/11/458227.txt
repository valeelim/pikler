Fork (software development)    fork ( software development ) in software engineering , a project fork happens when a copy of source code from one software package is made into a different piece of software . forking is not only creating a new branch from the old software , but also a split in support between the old and new software . free and open-source software is code that may be forked from the original development team without prior permission . this does not violate copyright law . however , licensed forks of proprietary software ( `` e.g . '' unix ) also happen .
