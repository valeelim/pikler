Blazar     a blazar is a very compact quasar ( quasi-stellar radio source ) . they have a presumed supermassive black hole at the center of an active , giant elliptical galaxy . blazars are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe and are an important topic in astronomy . blazars are one of a group of active galaxies that host active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . an agn is a region at the centre of a galaxy which has a much higher than normal luminosity over some or all of the electromagnetic spectrum . the name `` blazar '' was originally coined in 1978 by astronomer edward spiegel . blazars are agn with a relativistic jet which is pointing in the general direction of the earth . we observe `` down '' the jet , or nearly so . many blazars have apparent superluminal features within the first few parsecs of their jets , probably due to relativistic shock fronts . the blazar at the centre of galaxy m87 is fuelled by a black hole with a mass of about three billion solar masses within ten light years of the galaxy centre .
