Limit of a sequence     in mathematics , a sequence is an ordered list of events . each event consists of a mathematical object , which is a number in many cases . in some cases , the sequence tends towards a limit . in this case , the sequence is said to be convergent , otherwise it is divergent . in a convergent sequence , the absolute difference between the value of the current element and the limit , formula_1 will decrease as the sequence progresses . we call formula_2 the limit of the sequence formula_3 if the following condition holds : in other words , for every measure of closeness formula_8 , the sequence 's terms are eventually that close to the limit . the sequence formula_3 is said to converge to or tend to the limit formula_2 , written formula_11 or formula_12 . if a sequence converges to some limit , then it is convergent ; otherwise it is divergent . the greek philosopher zeno of elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes . leucippus , democritus , antiphon , eudoxus and archimedes developed the method of exhaustion , which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume . archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series .
