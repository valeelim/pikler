Epsilon Eridani     epsilon eridani ( ε eri , ε eridani ) is a star in the southern constellation eridanus , just south of the celestial equator . it can be seen from most of earth 's surface . it is 10.5 light years ( ly ) away , and has an apparent magnitude of 3.73. it is the third closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye . epsilon eridani was the closest star known to host a planet until the unconfirmed discovery of alpha centauri bb . its age is less than a billion years . because of its youth , epsilon eridani has a more active magnetic field than the present-day sun . its stellar wind is 30 times as strong . its rotation period is 11.2 days at the equator . the star is smaller and less massive than the sun , and has a lower level of metal elements . it is a main-sequence star of spectral class k2 , which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5,000 k , giving it an orange hue . its planet , epsilon eridani b , was announced in 2000. the planet orbits in about 7 years . it is about 3.4 astronomical units ( au ) away from its star .
