Gryphaea     gryphaea ( the devil 's toenail ) is a genus of extinct oysters which were once very common . their fossils are common on the jurassic coast in southern england , and in the margins of the old sundance sea in the united states . it is a marine bivalve mollusc in the family gryphaeidae . these bivalves were at their peak in the jurassic and cretaceous periods , when they sat in huge muddy oyster beds in shallow tropical seas . the genus survived a long time , but went extinct about 34 million years ago ( mya ) . the oyster shell has two 'valves ' : a larger gnarly-shaped shell ( the 'toenail ' ) and a smaller , flattened shell , the 'lid ' . the soft parts of the animal lived in the gap between the two shells , just like modern oysters . the shells have prominent growth bands . the large curved shell sat in the mud on the sea floor . in england at the coasts of redcar and weymouth in the kimmeridgian clay ; in the u.s.a in riverbanks and cliffs of texas and kansas . they are often washed out of the clay onto the beach or river banksides .
