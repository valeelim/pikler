Savannah cat     the savannah cat is a breed of cat . it is the size of a medium dog . the breed is a combination of the serval and the domestic cat . it is a hybrid feline developed by crossing a domestic cat with a serval for a number of generations . the bodies of savannahs are long and leggy . when a savannah is standing , its hind-end is often higher than its shoulders . the small head is taller than wide , and it has a long , slender neck . the backs of the ears have vivid marking , very clear in the first illustration . this is inherited from the serval cat . in the wild this lets kittens know where the mother is heading . in grass the kits can jump up to get a sight of their mothers ' ears . this is important because servals can cover a lot of territory very quickly . serval cats can jump over 9 feet high from a standing start . savannahs also jump high , but how high depends on the individual . they sometimes jump on top of doors , or onto shelves . they love the water . they have very few health issues . they make a hissing noise that sounds like a snake . overall , they are active and intelligent .
