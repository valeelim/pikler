D (programming language)    d ( programming language ) the d programming language is an object-oriented , imperative , multi-paradigm system programming language . d language originated as a re-engineering of c++ , and d 's design goals try combining the performance of compiled languages with the safety and expressive power of modern dynamic languages . native d code is commonly as fast as equivalent c++ code , while being shorter and memory-safe . this example program prints its command line arguments . the codice_1 function is the entry point of a d program , and codice_2 is an array of strings representing the command line arguments . a codice_3 in d is an array of characters , represented by codice_4 in d1 , or codice_5 in d2 . import std.stdio : writefln ; void main ( string [ ] args ) the codice_6 statement can iterate over any collection . in this case , it is producing a sequence of indexes ( codice_7 ) and values ( codice_8 ) from the array codice_2 . the index codice_7 and the value codice_8 have their types inferred from the type of the array codice_2 .
