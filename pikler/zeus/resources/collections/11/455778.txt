Bee-eater     the bee-eaters are a group of land birds in the family meropidae . they live in the old world and australasia : africa , asia , europe , australia , and new guinea . they have richly coloured plumage and slender bodies . they have long downturned bills and pointed wings , which give them a swallow-like appearance . there are 26 different species of bee-eaters . as the name suggests , bee-eaters eat flying insects , especially bees and wasps . they catch them in the air by darting from a perch . the birds only catch prey which is flying : they ignore flying insects once they land . mostly , they eat honeybees . hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) make up from 20 % to 96 % of all insects eaten . before eating its meal , a bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface . the bird squeezes out most of the venom . bee-eaters live together . they form colonies by nesting in burrows tunnelled into the side of sandy banks , such as those that have collapsed on the edges of rivers . many of these holes occur together .
