Geochronology     geochronology is the science of finding the ages of rocks , fossils and sediments . it uses a number of methods . geochronology is the main tool used to get absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages , and for the history of the earth and other bodies . by measuring the amount of radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life , geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material . a number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose , and depending on the rate of decay , are used for dating different geological periods . more slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time , but less accurate in absolute years . with the exception of the radiocarbon method , most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a radiogenic isotope , which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope . two or more radiometric methods can be used in concert to achieve more robust results . most radiometric methods are suitable for geological time only , but some such as the radiocarbon method and the ar/ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history .
