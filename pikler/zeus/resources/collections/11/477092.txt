Regnal year     a regnal year is a year of the reign of a monarch . it is from the latin `` regnum '' meaning kingdom or rule . some of the oldest dating systems were in regnal years . a regnal year usually begins on the date of a monarch 's accession to the throne . year one is counted from day one to the end of the first year of a monarch 's reign . then a second year of rule , a third , and so on . they would not have a zero year of rule . it is displayed as an ordinal , not a cardinal number . every year of a monarch 's reign falls within two calendar years , unless the reign began on the first day of the calendar year . when converting a regnal year in history to a calendar year , this can cause an error of one year . in england , from the 10th century until the late 13th century , the practice was to count the regnal year from the date of coronation . this was usually a later date than when a monarch was proclaimed king or queen . the current practice of dating from the date of accession began in the late 13th century when the heir was out of the country . henry iii of england died on 16 november 1272 which some sources date as the beginning of edward i of england 's rule . his reign actually began when he was proclaimed king at the new temple on 20 november 1272. here the date error between sources would be only four days .
