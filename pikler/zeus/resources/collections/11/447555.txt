Antimatter fuel     antimatter , when it comes into contact with regular matter , releases a huge amount of energy . this energy is in the form of an explosion . this explosion can be harnessed for electrical means ( creating electricity ) or as a thrust ( because antimatter has to be created , it would be extremely inefficient to use for electricity . ) since newtons laws state that if you push something , you get pushed . that is how rockets work . the antimatter can be exploded and forced behind the rocket , pushing the rocket forward . but antimatter reactions can produce harmful discharges of high energy gamma rays . high energy gamma rays break down molecules in cells and can also make the rocket engines radioactive . the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) is currently doing research to reduce this harmful side effect .
