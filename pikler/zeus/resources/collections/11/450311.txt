Catch and release     catch and release is a practice in sport fishing for conservation of the various species . once caught , the fisherman carefully and quickly removes the hook from the fish 's mouth . then , without causing any harm , returns the fish alive to the water . weighing and measuring of the fish , if done , are often done in the water . using barbless hooks , it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water ( a slack line is frequently sufficient ) . catch and release is an ethical decision by fishermen but it is not for every situation . the snakehead fish , for example , is an invasive species . it is illegal in many places to return them to the water . the muskellunge is a highly prized game fish in many places . but , in a few places it is seen also as an invasive species and should not be returned to the water . debates continue over the practice of catch and release . in canada , many first nations peoples feel strongly that fish should only be taken as needed for food . that `` playing with the fish '' is not showing proper respect . sportsmen point out that catch and release is respectful since they take only what they need and release the rest .
