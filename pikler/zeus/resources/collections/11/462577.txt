Software as a service     software as a service is the idea that clients access and use software using a thin client or a web browser . the software itself is running on computers accessible through the internet ( `` in the cloud '' ) . clients usually pay a fee to get access to the software . the benefit of this approach is that clients do not need to manage the software installation , and that they also do not need expensive hardware . one of the problems is that the data is also on the site of the company running the software - that is `` in the cloud '' . getting the data may be difficult , if the software vendor goes bankrupt .
