Pine nut     pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines ( family pinaceae , genus `` pinus '' ) . about 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting . other pines have edible seeds too small to be useful as a human food . pine nuts have been eaten in europe and asia since the paleolithic period . they are often added to meat , fish , salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread . in italian they are called `` pinoli '' . they are an essential part of italian pesto sauce . pine nuts can be pressed to extract pine nut oil , which is valued for its mild , nutty flavour . the large edible seeds of the southern hemisphere conifer genus `` araucaria '' produce nuts rather like pine nuts .
