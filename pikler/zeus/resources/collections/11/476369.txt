Closure (mathematics)    closure ( mathematics ) closure describes the case when the results of a mathematical operation are always defined . for example , in ordinary arithmetic , addition has closure . whenever one adds two numbers , the answer is a number . the same is true of multiplication . division does not have closure , because division by 0 is not defined . in the natural numbers , subtraction does not have closure , but in the integers subtraction does have closure . subtraction of two numbers can produce a negative number , which is not a natural number , but it is an integer . one can sometimes make closure of a mathematical object by including new elements . the integers are a closure of the natural numbers by including negative numbers . the real numbers are a closure of the rational numbers by including square roots of positive numbers . the complex numbers are a closure of the real numbers by including square roots of negative numbers . sometimes , if one includes an element to make closure , it makes more changes . for example , if one includes infinity , formula_1 , that is closure of division , the laws of addition and subtraction are changed . there is no inversion of addition for formula_2 .
