Paramylodon     paramylodon is an extinct genus of ground sloth . it was endemic to north america in the pliocene , and to the end of the pleistocene epoch . it lived from around ~4.9 million years ago ( mya ) to 11,000 years ago . `` paramylodon '' was about 3 m ( 9.8 ft ) in height and weighted as much as 1089 kg . it is known from deposits in the united states , mexico and as far south as guatemala . there is just one recognized species , `` p. harlani '' , ( owen ) 1840 , which is commonly referred to as harlan 's ground sloth in honor of the american paleontologist who first discovered and described a lower jaw in 1835. like the south american `` mylodon '' , `` paramylodon '' had dermal ossicles : small bones embedded in the skin . this made it harder for predators if they attacked from behind . its skull and teeth suggest it was , like the other members of its group , a browser on leaves and small branches . it ate standing on its hind legs and using its huge hands to pull the vegetation into its mouth . skeletons found in the la brea tar pits were more or less complete .
