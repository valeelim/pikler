Hysteresis     hysteresis is a concept in physical science . in hysteresis the output of a system depends not only on its input , but also on its history of past inputs . this is because the history affects the value of an internal state . to predict the future outputs of a system , either its internal state or its history must be known . the effect may happen because of a lag between input and output . this effect disappears as the input changes more slowly . this effect meets the description of hysteresis given above , but is often referred to as `` rate-dependent hysteresis '' to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect . hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic materials and ferroelectric materials . it also occurs in the deformation of some materials ( such as rubber bands and shape-memory alloys ) . many artificial systems are designed to have hysteresis : for example , in thermostats and computers .
