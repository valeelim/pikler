Corn Laws     the corn laws were a series of british laws regarding taxes on corn . these laws were passed in the 1800s . the laws were passed to favor and protect british land owners . lord liverpool passed them in 1815 : if the price for corn was below 80 shillings per quarter , importing corn was forbidden ; if the price was above , there were no import taxes . in 1822 and 1828 , there were small changes . the laws caused many protests , and they were phased out under the government of robert peel , in 1846. despite this , over one million people starved in ireland , between 1846 and 1849. this famine is known as irish potato famine today . economists , such as david ricardo were against the corn laws . ricardo believed that overall the laws made corn too expensive for the economy as a whole . he also believed that with the laws , the protection of agriculture was too big . he wrote about these ideas in his work called `` on the principles of political economy and taxation `` from 1817 '' . `` thomas malthus was in favor of the laws ; in his opinion , they helped the agriculture of the country , and would not lead to the country depending on others .
