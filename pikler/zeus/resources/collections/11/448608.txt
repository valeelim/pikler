Ground sloth     ground sloths are a group of extinct large sloths in the mammalian superorder xenarthra . the term `` ground sloth '' is used as opposed to the much smaller living `` tree sloths '' . their most recent survivors lived in the caribbean antilles , where they may have survived until about 2819 and 2660 bc . this was the last known occurrence of `` megalocnus '' in cuba . ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of north and south america for 10,000 years or more . their later survival in the caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans . some island sloth populations persisted 5,000-6,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives . this fits the global pattern of late quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal . most ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late tertiary of south america while the continent was isolated . at their earliest appearance in the fossil record , the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level . the presence of intervening islands between the american continents in the miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into north america . a number of mid- to small-sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges . ground sloths were a hardy group : their numbers and dispersals into remote areas are evidence of this . remains have been found in patagonia ( cueva del milod√≥n ) , and parts of alaska .
