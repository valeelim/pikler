Instar     an instar is a stage in the growth of an insect larva . as an example , there are three instars in the growth of a housefly . during each instar it eats and grows . then it sheds ( moults ) its outer covering ( exoskeleton ) and grows some more . after the third instar it changes into a pupa , the next stage in its development . the adult ( imago ) which comes out of the pupa is the familiar housefly . with many insects , most of the eating and growing is done by the larvae . the function of the adults is to reproduce .
