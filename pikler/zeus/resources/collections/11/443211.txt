Magnetic field line     a magnetic field line or magnetic flux line shows the direction of a magnet 's force and the strength of a magnet . the idea of lines of force was invented by michael faraday . his theory is that all of reality is made up of force itself . his theory predicts that electricity , light , and gravity have finite propagation delays . einstein 's theory agrees with this . one can make magnetic field lines show as if they were physical phenomena . for example , iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field lines ' . if there are a lot of lines through a magnet and not a great space between them , the magnet is strong . if the lines between a magnet are far apart and there are n't many lines , the magnet is weak . a way of determining the strength of a magnet is to do an experiment with iron filings . the iron filings will get attracted to the magnet and move into the shape of the flux lines . you then look at the shape of the iron filings and see the gap between the flux lines . this gives you an idea of the strength of the magnet .
