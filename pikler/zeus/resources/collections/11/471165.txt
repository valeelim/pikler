Canadian Club     canadian club ( also commonly known as just c.c . ) is a canadian brand of whisky . canadian club was created by gooderham and worts . it is currently being produced by beam suntory . canadian club started being made in 1858. the first distillery was created in walkerville , ontario . they decided to create the distillery in walkerville because of the good quality of the local grains that were there . the whisky was popular in the late 19th century in gentlemen 's clubs of canada and the united states . it was known as `` club whisky '' because of this . after it became very popular , american distillers decided to petition to include the word `` canada '' on the bottle to identify it from their competing whiskies . by doing this , they thought that it would stop the popularity of the whisky . however , this made the whisky even more exclusive . in 1889 , walker changed the label and added the word “ canadian ” to the top of the label . in 1890 , the label was changed again , with `` canadian '' being moved down from the top of the label and incorporated into the name of the whisky .
