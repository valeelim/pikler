Teaching machine     teaching machines were originally mechanical devices . they presented educational materials and taught students . they were first invented by sidney l. pressey . his machine originally administered multiple-choice questions . when the machine was set so it moved on only when the student got the right answer , tests showed that learning had taken place . much later , norman crowder developed the pressey idea much further . b.f. skinner was responsible for a different type of machine which used his ideas on how learning should be directed with positive reinforcement . there is extensive experience that both methods worked well , and so did programmed learning in other forms , such as books . the ideas of teaching machines and programmed learning provided the basis for later ideas such as open learning and computer-assisted instruction . quotes . - edward l. thorndike in 1912 : `` if , by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity , a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible , and so on , much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print '' .
