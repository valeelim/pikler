Sequoyah     sequoyah was a cherokee man . he invented a syllabary ( alphabet based on syllables ) for his people . before that , they did not have an alphabet for their language . sequoyah was born into the cherokee nation . his mother was `` wut-teh '' . not many people know about his early childhood . there are different stories on what happened . sequoyah met many white people . he was fascinated by their `` talking leaves , '' which was their writing system on paper . he wanted to make an alphabet for cherokees to communicate too . he began making it around 1809. first he tried to make a symbol for every word , like in chinese . that required too much remembering . then he tried to make one for every idea , but gave up . finally he made one symbol for every syllable in the cherokee language . he made a syllabary with 86 letters . many of the letters look like english because he had an english book that he could not read . he taught the syllabary to his daughter , ayokeh ( ayoka ) . then he tested it in front of a group of leaders . they said a word , he wrote it down , and then ayokeh repeated them . originally people thought it was witchcraft , but then they started liking his syllabary . many cherokee learned it and eventually became literate , which means they could read and write . in fact , more cherokees could read and write than nearby white people .
