Tenrec     the tenrec is a mammal of the family tenrecidae , found on madagascar and in parts of the african mainland . tenrecs are varied . as a result of convergent evolution , they look like hedgehogs , shrews , opossums , mice and even otters . they occupy aquatic , arboreal , terrestrial and underground habitats . some of these species can be found in the madagascar 's dry deciduous forests . although they may resemble shrews , hedgehogs , or otters , they are not closely related to any of these groups . their closest relatives are other african , insectivorous mammals such as golden moles and elephant shrews . the common ancestry of these animals , together with aardvarks , hyraxes , elephants , and sea cows in the group afrotheria , was not recognized until the late 1990s . work on the diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided more support for their common ancestry . unusual among placental mammals , the anus and urogenital tracts of tenrecs share a common opening , or cloaca , a feature more commonly seen in birds , reptiles , and amphibians . they have low body temperatures , sufficiently so that they do not require a scrotum to cool their sperm as most other mammals do .
