Breakbeat     breakbeat ( also called breaks or breakbeats ) refers to two things . it is both an electronic music genre and the distinct percussive rhythm from which this genre takes its name . as a musical device , breakbeats have been known and used for almost a hundred years . the name and modern meaning of the term traces its origins to the rise of hip hop in the united states during the 1980s . the electronic music genre is widely regarded as coming from the united kingdom 's early rave music . breakbeats were added to the music to form what became known as breakbeat hardcore . however , breakbeats had been used by american hip hop djs and turntablists in instrumental sets well before the advent of rave in the uk . it could be argued that the two scenes developed in parallel . today , breakbeat lives on in the form of strong regional scenes in the us and uk . breakbeats are frequently used in the production of such diverse music genres as hip hop , jungle or drum and bass , hardcore , uk garage ( including 2-step , breakstep and dubstep ) . since the 1990s , breakbeat has been used as background music to tv adverts . it also has been used in action film soundtracks .
