Canis Major dwarf     the canis major dwarf galaxy ( `` cma dwarf '' ) or canis major overdensity ( `` cma overdensity '' ) is a disputed dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group . it is in the same part of the sky as the constellation canis major . the supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giant stars , and is thought to contain an estimated one billion stars in all . the canis major dwarf is classified as an irregular galaxy . it is now thought to be the closest neighbouring galaxy to our position in the milky way . it is about 25,000 light-years away from the solar system , and 52,000 light-years from the galactic centre . it has a roughly elliptical shape and is thought to contain as many stars as the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy , the previous contender for closest galaxy to us . the dwarf was discovered in 2003. several studies cast doubts on the true nature of this overdensity . investigation of the area in 2009 showed only ten rr lyrae variable stars . this is consistent with the milky way 's halo and thick disk populations , rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy .
