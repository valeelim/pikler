Cymothoa exigua     cymothoa exigua , or the tongue-eating louse , is a crustacean , a parasitic isopod . this parasite enters fish through the gills , and then attaches itself . the female attaches to the fish 's tongue , and the male attaches on the gill arches beneath and behind the female . the female parasite destroys the fish 's tongue . then it attaches itself to the stub of what was once the tongue and becomes the fish 's new tongue . `` cymothoa exigua '' gets blood through the claws on its front , causing the tongue to atrophy ( wither ) from lack of blood . the parasite then replaces the fish 's tongue by attaching its own body to the muscles of the tongue stub . the fish is able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue . it appears that the parasite does not cause any other damage to the host fish . once `` c. exigua '' replaces the tongue , some feed on the host 's blood and many others feed on fish mucus . this is the only known case of a parasite replacing the function of a host organ . there are many species of `` cymothoa '' , but only `` c. exigua '' is known to consume and replace its host 's tongue .
