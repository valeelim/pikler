Nuclear membrane     the nuclear membrane is the membrane inside a cell around the nucleus . it has the genetic material ( chromosomes and dna ) and the nucleolus inside it . the membrane forms a double layer called the nuclear envelope . it is connected to another group of membranes in the cell , the endoplasmic reticulum . it is a double lipid bilayer membrane which surrounds the chromosomes and nucleolus in eukaryotic cells . the nuclear membrane has thousands of nuclear pores . they are large hollow proteins about 100 nm across , with an inner channel about 40 nm wide . they link the inner and outer nuclear membranes . during cell division , the nuclear membrane breaks down to allow mitosis to take place .
