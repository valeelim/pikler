Aularches miliaris     aularches miliaris is a grasshopper found in south and southeast asia . it is protected by powerful chemical defences , and its warning colour signals its foul taste . when it is disturbed or grabbed , it makes a sharp rasping noise with its thoracic segments . then , if its thorax is pinched , it gives off a toxic foam . it squirts a clear viscous mucus with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste , faintly alkaline , with many bubbles . this foam comes out as a strong jet from openings in the thorax , and more gently from other openings in the body ( ten in total ) . the foam heaps up around the insect and partly covers it . the head and thorax are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side . the leathery front wings are green with many yellow spots ; the legs are blue , with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind legs . the abdomen is black with bright red bands . like most noxious animals , it is very visible and slow-moving on vegetation . it pays to advertise , and it does not need to hide .
