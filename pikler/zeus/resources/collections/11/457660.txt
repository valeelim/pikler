Photorefractive keratectomy     photorefractive keratectomy ( prk ) is a type of laser eye surgery . prk uses an ultraviolet laser to reshape the cornea ( outer surface of the eye ) . prk can correct astigmatism , nearsightedness , and farsightedness . unlike lasik , prk does not create a flap in the eye . although no surgery is completely safe , prk has less complications or side effects than lasik . some patients who can not have lasik may be able to get prk . prk is especially preferred over lasik for people with high prescriptions , thin corneas , and people who are more likely to get eye injuries , such as athletes or police officers . potential side effects or complications include seeing haloes , starbursts , or glare , corneal haze , dry eye , infection , blurry vision , double vision , and the continued need for glasses or contact lenses . side effects are more likely if an old or obsolete laser is used , which many clinics still use . side effects are usually temporary but may become permanent . some temporary side effects may be caused by the eye drops used , and not the surgery itself .
