Grey market     a grey market ( or parallel market ) is a market where goods are sold legally , but outside the commonly-used channels and at lower prices . they are sold without the permission of the manufacturer . consumers buying grey market goods risk not having warranties honored . they risk getting user guides and software in the wrong language . packages may not include all accessories needed for a particular market . sometimes grey market goods are sold without packaging , user guides or needed accessories . there is usually no after-sale support for products . grey market products are often sold via the internet without charging customers any sales tax . products sold by grey marketers generally sell for much less than authorized dealers . this causes a loss of tax revenue to governments .
