American Athletic Conference     the american athletic conference ( also known as `` the american '' or `` aac '' ) is a big college sports conference in the united states . its members play in ncaa division i. in football , they play in the football bowl subdivision ( fbs ; known before 2006 as division i-a ) , the higher of two levels of division i football . the american has its roots in the original big east conference . that conference was started in 1979 as a basketball-first league by a group of schools in the eastern u.s. the big east added football in 1991. that led to years of conflict between schools that played i-a/fbs football and those that did not . in july 2013 , the big east split into two conferences . the seven schools that did not play fbs football left to form a new big east conference . the fbs schools that did not go to other conferences stayed in the old conference structure . along with several new members , they began operating as the american athletic conference . the american kept the original big east charter . that makes it the legal successor of the old big east . however , both the american and the new big east claim 1979 as their founding dates . both also claim the pre-split history of the old big east .
