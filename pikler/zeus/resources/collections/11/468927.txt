One's complement    one 's complement the one 's complement is an operation that can be done to binary numbers . it is obtained by swapping all the bits in the number , that is , replacing `` 1 '' with `` 0 '' , or `` 0 '' with `` 1 '' . in many systems , this is used to represent the inverse of a number . one of the big problems that occur when using one 's complement is that the number zero has two representations , either all 0 's or all 1 's . using 4 digits both `` 0000 '' and `` 1111 '' represent zero . this problem can be solved by using two 's complement .
