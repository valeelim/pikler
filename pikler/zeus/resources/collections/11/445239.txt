Seti I     menmaatre seti i ( or sethos i as in greek ) was a pharaoh of the new kingdom 19th dynasty . he was the son of ramesses i and queen sitre , and the father of ramesses ii . as with all dates in ancient egypt , the actual dates of his reign are unclear . various historians claim different dates , with 1294 bc to 1279 bc and 1290 bc to 1279 bc being the most commonly used by scholars today . the name 'seti ' means `` of set '' , which indicates that he was consecrated to the god set ( or `` seth '' ) . as with most pharaohs , seti had several names . upon his ascension , he took the `` prenomen '' `` mn-m3 ‘ t-r ‘ '' , usually vocalized as `` menmaatre '' , in egyptian , which means `` eternal is the justice of re . '' his better known nomen , or birth name , is transliterated as `` sty mry-n-ptḥ '' or `` sety merenptah '' , meaning `` man of set , beloved of ptah '' . the greatest achievement of seti i 's foreign policy was the capture of the syrian town of kadesh and neighboring territory of amurru from the hittite empire . egypt had not held kadesh since the time of akhenaten .
