Planetary system     planetary system is the general term for a star with planets and other objects in orbit around it . the solar system is one of these . it is now clear that many other stars have planetary systems . the 21st century has become a golden era of planetary system discovery . 1795 such planets in 1116 planetary systems , including 461 multiplanet systems . hundreds more systems are unconfirmed . ( 2014 data ) the closest confirmed system is gliese 832 at 14.8 light years ( ly ) with one confirmed planet , whereas the closest unconfirmed system is alpha centauri at 4.37 ly with a planet of earth mass . the closest multi-planet system is gliese 876 at 15.3 ly with four confirmed planets . of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems . this is thought to be the region with the most potential to develop extraterrestrial life . multiplanetary systems are stars with at least two confirmed planets , beyond our solar system . from the total of 1116 stars known to have exoplanets ( as of june 2014 , there are a total of 461 known multiplanetary systems . about 280 of these have only two confirmed exoplanets , but some have more . the star with the most confirmed planets is our sun with 8 confirmed planets , while the stars with the most confirmed exoplanets are kepler-90 and hd 10180 with 7 confirmed planets each ; in 2012 , two more exoplanet candidates have been suggested for hd 10180 , which would bring the total to 9 exoplanets in that system .
