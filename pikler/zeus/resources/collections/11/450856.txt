Cove     a cove is a small type of bay or coastal inlet . coves usually have narrow , restricted entrances . they are often circular or oval , and are often found in a larger bay . small , narrow , sheltered bays , inlets , creeks , or recesses in a coast are often considered coves . the term can also be used to describe a valley between two mountain ridges . coves are formed by differential erosion . differential erosion occurs when softer rocks are worn away faster than the harder rocks around them . these rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance called a cove .
