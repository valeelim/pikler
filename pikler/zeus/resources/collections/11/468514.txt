Cheese mite     cheese mites are mites which live in food , grain and plant leaves . they are sometimes found in flour but prefer cheese . refrigerated cheese is not usually affected as they prefer warm , damp foods . cheese mites are used to make certain cheeses . milbenkäse and mimolette are two examples . the action of the mites on the surface of these cheeses adds to the flavor . it also gives them a distinctive appearance . a 2010 sem study found that milbenkäse cheese was produced using `` tyrolichus casei '' mites , while mimolette cheese used `` acarus siro '' mites ( also known as flour mites ) .
