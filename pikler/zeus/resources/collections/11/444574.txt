Susumu Ohno     susumu ohno was born of japanese parents in seoul , korea , on february 1 , 1928. the family returned to japan after the war in 1945. his passion for science came from his lifelong love of horses . he earned a ph.d. in veterinary science at tokyo university of agriculture and technology in 1949 , and later a ph.d. and d.sc . from hokkaido university . ohno suggested that gene duplication plays a major role in evolution in his classic book `` evolution by gene duplication '' ( 1970 ) . subsequent research has overwhelmingly confirmed the key role of gene duplication in molecular evolution . sometimes . one gene copy , or `` paralog '' , takes on a totally new function after a gene duplication event . this means one of the gene copies mutates to develop a function that was not present in the ancestral gene . in this way , a gene duplication may lead to new possibilities in its descendents . normally , a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed , but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function . therefore , a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness .
