Multiple exposure     in photography , a multiple exposure is when a single frame of film is taken more than once . this usually happens accidentally if the photographer forgets to advance the film . to prevent multiple exposures , most modern cameras will not let the photographer open the shutter again until the film is advanced . it can also be used on purpose for special effects , such as creating a fake photograph of a ghost . the resulting image will be a combination of all of the shots . multiple exposures are not possible on digital cameras , but the effect can be simulated with the alpha channel feature of photo editing software such as photoshop or gimp .
