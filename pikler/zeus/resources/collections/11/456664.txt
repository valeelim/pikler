Pelagornis     pelagornis is a genus of huge fossil birds . one species , `` p. sandersi '' , is one of the largest bird ever found . its wingspan was twice that of the largest albatross . its wingspan is estimated as about 6.4 to 7.4 metres . the fossil of this particular species is from the oligocene stage , about 25 million years ago ( mya ) . pelagornithids are an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth-like beak projections , large size , and highly modified wing bones . there are many questions about their ecology . the bird was capable of highly efficient gliding . that suggests it had a long-range marine soaring life-style similar to that of living albatrosses . several later species have been found , and they are not quite so large . the whole group died out about three million years ago .
