Star system     a star system or stellar system is a small number of stars which orbit each other , bound by gravitational attraction . a large number of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a `` star cluster '' but , broadly speaking , they are also star systems . star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems , which include planets and similar bodies . a stellar system of two stars is known as a `` binary star '' , `` binary star system '' or `` physical double star '' . if there are no tidal effects , no disturbance from other forces , and no transfer of mass from one star to the other , such a system is stable . both stars will orbit around the center of mass of the system indefinitely . examples of binary systems are sirius , procyon and cygnus x-1 , the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole . it is possible to have star systems with more than two members . their stars are gravitationally bound to each other , and may or may not be close to each other . a recently discovered quintuple star system ( five stars ) is known as 1swasp j093010.78+533859.5 . the system has two sets of binary stars , one of them with a small third star . the two sets are a long way apart , further than the orbit of pluto is to the sun . the binary stars are close to each other and one binary has touching stars , with their outer ionised gases mixing . that situation is called a contact binary . from the data collected , the authors are fairly sure that both binaries ( and probably all five stars ) are gravitationally bound in a single system . the angles of inclination ( the angle between the two orbital planes ) of the two binaries ( 88.2 ( 3 ) and 86 ( 4 ) degrees ) . this suggests they originally formed by break-up ( ~9-10 billion years ago ago ) from a single protostellar disk . afterwards , they stayed in the same orbital plane .
