Climax community     in ecology , climax community is a term for a stable biological community of plants , animals and fungi . after a process of ecological succession the vegetation in an area reaches a steady state . its stability is not guaranteed : invasive species and climate change can cause changes . however , relatively , the system is stable . this equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area . the term is sometimes also applied in soil development . the idea of a single climatic climax , which is defined in relation to regional climate , originated with frederic clements in the early 1900s . the first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by henry cowles in 1899 , but it was clements who used the term `` climax '' to describe the idealized endpoint of succession .
