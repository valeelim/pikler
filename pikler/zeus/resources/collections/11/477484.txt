White's illusion    white 's illusion white 's illusion is a brightness illusion . here , some stripes of a black and white grating are replaced by gray rectangles ( see fig ) . all gray bars usually have same color and opacity . the brightness of the gray pieces appear to shift toward the brightness of the top and bottom bordering stripes , that is , the gray bars with horizontal black regions on their top and bottom appear darker and those with white regions on their top and bottom appear lighter . but this does not match with what lateral inhibition predicts . this illusion is mostly described for grayscale . a similar illusion occurs for colored patches . this is known as munker-white 's illusion or munker 's illusion . the amount of each bipolar cell response depends on the amount of the stimulation it receives from the receptor . neighboring cells decrease this response . this is called lateral inhibition . lateral inhibition can not explain white 's illusion . in figure 2.1 lateral inhibition sent by black cells a and c should make cell o lighter ; in figure 2.2 lateral inhibition sent by white cells a and c should make cell o darker .
