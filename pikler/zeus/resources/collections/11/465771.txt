Trace fossil     trace fossils ( or ichnofossils ) are geological records of biological activity . they are fossils , but not of the living things themselves . probably the best-known examples are dinosaur trackways . trace fossils may be impressions made on the substrate by an organism . burrows , borings , footprints , feeding marks , and root cavities are examples . the term includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism for example coprolites ( fossilized droppings ) or chemical markers . stromatolites are sediment structures produced by bacteria . trace fossils contrast with body fossils , which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms ' bodies , usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization . structures which are not produced by the behaviour of an organism are not considered trace fossils . the study of traces is called ichnology . traces reflect the behaviour , not usually not the biological affinity of their makers . they are given their own names in taxonomy , based on their appearance and the implied behaviour of their makers .
