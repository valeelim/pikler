Argument from ignorance     an argument from ignorance ( ) , or appeal to ignorance ( 'ignorance ' stands for `` lack of evidence to the contrary '' ) , is a fallacy in informal logic . it says something is true because it has not yet been proved false . or , that something is false if it has not yet been proved true . this is also called a negative proof fallacy . this also includes the ( false ) assumption there are only two options ( true or false ) . there may be as many as four choices : 1. true 1. false 1. unknown 1. unknowable . appeals to ignorance are often used to suggest the other side needs to do the proving . rules of logic place the burden ( responsibility ) of proving something on `` the person making the claim '' . a logical fallacy is simply a bad argument . using bad logic does not necessarily mean the argument is false ( or true ) . it is basically a hasty conclusion , one that is arrived at incorrectly . but it still may be convincing to some audiences . this is why it is used in politics and advertising .
