Cephalaspis     cephalaspis `` ( head shield ) '' was a genus of armoured fish in the early devonian about 400 million years ago ( mya ) . it was one of the jawless fishes , or ostracoderms , which were common at the time . they were discovered in the first half of the 19th century in the old red sandstone of britain . `` cepalaspis '' was described and pictured in a popular work on the rocks and fossils of the old red sandstone . it was a medium-sized fish that lived in freshwater streams and estuaries of the early devonian . some of the fossils are well-preserved , and so we know quite a bit about its anatomy . its armour was on the dorsal side , and its mouth on the ventral side . therefore , it is likely that it was a bottom-feeder , nosing about in the mud of a river . it had a typical vertebrate type of brain , with front , middle and rear regions , and nerves to and from sense organs and muscles in the head region . its pineal opening between its eyes was probably a light-sensitive organ . on its skull are three areas which obviously had a special function . many modern fish which live in muddy rivers use both pressure-sensitive lateral lines , and also electrical fields to sense movement . `` cephalaspis '' had no lateral lines , but the three fields on its skull were no doubt sensory , for sensing pressure change or electrical fields .
