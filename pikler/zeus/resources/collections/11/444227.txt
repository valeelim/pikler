Motor system     the motor system is the part of the central nervous system that is involved with movement . it consists of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal system . - the pyramidal motor system , ( or pyramidal tract or corticospinal tract ) starts in the motor center of the cerebral cortex and goes through the midbrain and medulla oblongata , then down the spinal cord . peripheral motor nerves carry the motor impulses to the voluntary muscles . - the extrapyramidal motor system consists of motor-modulation systems , particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum . this tweaks the messages so that fine , accurate movement is possible . that function is called `` modulation of movement '' . both systems are very ancient and may be common to all vertebrates .
