Unikont     unikonts are one of the five superkingdoms in the classification of eukaryotes . they are part of the taxonomy system of thomas cavalier-smith . the group is claimed to be a clade . it includes eukaryotic cells that : - have a single flagellum , or - are amoebae with no flagella . the unikonts include opisthokonts ( animals , fungi , and related forms ) and amoebozoa . by contrast other well-known eukaryotic groups are often referred to as bikonts . bikonts include archaeplastida ( plants and relatives ) , excavata , rhizaria , and chromalveolata . these groups may have two flagella ( although there are many exceptions ) . the unikonts have a triple-gene fusion that is lacking in the bikonts . the three genes code for enzymes which make pyrimidine nucleotides . this must have involved a double gene fusion , a rare pair of events , which supports the shared ancestry of opisthokonta and amoebozoa .
