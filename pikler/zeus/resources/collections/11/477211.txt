Escape reflex     many animals have one or more special escape reflexes . these get the animal out of trouble quickly . they use special nervous structures to do this . examples : - crayfish : the sensory hairs of the tail fan of crayfish are connected to a reflex arc . giant sensory and motor nerves are connected with electrical synapses . this flicks the tail , and shoots the crayfish away from the stimulus . the neurons bypass the main neural system that controls locomotion , so shortening the reaction time . the lateral giant connection to motor giant fast flexor neurons was the first known example of an electrical synapse . - squid : the squid giant axon is the very large ( up to 1 mm in diameter ; typically around 0.5 mm ) axon that controls part of the water jet propulsion system in squid . it was first described by l.w . williams in 1909 , but this discovery was forgotten until english zoologist j.z . young demonstrated the axon â€™ s function in the 1930s . squids use this system for making brief but very fast movements through the water .
