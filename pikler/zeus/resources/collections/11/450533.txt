Margay     the margay ( `` leopardus wiedii '' ) is a spotted cat native to the americas . it is a solitary and nocturnal animal which prefers remote parts of the rainforest . the margay is mostly nocturnal . it eats small mammals ( sometimes including monkeys ) , birds , eggs , lizards and tree frogs . the margay is able to hunt its prey entirely in trees . however , they do sometimes hunt on the ground , and have been reported to eat cane rats and guinea pigs . there is a report of a margay using sound mimicry to lure a prey . a margay was seen to imitate the call of an infant pied tamarin while in the presence of a group of adult tamarins . this caused the adults to investigate . although the margay was not successful in catching a monkey , this was the first observation of a neotropical predator using this type of mimicry . margays are mainly nocturnal , but they do sometimes hunt during the day . they prefer to spend most of their life in the trees , but also travel across the ground , especially when moving between hunting areas . during the day , they rest in safe branches or clumps of lianas .
