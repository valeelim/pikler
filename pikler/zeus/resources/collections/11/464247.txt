Château de Meudon     the château de meudon was a former royal residence in france . it is most commonly associated with the `` grand dauphin '' the only son of louis xiv who made it his personal residence . however , on the death of the dauphin the property reverted to the crown and was used by the famous duchess of berry ( a granddaughter of louis xiv ) and was later ignored under louis xv and louis xvi , but became the official residence of the king of rome from 1812 , and was occupied by jérôme bonaparte under the first empire . the main building was largely destroyed in a fire in 1871 , and it is now the site of the observatoire de paris-meudon . there was originally a small manor on the site which was given to the duchess of étampes , a mistress of francis i of france . the family remodelled the building in around 1540 when the property was given to the `` cardinal de lorraine '' . at the cardinal 's death in 1574 , meudon reverted to the house of guise until 1654. in 1679 , the château was sold by servien 's heir to louvois , the minister of louis xiv , who continued to improve it inside and out , until his death in 1691. above all , he commissioned andré le nôtre to construct grand gardens and fountains fed by elaborate hydraulic works . in june 1695 , louis xiv purchased meudon from the widow of louvois , with the intention of installing his only legitimate child le grand dauphin in the premises . a brilliant period followed . the dauphin employed `` jules hardouin-mansart '' . following the death of the dauphin the property was briefly used by his son louis , duke of burgundy , dauphin of france . it was then later given to the duchess of berry in 1718 .
