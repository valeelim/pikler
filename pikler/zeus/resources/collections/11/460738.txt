Black box     a black box , in science and engineering , is a box whose inside working is not known . it is a device , system or object with input and output . there is no knowledge of its internal workings . the way it works is `` opaque '' ( black ) . almost anything might be referred to as a black box : a transistor , an algorithm , or the human brain . ashby expains that the term arose when a decision had to be made about opening an engineering box . the question was whether to return the box for repair , or just scrap it . could this be decided without opening the box ? there can be many reasons why a complex system can not be repaired in the field , and even opening up some systems is a big deal . the question also comes up in surgery on brain damage patients . the more that can be discovered before operating , the better . the opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic can be seen . it is sometimes known as a clear box , a glass box , or a white box .
