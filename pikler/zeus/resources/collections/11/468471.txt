Xenolith     a xenolith ( ) is a rock fragment which another rock surrounds . it happens most in igneous rock when magma is fluid enough to flow round more solid rock . xenoliths may be covered in the margins of a magma chamber , torn loose from the walls of a flow of lava or picked up along the ground by flowing lava on earth 's surface . a xenocryst is an individual foreign crystal included within an igneous body . examples of xenocrysts are quartz crystals in a low-silica lava and diamonds in kimberlite diatremes . although the term xenolith is most commonly associated with igneous inclusions , a broad definition could include rock fragments which have become encased in sedimentary rock . xenoliths are sometimes found in meteorites . xenoliths and xenocrysts provide important information about the composition of the otherwise inaccessible mantle . basalts , kimberlites , lamproites and lamprophyres , which have their source in the upper mantle , often contain fragments and crystals assumed to be a part of the lower mantle mineralogy .
