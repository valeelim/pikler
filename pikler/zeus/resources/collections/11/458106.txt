Evolution of colour vision     the evolution of colour vision causes light to be seen according to its wavelength . this has obvious advantages , especially it helps animals find food . the colour vision of many herbivores allows them to see fruit or ( immature ) leaves which are good to eat . in hummingbirds , particular flowers are often recognized by colour . predators also use colour vision to help them find their prey . all this applies mainly to animals in the daytime . on the other hand , nocturnal mammals have much less-developed colour vision . for them , space on the retina is better used with more rods since rods collect light better . colour differences are much less visible in the dark . apart from vertebrates , the only land animals to have colour vision are arthropods . aquatic arthropods such as crustacea also have colour vision . as with vertebrates , the details differ , but the molecules which do the work the opsins â€“ are very similar . four photopigment opsins exist in teleost fish , reptiles and birds . this suggests that the common ancestor of tetrapods and amniotes ( ~360 million years ago ) had :
