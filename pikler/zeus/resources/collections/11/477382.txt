Amoeboid movement     amoeboid movement is the most common type of movement in eukaryotic cells . it is a crawling type of movement got by pushing out cell cytoplasm in the form of pseudopodia ( `` false feet '' ) . the cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to move the cell forward . this type of movement is observed in amoebae , slime molds and some other protozoans such as `` naegleria gruberi '' , as well as some cells in humans such as white blood cells . sarcomas , or cancers arising from connective tissue cells , are particularly good at amoeboid movement , thus leading to their high rate of metastasis . the exact mechanism is still unknown . it involves actin-myosin molecules inside the cytoplasm .
