Cytochrome     cytochromes are haemoproteins ( or proteins containing haem groups ) . they make atp by electron transport . they are found either as single ( monomeric ) proteins ( e.g. , cytochrome c ) or as part of bigger enzyme complexes which catalyze redox reactions . the haem group does the redox reactions . these include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed . in general , redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons . cytochromes were described in 1884 as respiratory pigments . they include ( haemoglobin , myoglobin , haemocyanin , haemoerythrin and chlorocruorin . in the 1920s , keilin rediscovered these respiratory pigments . he called them the cytochromes , or “ cellular pigments ” , and classified them as haem proteins . several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by spectroscopy . three types of cytochrome are distinguished by their prosthetic groups . in mitochondria and chloroplasts , these cytochromes are often combined in electron transport and related metabolic pathways .
