Climbing plant     climbing plants are plants which climb up trees and other tall objects . many of them are vines whose stems twine round trees and branches . there are quite a number of other methods of climbing . the climbing habit has evolved many times . in most cases the climbing plants were more diverse ( had more species ) than their nonâ€“climbing sister groups . it is a key innovation which has been very successful . over 130 plant families include climbers . vine species may represent more than 40 % of species diversity in tropical forests . it has evolved independently in several plant families , using many different climbing methods : botanists generally divide climbing plants into two broad groups : - bines , which twine their stems around a support . many bines have rough stems or downward-pointing bristles to aid their grip . - hops ( used in flavoring beer ) are a commercially important bine . - morning glory , `` ipomoea '' species . - honeysuckle - vines which use tendrils , suckers and other methods .
