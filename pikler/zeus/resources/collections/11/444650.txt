Mycoplasma genitalium     mycoplasma genitalium is a small parasitic bacterium which lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the primate genital and respiratory tracts . it has one of the smallest known genomes , and is one of the smallest bacteria . other very small bacteria are the endosymbiont `` candidatus '' carsonella ruddii , and the recently discovered bacterium `` nanoarchaeum '' . the smallest known free living bacterium is `` pelagibacter ubique '' with 1.3 mb . `` mycoplasma genitalium '' was originally isolated in 1980 from the urethras of two male humans with non-gonococcal urethritis . infection by `` m. genitalium '' is fairly common , and is transmitted between partners during unprotected sexual intercourse . it can be treated with antibiotics . much remains to be discovered about its role in sexual disease . `` m. genitalium '' has 525 genes . there are 482 protein-encoding genes in a circular chromosome of 582,970 base pairs . an initial study of the `` m. genitalium '' genome with shotgun sequencing was done by peterson in 1993. it was then sequenced by fraser and others . it was found to contain only 470 predicted coding regions , including genes required for dna replication , transcription and translation , dna repair , cellular transport , and energy metabolism . it was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced , after `` haemophilus influenzae '' .
