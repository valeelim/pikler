Copper wire and cable     a copper wire is a single electrical conductor made of copper . it can be insulated or uninsulated . a copper cable is a group of two or more copper wires bundled together in a single sheath or jacket . copper wire and cable is used in power generation , power transmission , power distribution , telecommunications , electronics circuitry , and countless types of electrical equipment . it has been useful ever since telegraphs and electromagnets were invented . copper is the most widely used conductor in many kinds of electrical wiring . copper has the lowest resistance to the flow of electricity of all non-precious metals . electrical wiring in buildings is the most important market for the copper industry . about half of all copper mined is used to make electrical wire and cable conductors . properties of copper useful for the copper wire . - electrical conductivity - tensile strength - ductility - strength and ductility combination - creep resistance - the copper does not change a lot because of heat .
