Accipitriformes     accipitriformes is an order which includes most of the diurnal birds of prey : hawks , eagles , vultures , and many others , about 225 species in all . for a long time , the majority view was to include them with the falcons in the falconiformes . however , a recent dna study has shown that falcons are not closely related to the accipitriformes . instead , they are related to parrots and passerines . since then putting the falcons next to the parrots in taxonomic order has been adopted by most ornithologists . the dna-based proposal includes the new world vultures in the accipitriformes , but the american ornithologists ' union ( aou ) classifies the new world vultures as a separate order , the cathartiformes .
