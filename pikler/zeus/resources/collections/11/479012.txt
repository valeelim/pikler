Pistol star     the pistol star is a blue hypergiant . it is one of the most luminous stars in the milky way galaxy . it is one of many massive young stars in the quintuplet cluster in the central region of our galaxy . it is about 25,000 light years from earth in the direction of sagittarius . it would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star , if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light . the pistol star was discovered by the hubble space telescope in the early 1990s . the star may have ejected almost 10 solar masses of material in giant outbursts perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 years ago . its stellar wind is over 10 billion times stronger than the sun 's . the star 's exact age and future are not known , but it is expected to end in a brilliant supernova or hypernova in 1 to 3 million years . its mass is equally uncertain , probably around 200 times the sun when first formed . now it is much less because it has lost so much mass . early reports suggested that it might be the most luminous star known , being almost 100 million times as luminous as the sun .
