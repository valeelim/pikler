Dry plate     dry plate , also known as gelatin process , is an improved type of photographic plate . it was invented by dr. richard l. maddox in 1871. by 1879 the first dry plate factory had been established . with much of the complex chemical work done at the factory , the new process simplified the work of photographers . the first practical way to take photographs was called the daguerreotype . it was introduced in 1839. it used sheets of copper coated with silver . the plate was then was exposed to chemical fumes , then taken to the camera . introduced in the 1850s the collodion process was introduced . it used what were called wet plates . but a wet plate had to be prepared and used within minutes . it also had a very slow photographic speed . the preparation of wet plates required numerous chemicals . these had to be mixed in the dark in a portable tent if the photographer was planning on photographing away from the studio . in the 1880s the gelatin dry plate replaced the wet plates . the dry plate allowed much faster exposure times . now a moving subject could be captured on film . the dry plates could be manufactured in a factory and used whenever the photographer wanted .
