Scrubber     scrubber systems are used to make coal a `` cleaner '' fuel . scrubbers remove sulfur from a power plant 's exhaust . scrubbers are of two types , wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers . wet scrubbers use liquid chemicals to remove pollutants . dry scrubbers typically use fabric filters . in many cases both are used together . as polluted air passes through a wet scrubber , chemicals in the scrubber react with the air pollution causing it to precipitate out . modern scrubbers can remove up to 98 % of the sulfur and 99 % of the precipitate matter from within the smokestacks . the sulfur and metals that are removed from the scrubbers can be sold as a marketable products . sludge from lime scrubbers can be sold to wallboard manufacturers , and fly ash from chimney flues can be sold to make lightweight concrete that can substitute for wood . the use of coal in the united states about doubled during the last quarter ( 25 years ) of the 20th century . however , sulfur in the air was reduced by 30 % during that same period . this shows that scrubbers work .
