Assassin bug     assassin bugs are the reduviidae . they are a large cosmopolitan family of `` true bugs '' or hemiptera . they are almost all terrestrial ambush predators . most members of the family are easy to recognise : they have a relatively narrow neck , sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis . large specimens should be handled with care , if at all , because they may defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis .
