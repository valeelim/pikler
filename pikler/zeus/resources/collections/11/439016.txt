Voltage regulation     in electrical engineering , voltage regulation is a measure of the difference in voltage between the sending and receiving ends of a transmission system or distribution system . on one end of these systems is the source , where the power is received , and on the other end is the load , where the power is sent to . voltage regulation involves measuring the difference in the voltage at each end . electric utility companies use some electrical equipment to maintain the voltage constant magnitude value transmitted or distributed along the power line , such as tap changer , voltage regulator , capacitor etc .
