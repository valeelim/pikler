Historical linguistics     historical linguistics is the study of language change . it has five main concerns : 1. to study changes in particular languages 1. to discover the pre-history of languages , and group them into language families ( comparative linguistics ) 1. to develop theories about how and why language changes 1. to describe the history of speech communities 1. to study the history of words , i.e . etymology . modern historical linguistics dates from the late 18th century . it grew out of the earlier discipline of philology , the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity . at first , historical linguistics was comparative linguistics . the focus was on the well-known indo-european languages , many of which had long written histories . scholars also studied the uralic languages , another european language family for which less early written material exists . since then , there has been linguistic work outside of european languages , such as on the austronesian languages and various families of native american languages .
