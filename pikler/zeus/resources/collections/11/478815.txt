Restriction enzyme     a restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts dna at particular places . it works at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as `` restriction sites '' . to cut dna , all restriction enzymes make two incisions , once through each strand of the dna double helix . these enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and defend them against invading viruses , which are bacteriophages . inside a prokaryote , the restriction enzymes selectively cut up `` foreign '' dna in a process called `` restriction '' . the host dna is protected by another enzyme which protects the host dna and blocks cleavage . together , these two processes are the restriction modification system . it is the earliest and simplest immune system . they are also a kind of selfish , mobile genetic element . over 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail , and more than 600 of these are available commercially . these enzymes are routinely used for dna modification in laboratories , and are a vital tool in molecular cloning .
