Decimal Day     decimal day is the name that was given to 15 february 1971 in the united kingdom ( uk ) . it was the day that the uk decimalised ( converted to a decimal-based system of currency ) . before that date the uk used the `` pound ( £ ) - shilling ( s ) - pence ( d ) '' currency system . the old system was known as the `` £sd '' system , after the abbreviations of the unit names . £sd is pronounced l-s-d. in the £sd system £1 = 20s and 1s = 12d , so £1 = 240d . in the new decimal system there are no shillings and there are 100 ( new ) pence ( abbreviated as `` p '' ) in a pound - so £1 = 100p .
