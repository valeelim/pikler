Trypanosoma     trypanosoma is a genus of parasitic protozoa . there are in the class kinetoplastida . they are a monophyletic group of unicellular parasitic flagellate protozoa . all trypanosomes are need more than one particular host to complete life cycle . most are transmitted by a vector , usually by blood-feeding invertebrates . there are different mechanisms among the various species . in an invertebrate host they are generally found in the intestine , but in their mammalian host they usually live in the bloodstream or inside cells . trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases , including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness , caused by `` trypanosoma brucei '' , and chagas disease , caused by `` trypanosoma cruzi '' . the mitochondrial genome of the `` trypanosoma '' , and other kinetoplastids , is made of a highly complex series of circles and minicircles . it needs many proteins for organisation during cell division .
