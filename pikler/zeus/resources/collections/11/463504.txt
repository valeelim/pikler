Bladderwort     bladderworts are utricularia , a genus of carnivorous plants . there are about 230 species . they occur in fresh water and wet soil as terrestrial or aquatic species . they live in every continent except antarctica . bladderworts are cultivated for their flowers , which are rather like those of snapdragons and orchids . all `` utricularia '' are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps . terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil . the traps range in size from 0.2 mm to 1.2 cm . aquatic species , such as `` u. vulgaris '' ( common bladderwort ) , have bladders that are usually larger and can feed on water fleas `` ( daphnia ) '' , nematodes , even tiny fish , mosquito larvae and young tadpoles . despite their small size , the traps are extremely sophisticated . in aquatic species , prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor . the bladder , when `` set '' , is under negative pressure : when the trapdoor is triggered , the prey , with the water around it , is sucked into the bladder . once the bladder is full of water , the door closes again . the whole process takes only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second .
