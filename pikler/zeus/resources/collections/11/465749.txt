Khaksar Movement     the khaksar movement was a fanatical political and social movement of british india . it was probably started in 1931 by the schizoid genius and leader inayatullah mashriqi . there are different opinions about the khaksar movement and its followers ( called 'khaksars ' ) . some conservative sunni muslims in india and pakistan believe it was a movement to help reform islam and guide muslims to a better life . but many other people believe it was a terrorist or fascist organisation which wanted to destabilise british india and create anarchy . it wanted to then come to power and set up a strict islamic state , in part of india . the khaksars ( meaning 'humble persons ' ) used to wear `` khaki '' colored ( light brown ) uniforms and carry sharp blades and spades all the time . they were very well organised and ready to attack other people violently , on the orders of their leaders . that is why sometime they are also called 'followers of militarism ' . in many ways , they resembled the german nazis and the italian fascists led by mussolini . they were against britain and its allies in world war ii and wanted that the axis powers should win . they also opposed the making of a separate muslim country , pakistan . they even tried to kill the founder of that country , quaid e azam muhammad ali jinnah .
