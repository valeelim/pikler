Bottom trawling     bottom trawling is trawling ( towing a trawl , which is a fishing net ) along the sea floor . it is also called `` dragging '' . bottom trawling can be either benthic trawling or demersal trawling . benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean . demersal trawling is towing a net just above the bottom . another kind of trawling is midwater trawling ( also known as pelagic trawling ) . this is where a net is towed higher in the water column . midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies , tuna , and mackerel . bottom trawling catches both bottom-living fish . it also catches semi-pelagic species such as cod , squid , shrimp , and rockfish . trawling is done by a trawler . this can be a small open boat or a large factory trawler . the trawl doors disturb the sea bed . they create a cloud of muddy water which hides the oncoming trawl net . it also makes a noise which attracts fish . the fish begin to swim in front of the net mouth . as the trawl continues along the seabed , fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net . finally , the fish become exhausted and drop back , into the net and are caught . the speed that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species which is being targeted . it also depends on the gear that is being used . for most species , a speed of around 4 knots ( 7 km/h ) is appropriate . trawling is very easy way of catching large amounts of fish . but it has been compared to `` fishing with bulldozers '' . like a bulldozer it scrapes up everything on the bottom .
