Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall     the hercules–corona borealis great wall is the largest known super-structure in the universe . it is a huge group of galaxies forming a giant sheet-like pattern . it is about 10 billion light-years long , 7.2 billion light-years wide , and almost 1 billion light-years thick . it is about 10 billion light-years away in the constellations of hercules and corona borealis , hence its name . it was discovered in november 2013 by mapping gamma-ray bursts . they are very luminous explosions of distant , massive stars , the most powerful explosions in the universe . a typical burst releases more energy in less than a tenth of a second than the sun will in its whole life of 10 billion years . gamma-ray bursts are very rare : only one happens in a typical galaxy every few million years . the stars which cause these explosions are very massive , so the material required for them to be formed must be in great amounts . so , these explosions can be used to track down if there is a galaxy in that direction , or there is a large group of matter in there .
