Tenerife airport disaster     the tenerife airport disaster happened on march 27 , 1977 , when two boeing 747s collided on the ground of los rodeos airport ( now tenerife north airport ) . this crash killed 583 people onboard the two flights . the crash was caused by many reasons . one reason is that as the klm captain wanted to takeoff quickly so that he could return to amsterdam . this made him misunderstand that he was cleared by air traffic controller to takeoff and so he began to take off , eventually crashing into the pan am flight . at that time , the tenerife north airport did not have ground radar , so the controllers could not know that the klm flight was taking off . another reason was the fog surrounding the airport . the bad weather reduced the visibility , meaning the pilots could not see each other and neither could the controllers see the two planes on the runway . because of the fog , the pilots only saw each other at the last minute , when they could not have prevented the crash . if there was no fog , the klm crew would have seen the pan am plane on the runway and would not have taken off .
