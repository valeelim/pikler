Thermostat     a thermostat is a sensor which keeps a heating system near to a desired temperature or setpoint . it is a control system . the thermostat works by switching heating or cooling devices on or off . this is what happens in a central heating system or an air conditioner . in some systems it works by switching a 'heat transfer fluid ' off or on as needed to keep the set temperature . the name is derived from the greek words `` thermos '' `` hot '' and `` statos '' `` a standing '' . the simplest kind of thermostat is a bimetal strip which bends as the temperature rises , and at a set point breaks the circuit of an electrical current . kitchen toasters use this kind of thermostat . because they control a system , thermostats are examples of feedback devices which maintain a steady local environment against temperature changes outside the outside world . in cybernetics , the thermostat is an example of a machine which uses feedback to maintain the stability of a heating system .
