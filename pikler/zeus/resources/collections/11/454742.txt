Supercluster     superclusters are large collections of smaller galaxy groups and galaxy clusters . they are one of the largest known structures in the cosmos . superclusters show that the galaxies in the universe are not evenly distributed . most , perhaps all , are in groups and clusters . groups have some dozens of galaxies , and clusters up to several thousand galaxies . those groups and clusters plus more isolated galaxies form even larger collections called superclusters . superclusters themselves form even larger structures , called `` filaments '' , `` complexes '' , `` walls '' or `` sheets '' , like the great wall . these may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years , and cover more than 5 % of the observable universe . superclusters suggest something about the initial condition of the universe when these superclusters were formed . the directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also tell us about the formation of galaxies early in the history of the universe .
