Cyprus cat     the cyprus cat is a breed of cat . these cats are thought to have first come from ancient egypt or palestine . they were brought to the island of cyprus by st. helen . these are now common domestic cats that live in homes or outside . many of these cats still live all over cyprus . but , a large number are now feral . this means they are not tame and they run wild . a researcher , j.-d. vigne and his group , might have discovered the oldest domestic cat , in cyprus . in 2004 , archaeologists working at a neolithic site in southern cyprus dug up carefully buried bones of a cat . it had been placed next to human bones and artifacts . `` examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out , and the body of the cat was placed in it , then rapidly covered . '' the cat skeleton is about 4,000 years older than any known egyptian drawings or writings . cyprus cats were probably living in a byzantine monastery in the fourth century . in legends , it is said that st. helen brought hundreds of cats to get rid of poisonous snakes that were taking over the monastery . the monastery had two bells . one rang to call the cats for their food . the second one rang to send the cats out to the meadows to hunt snakes . now , the monastery has very few cats that live there .
