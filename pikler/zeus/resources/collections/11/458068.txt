Rusty Cage     `` rusty cage '' is the third single off american rock band soundgarden 's third studio album `` badmotorfinger '' . the song was released in 1992. lead singer chris cornell wrote the lyrics of the song . lead guitarist kim thayil said of the song : the tuning on that song was pretty nutty . it 's recorded with a wah wah in the low position used as a filter . that was the first time we did anything like that . it was chris 's idea ; he wanted to get that weird tone that you ca n't really dial in on an amp . but if you use the wah wah as a filter , it gets an incredibly weird sound . and if you listen to that riff , especially if you 've heard the original demos of it , it almost sounds backward . a popular cover version of the song was done by johnny cash , who included it on his 1996 album , `` unchained '' . the album won a grammy award for best country album and cash 's version of rusty cage earned him a nomination for best male country vocal performance in 1998. other websites . - `` rusty cage '' on youtube
