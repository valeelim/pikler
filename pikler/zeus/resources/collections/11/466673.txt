Bloom filter     a bloom filter is a data structure that allows computers to see if a given element occurs in a set . bloom filters use hash functions to do this . for each element that is added , a hash value is calculated . when a new element is added , its hash value is compared to that of the other elements in the set . a bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure . it is possible to get a false positive , but not to get a false negative . in other words , a query returns either `` possibly in set '' or `` definitely not in set '' . elements can be added to the set , but not removed . for each added element , the probability of getting a false positive grows . edward bloom proposed the bloom filter in 1970. in the article , bloom supposes there is an algorithm to hyphenate words at the end of a line . according to the example , most words have simple hyphenation patterns . but about 10 % of the words require time-consuming lookups to fetch the correct rule . his case was that of hyphenating about 500,000 words . he saw that using the `` normal '' error-free hashing techniques , storing the hyphenation patterns , would require a lot of memory . he found that using his technique , he could eliminate most lookups . for example , a hash area only 15 % of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 85 % of the disk accesses .
