CompactFlash     compactflash is a name of a standard used for a mass storage device , which is mostly used in digital cameras . today , most compactflah devices use flash memory . since most compactflash cards have no movable parts , they are also used in embedded systems . compact flash cards are 36.4mm by 42.8mm in size , and either 3.3mm or 5mm thick . the 3.3mm type is known as type i , the 5mm type is known as type ii . most type ii devices are small hard disks . the transfer speed is often given as an x rating , where the base is 150kb/s for 1x speed , which was also the base speed for reading compact discs . in many cases , reading is faster than writing , often by a factor of two to three . that way , a speed of `` 133x '' is roughly that of 20mb/sec . when the speed is given as a rate , usually in mb/s , this speed is the maximum speed that can be obtained reading from the device . there are comactflash devices of different capacities .
