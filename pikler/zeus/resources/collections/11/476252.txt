Deuteromycota     the deuteromycota is a type of fungi . they are also called imperfect fungi . it is `` not '' a taxonomic category : they are linked only by their asexuality . the taxonomy of fungi is either based on morphological characteristics ( what they look like ) , or that of biological species . fungi imperfecti do not fit well into these schemes . deueromycota literally means `` second fungi '' , and was once a phylum within the fungi . the fungi in deuteromycota reproduce asexually , or vegetatively : `` sexual reproduction has never been observed in these species '' . the term is now used only informally for species of fungi that are asexually reproducing members of the fungal phyla ascomycota and basidiomycota . there are about 25,000 species that have been classified in the deuteromycota and many are basidiomycota or ascomycota . fungi producing the antibiotic penicillin and those that cause athlete 's foot and yeast infections are imperfect fungi . in addition , there are a number of edible imperfect fungi , including the ones that provide the distinctive characteristics of roquefort and camembert cheese . some fungi which are used to develop immunosuppressant drugs , are imperfect fungi . other imperfect fungi are used for insect pest control .
