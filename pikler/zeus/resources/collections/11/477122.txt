Kestrel     the name kestrel is given to several different members of the falcon genus , `` falco '' . kestrels hover about over open country , and swoop down on prey , usually small mammals , lizards or large insects . other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the wing . in addition , kestrels have much brown in their plumage . kestrels can fly in stationary air , even indoors in barns . while hovering they face towards any slight headwind . this leads to the common kestrel being called a `` windhover '' in some areas . unusually for falcons , plumage often differs between male and female , although as usual with monogamous raptors the female is slightly larger than the male . this allows a pair to eat slightly different prey on their home range . kestrels are bold , and have adapted well to humans . they nest in buildings and hunt by main roads . kestrels do not build their own nests , but use nests built by other birds . most kestrels form a distinct clade among the falcons , as suggested by comparison of mtdna cytochrome `` b '' sequence data and morphology . this clade diverged from other `` falco '' around the miocene to pliocene about 7â€“3.5 million years ago ( mya ) . the most basal `` true '' kestrels are three species from africa and its surroundings .
