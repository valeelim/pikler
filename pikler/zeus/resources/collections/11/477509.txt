Sterling silver     sterling silver is an alloy of silver containing 92.5 % by mass of silver and 7.5 % by mass of other metals , usually copper . the sterling silver standard has a minimum of 925 in continental european terms . pure silver , for example 99.9 % pure , is generally too soft for making objects for use . therefore , the silver is usually alloyed with copper to give it strength while keeping the ductility and beauty of the precious metal . other metals can replace the copper , to improve various properties of the basic sterling alloy such as increasing resistance to tarnish . these replacement metals include germanium , zinc and platinum , as well as a variety of other additives , including silicon and boron . alloys such as argentium silver have appeared in recent decades . argentium silver has some germanium added , and resists tarnishing well . the first legal definition of sterling silver appeared in 1275. a statute of edward i specified that 12 ounces of silver for coinage should contain 11 ounces pennyweights of silver and pennyweights of alloy , with 20 pennyweights to the troy ounce .
