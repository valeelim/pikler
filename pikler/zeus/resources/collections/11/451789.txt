Polecat     polecat is the common name for several medium-sized mustelids . they do not form a single clade : the name is given to several similar species . the european polecat is typical , and is the only one native to the british isles . ferrets are the domesticated form of european polecats . in the u.s. , the term `` polecat '' is often applied to skunks , which are only distantly related to the european polecat . the reason is that polecats give off a scent which some people think is offensive . the simplest version puts them all in a subfamily of the mustelidae : subfamily mustelinae - genus `` ictonyx '' - striped polecat , `` i. striatus '' - saharan striped polecat , `` i. libycus '' - genus `` mustela '' - steppe polecat , `` m. eversmannii '' - american polecat ( black-footed ferret ) `` m. nigripes '' - european polecat , `` m. putorius '' - genus `` vormela '' - marbled polecat , `` v. peregusna '' there is a more recent version which splits them up even more .
