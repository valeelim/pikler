Key Management Service     kms ( key management service ) is one of the methods to activate microsoft windows and microsoft office . activation ensures that the software is obtained from and licensed by microsoft . kms is used by volume license customers , usually medium to large businesses , schools , and non-profits . individual computers do not need to contact microsoft , although the kms server does . kms clients must be activated at least once every 180 days . a kms client will try to activate once every 7 days , and if it fails it will try again every 2 hours . the kms server can be automatically detected by dns if the proper dns record is present , or it can be manually entered using the `` slmgr '' command . there must be at least 25 kms-activated computers ( 5 for windows server ) on the network to use kms . if the kms activation fails ( for example , because the kms server is not available or there are less than 25 computers on the network ) , a watermark telling the user to activate windows will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen .
