Captivity narrative     captivity narratives are stories of people captured by enemies who are not civilized . historians do not trust all of these stories . a lot of them are not written from a neutral point of view . some historians that study native american cultures are careful when they use these stories as sources . captivity narratives from north america were published through the 18th and 19th centuries . they are a part of english literature , and more stories were written in india and east asia later on . colonists in new england were often captured by canadians and their indian allies . this was because new france and new england had competition at the time . ( this happened to the canadians as well ) . the number of captives taken from the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries are unclear , however . some think that about 1,641 new englanders were taken hostage during king phillip 's war ( 1675 ) . when the whites and indians had conflicts in the mid-nineteenth century , hundreds of women and children were captured .
