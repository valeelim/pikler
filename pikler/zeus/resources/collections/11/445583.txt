Cloisonné     cloisonné , a french word meaning `` enclosed '' , is a metal-working technique . it is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects . the resulting objects can also be called `` cloisonné '' . the decoration is formed by first adding compartments or cells to the metal object . this is done by soldering or sticking silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on edge . these are visible in the finished piece , separating the different compartments . coloured enamel is the usual filling for the cells . cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste , which then is fired in a kiln . in older times inlays of cut gemstones were often used . the technique was in ancient times mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes , weapons or similar small objects . they were decorated with geometric or schematic designs , with thick cloison walls . in the byzantine empire a technique with thinner wires were developed . this let pictorial images to be made . it was mostly used for religious images and jewellery , and by then always using enamel . by the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to china , where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases . the technique is common in china to the present day . cloisonné enamel objects using chinese-derived styles were produced in the west from the 18th century .
