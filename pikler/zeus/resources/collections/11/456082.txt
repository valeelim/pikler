Glaucophyte     the glaucophytes are a small group of freshwater microscopic algae . together with the red algae ( rhodophyta ) and green algae plus land plants ( viridiplantae or chloroplastida ) , they form the archaeplastida . the glaucophytes are of interest because they may be similar to the original algal type that led to green plants and red algae . the relationships between these groups are not yet clear , and the glaucophytes in particular need more study . the chloroplasts of glaucophytes are known as 'cyanelles ' . unlike the chloroplasts in other organisms , they have a peptidoglycan layer , like bacterial cell walls . this is thought to be a relic of the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from cyanobacteria . glaucophytes have the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a. they harvest light with the same type of pigment molecules as do cyanobacteria and red algae . green algae and land plants have lost that pigment , which is known as phycobiliprotein . glaucophyte mitochondria and flagella ( if present ) are similar to forms found in some green algae .
