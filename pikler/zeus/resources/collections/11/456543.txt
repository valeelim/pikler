Interface     an interface is what the user uses on an operating system to make the computer do tasks , like writing a document , or loading a web page . there are two types of interfaces , a command line interface ( cli for short ) , or a graphical user interface ( gui for short ) . `` see command line interface . '' command line interfaces ask the user to type in commands in a text-based environment , not allowing images , like the screen image to the right . for example , if the user wanted the computer to say `` hello world '' , he or she would : 1. have to type in what tells the computer that this is a command ( we will use `` say '' ) 1. then have to tell the computer what to `` say '' ( `` hello world '' in quotation marks ) 1. then press enter or return , giving the command to the computer , which is say `` hello world '' , so the computer prints hello world . this is hard to use for most people , mostly because when the user has to do a long command , he or she can miss a letter or two , so the computer shows an error , and he or she has to do it all over again , which can waste hours .
