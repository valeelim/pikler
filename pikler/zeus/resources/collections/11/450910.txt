Champagne Supernova     `` champagne supernova '' is the sixth and final single off english rock band oasis ' second studio album `` ( what 's the story ) morning glory ? '' . the song was released on 13 may 1996. in an interview , lead guitarist noel gallagher said of the song : `` some of the lyrics were written when i was out of it . there 's the words : 'someday you will find me/ caught beneath a landslide/ in a champagne supernova in the sky ' . that 's probably as psychedelic as i 'll ever get . it means different things when i 'm in different moods . when i 'm in a bad mood being caught beneath a landslide is like being suffocated . the song is a bit of an epic . it 's about when you 're young and you see people in groups and you think about what they did for you and they did nothing . as a kid , you always believed the sex pistols were going to conquer the world and kill everybody in the process . bands like the clash just petered out . punk rock was supposed to be the revolution but what did it do ? fuck all . the manchester thing was going to be the greatest movement on earth but it was fuck all . when we started we decided we were n't going to do anything for anybody , we just thought we 'd leave a bunch of great songs . but some of the words are about nothing . one is about bracket the butler who used to be on camberwick green , or chipley or trumpton or something . he used to take about 20 minutes to go down the hall . and then i could n't think of anything that rhymed with 'hall ' apart from 'cannonball ' . so i wrote 'slowly walking down the hall/ faster than a cannonball ' and people were like , 'wow , fuck , man ' . there 's also the line 'where were you while we were getting high ? ' because that 's what we always say to each other . but the number of people who 've started clubs called champagne supernova is fucking unbelievable . and the album is n't even released yet . ''
