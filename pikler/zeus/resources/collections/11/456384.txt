Melanocyte     melanocytes are melanin-producing cells . they are most obvious in the skin , hair and eyes . they are in the bottom layer of the skin 's epidermis , in hairs , and in the iris of the eye , and some places inside the body . melanin is the pigment mostly responsible for skin and hair colour . it protects the skin against damage by uv radiation from the sun . uv radiation causes damage to cell dna , which makes skin cancer more likely . melanocyte-stimulating hormones ( msh ) from the pituitary gland causes melanocytes to produce more melanin . they stimulate the production and release of melanin by melanocytes in skin and hair . msh signals to the brain have effects on appetite and sexual arousal .
