Timema     timema is a genus of short-bodied , somewhat thicker stick insects . they are native to the far western united states . compared to other stick insects ( order phasmatodea ) , the genus `` timema '' is basal . it is the earliest living branch to diverge from the phylogenetic tree of the phasmatodea . to emphasize this , all other stick insects are sometimes described as `` euphasmatodea . '' five of the 21 species of `` timema '' are parthenogenetic , including two species that have done sexual reproduction for a million years . this is the longest known asexual period for any insect . `` timema '' sticks are night-feeders : they spend daytime resting on the leaves or bark of the plants they feed on . they are camouflaged . `` timema '' species have colours ( green , gray , or brown ) and patterns ( stripes or dots ) which match their background .
