Archaefructus     archaefructus is an extinct genus of herbaceous aquatic seed plants . its fossils come from the yixian formation in northeastern china , about 125 million years ago in the early cretaceous . `` archaefructus '' is the earliest known genus of flowering plants . it lacks sepals and petals . its reproductive organs , carpels and stamens , are produced on an elongate stem rather than condensed into a flower as in modern angiosperms . archaefructaceae has been proposed as a new basal angiosperm family . an alternate interpretation of the same fossil has the long stem as an inflorescence rather than a flower , with staminate ( male ) flowers below and pistillate ( female ) flower above . the discovery of `` archaefructus eoflora '' supports this interpretation , because a bisexual flower is present between staminate and pistillate organs . if this is correct , `` archaefructus '' may not be basal within angiosperms , but it may be close to the nymphaeales or the basal eudicots .
