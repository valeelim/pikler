Pyrrharctia isabella     the isabella tiger moth ( `` pyrrharctia isabella '' ) lives in cold northern regions , especially the arctic . its caterpillar , the banded woolly bear larva , overwinters . it literally freezes solid . it produces a body fluid which helps its tissues to avoid damage . in the spring it thaws out and emerges to eat and grow in the short arctic summer . in temperate climates , many moths go through one generation in a year . in the arctic the summer period is so short that the woolly bear must feed for several summers . each winter it freezes , until at last it can pupate . some are known to live through as many as 14 winters . once it emerges from its pupa as a moth it has only days to find a mate .
