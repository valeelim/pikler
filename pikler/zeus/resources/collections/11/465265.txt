Rule of inference     in logic , a rule of inference , inference rule , or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises , analyzes their syntax , and returns a conclusion . for example , the rule of inference called `` modus ponens '' takes two premises , one in the form `` if p then q '' and another in the form `` p '' , and returns the conclusion `` q '' . the rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic , in the sense that if the premises are true , then so is the conclusion . typically , a rule of inference preserves truth , a semantic property . in many-valued logic , it preserves a general designation . but a rule of inference 's action is purely syntactic , and does not need to preserve any semantic property : any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference . usually only rules that are recursive are important ; i.e . rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule .
