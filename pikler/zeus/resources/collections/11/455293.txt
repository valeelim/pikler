Orion complex     the orion complex ( sometimes called the orion molecular cloud complex ) is a huge star-forming area in the constellation of orion . it is a large group of bright nebulae , dark clouds , and young star clusters . the cloud is between 1,500 and 1,600 light-years away and is hundreds of light-years across . several parts of the nebula can be seen through binoculars and small telescopes . some parts ( such as the orion nebula ) are visible to the naked eye . the nebula is important because of its sheer size . it is also one of the most active regions of stellar formation that can be seen in the night sky . in it are protoplanetary discs and many very young stars . the nebula is very bright in the infrared wavelengths due to the heat-intensive processes involved in star formation . the complex contains dark nebulae , emission nebulae , reflection nebulae , and hii regions . the following is a list of notable nebulae in the larger nebula complex : - the orion nebula , also known as m42 - m43 , which is part of the orion nebula
