Leopold and Loeb     leopold and loeb were nathan freudenthal leopold , jr. ( november 19 , 1904 – august 29 , 1971 ) and richard albert loeb ( june 11 , 1905 – january 28 , 1936 ) . they were two wealthy university of chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old robert `` bobby '' franks in 1924 in chicago . the duo was motivated to murder franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime . once arrested , leopold and loeb hired clarence darrow as counsel for the defense . darrow ’ s summation in their trial criticized capital punishment as retribution , rather than rehabilitation . leopold and loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment . loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936 ; leopold was released on parole in 1958. the leopold and loeb crime has been the inspiration for several works in film , theatre , and fiction , such as the 1929 play `` rope '' by patrick hamilton , and alfred hitchcock 's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name . later movies such as `` compulsion '' and `` swoon '' were more accurate portrayals of the leopold and loeb case .
