Hylonomus     hylonomus is an extinct stem tetrapod which lived 312 million years ago ( mya ) during the pennsylvanian . the lack of skull openings behind the eyes makes it difficult to decide whether or not it is a sauropsid . `` westlothiana '' is older , but may have been an amphibian , and `` casineria '' is rather fragmentary . `` hylonomus '' was long ( including the tail ) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern lizards . it had small sharp teeth and likely ate small invertebrates such as millipedes or early insects . fossils of `` hylonomus '' have been found in the remains of fossilized club moss stumps in joggins fossil cliffs , nova scotia , canada . the theory is that , after harsh weather , the club mosses would crash down . the stumps eventually hollow out . small animals such as `` hylonomus '' , seeking shelter , might enter and become trapped , starving to death . fossils of the basal pelycosaur `` archaeothyris '' and the basal diapsid `` petrolacosaurus '' are also found in the same region of nova scotia , higher up , dated about 6 million years later .
