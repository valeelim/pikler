Ramsey theory     the ramsey theory is named after the british mathematician and philosopher frank ramsey ( 19031930 ) . it is a branch of mathematics that studies the conditions under which order must appear . a typical result in ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that is then cut into pieces . how big must the original structure so that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property ? this idea can be defined as partition regularity . for example , consider a complete graph of order `` n '' ; that is , there are `` n '' vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge . a complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle . now colour every edge red or blue . how large must `` n '' be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle ? it turns out that the answer is 6. another way to express this result is as follows : at any party with at least six people , there are three people who are either ( a ) mutual acquaintances ( each one knows the other two ) or ( b ) mutual strangers ( each one does not know either of the other two ) .
