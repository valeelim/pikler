Battering ram     a battering ram is a siege engine used in the past . it was used to break open the stone walls of castles or splinter their wooden gates . in its simplest form , a battering ram is just a large , heavy log carried by several people and banged against an obstacle . the ram damages the target if the big log hit the target again and again . later rams were covered in the log with an arrow-proof , fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels . inside the canopy , the log was swung from chains or ropes . rams were great weapons of war against old fashioned wall-building materials such as stone and brick . these walls were weak in tension : they cracked when struck with sufficient force . with many blows , the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created . eventually , a breach would appear in the fabric of the wall . it would cause armed attackers to force their way through the gap . the introduction in the later middle ages of siege cannons causes the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons . much smaller , hand-held versions of battering rams are still used today , however , by law enforcement officers and military personnel to bash open locked doors .
