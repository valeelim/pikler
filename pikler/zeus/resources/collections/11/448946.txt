Sidewinding     sidewinding is a type of locomotion unique to some snakes . they use it to move across loose or slippery ground like sand or mud . it is often used by the saharan horned viper , `` cerastes cerastes '' , and the sidewinder rattlesnake , `` crotalus cerastes '' , to move across loose desert sands . it is also used by some snakes in southeast asia to move across tidal mud flats . other snakes can be induced to sidewind on artificial smooth surfaces , with various degrees of success . sidewinding is not the only way snakes can move on sand . sidewinding is done by simply lifting all the segments with the same slope off the ground . in the movement , the snake 's body is always in static ( as opposed to sliding ) contact with the ground . the head seems to be `` thrown '' forward , and the body follows , being lifted from the prior position and moved forward to lie on the ground ahead of where it was originally . meanwhile , the head is being thrown forward again . in this way , the snake slowly progresses at an angle , leaving a series of mostly straight , j-shaped tracks . because the snake 's body is in static contact with the ground , imprints of the belly scales can be seen in the tracks , and each track is almost exactly as long as the snake .
