Capsid     a capsid is the protein shell of a virus . it is made of several protein subunits . the observable 3-dimensional subunits are called 'capsomeres ' . the capsid encloses the nucleic acid of the virus . capsids are broadly classified according to their structure . some viruses , such as bacteriophages , have developed more complicated structures . the icosahedral shape , which has 20 equilateral triangular faces , approximates a sphere , while the helical shape is cylindrical . the capsid faces may consist of one or more proteins . for example , the foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid has faces consisting of three proteins called vp1â€“3 . most viruses ( e.g . influenza and many animal viruses ) have viral envelopes covering their protein capsids . this means the capsid is coated with a lipid membrane . the envelope is got by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus ' host ; such as the inner nuclear membrane , the golgi membrane , or the cell 's outer membrane . the envelope may help viruses avoid the host immune system . glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope bind to receptor sites on the host 's membrane . the viral envelope then fuses with the host 's membrane this allows the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host .
