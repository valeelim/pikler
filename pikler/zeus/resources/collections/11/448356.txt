Ennerdale Water     ennerdale water is the most westerly lake in the lake district national park in cumbria . it is a glacial lake , with a maximum depth of 150 feet ( 45 metres ) . at ½ mile to a mile ( 700 to 1,500 metres ) wide and 2½ miles ( 3.9 kilometres ) long is one of the smallest lakes in the area . to the west of the lake lies the small village of ennerdale bridge , with of two pubs and a few houses . it is close to the port of whitehaven , the town of cleator moor and the village of cleator . in 1810 a large carnivore killed hundreds of sheep in and around ennerdale before it was hunted down and killed . the girt ( dialect for 'great ' ) dog of ennerdale was a mysterious creature that killed between 300 and 400 sheep over six months in the fells of cumberland , england , in 1810. it is now commonly thought that the girt dog of ennerdale was a thylacine ( otherwise known as the tasmanian tiger or tasmanian wolf . ) travelling circuses and menageries of the time were known to keep what were described as “ tiger wolves ” – a description that fits the thylacine perfectly . as import laws and animal control were so relaxed in the early part of the nineteenth century , an escape from one of these itinerant shows is easy to imagine .
