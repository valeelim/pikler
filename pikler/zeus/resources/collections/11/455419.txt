Sonderkommando     sonderkommandos were special work groups made up of prisoners in the nazi concentration camps during world war ii . ( in german , `` sonderkommando '' means `` special unit '' . ) they worked in and around the gas chambers , which the nazis used to murder many people . the `` sonderkommandos '' did not kill anybody . when the nazi guards at the concentration camps killed people in their gas chambers , they made the `` sonderkommandos '' do a few different jobs : - take prisoners into the gas chambers - take dead bodies out of the gas chambers after the nazis had killed them - take things the nazis wanted from the dead bodies . for example , they had to take out gold teeth and tooth fillings ; cut off the women 's hair ; and take jewelry and eyeglasses - bury or burn the dead bodies - clean the gas chambers and get them ready for the next group of people the nazis wanted to kill usually , the nazi camp guards chose people for the `` sonderkommando '' groups right after those people got to the concentration camps . they almost always chose jewish prisoners . these people were told they would be killed if they did not agree . they were not told what kind of work they would have to do . sometimes , the new `` sonderkommando '' would find the bodies of their own families in the gas chambers . they were not allowed to change jobs or refuse to work . the only way they could stop working as `` sonderkommando '' would be to kill themselves .
