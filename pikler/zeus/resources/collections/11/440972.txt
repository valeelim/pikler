Kinematics     kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points , bodies ( objects ) and systems of bodies ( groups of objects ) without looking at the cause of this motion . the term was translated from french ; a.m. ampère used the term `` cinématique '' . he constructed the term form the greek , kinema ( movement , motion ) , derived from , kinein ( to move ) . the study of `` kinematics '' is often referred to as the `` geometry of motion . '' to describe motion , kinematics studies the paths of points , lines and other geometric objects in space , and some of their properties such as velocity and acceleration . astrophysics uses kinematics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and systems . mechanical engineering , robotics and biomechanics use it to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts such as an engine , a robotic arm or the skeleton of the human body . the study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical functions . it is possible to represent rotation with elements of the unit circle in the complex plane . other planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of classical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the lorentz transformations of relativistic space and time . mathematicians have developed a science of kinematic geometry , which uses time as a parameter .
