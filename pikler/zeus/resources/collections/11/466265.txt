Adactylidium     adactylidium is a genus of mites . it is known for its short and unusual life cycle . the pregnant female mite attaches herself to a single egg of a thrip . she grows from five to eight female offspring and one male in her body . the offspring begin to eat their mother from the inside out . the single male mite mates with all his sisters when they are still in the mother . the females , now pregnant , cut holes in their mother 's body . this is so that they can get out to find new thrips eggs . the male gets out too . but having served his biological function he dies after a few hours . the females die at the age of four days , when their own offspring eat them alive from the inside .
