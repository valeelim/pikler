Matthias Schleiden     matthias jakob schleiden ( 5 april 1804 23 june 1881 ) was a german botanist . he was long supposed to be the co-founder of the cell theory , with theodor schwann and rudolf virchow . however , a recent study of the original papers revealed that schleiden and schwann used previous research , and were popularisers of an idea others had discovered . the earlier work of the czech jan purkyně ( 1787–1869 ) and his student and collaborator gabriel valentin ( 1810–1883 ) was `` unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic germans . they have a claim to some priority in the cell theory '' . johannes müller ( 1801–1858 ) also made great contributions . it was , however , his student theodor schwann and matthias schleiden who got the credit for the cell theory . this was despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct , and their credits to previous workers were `` a travesty '' . as understood now , the cell theory includes these important ideas : 1. all living things are made of cells . 1. the cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all organisms .
