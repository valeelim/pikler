Bubo     bubo is a genus of large owls . it includes the eagle-owls ( old world ) and the horned owls ( the americas ) . this genus contains about one or two dozen species of typical owls ( family strigidae ) and is found in many parts of the world . some of the largest living strigiformes are in `` bubo '' . traditionally , only owls with ear-tufts were included here , but that is no longer the case . mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) cytochrome `` b '' sequence data supports the decision to put the snowy owl , an eagle-owl adapted to arctic conditions , into `` bubo '' . the fish-owls in the genus `` ketupa '' , and the `` scotopelia '' fishing owls , are also closely related . they might be moved into `` bubus '' , but that would make the genus rather large . as it is some of these owls , like verreaux 's eagle-owl , are not studied enough . more research is needed .
