Logical quantifier     in logic , a quantifier is a way to state that a certain number of elements fulfill some criteria . for example , every natural number has another natural number larger than it . in this example , the word `` every '' is a quantifier . therefore , the sentence `` every natural number has another natural number larger than it '' is a quantified expression . quantifiers and quantified expressions are a useful part of formal languages . they are useful because they let rigorous statements claim how widespread a criteria is . two basic kinds of quantifiers used in predicate logic are universal and existential quantifiers . a universal quantifier states that all the elements considered fulfill the criteria . the universal quantifier is symbolized with `` ∀ '' , an upside down `` a '' , to stand for `` all '' . an existence quantifier ( symbolized with `` ∃ '' ) states that at least one element considered fits the criteria . the existential quantifier is symbolized with `` ∃ '' , a backwards `` e '' , to stand for `` exists '' .
