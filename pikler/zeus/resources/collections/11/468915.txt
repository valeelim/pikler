Annealing     annealing is the name for a number of processes that change the properties of a piece of work using heat . in general the piece is heated to a certain temperature , and modelled while it cools off . specifically , annealing can refer to : - annealing ( metallurgy ) when metals are treated - annealing ( glass ) when a piece of glass is heated to remove stress - nucleic acid thermodynamics when dna-like structures are changed - simulated annealing is a method of combinatorial optimization to find the optimum of a function - quantum annealing is another method of combinatorial optimization
