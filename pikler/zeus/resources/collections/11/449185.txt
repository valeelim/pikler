Proto-Sinaitic script     proto-sinaitic is a middle bronze age script . it is known only from a few inscriptions at serabit el-khadim in the sinai peninsula . because there are so few proto-sinaitic signs , little is known with certainty about the nature of the script . the script co-existed with egyptian hieroglyphs , so it is likely that it represented true writing , but this is not certain . from the shape of the signs , proto-sinaitic may be an alphabet , and the ancestor of the phoenician alphabet , from which nearly all modern alphabets descend . there have been two major discoveries of inscriptions of the proto-sinaitic script . the first was in the winter of 1904–1905 in sinai by hilda and flinders petrie , dated to circa 1700–1400 bc . the second find was more recently in 1999 in middle egypt by john and deborah darnell . this is dated to the 18th century bc .
