Random walk hypothesis     random walk hypothesis is created as a neo-classical consumption function by robert e. hall , and it is related to an expectation theory in macro economics . this gives basis of how individuals do economic decision of present period and is used to calculate an amount of the macro consumption from an economic world . this theory starts with freidman 's permanent income hypothesis and lucas 's rational expectation hypothesis . before this theory was made , other expectation theories basically assume that people irrationally think sometimes making decision based on the past ( already reflected in the market ) facts or falling into the illusion . but lucas argued that the market players use all the information available at the moment in order to pursuit utility maximization . permanent income hypothesis supposes people try to decide the amount of consumption expecting the impacts of a certain incident throughout the whole periods of time . random walk hypothesis concludes rational expectation to consumption of the next period is the present consumption . it is because all the information was taken into account on the decision of the present consumption . what changes the amount of next period consumption is totally unexpected or not given information . therefore , the changes in the consumption can not be expected but randomly walk .
