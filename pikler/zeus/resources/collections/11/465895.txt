Nuclear DNA     nuclear dna is the dna inside the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cells . this dna is a double helix , with two strands wound around each other . this double helix structure was first described by francis crick and james d. watson in 1953. this dna is different from the dna in bacteria , mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplasts . nuclear dna is very long , and is bound up in chromosomes which , apart from the dna , are protein structures . the second difference is that each eukaryote cell has two sets of dna , one set from each parent : it is diploid . mitochondrial and plastid dna is relatively short , is in a circle , and there is only one set ( haploid ) , not two . it is supposed that these organelles were once independent bacteria ( see endosymbiosis ) . the consequence of nuclear dna being double is highly important . the genes in mitochondria and plastids only change when a mutation happens . nuclear dna gets shuffled by the cell division known as meiosis , part of sexual reproduction . this leads to a variety of offspring from any two parents .
