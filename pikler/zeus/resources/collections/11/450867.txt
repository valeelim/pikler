Laplace operator     in mathematics the laplace operator or laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on euclidean space . it is usually denoted by the symbols ∇·∇ , ∇ or ∆ . the laplacian ∆ '' f '' ( `` p '' ) of a function `` f '' at a point `` p '' , up to a constant depending on the dimension , is the rate at which the average value of `` f '' over spheres centered at `` p '' , deviates from `` f '' ( `` p '' ) as the radius of the sphere grows . in a cartesian coordinate system , the laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable . in other coordinate systems such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates , the laplacian also has a useful form . the laplace operator is named after the french mathematician pierre-simon de laplace ( 1749–1827 ) , who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics . in this case , the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to a given gravitational potential . solutions of the equation ∆ '' f '' = 0 , now called laplace 's equation , are the so-called harmonic functions , and represent the possible gravitational fields in free space .
