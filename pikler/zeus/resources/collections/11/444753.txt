Pseudo-Nero     the roman emperor nero committed suicide near the villa of his freedman phaon in june of 68 ad . between the autumn of 69 ad and the reign of the emperor domitian , some people appeared and claimed they were nero . these impostors were known as pseudo-nero . most scholars believe there were either two or three nero impostors . st. augustine wrote of the popularity of the belief that nero would return in his day , which is known as the nero redivivus legend . suetonius writes that imperial edicts were forged in the name of dead nero . these edicts encouraged his followers and promised that he would soon return to avenge himself on his enemies . one of the things that led to the belief that nero survived was the fact that he died in a location that was not well known . suetonius wrote that galba 's freedman icelus saw the dead emperor 's body and reported back to his master . nero was also denied the lavish burial that was accorded to popular emperors and members of the imperial family . this may have left those plebeians who loved him dissatisfied and suspicious . furthermore , he was not buried in the mausoleum of augustus with the other julio-claudian emperors , but in a tomb on the pincian hill at the family burial place of the domitii ahenobarbi . many roman plebeians though nero was very popular after his death , and so they laid flowers at his tomb .
