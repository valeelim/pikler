Planthopper     planthoppers are insects in the infraorder fulgoromorpha . they are true bugs ( hemiptera ) , with over 12,500 described species . they are cryptic mimics : their body shape and colours look like leaves and other plant parts in their environment . they either walk very slowly or hop like grasshoppers . members of this group are plant-feeders , and live world-wide . few are pests , but some are vectors for plant diseases . phytoplasmas which live in the phloem of plants can be transmitted by planthoppers when feeding . their nymphs have a biological gear mechanism at the base of the hind legs , which keeps the legs in synchrony when the insects jump . the planthopper is mentioned in a key scene from alfred hitchcock 's film `` marnie '' :
