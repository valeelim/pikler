Plant breeding     plant breeding is the art and science of changing the traits of plants to produce desired characteristics . plant breeding can be done by many different techniques . plants with desirable characteristics for propagation can be selected . more complex molecular techniques are also possible ( see cultigen and cultivar ) . plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years , since near the beginning of human civilization . it is now done worldwide by gardeners and farmers , or by professional plant breeders employed by government institutions , universities , crop-specific industry associations or research centres . international development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for preventing famine . new varieties are developed . they are higher-yielding , resistant to pests and diseases , drought-resistant or adapted to different environments and growing conditions . plant breeding started with the domestication of the first agricultural plants , a practice dates back 9,000 to 11,000 years . initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics , and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations , resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time .
