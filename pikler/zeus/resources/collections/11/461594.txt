Structural color     structural coloration is a coloring that results from the special structure of the surface . sometimes structural coloration is combined with pigments : for example , peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown , but their structure makes them appear blue , turquoise , and green , and often they appear iridescent . english scientists robert hooke and isaac newton were the first who observed structural coloration . thomas young described its principle a century later and called it wave interference . young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from several surfaces of thin films , combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films . the geometry then determines that at certain angles , the light reflected from both surfaces adds ( interferes constructively ) , while at other angles , the light subtracts . as a result , different colors appear at different angles .
