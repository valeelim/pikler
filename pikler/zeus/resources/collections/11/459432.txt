Token Ring     token ring is a networking protocol for local area networks . it uses a token at the data link layer . the token has two states , either it is free , or it is taken , and data follows . when a computer has a message to send , it appends the message to the token , and sets the token state to taken . each workstation along the ring sees the message . if the workstation was the recipient of the message , it sends a new empty token , otherwise it passes the token along . since the only way to send data is to wait for an empty token , there will be no collisions . token ring was mainly used by ibm in the 1970s to 1990s , today , ethernet has replaced it in many applications .
