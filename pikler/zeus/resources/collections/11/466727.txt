Hardback     a hardback , hardcover , or hardbound book is one with stiff covers . the covers are of rigid cardboard . they are usually covered with cloth or heavy paper . a heavy cloth like buckram , or a leather is sometimes chosen . it should have a flexible , sewn spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened . less good is a glued spine , because the glue gets worse with time . hardback books may be printed on acid-free paper . they are much more durable than paperbacks . paperbacks are often printed on cheap recycled paper , and have flexible , easily damaged paper covers . hardback books are only slightly more costly to make , but are often much more expensive to buy . hardbacks may have artistic dust jackets , or designs printed right on the board binding .
