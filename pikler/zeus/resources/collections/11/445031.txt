Delta-v     delta-v , or Î´ '' v '' , '' `` ( literally , the change in speed ) '' `` in astrodynamics , ( how spacecraft move in space ) is a measure of the amount of effort ( pushing power ) needed to change a craft 's trajectory ( how it 's going to move from now on ) in space . it is measured by a unit of speed . most of the time , a propellant burned by an engine provides the needed thrust . delta-v is calculated in meters per second of thrust , or m/s . for example , to reach low earth orbit , ( leo ) a spacecraft generally needs about 9,300 to 10,000 m/s of thrust .
