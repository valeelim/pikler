Enthalpy of vaporization     the enthalpy of vaporization , also called the latent heat of vaporization is the change in the enthalpy needed to change an amount of liquid into a gas . it happens at a given pressure . the enthalpies of vaporization are usually measured at the normal boiling point for that substance . the units are usually j/mol . an example is when the cooling effects of vaporization controls the body temperature of humans . warm weather or exercise creates heat in the body . this causes the body to sweat ( or perspire ) . the body feels cooler when the liquid sweat evaporates . as the humidity increases , the rate of evaporation decreases . this determines the body 's comfort level . related pages . - enthalpy of fusion
