Mercator projection     the mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection which is widely used in cartography today . it was developed by gerardus mercator in 1569. it is not a physical projection , and can not be constructed using geometric tools . on a small scale , geometric shapes can be moved around the map , without distorting them ( this property is known as conformity ) . as a downside , the scale of the shape and the direction of lines may change when shapes are moved . for example , africa is actually 15 times larger than greenland , but on this map projection they look the same size . today , mercator projections are mainly used for maps .
