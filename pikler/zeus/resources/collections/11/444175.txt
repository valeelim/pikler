Bucket-wheel excavator     bucket-wheel excavators ( bwes ) are huge machines used for surface mining . they are continuous digging machines in large-scale open cast mining operations . what sets bwes apart from other large-scale mining equipment is their large wheel with a continuous pattern of buckets to scoop material as the wheel turns . they are among the largest vehicles ever constructed . the biggest bucket-wheel excavator ever built , bagger 293 , is the largest terrestrial ( land ) vehicle in human history.. bwes built since the 1990s , such as the bagger 293 , have reached sizes as large as 96 metres ( 314.9 feet ) tall , 225 metres ( 738.2 feet ) long , and as heavy as 14,200 metric tons ( 31.3 million lb ) . the bucket-wheel itself can be over 70 feet in diameter with as many as 20 buckets , each of which can hold over 15 cubic metres of material . bwes are now capable of operating in extreme climates . many bwes have been designed to operate in climates with temperatures as low as -45°c ( -49°f ) .
