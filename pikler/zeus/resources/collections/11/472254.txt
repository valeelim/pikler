Intercalation (timekeeping)    intercalation ( timekeeping ) calendars are commonly based on the rotation of celestial bodies , such as the sun or the moon . these calendars periodically add a certain time unit , to make the calendar follow the rotation more closely , which is known as intercalation . as an example , the solar year is about 365,25 days long . the gregorian calendar says that the year has 365 days , but that roughly every four years , an extra day is added . another example is the jewish calendar , which is a lunisolar calendar . in addition to the 365,25 days of the solar year , there are the 29.5 days in a lunar month . this gives the problem that the year does not have twelve months , but about 12.4 months . the calendar solves this problem by adding an extra month in certain cases .
