Miracle fruit     the miracle fruit is the berry of synsepalum dulcificum , a plant from west africa . the chemical produced by the fruit makes other food taste sweet . this chemical , called miraculin , is now being produced by transgenic tomato plants . miraculin is a glycoprotein molecule , with some trailing carbohydrate chains . the berry has a low sugar content and a mildly sweet taste . when the fruit is eaten , miraculin binds to the tongue 's taste buds , causing sour foods to taste sweet . at neutral ph , miraculin binds and blocks the receptors , but at low ph ( after eating sour food ) miraculin binds protons and activates the sweet receptors . this is what causes the sweet taste . this effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva ( up to about 60 minutes ) .
