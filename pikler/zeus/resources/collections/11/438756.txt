Public-private partnership     a public-private partnership is a contract between the public sector , or government , and a private company . the purpose for such public-private partnerships is to provide public services , like education and transportation . this is without changing the private business into a government-operated service . one way of doing this is to allow the government to pay the business for providing free services to the public . the business provides the services for free and then charges the government for compensation , in which the government agrees . supporters of public-private partnerships argue that it reduces inefficiency and provides the free market with greater flexibility .
