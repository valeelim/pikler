Gotra     gotra is a clan in hindu society . it means the people who are descended in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor . in the 4th century , pāṇini wrote that gotra are the descendants of a sage , `` beginning with the son 's son. '' ( iv . 1 . 162 ) . a person who says `` i am kashyapa-gotra , '' can trace his family from the ancient sage kashyapa through an unbroken male line . according to the brihadaranyaka upanisad 2.2.6 , gautama and bharadvāja , viśvāmitra and jamadagni , vashishtha and kaśhyapa , and atri are seven sages ( also known as saptarishi ) . the descendants of these eight sages are said to be gotras . this explanation of the eight primary gotras seems to have been known to pāṇini . descendants of others are called `` gotrâvayava '' .
