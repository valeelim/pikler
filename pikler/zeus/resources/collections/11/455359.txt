Sagittarius A     sagittarius a ( or sgr a ) is a complex radio source at the galactic centre of the milky way . it is in the sagittarius constellation , but hidden from view by large clouds of cosmic dust in the spiral arms of the milky way . it consists of three components : the remains of a supernova sagittarius a east , the spiral structure sagittarius a west , and a very bright compact radio source at the center of the spiral , sagittarius a* . these three overlap : sagittarius a east is the largest , west appears off-center within east , and a* is at the centre of west . this feature is about 25 light-years wide . it looks like a remnant from a supernova explosion that happened between 35,000 and 100,000 years ago . however , it would take 50 to 100 times more energy than a standard supernova explosion to create a structure of this size and energy . sgr a east might be the remains of a star that exploded as it was gravitationally squashed approaching the central black hole . sgr a west looks like a three-arm spiral from the point of view of the earth . actually it is made of several dust and gas clouds , which orbit and fall onto sagittarius a* at velocities as high as 1,000 kilometers per second . the surface layer of these clouds is ionized . the source of ionisation is the population of massive stars that also occupy the central parsec of the galaxy . over hundred such ob stars have been identified so far .
