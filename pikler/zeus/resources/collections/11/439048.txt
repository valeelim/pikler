Leishmaniasis     leishmaniasis or leishmaniosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus `` leishmania '' . it is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies . the disease has three forms : - cutaneous leishmaniasis : skin ulcers - mucocutaneous leishmaniasis : ulcers of the skin , mouth and nose - visceral leishmaniasis : starts with skin ulcers , then fever , low red blood cells , and a large spleen and liver leishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of `` leishmania '' . risk factors include poverty , malnutrition , deforestation and urbanization . all three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope . the visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test . leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide . another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies . early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread . the treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired , the species of `` leishmania '' and the type of infection . medications used for the visceral form include : liposomal amphotericin b , a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin , and miltefosine . for the cutaneous form , paromomycin , fluconazole or pentamidine can help .
