Rolling and wheels in the natural world     there are two ways that natural and man-made things can use rotation to move around . one way is for the entire thing to roll . the other way is for part of the thing to turn while the rest does not , like a wheel or a propeller . some living things move around by rolling , but no living things seem to use wheels . biologists have written about the reasons for this . writers of science fiction and fantasy have invented many animals with wheels . wheels are a very useful technology for people . many technologies that people use are also found in nature , like wings and lenses . it may seem strange , then , that wheels have never evolved in nature , but there are two reasons for this . first , there are natural limits to what kinds of things can exist in nature . living things change slowly over time , a process called evolution by natural selection . this process can create many different answers to a problem , but it ca n't always create every answer that can be imagined . also , the ways that new living things build themselves ( a process called developmental biology ) ca n't always create every kind of part that can be imagined . second , wheels are sometimes less useful than other ways of moving , like walking , running , or slithering like a snake . for the same reason , some groups of people in the past have given up using wheels completely .
