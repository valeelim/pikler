Spire     a spire is a tapering conical or pyramidal structure on the top of a building , particularly a church tower . etymologically , the word comes from the old english word `` spir '' , meaning a sprout , shoot , or stalk of grass . symbolically , spires have two effects . one is to show strength and power . a spire , with its spear point , gives the impression of strength . the other is to reach up toward the skies as a religious gesture . this is one reason for its association with religious buildings , and a similar reason has been given for the large pyramids in egypt and early american civilisations . however , the tallest spires today are secular places of business or hotels , such as the shard . as an architectural ornament , spires are most often found on christian churches .
