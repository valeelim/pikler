Palaeoclimatology     palaeoclimatology ( or palaeoclimatology ) is the study of changes in climate over the entire history of earth . modern interest in climate change has caused a great increase in the climates of the past . the climates of the past can only be studied by proxy . data is got from rocks , sediments , ice and tree rings , corals , shells and microfossils . these records are used to work out the past states of the earth 's climate and its atmospheric system . studies of past changes in the life and ecosystems of the past may throw a light on the present . an example is the effect of climate on mass extinctions and the recovery of life after those extinctions . knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes further back in time . some notable climate events : - faint young sun - huronian glaciation ( ~2400 mya earth completely covered in ice probably due to great oxygenation event ) - later neoproterozoic snowball earth ( ~600 mya , precursor to the cambrian explosion ) - carboniferous rainforest collapse ( ~300 mya )
