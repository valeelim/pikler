Megaflood     a megaflood is a flood which suddenly releases a huge amount of water . in geomorphology it is sometimes called an outburst flood . at the end of the last ice age , many large floods were caused by the collapse of ice sheets or glaciers which formed the dams of glacial lakes . examples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the earth . landslides , lahars , and volcanic dams can block rivers and create lakes . when the rock or earth barrier collapses , or is eroded , this triggers a flood . lakes also form behind glacial moraines , which can collapse and create outburst floods . it is claimed that a rising sea flood led to refilling of the freshwater glacial black sea with water from the aegean . it is described as `` a violent rush of salt water into a depressed fresh-water lake in a single catastrophe that has been the inspiration for the flood mythology '' . the marine incursion was caused by the rising level of the mediterranean about 7,600 years ago . it is the subject of debate among geologists . the existence of the flood is not certain , and the theory that it was the basis for later flood myths is not proven .
