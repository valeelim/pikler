Query by Example     query by example ( commonly shortened to qbe ) is a database query language for relational databases . it was developed at ibm in the 1970s . the development of sql ran in parallel . qbe was developed for those users who only use databases occasionally , and who do not want to learn a complex language such as sql . with query by example , users are presented with a visual schema of the database , which they edit with a special editor . when they are done , a parser translates their actions into a query in a regular query language such as sql . behind the scenes , it is this statement that is actually executed . with a suitable front-end , the user does not need to remember the details of a query language . the user will be able to select tables and columns more quickly , for example by clicking on them , rather than typing their names . this will improve productivity . in the context of information retrieval , qbe has a somewhat different meaning . the user can submit a document and ask for `` similar '' documents to be retrieved from a document database . similarity search is based comparing document vectors ( see vector space model ) .
