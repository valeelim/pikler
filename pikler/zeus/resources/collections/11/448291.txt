Salt lake     a salt lake , or saline lake , is a lake with a lot of sodium chloride and other dissolved minerals in the water . it is often defined as three grams or more of salt per litre . in some cases , salt lakes have more salt than sea water : they are called hypersaline lakes . an alkaline salt lake with a high content of carbonate is called a soda lake . salt lakes can be put into categories based on salinity : - subsaline 0.5–3 ‰ ( parts per thousand ) - hyposaline 3–20 ‰ - mesosaline 20–50 ‰ - hypersaline greater than 50 ‰ salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake , containing salt or minerals , can not leave . this is because the lake is endorheic ( a dead end ) . the water then evaporates , leaving behind any dissolved salts . this increases its salinity . salt lakes are an excellent place for salt production . high salinity will also lead to a unique flora and fauna in the lake . sometimes the large amount of salt means there is little life in or near the lake . if the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated , the lake will eventually disappear and leave a dry lake : a 'playa ' , salt flat or salt pan .
