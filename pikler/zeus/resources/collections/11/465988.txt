Connecticut Turnpike     the connecticut turnpike ( also known as governor john davis lodge turnpike ) is a freeway in connecticut . it runs from byram to south killingly . it is approximately 135 miles long ( 94 miles on interstate 95 , 37 miles on interstate 395 , and 4 miles on state route 695 ) . the connecticut turnpike opened in the early 1950s as the state 's main highway . once the road was considered paid for , and also due to several accidents near the toll booths , tolls were removed from the road in 1985. the turnpike was renamed for former governor john davis lodge soon afterward . very few signs nowadays identify the route as one unified road , and the section that runs as route 695 carries no current identification at all ( not even ct 695 markers ) except to say that eastbound it goes `` to us 6 '' and westbound it goes `` to i-395 '' . other websites . - nycroads.com â€“ connecticut turnpike - unofficial connecticut turnpike page - i-95 ( greater new york roads )
