Deep Web     the deep web is the part of the world wide web you can not search on common search websites such as google . the part you can search is called the surface web . the first person who used the term `` deep web '' was mike bergman , a computer scientist , in the year 2000. some people think that `` darknet '' and `` dark web '' are the same thing as deep web , but they are not . let 's explain what they mean : - a darknet is a type of computer network ( this means a connection between many computers , such as the internet ) that is private or closed . it is sometimes difficult to access a darknet . you would need to know a password , use specific computer programs , change the configuration of your web browser and many other things , depending on what network you are trying to access . tor is an example of a darknet used by many people . - the dark web is the part of the world wide web located in darknets . since no darknet can be found by google or any other search website , the entire dark web is also part of the deep web . thus , the dark web exists inside the deep web but is not the same thing as it .
