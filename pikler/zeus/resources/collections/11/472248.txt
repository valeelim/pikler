Nested Paging     in computer platform virtulisation , nested paging is used to unburden the hypervisor from heavy work with guest os memory translation . before , hypervisor needs to employ a second page table keeping track of guest page table , and force the guest os use it to access system physical memory . for doing this , hypervisor needs to monitor the paging activities of guest os and intercept it with necessarily inserting , deleting or modifying entries in this second page table . this consumes processor 's time and system physical memory space . nested paging provides a second level address translation . with help of it , hypervisor does not need to maintain that second page table with intercepting activities on guest paging . it simply maintains the nested page table for translating the guest physical address into the system physical address . after nested page table created , the paging hardware does the translation job automatically . each guest physical access would incur nested paging , for a 48-bit address paging in 4kib , a guest physical address translation would need 25 accesses of system physical memory . so larger tlb and page size would decrease the system physical memory accesses .
