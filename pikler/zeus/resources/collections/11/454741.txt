Galaxy group     a galaxy group is a group of galaxies made up of less than 50 or so members and bound by gravity . collections of galaxies larger than groups are called galaxy clusters or superclusters . our own galaxy , the milky way , is in the local group of more than 40 galaxies . galaxy groups are the smallest groups of galaxies . they usually have no more than 50 galaxies . the group in a diameter of 1 to 2 megaparsecs ( about 4 to 8 million light-years ) . their mass is about 10 solar masses . this is just a guide , because larger and more massive galaxy systems are sometimes called galaxy groups .
