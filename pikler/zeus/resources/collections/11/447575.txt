List of mammals of Great Britain     this is a list of mammals of great britain . the great britain mammal fauna is impoverished compared with that of continental europe . this is because there was only a short time between the last ice age and the flooding of the land bridge between britain and the rest of europe . the list only has land species which crossed before the creation of the english channel , and those later brought in by humans . native ( indigenous ) species have three possible definitions : - a species which colonised the islands during the glacial retreat at the end of the last ice age ( c.9500 years ago ) ; - a species that was present when the english channel was created ( c.8000 years ago ) ; - or , a species that was present in prehistory . this list includes mammals from the small islands around great britain and the channel islands . there are no endemic mammal species in great britain , although four distinct subspecies of rodents have arisen on small islands . rodents make up the largest order of mammals , with over 40 percent of mammalian species . they have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing . most rodents are small though the coypu ( once introduced to great britain , but subsequently eradicated ) can weigh up to 9 kg ( 15.5 lb ) .
