Utatsusaurus     utatsusaurus is the earliest-known form of an ichthyopterygian . it lived in the earliest lower triassic period , about 250245 millions years ago . it is nearly 3m ( about 9 feet ) long with a slender body . the name `` utatsusaurus '' was given after the city utatsu-cho where the first specimen was found . the fossils have been found in the lower triassic of miyagi prefecture , japan and british columbia , canada . `` utatsusaurus '' is one of the most primitive ( basal ) types of ichthyosaur . it has transitional features between its ancestral land-dwelling forms and the more derived ichthyosaurs . unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs , `` utatsusaurus '' has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull . the snout gently tapers , compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians . the tail had a long low fin , quite different from the tail shape of later forms . this suggests that the animal swam by undulation , waving its body to & fro , rather than using its paddles and tail . the 2011 t≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed the local museum , but fortunately the specimens were not there at the time .
