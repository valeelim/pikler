Meninges     the meninges are the membranes that surround and protect the brain and the spinal cord . in mammals , the meninges have three layers : the dura mater , the arachnoid mater , and the pia mater . in the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater ( called the `` subarachnoid space '' ) , there is cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) . csf is a special fluid which bathes the brain and spinal cord . the meninges and the csf work together to cushion and protect the central nervous system ( the brain and spinal cord ) . the pia mater ( or `` pia '' ) is the layer of the meninges that is closest to the brain and spinal cord . it is a thin , delicate layer ( `` pia mater '' means `` tender mother '' in latin ) . the pia mater sticks very closely to both the brain and spinal cord . the pia mater is made of cells that fluid can not get through . this prevents cerebrospinal fluid from reaching the brain . the smallest type of blood vessels , called capillaries , go through the pia mater and bring the brain the things it needs , like blood and oxygen . the pia 's capillaries also make up an important part of the blood-brain barrier . this is the brain 's `` security system . '' it controls what can leave the bloodstream and get into the brain 's nerve cells , and what can not .
