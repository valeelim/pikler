Grammar school     a grammar school is one of several different types of school in the united kingdom and some other english-speaking countries . originally they were schools teaching classical languages such as latin . recently they are academically-oriented secondary schools . in the late victorian era grammar schools were reorganised for secondary education throughout england and wales . scotland had developed a different system . grammar schools were also established in british territories overseas , where they have evolved in different ways . grammar schools became `` selective '' in the mid-20th century . this means they selected applicants whom they thought would get the most out of that kind of education . they were described as `` the selective tier of state-funded secondary education in england and wales '' . labour governments in the 1960s and 70s made efforts to replace grammar schools with comprehensive schools . comprehensive schools were open to children of all abilities , similar to high schools in the united states .
