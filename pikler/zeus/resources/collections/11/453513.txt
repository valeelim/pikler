Fluvial terrace     fluvial terrace is an abandoned floodplain with a long , narrow stairs that is formed when the river flowed at a higher level than at present . fluvial terrace consists of two parts ; a tread , which is the flat surface at the upper side of fluvial terrace , and a scarp , which is the steep slope connecting the tread to the downside . fluvial terrace is divided into rock terrace and gravel terrace according to structure materials , and it is also classified as tectonic terrace and climate terrace according to causes of formation . fluvial terraces are either called erosional or depositional . erosional terrace is a terrace that the tread has been formed primarily by lateral erosion . during low water level stage , fine sediment is deposited and during normal flow , coarse sediment is deposited at the end of a high water event . when the river reaches its highest level , it entrains all the channel sediment and scours the underlying bedrock before coarse detritus is deposited again on the channel floor .
