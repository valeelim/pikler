Hague Adoption Convention     the hague convention on protection of children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption ( or simply hague adoption convention ) , provides certain protections to children . it guarantees the protection of children from child trafficking . it also guarantees them safe adoption and a quick adoption process . in may 1993 the proposal was presented at the seventeenth session of the hague convention . it became effective in 1995. the united states ratified the hague adoption convention in december of 2007. forty-six countries had ratified the treaty as of may of 2002. thirteen more had yet to ratify it . many countries which have not ratified the convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children . for example muslim countries do not permit foreign adoptions . adopting children from one country into a family from another is a relatively new idea . it developed after world war ii . by the 1970s it became a fairly common event . but it was soon recognized this was creating a number of legal and human problems . there were few domestic and international laws that adequately protected children 's rights . the hague adoption convention of 1993 addressed these concerns . the convention gave the responsibility of providing the protection against child trafficking , safe adoption and a quick adoption process to the countries and to adoption agencies .
