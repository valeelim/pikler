Neo-creationism     creationism is the idea that life on earth was created by god . this idea comes from a literal reading of scripture , very often the bible . today , almost all scientists believe evolution is a good explanation . these scientists say that the scientific method does not allow certain explanations , mostly those that include supernatural elements . for this reason , a movement called neo-creationism wants to re-state the ideas behind creationism and restart the discussion over the origins of life . the followers want to do this in such a way that religious terms are not used , and that there are no references to scripture . this should make it easier to talk to other groups , such as the scientific community or the general public .
