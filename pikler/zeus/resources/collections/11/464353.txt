Magnitude (astronomy)    magnitude ( astronomy ) the apparent magnitude ( ) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on earth . the brighter an object appears , the lower its magnitude value ( i.e . inverse relation ) . the sun , at apparent magnitude of −27 , is the brightest object in the sky . magnitude is a logarithmic measure . it is measured in a specific wavelength or passband , usually in optical or near-infrared wavelengths . a full moon is −13 magnitude and the brightest planet venus measures −5 . the brightest man-made objects , iridium flares , are ranked at −9 and the international space station measures −6 . the greek astronomer hipparchus first invented our system of apparent magnitude . he gave the brightest stars a magnitude of 1 and increased the numbers for dimmer stars . about 300 years later ptolemy of alexandria created an encyclopedia of stars based on hipparchus ' work . the persian astronomer al-sufi took ptolemy 's work and gave arabic names to the stars some 800 years later . medieval european astronomers simply translated al-sufi 's work into latin which is why many stars today have arabic names .
