Gibbs free energy     gibbs free energy is the available energy in a chemical reaction . it was calculated by josiah willard gibbs . systems want to achieve as low of a free energy state as possible . the gibbs free energy number is how far away the current system is from this state . it is analogous to a number line , with zero being the final state . scientists use gibbs free energy to determine the energy in a system that can be used . a negative gibbs number indicates that you can get energy out of the reaction . it is a favorable reaction , which means that the chemical `` wants '' to move towards its lower state . a positive gibbs number shows that you must put energy in to get energy out . an example can be seen in respiration . the gibbs value of one mole of glucose -686kcal . this means that we can get 686 kcal of energy from one mole of glucose . this means if we put in energy in respiration , we can theoretically get 686 kcal out of the mole of glucose . the equation for gibbs free energy is `` g ( p , t ) '' = '' u '' + '' pv '' âˆ’ '' ts .
