Heera Mandi     the heera mandi ( diamond market ) , also called shahi mohallah ( royal neighborhood ) , is a famous red-light district of the old taxali gate of lahore , pakistan . a red-light district is an area where prostitutes work . the heera mandi was first called the 'shahi mohallah ' or royal neighborhood in the 17th century . it was called that because many princes and nobles of the mughal dynasty used to come there . at that time there were only `` tawaifs '' ( dancing girls ) and courtesans there . they were there to amuse the people . during the rule of the sikh king ranjit singh , prostitution also was common . many brothels were opened there . ranjit singh renamed this place 'heera mandi ' . it was named for an officer , heera singh , who lived there . some historians think that he named it for the beautiful girls ( prostitutes ) who lived there . they were like precious diamonds . when the british raj came to power in this region , christian missionaries asked for the heera mandi to be moved away . they thought the activities there were 'sinful ' . the british government tried to move it , but they were forced to move it back because people did not like this idea . later , after the 1870s , the british also added some special brothels there for british soldiers . this area was made famous in rudyard kipling 's novel kim ( printed in 1901 ) .
