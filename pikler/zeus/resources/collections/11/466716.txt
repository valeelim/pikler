Latin poetry     latin poetry is the poetry of ancient rome . they started by adapting greek models . the verse comedies of plautus are the earliest surviving examples of latin literature . they were probably composed around 205–184 bc . there was a play written by a greek slave , livius andronicus , at rome in 240 bc . livius translated greek comedy for roman audiences . he used metres that were those of greek drama , but modified to the needs of latin . his successors , plautus and terence , continued this process . the traditional metre of greek epic poetry , the dactylic hexameter , was introduced into latin literature by ennius ( 239–169 bc ) . ennius provided a model for the later 'classical ' poets such as virgil and ovid . horace ( who was a contemporary of virgil ) wrote verses in dactylic hexameter . they were in a conversational style , as if writing a letter . virgil 's hexameters are regarded as `` the supreme metrical system of latin literature '' .
