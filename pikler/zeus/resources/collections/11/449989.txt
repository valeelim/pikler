Qianzhousaurus     qianzhousaurus is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs . so far only one species has been named : the type species `` qianzhousaurus sinensis '' . nicknamed 'pinocchio rex ' for its long snout in comparison to other known tyrannosaurs , it was discovered in southern china and first published in the journal `` nature communications '' in may 2014. apart from its signature snout , it also had long , narrow teeth , while `` t. rex '' had thick teeth and powerful , deep-set jaws . this suggest its feeding method and probably its life-style were quite different from `` tyrannosaurus '' . the thinner teeth and lighter skeleton of `` qianzhousaurus '' suggest it hunted smaller creatures , such as lizards and feathered dinosaurs . the bones were discovered by workmen at a construction site near the city of ganzhou , who then took them to a local museum . the discovery of `` qianzhousaurus '' , and `` alioramus '' from mongolia , shows that the long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widespread in asia . although we are only starting to learn about them , they were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in asia . their existence was previously suspected because of various scattered fossil finds . an expert says the find `` tells us pretty unequivocally that these long-snouted tyrannosaurs were a real thing . they were a different breed , living right to the end of the age of dinosaurs '' .
