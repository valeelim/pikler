Common wheat     common wheat ( `` triticum aestivum '' ) , also known as bread wheat , is a cultivated wheat species . about 95 % of the wheat produced is common wheat . common wheat has been got by many generations of artificial selection by farmers choosing the most productive plants which occurred in their crops . bread wheat is an allohexaploid , instead of the original two sets ( diploid ) . there are six sets of chromosomes , two sets from each of three different species.. free-threshing wheat is closely related to spelt wheat . as with spelt , genes from goatgrass ( `` aegilops tauschii '' ) give bread wheat greater cold hardiness than most wheats . it is cultivated throughout the world 's temperate zones . of the six sets of chromosomes , two come from einkorn wheat and two from `` aegilops speltoides '' . this hybridisation created the species `` triticum turgidum '' , 580820 thousand years ago . the last two sets of chromosomes came from `` aegilops tauschii '' , 230â€“430 thousand years ago .
