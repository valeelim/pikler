Chaohusaurus     chaohusaurus is an extinct genus of basal ichthyopterygian , or ichthyosaur , from the lower triassic of chaohu and yuanan , china . it was closer in time and form to `` cymbospondylus '' and `` mixosaurus '' than to more advanced genera like `` ichthyosaurus '' . it did not have the dolphin-like form of later ichthyosaurs , but it was fully aquatic . the tail fin is wide-based and short . the neck is rather long , whereas later ichthyosaurs have no neck . there is no dorsal fin . it was one of the smallest ichthyosaurs , about 70 to 180 cm long . its weight was about 10 kg . a recent study of `` chaohusaurus '' shows an early example of live birth . a remarkable feature was a baby close to emerging `` head-first '' . the authors comment : in other words , ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers . then , later , they adapted to an aquatic life .
