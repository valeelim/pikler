Contras     the contras is the name given to the rebel groups that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s . they were against the sandinista junta of national reconstruction government in nicaragua . among the separate contra groups , the nicaraguan democratic force ( fdn ) emerged as the largest by far . in 1987 , virtually all contra organizations were united , at least nominally , into the nicaraguan resistance . from an early stage , the rebels received financial and military support from the u.s. government . president ronald reagan supported the group . after the u.s. support was banned by congress , the reagan administration secretly gave them money from profit they gained after selling weapons to iran . these secret activities soon became known as the iran–contra affair . related pages . - iran-contra affair - isis - communism - cold war other websites . - confessions of a contra : how the cia masterminds the nicaraguan insurgency by `` the new republic '' , 5 august 1985 - `` the contras ' valley forge : how i view the nicaragua crisis '' , by enrique bermúdez ( with michael johns ) , `` policy review '' magazine , summer 1988 .
