Gideon Mantell     gideon algernon mantell mrcs frs ( lewes , 3 february 1790 â€“ london , 10 november 1852 ) was an english obstetrician , geologist and palaeontologist . mantell 's work on the structure and life of `` iguanodon '' began the scientific study of dinosaurs . in 1822 he was responsible for the discovery ( and the eventual identification ) of the first fossil teeth , and later much of the skeleton , of `` iguanodon '' . mantell 's work on the cretaceous of southern england was also important . his phrase the `` age of reptiles '' was significant . he recognised that reptiles were the dominant life-form in what we now call the jurassic and cretaceous periods . mantell did two things which were most important . he showed that the teeth of `` iguanodon '' meant it must be a herbivore , and its shorter front legs meant it could be bipedal ( walk on two legs ) . this was denied by richard owen , who did a good deal to hide mantell 's achievements . at the end of mantell 's life he suffered terribly from damage to his spine caused by an accident . he took an overdose of opium , which caused his death . it is not known whether he did this deliberately ; he took opium to dull the pain .
