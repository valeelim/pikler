Defensin     defensins are small cation proteins found in animals and plants . they are host defence peptides . they work against bacteria , fungi and many viruses . defensins have 18-45 amino acids including six to eight conserved cysteine residues . cells of the immune system have these peptides to help kill phagocytosed bacteria . those cells include neutrophil granulocytes and almost all epithelial cells . most defensins work by binding to the microbial cell membrane . once there , they make tiny holes in the membrane which allow vital ions and nutrients to leak out . related pages . - host defence peptide - lysozyme - innate immune system
