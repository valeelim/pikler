MIPS architecture     the mips architecture is an instruction set for computers that was developed at stanford university in 1981. at the start , mips was an acronym for microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages . most of it is done in risc . in a full risc architecture , all commands have the same length . this simplifies the design of the microchip and allows to use fast clock cycles . at the start , the architecture used a 32 bit bus , but from 1991 , a 64 bit architecture was used . in 2015 , mips implementations are primarily used in embedded systems such as windows ce devices , routers , residential gateways , and video game consoles such as the sony playstation , playstation 2 and playstation portable . until late 2006 , they were also used in many of sgi 's computer products . mips implementations were also used by digital equipment corporation , nec , pyramid technology , siemens nixdorf , tandem computers and others during the late 1980s and 1990s . in the mid to late 1990s , it was estimated that one in three risc microprocessors produced was a mips implementation .
