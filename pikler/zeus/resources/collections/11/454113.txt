Meju     meju is a brick of fermented soybeans in korean cuisine . it is used in korean cuisine to make essential condiments such as soy sauce ( kanjang ) , soybean paste ( doenjang ) and red chilli pepper paste ( gochujang ) . meju is produced by drying a brick of soybeans . the brick of soybeans is naturally fermented while it dries . there are several ways to make a brick of soybeans . traditionally , boiled soybeans were crushed in a mortar and made into a brick shape to be tied up with straw . `` meju '' was commonly made in any korean home in the past . condiments made with mejus all tasted different because the production of meju was not standardized . as many koreans now buy korean traditional condiments instead of making them , it is difficult to find the wide variety of unique tasting condiments made from homemade meju . the meaning of the word ‘ meju ’ originally included all condiments and seasonings made with meju . however , as another word ‘ jang ’ was used more frequently to refer to condiments made with meju , the meaning of the word ‘ meju ’ shifted to refer only to the stage before it is used in condiments . scholars believe the japanese word ‘ miso ’ which is similar to korean doenjang has the same origin as ‘ meju ’ .
