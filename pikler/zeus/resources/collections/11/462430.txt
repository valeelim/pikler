New Valley Project     the new valley project consists of building a number of canals , to be able to irrigate parts of the desert in egypt for the purpose of agriculture . the project was started in 1997. its main canal should cover a distance of . in 2012 , it was still away from the oasis it was supposed to reach . other problems of the project include the fact that the soil is very salty in the desert , and that there are underground aquifers , which are a problem for the canals . when the land is irrigated , the salt would mix with the aquifers and would reduce access to drinking water . the clay minerals found in the soil are posing technical problems to the big wheeled structures moving around autonomously to irrigate the land . often their wheels get stuck in a little bowl created by wet clay that dried , and the irrigation machines come to a standstill . the only objective met up to april 2012 is the diversion of water from lake nasser into what little of the sheikh zayed canal has been built .
