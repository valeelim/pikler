Blood substitute     blood substitute ( also called blood surrogate ) is the name for a number of substances that can perform some functions of blood . blood substitutes are often used in blood transfusions where real blood is not available . losing a lot of blood can mean there is not enough blood left to keep up the oxygen transfer to certain organs , or the brain . this state is a medical emergency , as it can lead to organ failure and death . blood substitutes can help in these situations . there are two basic types of blood substitutes : - liquids that act as blood thinners , but that do not have any physiological function - blood substitutes in the narrow sense , which can take the some of the functions of blood an oxygen-carrying blood substitute , or artificial haemoglobin , is an artificially made red substitute whose main function is to carry oxygen , as does natural haemoglobin . the first goal of oxygen carrying blood substitutes is just to mimic blood 's oxygen transport capacity . unfortunately , oxygen transport , one function that distinguishes real blood from other `` volume expanders '' , has been very difficult to reproduce .
