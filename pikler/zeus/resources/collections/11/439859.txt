Cementation     cementation is what makes rocks solid . it is the process where grains of sediment get stuck together . it is a chemical process , and the cement is a precipitate which crystallises in the spaces between the matrix of grains . silica ( sio ) and calcium carbonate ( caco ) are the most common types of cement . ions carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores : this is how `` sediment '' becomes `` rock '' . the new pore-filling minerals form `` bridges '' between original sediment grains , thereby binding them together . so `` sand '' becomes `` sandstone '' , and `` gravel '' becomes `` conglomerate '' . cementation occurs mainly below the water table . large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process . sedimentation does not always occur . many quarries used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones , just as if they came from a present-day beach . in england , most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the jurassic , 150+ million years ago . by chance , the conditions for cementation have never occurred there .
