Interdisciplinarity     interdisciplinarity is when two or more subjects ( academic disciplines ) join up . this happens when a problem overlaps traditional academic boundaries . other terms which mean almost the same thing are multidisciplinarity and crossdisciplinarity . an examples makes clear what is meant : - in order to investigate living cells , these subjects joined together : genetics , physics , chemistry , cytology . other examples include artificial intelligence , cultural studies , cybernetics , computational linguistics , biomedical engineering , and so on . physical chemistry , biochemistry and astrophysics must have been some of the first . in many universities , traditional departments ( e.g . botany , zoology ) were scrapped , and new broader departments like 'school of biological sciences ' were formed . inside this umbrella , research and teaching teams were based on interdisciplinary problems , such as ecology or cell division or earth history . there are some necessary specialities which do not fit easily into the new system . examples are taxonomy ( you still need people to identify animals ) and areas like parasitology and agricultural botany .
