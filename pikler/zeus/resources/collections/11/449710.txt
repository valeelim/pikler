Methanogen     methanogens are microorganisms which produce methane as a metabolic byproduct in anoxic conditions . they are archaea , a different domain from bacteria . they are common in wetlands , where they are responsible for marsh gas . they are also common in the digestive tracts of many animals , such as ruminants and humans . they are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans . in marine sediments methane is produced when sulfates are depleted , below the top layers . moreover , the methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments . others are extremophiles , found in environments such as hot springs and submarine hydrothermal vents as well as in the `` solid '' rock of the earth 's crust , kilometers below the surface . methanogens can convert acetic acid to methane in a fermentation process . do not confuse them with methanotrophs , which use up methane for their carbon and energy requirements .
