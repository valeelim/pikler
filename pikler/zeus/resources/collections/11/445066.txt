Dijkstra's algorithm    dijkstra 's algorithm dijkstra 's algorithm is an algorithm that works on groups of things connected by distances . it finds the shortest ways to move from one first thing to each other thing in the graph . it is faster than many other ways to do this , but it needs all of the distances connecting the things to be zero or more . steps . - make a list of all of the things in the graph - write 0 next to the first thing - keep doing these steps : - find the thing that you have not yet drawn a mark next to that has the smallest number written next to it - draw a mark next to this thing - do these steps for each other thing connected to this place : - add the number written next to this thing and the distance of the connection together - if the connected thing does not have a number written next to it , write the new number and the name of this thing next to the connected thing - if the connected thing has a number written next to it and the new number is smaller than the written number : - draw a line over what is already written
