Myosin     myosins are a group of specialized proteins used for muscle contraction and motion in eukaryotic cells . myosins need atp for energy to do these functions . a large number of different myosin genes have been discovered in eukaryotes . the structure and function of myosin is strongly conserved across species . for example , rabbit muscle myosin ii will bind to actin from an amoeba . most myosin molecules are composed of a head part , a neck part , and a tail part . - the `` head part '' grabs onto the actin , and uses energy from atp to pull , making the muscle shorter . - the `` neck part '' acts as a lever . - the `` tail part '' mostly interacts with other molecules or other myosin subunits . in some cases , the tail part may help regulate movement . many myosin molecules can make muscles get shorter using the energy released from breaking apart atp molecules into adp and a phosphate group . the power stroke happens when a phosphate that n broken off gets released from the myosin . this makes the myosin change shape so that it pulls against the actin . when the adp molecule is released and a new atp molecule joins onto the myosin head , the head releases from the actin . the myosin breaks the new atp and the cycle keeps going . the combined effect of all the power strokes from all the different myosin molecules makes the muscle get shorter .
