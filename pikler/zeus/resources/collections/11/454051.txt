Tribune of the plebs     tribunes of the plebs were important officials in ancient rome . the plebians ( plebs ) were the free roman people who were not patricians . the tribunes provided a balance between the power of the senate and the needs of the people . there were ten tribunes at any time , and they could act separately or together . these tribunes had the power to use the people 's assembly ( the concilium plebis ) to support the common people . they could summon the senate , propose legislation and intervene on the behalf of plebeians in legal matters . most important of all was the power to veto the actions of the consuls and other magistrates , to protect the interests of the plebeians . an assault on any plebian tribune was against the law . tribunes of the plebs were elected by the people 's assembly alone . they could be commoners , unlike all the other officials of the roman republic . their role lasted for about 800 years , but under the roman empire they did not have real powers . they were in origin and style , a working part of the roman republic .
