Pithovirus     pithovirus is a genus of giant virus which infects amoebae . it is a double-stranded dna virus , and is a member of the clade of large dna viruses . it was first described in 2014 after a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old ice core harvested from permafrost in siberia , russia . it is 50 % larger in size than the previous largest known viruses , but `` pandoravirus '' has the largest viral genome , containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of dna . `` pithovirus '' has a thick , oval wall with an opening at one end . internally , its structure resembles a honeycomb . the genome of `` pithovirus '' has 467 different genes , more than a typical virus but far less than `` pandoravirus '' . its genome is much less densely packed than any other known virus . two-thirds of its proteins are unlike those of other viruses . despite the physical similarity with `` pandoravirus '' , the `` pithovirus '' genome sequence shows that it is barely related to that virus . it more closely resembles members of some other virus families . these families all contain large icosahedral viruses with dna genomes . the `` pithovirus '' genome has 36 % gc-content , similar to the `` megaviridae '' , in contrast to greater than 61 % for pandoraviruses .
