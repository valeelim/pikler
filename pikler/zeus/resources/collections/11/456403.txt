Human skin colour     human skin colour is one of the most easily seen features of a person . it ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white . skin colour is inherited and is the result of natural selection . skin pigmentation in human beings evolved mainly to control the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin , thus reducing its effects . the single most important substance deciding human skin colour is the pigment melanin . melanin is produced within the skin by cells called melanocytes . the red colour underlying the skin becomes more visible in white skin , especially in the face . in physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system ( anger , fear ) , blood vessels expand . there is a direct relationship between uv radiation ( uvr ) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world . areas that have more uvr also have darker-skinned populations . areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of uvr , and lighter-skinned populations . human populations have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned as they left africa about 100,000 years ago , and some have changed back to darker skin as they returned to higher uv zones .
