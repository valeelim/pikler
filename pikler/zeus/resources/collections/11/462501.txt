Qutb Shah     qutb shah or qutub shah was a fictitious person , a folk hero who never existed in history but according to many stories and legends , he ruled in herat afghanistan sometime around 960 ad and then shifted to india . the actual story of a legendary ruler of herat , in afghanistan , was started much later in the 18th or 19th century by some punjabi tribes , like the awan tribe , khokhar , khattar and others . all these tribes were inter-linked and were of indigenous ( native ) indian hindu origins but they wanted to impress the colonial rulers of british india by claiming to be descended from an arab who came and settled in india , after ruling in afghanistan , so they made up a fictitious ancestor who was a 'hero ' and won many battles and then left afghanistan and came to india and married local hindu women , and had several children who founded these tribes . in 1860s to 1940s , a number of british rulers came to believe this story too and mentioned it in their books , but more recent historical research by prof ahmad hasan dani and others has confirmed that there never existed any person in recorded history by that name , at any time , either in afghanistan or northern india .
