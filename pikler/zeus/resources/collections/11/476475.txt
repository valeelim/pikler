Hendrik A. Lorentz     hendrik antoon lorentz ( 18 july 1853 – 4 february 1928 ) was a dutch physicist who shared the 1902 nobel prize in physics with pieter zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the zeeman effect . hendrik lorentz was born in arnhem , gelderland ( the netherlands ) , the son of gerrit frederik lorentz ( 1822–1893 ) . in 1862 , after his mother 's death , his father married luberta hupkes . in 1905 , einstein would use many of the concepts to write his paper entitled `` on the electrodynamics of moving bodies '' , known today as the theory of special relativity . because lorentz laid the fundamentals for the work by einstein , this theory was originally called the `` lorentz-einstein theory '' . lorentz was one of few scientists who supported einstein 's search for general relativity from the beginning – he wrote several research papers and discussed with einstein personally and by letter . for instance , he attempted to combine einstein 's formalism with hamilton 's principle ( 1915 ) . in january 1928 , lorentz became seriously ill , and died shortly after on february 4 .
