Wave equation     equations that describe waves as they occur in nature are called wave equations . waves as they occur in rivers , lakes , and oceans are similar to those of sound and light . the problem of having to describe waves arises in fields like acoustics , electromagnetics , and fluid dynamics . historically , the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by jean le rond d'alembert , leonhard euler , daniel bernoulli , and joseph-louis lagrange . in 1746 , d â€™ alambert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation , and within ten years euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation .
