Gippsland Lakes     the gippsland lakes are a network of lakes , marshes and lagoons in east gippsland , victoria , australia . they cover an area of about . the largest of the lakes are lake wellington , lake king and lake victoria . water enters the lakes from the avon , thomson , latrobe , mitchell , nicholson and tambo rivers . the gippsland lakes were formed by two main actions . the first was by silt from the rivers creating river deltas . the mitchell river created silt jetties which run into lake king for several kilometres . the second action was the sea in bass strait which created the ninety mile beach which blocked the rivers from reaching the sea . once the rivers were blocked the water level of the lakes would gradually rise . the water would finally break through the barrier beach and the level would drop to sea-level . eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin again . sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and it was not always in the same place as the last one .
