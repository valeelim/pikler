Selfish DNA     selfish dna is a term for sequences of dna that have two distinct properties : - the dna sequence spreads by forming additional copies of itself within the genome ; and - it makes no specific contribution to the reproductive success of its host organism . ( it may or may not have significant negative effects . ) in his 1976 book , `` the selfish gene '' , richard dawkins suggested the idea of selfish dna when the noncoding dna in eukaryotic genomes was discovered . in 1980 , two articles in the journal `` nature '' expanded and discussed the concept . according to one of these articles : normal genetically functional dna might be seen as `` replicating entities '' that effect their replication by manipulating the cell that they control . in contrast , units of selfish dna may exploit existing mechanisms in the cell , and multiply without affecting the fitness of the organism in other respects . there is no sharp boundary between the concepts of selfish dna and genetically functional dna . often it also is difficult to see if a unit of noncoding dna is functionally important or not ; or if important , in what way . what is more , it is not always easy to distinguish between some instances of selfish dna and some types of viruses .
