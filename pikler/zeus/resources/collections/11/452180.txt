Dumb Starbucks     dumb starbucks was a coffee shop opened by comedian nathan fielder . it was closed just after three days for not having a proper health license . because the shop was a parody making fun of the real starbucks company , fielder was able to use their logo . in a normal starbucks store , you will usually see a board with the beverages that you can purchase . but in dumb starbucks , it had the word `` dumb '' in front of the name of the beverage you would see at starbucks . for example , if you saw the vanilla latte at starbucks , in dumb starbucks , it would be called `` dumb vanilla latte '' . usually starbucks has some other items , such as music cds , but dumb starbucks also took the same music cd 's and wrote the word `` dumb '' in front of them . nathan fielder had planned to open another dumb starbucks in brooklyn , new york , but he did n't try to open one , even with health documents . many people have did not like fielder and his new parody . some people felt he was making fun of them being starbucks customers , others said his coffee was just terrible .
