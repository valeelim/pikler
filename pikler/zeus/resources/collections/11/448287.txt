Glacial lake     a glacial lake is a lake that is made as a glacier melts . the glacier erodes the land , and then as it melts , water fills the hole or space that has been created . near the end of the last glacial period , about 10,000 years ago , glaciers began to retreat . a retreating glacier often left behind large amounts of ice in hollows between drumlins or hills . as the ice age ended , these melted to create lakes . this can be seen in the lake district in northwestern england . glacial lakes are often surrounded other evidence of the glacier including drumlins , moraines , eskers , striations and chatter marks . the glaciers crush minerals in the rock as they pass over them . these minerals become sediment at the bottom of the lake , and some of the rock flour becomes suspended in the water . these minerals support a large population of algae , making the water look green . these lakes can be seen in aerial photos of landforms in : - canada - u.s. - russia - argentina - iceland - spain - new zealand
