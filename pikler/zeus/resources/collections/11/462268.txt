Clerk     a clerk is someone who writes . the word is derived from the greek `` κληρικός '' ( `` klērikos '' ) , meaning `` of the clergy '' . once only religious people could write , so a cleric meant a religious person . in early mediaeval courts , writing was mainly done by clergy because most men , including nobles , could not read . in a medieval context , the word `` clerk '' meant `` scholar '' . now almost everyone can read and write , but the term 'clerk ' still correctly applies to whole professions such as accountants , lawyers and civil servants . there is such a person as the clerk of the house of commons , and every court in england has a legally qualified clerk . their job is to keep the records , and run the behind-the-scenes business . related pages . - company clerk
