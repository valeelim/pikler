Pack (canine)    pack ( canine ) pack is the name given to canines , which live and hunt together . that means the dog tribe , known as the canini . it does not apply to foxes ( the tribe vulpini ) . other caniforms ( caniformia ) live singly or come together at mating times , with some exceptions ( like the badger ) . so , not all canids form packs . if they do , the size of the pack , and the social behaviour in the pack varies by species . the animals in the pack know each other . always there is a hierarchy of dominance inside the pack . the classic case is the grey wolf . all packs are united by genetic relationship : they are family members . one reason why some mammalian predators evolved group behaviour is that their prey lives in massive herds on grassland . the most notable predators on grassland are the wolves and jackals ( caniforms ) and the lions and hyaenas ( feliforms ) . the same principle works with aquatic predators : if their prey goes in shoals or family groups , then the predators go in groups . related pages . - collective animal behaviour
