Lubrication     lubrication is a physical process which allows surfaces to move smoothly against each other . a thin film of lubricant put between the surfaces reduces friction and wear on the surfaces , and keeps temperatures from rising too far . the lubricant film can be a solid/liquid dispersion , a liquid , a liquid-liquid dispersion ( a grease ) or , exceptionally , a solid or gas . examples are the use of oil in machinery , the function of tears in eyes and synovial fluid in joints . related pages . - lubricant
