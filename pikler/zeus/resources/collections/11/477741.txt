Water-mixable oil paint     water-mixable oil paint ( also called `` water soluble '' or `` water miscible '' ) is a modern type of oil paint . it is designed to be thinned and cleaned up with water . this avoids using turps ( turpentine ) , whose fumes may be harmful if inhaled , and is a fires risk . water miscible oil paint can be mixed and used with the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint . when it is still wet , it can be removed from brushes , palettes , and rags with ordinary soap and water . its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules , as in a solution . another advantage of this type of oil paint is that it dries faster than traditional oils ( but slower than acrylics ) . also , painters can control the speed of drying with supplementary products from artistic paint suppliers .
