Bergmann's rule    bergmann 's rule bergmann 's rule is an ecogeographic principle . it states that , within a widely distributed group of animals , the larger ones are found in colder environments , and the smaller ones are found in warmer regions . so , for example , with bears the largest member is the polar bear , and the smallest members are found in subtropical areas ( panda ) . the largest tiger is the siberian tiger . large mammals of the late ice age were in general larger than their descendants today . the rule is named after nineteenth-century german biologist carl bergmann , who described the pattern in 1847 , though he was not the first to notice it . bergmann 's rule appears to hold true for many mammals and birds , but there are exceptions . although originally put in terms of species , it seems to apply to populations within a species . bergmann 's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are endotherms , but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of ectothermic species .
