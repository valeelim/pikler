Naval fleet     a naval fleet is usually a permanent formation . fleets are generally assigned to a particular ocean or sea . many fleets are named after the particular ocean or sea they are assigned to . since 1942 the united states navy uses numbers to identify their fleets . a fleet is normally commanded by an admiral . usually his rank is admiral of the fleet . some fleets have been or are commanded by vice-admirals or even rear-admirals . most fleets are divided into several squadrons . each squadron is commanded by a subordinate admiral . those squadrons in turn are often divided into divisions . in the age of sail , fleets were divided into van , centre and rear squadrons . these were named after each squadron â€™ s place in the line of battle . in more modern times , the squadrons are typically composed of groups of the same class of warships . examples would be frigates or destroyers . since many smaller navies only contain a single fleet , the term `` the fleet '' usually means `` the navy '' .
