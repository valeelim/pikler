Sirius Passet     sirius passet is a special fossil site , a lagerstätte in greenland . it is from six places on the eastern shore of a fjord in the far north of greenland . it was discovered in 1984. about 10,000 fossil specimens have been collected so far . the fauna is just before that of the burgess shale , probably ten to fifteen million years older – 518 vs. 505 mya . the fauna includes some arthropods and sponges , and rare representatives of other groups . a polychaete annelid from the sirius passet was described in 2008. polychaete annelids are a significant part of the burgess shale fauna , but are otherwise unknown from the other early cambrian lagerstätten . this single species from a single place improves our knowledge of this group .
