R/K selection theory     r/k selection theory describes the way a species controls its number of offspring . r-selection species produce many offspring . k-selected species focus on a few . neither method is in itself superior , and they may occur in the same habitat ; e.g. , rodents ( r-selection ) and elephants ( k-selection ) . the theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s , but several studies criticized it . the study of life histories has replaced the r/k selection paradigm . the terminology of r/k-selection was coined by the ecologists robert macarthur and e.o . wilson , based on their work on island biogeography . study of the evolution of life history strategies actually has a longer history .
