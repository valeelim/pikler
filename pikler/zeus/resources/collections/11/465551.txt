Neanderthal 1     neanderthal 1 is the name of the first fossil found that was clearly identified as a neanderthal ( `` homo neanderthalensis '' ) . sometimes this fossil is also called feldhofer 1 , but that name is less common . it is not the first fossil found of a neanderthal , but before this find , the importance of the fossils was unclear . the fossil is part of a skull , with a fragment of the left temporal bone , part of the right scapula ( shoulder blade ) , the right clavicle , both humeri ( bones in the upper arm ) , one radius ( a bone in the forearm ) , both ulnae ( another bone in the forearm ) , five ribs , an almost complete half pelvis , and both femurs . studies done in 1999 included a radiocarbon dating of the bones : the bones were fouund to be about 39.900 Â± 620 years old . this means this neanderthal was from one of the last neanderthal populations in europe . in the 1990s and 2000s , bones from two other neanderhals were found nearby , they are called neanderthal 2 and neanderthal 3 respectively . neanderthal 2 has the same age , but a lighter build . neanderthal 3 was probably a teenager .
