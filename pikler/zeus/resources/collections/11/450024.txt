Lactation     lactation describes the secretion of milk from the breasts when a mother feeds her young . it occurs with almost almost all female mammals after the birth of their young . in humans the process is also called `` breastfeeding '' or `` nursing '' . in most species , milk comes out of the mother 's nipples . the platypus ( a non-placental or monotreme mammal ) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen . in only one species of mammal , the dayak fruit bat , is milk production a normal male function . milk production requires the hormones prolactin ( prl ) and oxytocin . the evolution of milk production made use of a feature which was present before modern mammals . the cells which produce milk were developed from the apocrine glands in the skin : meaning : since the skin of synapsids had glands in it , the development of milk production was possible . apart from food nutrients , mothers ' milk contains a range of antibodies which protect the baby until it develops its own immune system . when born , a baby has igg antibodies from across the mother 's placenta . its own immunoglobulin production takes about six months to develop after birth , so meantime the mother 's milk supplies iga as a stop-gap protection .
