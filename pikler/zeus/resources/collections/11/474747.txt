Electrolysis of water     electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen gas . this happens when an electric current being passed through the water . this technique can be used to produce breathable oxygen or hydrogen fuel . however , that method is more expensive than the industrial way to produce hydrogen fuel from natural gas . in pure water , a redox reaction can be watched . at the cathode a reduction happens and on the anode an oxidation . normally , the reaction is balanced with either an acid or a base as shown in the equations below . that two reactions are half reactions . they are balanced with an acid . commonly hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is used . however , the half reactions can also be balanced with a base , for example with sodium hydroxide . combining one pair of half reactions leads to an overall reaction , which is then the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen .
