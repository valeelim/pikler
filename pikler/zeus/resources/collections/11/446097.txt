Rapetosaurus     rapetosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur . it lived in what is now madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago , at the end of the cretaceous period . only one species , `` rapetosaurus krausei '' , has been found . like other sauropods , `` rapetosaurus '' was a quadrupedal herbivore . the discovery of `` rapetosaurus '' was the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton , complete with skull . it has helped to clarify some difficult issues in this large group of sauropod dinosaurs . it provides a baseline for the reconstruction of other titanosaurs that are known only from partial remains . by the early part of the upper cretaceous all sauropods , except the titanosaurs , were extinct . the titanosaurs were the dominant herbivores of the upper cretaceous on the southern continents which made up gondwana . their reign was cut short by the cretaceousâ€“paleogene extinction event . the specimen discovered was a juvenile . it is 8 metres ( 26 ft ) from head to tail , and `` probably weighed about as much as an elephant '' , according to kristina curry rogers . an adult would have been about twice as long ( 15 metres ( 49 ft ) in length ) , which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin , like `` argentinosaurus '' and `` paralititan '' .
