Keystone species     a keystone species is a species which has a big effect on its environment relative to its numbers . the ecosystem depends on them , and would be much changed if they were not there . this is because they affect many other organisms in the ecosystem . they affect the types and numbers of other species in the community . some sea stars ( e.g . `` pisaster ochraceus '' ) prey on sea urchins , mussels , and other shellfish that have no other natural predators . if the sea star is removed from the ecosystem , the mussel population explodes uncontrollably . this drives out most other species . the urchin population grows likewise , and destroys coral reefs . living coral reefs are the habitat for many hundreds of other species . some other examples of keystone species are the sea otter , horseshoe crab , and wolves . sea otters and kelp depend on each other . without the sea otter , sea urchins would destroy the kelp , and much else in the ecosystem .
