Sphynx cat     the sphynx is a breed of cat . it does not have much hair or fur on its body , but it is not truly hairless . the skin is soft because it has a fine layer of down . it may or may not have whiskers . the skin is the color the fur would be . this cat has all the same coat patterns found on other cats , such as a calico or tabby . the pattern is just seen on the sphynx skin . because they have no coat , they lose more body heat than cats with fur . this makes them feel warm when touched . they also like to seek sun or warm places because they are naturally cold . the sphynx was not the first hairless domestic cat . some were seen in other places around the world for at least 90 years . the sphynx breed began in 1966 , in toronto , when a hairless kitten , named prune , was born to a black and white shorthair cat , named elizabeth , in ontario , canada . the kitten was mated with its mother , so one more naked kitten was born . along with a few naked kittens found later , the hairless breed began . a natural birth of a sphynx cat happened on a minnesota farm . the owners found hairless kittens in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s . two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976 , named epidermis and dermis , were also an important part of developing the breed . more hairless cats were found in texas , arkansas , and minnesota . so , the modern sphynx breed began with the canadian cats and the minnesota cats .
