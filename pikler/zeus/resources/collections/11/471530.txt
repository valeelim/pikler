Common teal     the common teal ( `` anas crecca '' ) is a duck that lives in many places in europe and asia . it is sometimes called the eurasian teal . it mates in places where the weather is temperate ( not very hot and not very cold ) , but in winter it flies south to avoid the cold . people often call it simply the teal because it is the only kind of teal in most of the places where it lives . ( teal is also the name of a color between blue and green . the bird has this color around its eyes . ) when it is not starting a family , the teal likes to be with other teals . groups of teal may have a great many members . it often lives in places where the ground is very wet and the wind is usually not strong . it does not go under the water to find its food . instead , it stays on top of the water and eats seeds and bugs that live in the water . some scientists think that another kind of teal , the north american green-winged teal ( `` a. carolinensis '' ) , is a kind of common teal .
