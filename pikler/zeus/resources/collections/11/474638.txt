Index Librorum Prohibitorum     the index librorum prohibitorum ( ) was `` the index '' , a list of books banned by the catholic church . they were banned if the church thought they were heretical , anti-clerical ( anti-church ) or lascivious ( obscene ) . it was censorship by the catholic church . early versions of the index were published in catholic netherlands ( 1529 ) ; venice ( 1543 ) and paris ( 1551 ) . by mid-century , with wars of religion in france and germany , authorities thought control of the press could prevent the spread of heresy . this could be done by using a catalog of prohibited works , backed by ecclesiastic and civil authorities . the first version published in rome ( the `` pauline index '' ) was issued by pope paul iv in 1559. the 20th and final edition appeared in 1948 , and the `` index '' was formally abolished on 14 june 1966 by pope paul vi . the aim of the list was to protect the belief and morals of the faithful . this was done by preventing them from reading heretical and immoral books . books thought to contain such errors included works by astronomers such as johannes kepler 's `` epitome astronomiae copernicanae '' , which was on the index from 1621 to 1835 , and by philosophers , like immanuel kant 's `` critique of pure reason '' . the various editions of the `` index '' also had the rules of the church about the reading , selling and censorship of books . even editions and translations of the bible not been approved by the church could be banned .
