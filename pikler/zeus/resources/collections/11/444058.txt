Hyman Minsky     hyman philip minsky ( september 23 , 1919 â€“ october 24 , 1996 ) was an american economist , a professor of economics at washington university in st. louis . he gave an explanation of financial crises , caused by swings in a potentially fragile financial system . minsky is sometimes described as a post-keynesian economist because , like keynes , he supported some government intervention in financial markets . he opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s . he supported the federal reserve as a `` lender of last resort '' ( which means he thought it right for the fed to bail out banks which might go bust ) . he argued against too much private debt in the financial markets . minsky proposed theories were about the normal life cycle of an economy . he linked financial market fragility with speculative investment bubbles in financial markets . minsky claimed that in prosperous times , when companies make plenty of money , an irrational euphoria develops . soon debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their income , which produces a financial crisis . as a result , banks and lenders tighten credit , even to companies that can afford loans . then the economy contracts .
