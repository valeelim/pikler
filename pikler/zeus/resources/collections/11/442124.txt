Gum arabic     gum arabic , also known as acacia gum , or meska , is a natural gum . it is made of hardened sap from two species of acacia tree ; `` senegalia ( acacia ) senegal '' and `` vachellia ( acacia ) seyal '' . the gum is got from wild trees throughout the sahel from senegal to somalia . in the past it has also been cultivated in arabia and west asia . gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides . it was historically the source of the sugars arabinose and ribose , both of which were first discovered and isolated from it . acacia gum has been harvested in arabia , egypt , and west asia since antiquity , and sub-saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export . traditionally harvested by semi-nomadic desert tribes on their travels , acacia gum is a main export of several african nations . the hardened gum is collected in the middle of the rainy season ( harvesting usually begins in july ) , and exported at the start of the dry season ( november ) . from the 1950s to the early 1990s sudan did about 80 % of gum arabic production . today , the figure is under 50 % . hundreds of thousands of sudanese are dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods . it is still the world 's largest single producer , and the production of gum arabic is heavily controlled by the sudanese government .
