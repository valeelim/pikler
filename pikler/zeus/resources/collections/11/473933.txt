Apex predator     apex predators are predators with no natural predators of their own . they are at the top of their food chain . apex predators have big effects on the animals and plants lower down the food chain . if they become extinct in an area , many changes happen . in recent times , it is often humans who have removed top predators . an example of apex predators affecting an ecosystem is in yellowstone national park . after the gray wolf was reintroduced , in 1995 , researchers noticed big changes occurring in the greater yellowstone ecosystem . elk , the primary prey of the gray wolf , became less abundant and changed their behavior . this freed the riparian ( river ) zones from constant grazing . this allowed willows , aspens , and cottonwoods to grow , so creating a habitat for beaver , moose , and scores of other species . in addition to the effects on prey species , the gray wolf 's presence also affected the park 's grizzly bear , a vulnerable species . the bears , emerging from hibernation , chose to scavenge off wolf kills after fasting for months . they can also eat wolf kills in autumn to prepare for hibernation . as grizzly bears give birth during hibernation , a greater food supply may improve the mother â€™ s nutrition and increase the number of cubs . dozens of other species , including eagles , ravens , magpies , coyotes , and black bears , have been seen scavenging from wolf kills .
