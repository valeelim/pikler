Platypterygius     platypterygius ( 'flat flipper ) ' is an ichthyosaur of the family ophthalmosauridae . it was the last surviving ichthyosaur . fossils are known from australia , russia , united states of america , colombia , western europe and possibly new zealand . there are seven named species . both adults and juveniles have been unearthed , including newborns and pregnant females . like other ichthyosaurs , `` platypterygius '' gave live birth . `` platypterygius '' reached a length of about 7 m ( 23 ft ) . it had a long snout and a powerful finned tail . there are more digits in the front flippers than is usual in ichthyosaurs ; they are tightly bound in rows , giving a broad , flat appearance . this unusual characteristic gives the genus its name , meaning 'flat wing . ' furthermore , some of the wrist bones have disappeared entirely . cat scans on a juvenile specimen strongly suggest that `` platypterygius '' was deaf . `` platypterygius '' became extinct during the upper cretaceous , about 30 million years before the k/t extinction event . there was an ocean anoxic event at the cenomanianâ€“turonian stage boundary . the deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide ( hs ) . as life died off in the lower ( benthos ) levels of the sea , so did the predators at the top of the food chain . the last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinct .
