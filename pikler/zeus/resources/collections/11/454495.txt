Casting (fishing)    casting ( fishing ) in fishing , casting is the act of throwing bait or a lure using a fishing rod , reel , and line . several types of rod and reels are designed just for casting . the method of casting can vary but in each case the object of casting is to get the bait or lure to where the fish are . the most accurate type of cast is the 'overhead cast ' . the angler raises the rod ( and reel ) back behind the head , then quickly flicks the rod forward , releasing the line as the cast is completed . the 'side cast ' is less forceful but easier to learn . the rod is swung back in a horizontal motion then quickly moved forward releasing the line . both basic methods have variations . but both are popular when using spinning and casting rods . fly fishing uses similar movements , but the line release is different . all types of rods and reels need to match the weight rating of the rod , reel , line and lure for best performance . anyone can learn to cast a lure with a spinning rod and reel in just a few minutes . two types of spinning reels , open faced and close faced . they work differently . with a closed face reel a push-button his held down and released at the end of the cast . open face reels require the angler to first open the bail , then hold and release the line with your forefinger as you cast . open faced reels have a disadvantage when casting short distances . short casts causes the line to twist . this in turn causes line tangles on the spool . spinning rods and reels work best using light line and light lures . spinning reels have an advantage over casting reels when casting into the wind .
