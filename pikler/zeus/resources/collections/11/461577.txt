Biological pigment     biological pigments are pigments which are chemical colours . the colours of plants and animals have various functions . chlorophyll is the green pigment used to collect light energy for photosynthesis in plants . many colours on plants and animals work to change the behaviour of animals . they can be seen , and they act as a means of camouflage , warning or attraction ( pollination ; mating ) . the common dark pigment melanin often has the function of protection against sunlight ( ultraviolet radiation ) . pigments are different from structural colors . pigments look the same from all angles . structural color is the result of reflection or iridescence . for this reason , structural colors look different from different viewing angles . as an example , the wings of butterflies commonly use structural color .
