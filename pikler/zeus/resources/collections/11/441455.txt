Kessler Syndrome     kessler syndrome ( or an ablation cascade ) is a thought-up situation made by the nasa scientist donald j. kessler in which the amount of space debris in orbit is large enough to cause space collisions to happen often . this would make space mostly unusable for years if it happened at an extreme level . there is a satellite in orbit that is large and inactive , making it count as space debris , but it is in an orbit with a large amount of space debris . two known objects get within 200m of it every year . this could cause a lot of space debris , inducing a domino effect with more collisions . satellite manufacturers must demonstrate that their satellite can safely destroy itself or boost itself into a higher or lower orbit , known as a graveyard orbit , to avoid keeping unused satellites in common orbits for other satellites . related pages . - space debris - `` gravity '' ( movie ) , a 3d movie showing space debris and a form of kessler syndrome .
