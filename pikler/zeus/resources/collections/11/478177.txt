Hydrogen ion     hydrogen ion is recommended by iupac as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes . depending on the charge of the ion , there are two types : positively charged ions and negatively charged ions . when hydrogen loses its electron , the cations can be formed : - hydron : general name referring to the positive ion of any hydrogen isotope ( h ) - proton : h ( i.e . the cation of protium ) - deuteron : h , d - triton : h , t the ions produced by the reaction of these cations with water , as well as their hydrates , are also called 'hydrogen ions ' . in connection with acids , `` hydrogen ions '' usually refers to hydrons . hydrogen anions are formed when additional electrons are acquired : - hydride : general name referring to the negative ion of any hydrogen isotope ( h ) - protide : h - deuteride : h , d - tritide : h , t
