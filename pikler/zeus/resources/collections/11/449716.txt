Selfie     a selfie is a self-portrait photograph . it is typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone . selfies are often shared on social networking services such as instagram , snapchat , and tumblr . they are often casual , and are typically taken either with a camera held at arm 's length or in a mirror . some people use a `` selfie stick '' to hold the camera . one of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by robert cornelius , an american photographer . the term `` selfie '' was first used by photographer jim krause in 2005. a black crested macaque ( `` macaca nigra '' ) snatched a camera , and took a photo of herself . the selfie seemed to establish a legal precedent when the wikimedia foundation rejected a copyright claim . the ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright , and the camera owner had not taken the photo , and so also could not own the copyright . therefore the photo was not under copyright .
