Algebraic geometry     algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying polynomial equations . modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra , especially commutative algebra , with the language and the problems of geometry . the main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties , which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations . examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are : plane algebraic curves , which include lines , circles , parabolas , ellipses , hyperbolas , cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates , and cassini ovals . a point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation . basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points , the inflection points and the points at infinity . more advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations .
