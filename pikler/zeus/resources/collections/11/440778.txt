Sensory memory     sensory memory ( sm ) is an automatic response , not under conscious control . it deals with the input from the senses . the information people received which is stored in sensory memory is just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory . the information in sm is the `` raw data '' of a person 's overall sensory experience . there are four common features to all forms of sm : 1. the formation of a sm trace is independent of attention to the stimulus . 1. the information stored in sm is modality specific . this means for example , that echoic memory is only for storing auditory information , and haptic memory is only for storing tactile information . 1. each sm store has an immense amount of detail . 1. each sm trace is very brief and lasts a very short period of time . once the sm trace has decayed or is replaced by a new memory , the information stored is no longer accessible and is ultimately lost . the sm is made up of stores of different kinds of information . each has different rates of information processing and decay . genetics also plays a role in sm capacity .
