Kanjar     the kanjar are a nomadic tribe or group of people of north india , kashmir and pakistan . the mirasi tribes are also probably related to them . these people are also sometimes called by the names of nath , banchra and gashtay . these names are not nice ones , they mean to show that these people are inferior . in old times , most of the kanjar people used to live in jungles or forests . they used to hunt wild animals to eat and also keep some goats , cows and water buffaloes for their meat and milk . many of them still live like nomads , moving from place to place but some have started to live in towns and cities . some of them are hindu and some are muslims . they are mostly very poor people and do all the dirty jobs that rich people wo n't do . in lahore , pakistan , and in parts of kashmir , many kanjar women are sold by their families to become prostitutes . they go and live in brothels in the heera mandi . many men will go there to have sex with these poor women for money , but no one will marry them . they think they are 'unclean ' or bad .
