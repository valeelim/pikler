Bay of Pigs Invasion     the bay of pigs invasion was an attempt in 1961 ( during the cold war ) to remove fidel castro from power in cuba . the cia trained cuban exiles and these exiles launched an attack in a bay called the bay of pigs . the invasion was a failure and most of the attackers were captured or killed . there were several conflicts that led to this ; including a lack of promised air support and a change in where the landing was to be launched . this was one of many unsuccessful attempts by the cia to rid cuba of castro . one interesting fact is that the plan was originally put in motion by eisenhower , but the attack was ordered by john f. kennedy who only found out about the plan after his election . related pages . - cuban missile crisis
