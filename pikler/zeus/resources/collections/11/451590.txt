Golden mole     golden moles are small , insectivorous burrowing mammals native to southern africa . they form the family chrysochloridae . they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles . they look alike because of convergent evolution . the golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the marsupial moles of australia . they live almost exclusively underground , beneath grassland , forest , swamps , deserts , or mountainous terrain . like several other burrowing mammals with similar habits , they have short legs with powerful digging claws , very dense fur that repels dirt and moisture , and tough skin , particularly on the head . their eyes do not work , and covered with skin and fur . the ears are just tiny openings and , like the marsupial moles , they have an enlarged leather-like pad to protect their nostrils . their main sense is that of touch , and they are particularly sensitive to vibrations that may indicate approaching danger .
