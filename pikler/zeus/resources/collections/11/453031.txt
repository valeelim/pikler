Gender selection     gender selection ( or sex selection ) is the attempt to control the gender of human offspring . it can be done either before or after the fertilisation of the egg . it has been promoted by the term family balancing . in certain countries , particularly china , nepal and india , sons are often preferred to daughters . in the united states , slightly more americans preferred boys to girls . the methods used for gender selection are of two main types . one occurs before fertilisation by making sure there are more sperms with a y chromosome ( which produce a male ) . the other acts after fertilisation by selecting only male embryos to develop . the ericsson method uses the extra weight of sperms carrying the x chromosome . they swim slower than the lighter sperms with the y chromosome . this test tube method increases the chance of having a boy from just over 50 % to just over 70 % . the method is called 'sperm sorting ' . the `` in-vitro '' fertilisation uses ovarian stimulation to cause the mother to produce a number of eggs . the eggs are fertilised in the laboratory by the father 's sperm . then the sex of embryos is discovered by taking a single cell from the ball of cells which has divided after fertilisation . one or more male embryos are then implanted in the mother 's womb so they will develop .
