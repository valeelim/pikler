Megazostrodon     megazostrodon is an early proto-mammal , discovered in lesotho , southern africa . it is one of the first mammals , and appeared in the fossil record about 200/205 million years ago ( mya ) . it did have some non-mammalian characteristics , but overall this animal , and `` morganucodon '' , probably show the final stage of the transition between the cynodonts and true mammals . it is thought that the animal was nocturnal as it had a relatively much larger brain than its cynodont relatives , and the enlarged areas of its brain were found to be those which process sounds and smells . nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat . from their size and teeth , `` megastrozodon '' were probably insectivores , as were all its relatives at the time . their small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation , which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur . the night-time behaviour and insectivorous habits gave these early mammals a niche which did not compete with the reptiles .
