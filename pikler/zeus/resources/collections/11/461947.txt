Principal photography     principal photography is the part of movie making when a movie is being filmed . it is after pre-production and before post-production . principal photography is usually the most expensive part of movie making . this is partly because the cost includes salaries for the actors and crew . it is also because some movie scenes are expensive if they include special props or special effects that are done on the set . feature movies usually have insurance when principal photography starts . this is in case something happens that makes the movie cost more to make . for example , if one of the actors dies before filming all his or her scenes , the scenes might have to be filmed again with a different actor . if sets or finished parts of the movie are destroyed , it might even be impossible to finish the movie .
