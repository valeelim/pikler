Wall cloud     wall clouds ( or pedestal clouds ) are localized , large and persistent lowering cloud formations that develop below the rain-free region of thunderstorms . rotating wall clouds are indicative of mesocyclones in thunderstorms . wall clouds do not always rotate , though . wall clouds are formed by a process known as entrainment , when an inflow of warm , moist air rises and overpowers rain-cooled air during a downwind downdraft .
