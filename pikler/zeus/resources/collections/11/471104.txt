Iceland hotspot     the iceland hotspot is a geologic hotspot . it is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the island of iceland . iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world . on iceland , there are volcanic eruptions about every three years . in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around iceland . about a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history were produced by icelandic eruptions . notable eruptions have included that of eldgjá , a fissure of katla , in 934 ( the world 's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed ) , and laki in 1783 ( the world 's second largest ) . in many places , iceland is covered by glaciers . several eruptions under ice caps have burst through the ice . the most recent one was in 2010 after the eruption of eyjafjallajökull . iceland 's position over the mid-atlantic ridge is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity . it is not understood why iceland is an island , but the rest of the ridge consists of seamounts , with peaks below sea level .
