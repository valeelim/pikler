Non-coding DNA     non-coding dna sequences are those parts of an organism 's dna that do not code for protein sequences . some non-coding dna is transcribed into functional non-coding rna molecules ( e.g . transfer rna , ribosomal rna , and regulatory rnas ) , while others are not transcribed or give rise to rna transcripts of unknown function . the amount of non-coding dna varies greatly among species . for example , over 98 % of the human genome is noncoding dna , while only about 2 % of a typical bacterial genome is non-coding dna . initially , a large proportion of non-coding dna had no known biological function . it was known as `` junk dna '' , particularly in the press . however , it has been known for years that many non-coding sequences are functional . these include genes for functional rna molecules and dna sequences such as `` start replication '' signals , centromeres , and telomeres . other noncoding sequences have likely , but not yet discovered , functions . this is inferred from the high levels of sequence similarity seen in different species of dna .
