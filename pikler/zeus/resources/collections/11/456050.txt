Compliance (medicine)    compliance ( medicine ) in medicine , compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor , and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed . compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases . worldwide , non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care . in 2003 , the world health organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations . in particular , low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma , diabetes , and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions . compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature , as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a `` real-world '' setting . some drugs are difficult to take , because they must be taken at a specific time or interval ; sometimes , several drugs must be taken together . this is seen as a major obstacle to compliance . other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated , or they see side-effects that they were not told about , the drugs costing a lot of money , poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider . efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging , providing effective medication reminders , improving patient education , and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time .
