Benign neonatal seizures     benign neonatal seizures are somewhat rare syndromes ( medical problems ) which cause `` seizures '' in newborn infants . a seizure is caused by problems in the electrical activity in the brain . one syndrome is `` benign idiopathic neonatal seizures '' ( bins ) and the other is `` benign familial neonatal seizures '' ( bfns ) . both syndromes usually happen in infants in the neonatal period , which is the first 28 days after birth . in most cases , the first seizure happens within the first few days after birth . however , some infants may have their first seizure later in the neonatal period , or even months after the neonatal period . the last seizure usually happens while the infant is still in the neonatal period , but seizures may continue after this time . a third syndrome called `` benign familial neonatal-infantile syndrome '' ( bfnis ) . it may cause the first seizure between the second day upwards to 6 months after birth , and usually stops within the first 12 months . these syndromes are called `` '' benign '' because they usually cause no long-term harm to the infant , but there is a greater chance of getting seizures later in life .
