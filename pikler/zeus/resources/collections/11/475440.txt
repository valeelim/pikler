Lateralization of brain function     the human brain has two halves , called the left and right hemispheres . these two halves of the brain are not exactly alike . for most tasks , both sides of the brain work together . but each side of the brain specializes in some things and works harder on those things than the other side . the term brain lateralization , or lateralization of brain function , means that the different halves do things differently . a deep groove called the longitudinal fissure separates the brain into its two hemispheres ( halves ) . the two hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum , a bundle of nerve fibers . the corpus callous allows the right and left hemispheres to communicate with each other , and to work together . both the left and right hemispheres look and work in similar ways . the large parts of both hemispheres are exactly the same on both sides . but in the smaller parts , there are some differences . sometimes , the brain is different for left-handed and right-handed people . for example , there are two areas in the brain that are very important for speech : broca 's area and wernicke 's area . these two areas are in the left hemisphere for about 95 % of right-handed people , but only about 70 % of left-handed people .
