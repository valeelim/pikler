Suicide risk assessment     a suicide risk assessment ( sra ) is used to decide an individual 's suicide risk ( how likely they are to kill themselves ) . this is a very important first step in helping a person who is thinking of killing themselves . it is best done by a mental health professional , like a counselor . a good , complete risk assessment can lead to a person getting the treatment and help they need , which can reduce or end suicidal symptoms . the first part of an sra is talking to a doctor - or other trained mental health worker - who asks specific questions about what the person is thinking about , how they feel , and what is going on in their life . ( this is called a clinical interview ) . the second part of the sra uses one or more tests that have been proven to measure suicide risk . these tests are called `` scales . '' a scale is a way of measuring something . some of these scales have been shown to be very reliable , such as the suicidal affect-behavior-cognition scale ( sabcs ) and the columbia-suicide severity rating scale ( c-ssrs ) .
