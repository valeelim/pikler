Cyclostome     the cyclostomes ( or cyclostomata ) are the lamprey and hagfish . they are the only two living jawless fish , the agnatha . recent molecular data from rrna , and from mtdna , show that these living agnathans are monophyletic . there are about 100 species . hagfish are vertebrates but do not have vertebrae . it is believed that they lost their vertebrae during their lifestyle adaptations . the name cyclostomata means `` round mouths '' . their mouths can not close due to the lack of a jaw , so they have to constantly cycle water through the mouth .
