Cooperative binding     cooperative binding is when the number of small molecules binding to a macromolecule depends on the concentration of those small molecules around the macromolecule . this is a type of molecular binding , which is where molecules attach to each other in a stable way without decaying or breaking that bond rapidly . a popular example of cooperative binding is between haemoglobin and oxygen . in the lungs , there is a very high concentration of oxygen in the alveoli of the lungs . so the oxygen bonds to haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin . when this travels around the body in the blood and reaches areas of low oxygen concentration , the oxygen is released from the haemoglobin . other websites . - khan academy-haemoglobin
