Independence (statistics)    independence ( statistics ) probability theory talks about events which occur with a given ( possibly unknown ) probability . usually , when it talks about several events occurring , it assumes that if one event occurs , this does not change the probablility of the other events occurring . abraham de moivre wrote : `` two events are independent , when they have no connexion one with the other , and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other .
