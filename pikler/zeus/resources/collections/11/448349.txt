Trophic state index     the trophic state index ( tsi ) is a measure of how much nutrient , such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in a lake , or other body of water . nutrients increase plant growth , and raise the trophic levels . the tsi can be used to make an estimate of the biological condition of a lake . carlson 's index is a trophic state index . it is used by the united states environmental protection agency . the `` trophic state '' is the total weight of biomass in a given water body at the time of measurement . the carlson index uses the algal biomass to classify a lake 's trophic status . three variables are used to work out the carlson index : `` chlorophyll pigments '' , `` total phosphorus '' and `` secchi depth '' . chlorophyll is the most accurate measure , as it is the best predictor of biomass . phosphorus may be better in summer . secchi depth is the least accurate measure , but it is the cheapest and easiest to use . it measures how clear the water is . this shows how much dissolved and particulate material is in the water . this can be used to work out the biomass .
