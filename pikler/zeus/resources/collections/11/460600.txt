Buttered cat paradox     the buttered cat paradox is a popular joke based on putting two adages ( sayings ) together to make them funny : - cats always land on their feet . - buttered toast always lands buttered side down . the paradox happens when one asks this question : what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast ( butter side up ) to the back of a cat , then dropped the cat from a large height ? in reality , cats can turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down . this is named the cat righting reflex . this reflex lets them land on their feet if dropped from high enough up ( about ) . toast , not being alive , does not have the ability to turn itself over . nor does it want to , since it can not think . toast usually lands on the floor butter-side-down . this is because of how it is dropped from a table . as the toast falls from the table , it rotates or turns . using the average speed of rotation for a slice of toast as it falls from the table and the usual height of a table , a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor 81 % of the time . this is because the buttered side is heavier . when an object has a heavy and light side , in most cases it will fall heavy side first .
