Address Resolution Protocol     address resolution protocol ( arp ) is a network layer protocol used to convert an ip address into a physical address ( called a dlc address ) , such as an ethernet address . a host wishing to obtain a physical address broadcasts an arp request onto the tcp/ip network . the host on the network that has the ip address in the request then replies with its physical hardware address . there is also reverse arp ( rarp ) which can be used by a host to discover its ip address . in this case , the host broadcasts its physical address and a rarp server replies with the host 's ip address .
