Least common multiple     the least common multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer between all the multiples of both . it is usually denoted by lcm ( `` a '' , `` b '' ) . likewise , the lcm of more than two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them . the lcm is known in elementary arithmetic as the `` least common denominator '' ( lcd ) that must be calculated before fractions can be added , subtracted or compared . a multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer . for example , 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10 , so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2 , it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. by the same principle , 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and 2 as well . it is known that : this formula is often used to compute the lcd , once known the gcd of `` a '' and `` b '' . related pages . - greatest common divisor
