Dinosaur renaissance     dinosaur renaissance is a term coined in a 1975 issue of `` scientific american '' by robert bakker to describe the renewed interest in paleontology . this has lasted from the 1970s to the present . it was caused by a great increase in dinosaur discoveries , and by new ideas of how they lived . the `` renaissance '' , a word which means `` rebirth '' , changed how dinosaurs pictured both by professional illustrators , and in the public eye . john ostrom 's 1964 discovery of `` deinonychus '' is one of the most important fossil finds . `` deinonychus '' was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its `` terrible claw '' . evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail , making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running . one conclusion was that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism , and so in some cases were warm-blooded . this was popularized by ostrom 's student robert bakker . the impression of dinosaurs as being slow , cold-blooded , small-brained reptiles needed to be rethought , at least for some of the carnivores .
