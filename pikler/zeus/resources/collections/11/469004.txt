Relational model     the relational model for database management is a database model based on first-order predicate logic . edgar f. codd proposed it in 1969. in the relational model of a database , all data is represented in terms of tuples , grouped into relations . a database organized in terms of the relational model is called relational database . the purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries : users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it . the structure in which the data is stored , and the task of responding to users ' requests and retrieving the data is left to the database system , and is not visible to the user . most relational databases use the sql data definition and query language ; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model . a `` table '' in an sql database schema corresponds to a predicate variable ; the contents of a table to a relation ; key constraints , other constraints , and sql queries correspond to predicates . today , many database systems are different from the original model . codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles .
