Hypodermic needle model     the hypodermic needle model ( also known as the magic bullet theory or the direct effects model ) is an early theory of mass communications . the theory stated that the mass media had direct influence over audiences by `` injecting '' their minds with information . according to this theory media messages are powerful forces and audiences are powerless to resist them . the theory was popular during the 1940s and 1950s . ideas about the power of the mass media were based on historical events . one was the role played by the hearst newspapers in getting public support for the spanish-american war . another was the powerful nazi propaganda campaigns by joseph goebbels in world war ii . still another was the idea of a powerful madison avenue advertising influence on consumer buying and voting . later researchers determined the theory was just too simple and too general to be accurate . most modern media scholars think the theory is mostly false . however , many americans still believe the mass media has unlimited power to control people 's minds . in effect they believe the myth that if the mass media tells people to jump , the only question will be how high .
