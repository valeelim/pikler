Gram staining     gram staining ( or gram 's method ) is a way of classifying bacteria into two large groups : gram-positive and gram-negative . the name comes from its inventor , hans christian gram . gram 's method stains bacteria according to the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls . first , a violet dye is put on the bacteria . this dye stains peptidoglycan , a thick layer that is only found in gram-positive bacteria . after the first stain , another stain ( usually safranin or fuchsin ) gives all gram-negative bacteria a red or pink colour . the gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism . however , not all bacteria can be classified by this technique . bacteria for which the method does not work are called 'gram-variable ' or 'gram-indeterminate ' . gram developed the technique working with another scientist , carl friedl√§nder in a hospital in berlin . however , gram first used the test to make bacteria in the lungs easier to see . he published his finished method in 1884 .
