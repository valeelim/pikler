Prickly pear     the prickly pear is opuntia : a genus in the cactus family , cactaceae . the genus is named after the ancient greek city of opus . there , according to theophrastus , an edible plant grew which could be propagated by rooting its leaves . prickly pears ( mostly `` opuntia stricta '' ) were originally imported into australia in the 18th century for gardens . they were later used as a natural agricultural fencing . they quickly became a widespread invasive weed . they changed of farming land into an impenetrable green jungle of prickly pear , in places high . in 1919 , the australian federal government established the commonwealth prickly pear board to coordinate efforts with state governments to eradicate the weed . early attempts at mechanical removal and poisonous chemicals failed , so in a last resort , biological control was attempted . there is a moth , `` cactoblastis cactorum '' , from south america , whose larvae eat prickly pear . it was introduced in 1925 and rapidly reduced the cactus population . a memorial hall in chinchilla ( queensland ) commemorates the moth . this is one of the earliest known examples of the biological control of pests .
