Loop antenna     a loop antenna is a radio antenna consisting of at least one loop of wire , tubing , or other electrical conductor with its ends connected to a balanced transmission line . within this physical description two different antenna designs are common : the small loop ( or `` magnetic loop '' ) with a size much smaller than a wavelength , and the resonant loop antenna with a circumference approximately equal to the wavelength . small loops have a poor efficiency and are mainly used as receiving antennas at low frequencies . except for car radios , almost every am broadcast receiver sold has such an antenna built in or directly attached to it . these antennas are also used for radio direction finding . in amateur radio , loop antennas can be used where larger antennas would be inconvenient , unsightly , or banned because of size . loop antennas are relatively easy to build . a small loop antenna , also known as a magnetic loop , generally has a circumference of less than one tenth of a wavelength , in which case there will be a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor . as the frequency or the size is increased , a standing wave starts to develop in the current , and the antenna starts to acquire some of the characteristics of a resonant loop ( but is not resonant ) ; for this reason , these intermediate cases can not be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small and resonant loop antennas described below .
