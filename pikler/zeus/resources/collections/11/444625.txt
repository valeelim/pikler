Blue shift     blue shift is one example of the doppler effect . it is the opposite effect to redshift . doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer . the term applies to any decrease in wavelength caused by relative motion , even outside the visible spectrum . the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel . doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion : - the andromeda galaxy is moving toward our own milky way galaxy within the local group . when observed from earth , its light shows a blueshift . - components of a binary star system will be blueshifted when moving towards earth - when observing spiral galaxies , the side spinning toward us will have a slight blueshift `` relative to '' the side spinning away from us . - blazars may emit relativistic ( near the speed of light ) jets toward us that appear blueshifted . - nearby stars such as barnard 's star are moving toward us , resulting in a very small blueshift .
