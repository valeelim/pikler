Zero-point energy     zero-point energy is the energy of the vacuum space , the space between the subatomic particles within atoms . there are a few theories about how much energy there is in that space . there is the theory that there is an incredibly small , very near-zero amount , the theory that there is zero energy there , the theory that the amount of energy is indeterminable , and the theory that a cubic centimetre of vacuum has a few levels of magnitude more energy than would be required to create the big bang . if you look at the way physics is going , there are atoms , then there are subatomic particles making up atoms ( e.g . electrons , protons , neutrons ) , then further subatomic particles making up those subatomic particles ( e.g . quarks , gluons ) , and now there is string theory . string theory says that those smallest subatomic particles are made of vibrating strings of energy , and that those strings have practically no actual width whatsoever . so all the matter of the universe could be compressed into an extremely small space , hence the big bang theory . if this is the case , the large energy interpretation of zero-point energy seems likely .
