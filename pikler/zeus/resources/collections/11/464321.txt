Diffuse axonal injury     diffuse axonal injury ( often shortened to dai ) is one of the most common forms of traumatic brain injury . in traumatic brain injury , the damage is focused to one area of the brain , in diffuse axonal injury , the damage occurs over a larger area of the brain . dai mainly damages white matter , which makes it one of the major causes of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after head trauma . it occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma . frequently , people suffering such damage fall into a coma ; over 90 percent of the patients with severe dai never regain consciousness . those who do wake up often remain significantly impaired . other authors state that dai can occur in every degree of severity from ( very ) mild or moderate to ( very ) severe . concussion may be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury .
