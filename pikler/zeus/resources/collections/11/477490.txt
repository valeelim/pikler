Lateral inhibition     in neurobiology , lateral inhibition is the ability of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors . it stops action potentials from spreading in the lateral direction . it is called lateral inhibition as it stops ( inhibits ) neighboring neurons from firing . this creates a contrast in stimulation . this increases perception . for example , in vision , it helps in differentiating edges . it occurs primarily in visual processes . but it has also been seen in tactile , auditory , and even olfactory processing . cells that use lateral inhibition are mainly present in cerebral cortex and thalamus . they make up lateral inhibitory networks ( lins ) . artificial sensory systems have artificial lateral inhibition built in them . examples are vision chips , hearing systems , and optical mice .
