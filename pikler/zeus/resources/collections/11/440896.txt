Holocene calendar     the holocene calendar , also called the holocene era human era or ( he ) , is a year numbering system that adds 10,000 years to the currently used `` anno domini '' ( ad ) or common era ( ce ) system . it places the first year near the beginning of the holocene epoch and the neolithic revolution . people who like the human era system say that it makes for easier geological , archaeological , dendrochronological and historical dating . they say that it is based on an event more important than the birth of jesus . the current year of 2017 ad can be made into a holocene year by adding the number `` 1 '' before it , making it 12017 he . the `` human era '' was first thought of by the scientist cesare emiliani in 1993 ( 11993 he ) . cesare emiliani 's reasons for wanting a new calendar include : - in the `` anno domini '' system the birth of jesus represents the year 1. people now think jesus was born four years later . - the years bc are counted down when moving from past to future , making calculation of lengths of time difficult .
