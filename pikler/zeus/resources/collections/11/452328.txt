Chi-squared test     chi-squared test ( or formula_1 test ) is a statistical hypothesis test . it usually tests the hypothesis that `` the experimental data does not differ from untreated data '' . that is a null hypothesis . the distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true . the test results are regarded as 'significant ' if there is only one chance in 20 that the result could be got by chance . there are three main groups of tests : - tests for distribution check that the values follow a given probability distribution . - tests for independence check that the values are independent ; if this is the case , no value can be left out without losing information . - tests for homogeneity : these check that all samples taken have the same probability distribution , or are from the same set of values .
