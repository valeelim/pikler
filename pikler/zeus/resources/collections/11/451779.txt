Coracle     the coracle is a small , lightweight boat . they were used in wales , parts of western and south west england , ireland , and scotland the word is also to describe similar boats from india , vietnam , iraq and tibet . the word `` coracle '' comes from the welsh word `` cwrwgl . '' this is related to the irish and scottish gaelic word `` currach . '' it is recorded in english as early as the 16th century . other old english spellings include `` corougle '' , `` corracle '' , `` curricle '' and `` coricle '' . corricles are oval in shape , and look like half a walnut shell . they are made with a framework of split willow branches , twisted together and tied with willow bark . originally the outer layer was an animal skin from a horse or bullock . these skins were covered with a thin layer of tar to make them keep the water out . today coracles are made with calico or canvas covered in tar , or simply fibreglass . the asian coracle is made differently . it uses bamboo and the water is kept out with a layer of resin and coconut oil . the coracle does not have a keel . the flat bottom allows the weight of the boat and its load to be spread evenly . this means it does not need much water to float â€“ as little as a few inches , making it ideal for use on rivers .
