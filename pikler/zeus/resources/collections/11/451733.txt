Solenodon     solenodons ( meaning `` slotted-tooth '' ) are venomous , nocturnal mammals in the family solenodontidae . they are burrowing insectivores there is only one genus , `` solenodon '' , they are interesting because they keep some primitive mammal characteristics . their species resemble closely those which lived near the end of the age of the dinosaurs . the two living solenodon species are the cuban solenodon ( `` solenodon cubanus '' ) , and the haitian or hispaniolan solenodon ( `` solenodon paradoxus '' ) . the hispaniolan solenodon lives in many habitats on the island of hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest . two other described species went extinct during the quaternary . oligocene north american genera , such as `` apternodus '' , have been suggested as relatives of `` solenodon '' .
