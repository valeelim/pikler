Programmed learning     programmed learning ( or 'programmed instruction ' ) is a research-based system which helps learners work successfully . the method is guided by research done by a variety of applied psychologists and educators . the learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer . the medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence . the text is in small steps or larger chunks . after each step , learners are given a question to test their comprehension . then immediately the correct answer is shown . this means the learner at all stages makes responses , and is given immediate knowledge of results . it is rather interesting that edward l. thorndike wrote in 1912 : `` if , by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity , a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible , and so on , much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print '' . thorndike , however , did nothing with his idea . the first such system was devised by sidney l. pressey in 1926 . `` the first.. [ teaching machine ] was developed by sidney l. pressey ... while originally developed as a self-scoring machine ... [ it ] demonstrated its ability to actually teach '' .
