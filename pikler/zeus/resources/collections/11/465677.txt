Hypnagogia     hypnagogia is the state of mind that exists between being awake and sleep , or just after waking up . people in this state may have experiences that resemble hallucinations , but are not . the person usually knows that it is not real , but very often nothing can be done against it . most of these `` pseudohallucinations '' are visual experiences . other experiences that may happen are sleep paralysis and lucid dreams . all of these symptoms happen because of the changes that occur in the brain , and they are not linked to a disease . the writings of aristotle already talk about hypnagogia . in more recent centuries , many authors have referred to the state . edgar allan poe , for example , wrote of the `` fancies '' he experienced `` only when i am on the brink of sleep , with the consciousness that i am so '' . serious scientific inquiry began in the 19th century with johannes peter m√ºller , jules baillarger and alfred maury , and continued into the 20th century with leroy . with electroencephalography ( eeg ) in the mid 20th century , detecting such a state has become easier .
