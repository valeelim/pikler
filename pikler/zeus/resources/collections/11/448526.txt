Probability space     probability space is a mathematical model used to describe scientific experiments a probability space consists of three parts : 1. a sample space which lists all possible outcomes 1. a set of events . each event associates zero or more outcomes 1. a function that assigns probabilities to each event an `` outcome '' is the result of a single execution of the model . since individual outcomes might be of little practical use , more complex `` events '' are used to characterize groups of outcomes . the collection of all such events is a `` σ-algebra '' formula_1 . finally , there is a need to specify each event 's likelihood of happening . this is done using the `` probability measure '' function , `` p '' . once the probability space is established , it is assumed that “ nature ” makes its move and selects a single outcome , `` ω '' , from the sample space ω. all the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome `` ω '' ( recall that each event is a subset of ω ) are said to “ have occurred ” . the selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times , the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function `` p '' .
