Intelligence agency     an intelligence agency is a government agency . its job is to collect , analyse , and use information to support its government . there are two parts to this , and usually they are done by separate agencies . the first part is to collect information ( to `` spy '' ) on other countries . the other side is to watch people in the home country who might cause problems . a third activity is to defend against foreign intelligence agencies in the home country . this is called counter-intelligence , and is often done by a separate agency . what the agencies discover is called `` intelligence '' . it may be used to help law enforcement , security , defence and foreign policy . the methods of information gathering are sometimes covert ( hidden ) and sometimes quite open . a covert method might be to steal and copy secret documents . an open method would be to read all published work on some important matter , and analyse it . much important material is published openly in democratic countries . to get hold of secret information , these organisations use espionage , intercept signals ( tap phones , hack computers ) , cryptanalysis ( break codes ) , and think about what the information means . putting together and communicating information is known as intelligence analysis and assessment .
