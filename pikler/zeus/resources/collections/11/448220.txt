Complement system     the complement system helps or “ complements ” the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism . it is part of the innate immune system . the complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood , made by the liver . normally they circulate as inactive precursors ( `` pro-proteins '' ) . when stimulated by a trigger , proteases split specific proteins to release active cytokines . this starts a series ( a cascade ) of further cleavages which release more cytokines . this amplifies ( makes bigger ) the response . so , if the original stimulus was an invading bacterium , the cytokines disrupt the phospholipid bilayer cell membrane of the target , which kills it .
