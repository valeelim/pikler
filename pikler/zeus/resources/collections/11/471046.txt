New World oriole     new world orioles are a group of birds in the genus icterus . they are in the blackbird family , and not related to old world orioles of the family oriolidae . icterid species are strikingly similar in size , diet , behaviour , and strongly contrasting plumage to old world orioles . this is a good example of convergent evolution . males are typically black and vibrant yellow or orange with white markings , females and immature birds duller . they moult annually . new world orioles are generally slender with long tails and a pointed bill . they mainly eat insects , but also enjoy nectar and fruit . the nest is a woven , elongated pouch . species nesting in areas with cold winters are strongly migratory , while subtropical and tropical species are more sedentary ( do not migrate . the name `` oriole '' was first recorded ( in the latin form `` oriolus '' ) by albertus magnus in about 1250 , which he stated to be onomatopoeic , from the song of the european golden oriole . the genus name `` icterus '' as used by classical authors , referred to a bird with yellow or green plumage . in modern times this has been identified as the golden oriole . brisson mistakenly re-applied the name to the new world birds because of their similarity in appearance .
