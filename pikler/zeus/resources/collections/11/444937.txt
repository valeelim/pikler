Molar concentration     molar concentration , or molarity , or simply concentration , is a term in physical chemistry . it measures the concentration of a solution or mixture . in chemistry , the molar concentration , formula_1 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_2 ( usually measured in moles â€“ hence the name ) divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3 : the volume formula_3 in the definition formula_6 refers to the volume of the solution , `` not '' the volume of the solvent . one litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because when a substance dissolves in a solvent it causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease . the reciprocal quantity represents the dilution ( volume ) which can appear in ostwald 's law of dilution .
