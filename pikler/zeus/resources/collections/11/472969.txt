Diplomatics     diplomatics is a discipline which is concerned with the analysis of historical documents . the word goes back to `` diploma '' , which literally means folded ( document ) . using the term diplomatics for this science is probably due to a work called `` de re diplomatica '' , by jean mabilon ( 1632-1707 ) . note also , that the term is unrelated to diplomacy . the discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official charters and diplomas issued by royal and papal chanceries . it was later found that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and legal instrument , to non-official documents such as private letters , and , most recently , to the metadata of electronic records . diplomatics is one of the auxiliary sciences of history . it should not be confused ( as it often is ) with its sister-discipline of palaeography . in fact , its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of textual criticism and historical criticism .
