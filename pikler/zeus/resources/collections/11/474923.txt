William Tyndale     william tyndale ( c. 1484–1536 ) was an english scholar . he is well known for his translation of the bible into english , and for his later prosecution and execution . he was influenced by the work of erasmus , who made the greek new testament available in europe , and by martin luther . the spread of the wycliffe bible led to strong measures to keep translations in the hands of the catholic church . there was a death sentence for any unlicensed possession of scripture in english—even though translations in all other major european languages were accepted . tyndale 's translation was the first english bible to draw directly from hebrew and greek texts , and the first english one to take advantage of the printing press . it was seen as a direct challenge to the roman catholic church . in 1530 , tyndale also wrote `` the practyse of prelates '' , opposing henry viii 's divorce on the grounds that it contravened scripture . a copy of tyndale 's earlier `` the obedience of a christian man '' fell into the hands of henry viii . there , the king found the reasons he used to break the church in england from the roman catholic church in 1534. meanwhile , the agents of chancellor thomas more were searching in europe for tyndale , who had taken refuge where he hoped the church could not get at him .
