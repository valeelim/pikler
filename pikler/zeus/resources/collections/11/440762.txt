Long-term memory     long-term memory ( ltm ) is our memory of past events . it follows from short-term memory , and involves the growth of nerve synapses which are very long-lasting . the brain does not store memories in one unified structure , as might be seen in a computer 's hard disk drive . instead , different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain . long term memory is typically divided up into two major headings : explicit memory and implicit memory . explicit or 'declarative ' memory refers to memories which can be consciously recalled such as facts and knowledge . these are partly encoded by the hippocampus , stored elsewhere . exactly where is unknown , but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate . research shows that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls . however , the same patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on `` implicit '' learning tests . this implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning , but not in implicit learning .
