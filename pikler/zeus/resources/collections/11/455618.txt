H II region     an h ii region is a region where huge blue stars are formed from hydrogen . they are named after the ionised atomic hydrogen which they produce : h ii . the stars form inside a large cloud of hydrogen gas . the short-lived blue stars formed in these regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light . this ionizes the surrounding gas . h ii regions can be several hundred light-years across . the first known h ii region was the orion nebula , which was discovered in 1610. these regions have extremely varied shapes . they often appear clumpy and filamentary , sometimes showing bizarre shapes such as the horsehead nebula . h ii regions give birth to thousands of stars over several million years . eventually , this produces a star cluster . in the end , supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars blow away the gases of the h ii region . this leaves behind behind a cluster of stars such as the pleiades . h ii regions can be seen at huge distances in the universe.the study of extragalactic h ii regions helps to fix the distance and chemical composition of other galaxies .
