Amoebozoa     the amoebozoa are a eukaryote phylum of `` amoeba '' -like protozoa . most move by internal cytoplasmic flow . their finger-like pseudopodia are characteristic . they are a major group with about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists . in most classification schemes , amoebozoa is ranked as a phylum in either the kingdom protista or the kingdom protozoa . in the classification of the international society of protistologists , it is kept as an unranked `` supergroup '' in the eukaryota . sequence analysis shows amoebozoa is a monophyletic clade . most phylogenetic trees identify it as the sister group to opisthokonta . that is another major clade which contains both fungi and animals as well as some 300 species of unicellular protists . amoebozoa and opisthokonta are sometimes grouped together in a high-level taxon , variously named unikonta , amorphea , or opimoda . amoebozoa includes many of the best-known amoeboid organisms , such as `` chaos '' , `` entamoeba '' , `` pelomyxa '' and the genus `` amoeba '' itself .
