Alkaliphile     an alkaliphile is an organism that lives and grows well in extremely alkaline conditions that are harmful to most life on earth . to be considered an alkaliphile , the organism must have optimal growth in environments with a ph level of 9.0 or above . surviving and growing in an environment that has a high ph level is very difficult . many processes in the cell are blocked by high ph levels . alkaline conditions change dna , and make the plasma membrane of the cell unstable . alkaliphiles have two basic methods of dealing with these problems : either they have a way of making the environment more acidic , or they have adapted the cellular processes , so that they work best in highly alkaline conditions . to find out which of the two mechanisms a specific organism uses , experiments are needed .
