Algebraic variety     in mathematics , algebraic varieties ( also called varieties ) are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry . the first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations , over the real or complex numbers . modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition . conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ : some authors require that an `` algebraic variety '' is , by definition , `` irreducible '' ( which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the zariski topology ) , while others do not . when the former convention is used , non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets . the notion of variety is similar to that of manifold . one difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular points , while a manifold will not . proven around the year 1800 , the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients ( an algebraic object ) is determined by the set of its roots ( a geometric object ) . generalizing this result , hilbert 's nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets . using the nullstellensatz and related results , mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory . this correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry .
