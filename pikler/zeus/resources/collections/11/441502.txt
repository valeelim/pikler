Bijective function     in mathematics , a bijective function or bijection is a function `` f '' : '' a '' â†’ `` b '' that is both an injection and a surjection . this means : for every element `` b '' in the codomain `` b '' there is exactly one element `` a '' in the domain `` a '' such that `` f '' ( `` a '' ) = '' b '' . another name for bijection is 1-1 correspondence . the term `` bijection '' and the related terms `` surjection '' and `` injection '' were introduced by nicholas bourbaki . in the 1930s , he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics . formally : the element formula_5 is called the image of the element formula_6 . - the formal definition means : every element of the codomain `` b '' is the `` image '' of exactly one element in the domain `` a '' . the element formula_6 is called a pre-image of the element formula_5 . - the formal definition means : every element of the codomain `` b '' has exactly one pre-image in the domain `` a '' . note : surjection means minimum one pre-image . injection means maximum one pre-image . so bijection means exactly one pre-image .
