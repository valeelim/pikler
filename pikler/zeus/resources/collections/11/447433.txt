Buitreraptor     buitreraptor is a small dromaeosaur from the cretaceous of argentina . it was about four to five feet long ( 1.5 metres ) . `` buitreraptor '' has a slender , flat , extremely elongated snout . its jaws have many small teeth which lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges . they are grooved , strongly recurved and flattened . this probably meant it ate quite small animals , like lizards and mammals . since its close relatives had feathers , it is likely that `` buitreraptor '' also was feathered .
