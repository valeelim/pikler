Voice-tracking     voice-tracking is a technique used by some radio stations in radio broadcasting to make an illusion of a live disc jockey or announcer sitting in the studios of the radio station when one is actually not in the station . voice-tracking refers to the process of a disc jockey prerecording the parts when they speak on the radio . it is then mixed with songs , commercials and other elements to make it sound like a live air shift . voice-tracking is mostly used in radio stations , especially during the night , overnight , weekend , and holiday time periods . most radio stations also use it as a way to save money instead of having disc jockeys around the clock . sometimes , voice-tracking is done so that people can do other jobs . for example , a dj may also have a job as a program director or general manager . voice-tracking allows that person to record a three-hour shift in less than a half-hour , leaving him or her time to do office work . a popular live weekday morning radio host can record parts for a saturday show , allowing him or her to be on the air six days a week without spending more time at the station . it is also helpful during holidays such as christmas or easter , when people are off spending time with their families .
