Mice galaxies     the mice galaxies ( ngc 4676 ) are two spiral galaxies in the constellation coma berenices . about 290 million light-years away , we see them as they began to collide and merge . their name refers to the long tails produced by tidal action , which is the relative difference between gravitational pulls on the near and far parts of each galaxy . they are members of the coma cluster , so the galaxies may have collided before , and will continue colliding until they merge . the galaxies were photographed in 2002 by the hubble space telescope .
