Legal guardian     the goal of a legal guardian is to protect a person who can not make legal decisions on their own . the legal guardian makes decisions for the person who needs protection . usually , a legal guardian has to be appointed ( chosen ) by a court . before a court appoints a guardian for a person , it first has to decide that the person is incompetent ( unable to make decisions on their own ) . a court may choose a legal guardian for a minor child ( a child under a certain age ) in many different situations : - if a child has no parents or other adults who are willing to take care of the child - if a child 's parents die - if a child 's parents lose custody of the child . ( this happens when a court decides that the parents are not able to take care of the child . for example , if a parent hurts their child , or does not care for them properly , they may lose custody . ) - if a court decides that a child 's parents are incompetent ( unable to make decisions on their own ) a court may also choose a legal guardian for an adult . this happens when the court decides the adult is incompetent . the court appoints a legal guardian to help protect the incompetent person ( who is called a ward ) . the legal guardian then has the right to make legal decisions for the ward .
