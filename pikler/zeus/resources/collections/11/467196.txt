Himno De Riego     `` el himno de riego '' is the anthem of the second spanish republic . it was named for of colonel rafael del riego . it was composed by jos√© melchor gomis . < poem > serene and happy , brave and daring , let us sing , soldiers , the battle hymn . our voices shall astonish the world which will see on us the children of the cid . soldiers , the country calls us to the fight . let us swear for her to succeed or to die . never saw the world more noble daring , nor any day greater valor was shown , than that , inflamed , we showed at the fire awaken in riego the love of his land . soldiers , the country calls us to the fight . let us swear for her to conquer or to die . the war trumpet echoes to the winds ; affrighting the greedy , the cannon now roars . at mars , wrathful provokes the audacity and the ingenuity of our nation . soldiers , the country calls us to the fight . let us swear for her to succeed or to die . < /poem >
