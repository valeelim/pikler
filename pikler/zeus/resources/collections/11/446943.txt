Major general     a major general ( or two-star general ) is a rank in an army . it is between the ranks of lieutenant general and brigadier general . a major general usually commands a division . it comes from the older rank of sergeant major general . the disappearance of the `` sergeant '' in the title explains the apparently confusing system whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( although a major outranks a lieutenant , a lieutenant outranks a sergeant-major . ) a major general is addressed as `` general '' .
