Knowledge of results     knowledge of results is a term in the psychology of learning . a psychology dictionary defines it as feedback of information : it describes the situation where a subject gets information which helps them to change behaviour in a desirable way , or to gain understanding . a primitive example is avoiding a behaviour after punishment . an advanced example is the way a human may improve understanding and behaviour after a teacher explains what was wrong with the previous effort . there are a number of similar terms in psychology , but all of them have some problems . - kcr : this means `` knowledge of `` correct '' results '' , which implies that there is a always a specific correct result . - operant conditioning and reinforcement : this implies a behaviourist approach using `` schedules of reinforcement '' to `` shape behaviour '' . - feedback : this is a more general term , perhaps too general . it is often used for the way systems adjust to preset limits . the watt `` governor '' which controlled steam engines is a classic example .
