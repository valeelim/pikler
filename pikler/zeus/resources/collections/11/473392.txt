Active transport     active transport is when molecules move across a cell membrane from a lower concentration to a higher concentration . this takes energy , often from adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) . active transport is done so cells get what they need , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . in general , molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration . to get molecules into the cell `` against '' the concentration gradient , work must be done . the work is done in special proteins which act as ports in the cell membrane . the imports must come through the ports : they can not get through the bilipid layer of the cell membrane . there are three main types of protein ports in cell membranes : - uniporters : they use energy from atp to pull molecules in . - symporters : they use the movement in of one molecule to pull in another molecule against gradient . - antiporters : one substance moves against its gradient , using energy from the second substance ( mostly na+ , k+ or h+ ) moving down its gradient .
