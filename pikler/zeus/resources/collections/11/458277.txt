Potato blight     potato blight is the so-called `` fungal '' disease which destroyed the irish potatoes in 1845. because there are other blights of potatoes , this one is sometimes called late blight of potato . the infestation caused widespread famine . it was caused by an oomycete `` phytophthora infestans '' . the oomycetes or water moulds have many features which are similar to fungi , but they are in a different kingdom . `` phytophthora infestans '' in ireland caused over one million to starve to death and another two million people emigrated from affected countries . during the 1840s the blight damaged crops in scotland and europe also . it was the only important cash crop in ireland , which explains its greater effect there . also , most of the irish crop was one variety , the irish lumper . the first recorded instances of the disease were in the united states , in philadelphia and new york city in early 1843. it crossed the atlantic ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for belgian farmers in 1845. all of the potato-growing countries in europe were affected , but the potato blight hit ireland the hardest . the lack of genetic variability created a susceptible host population for the organism .
