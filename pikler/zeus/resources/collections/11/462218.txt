Phospholipid     phospholipids are a type of fat that contain phosphorus . they are major parts of all cell membranes because they form lipid bilayers . phospholipid molecules usually have hydrophobic tails and a hydrophilic head . biological membranes in eukaryotes also contain another class of lipid , sterols . these are spaced out among the phospholipids . together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength . purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science .
