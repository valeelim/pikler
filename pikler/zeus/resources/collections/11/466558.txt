African palm civet     the african palm civet ( nandinia binotata ) , or 'two-spotted palm civet ' , is a small mammal . it is in the feliformia suborder . it has short legs , small ears , a body like a civet cat , and a long lithe tail as long as its body . adults usually weigh . it is native to the forests of eastern africa and the congo river basin . it usually lives in trees , and it is omnivorous : it eats rodents , insects , eggs , carrion , fruit , birds and fruit bats . the animal is generally solitary and nocturnal . although it looks like other civet species ( in the family viverridae ) , the african palm civet is genetically distinct : they probably diverged from other civets before the cats did . they are therefore classified as the only species in the genus nandinia and in their own family , nandiniidae . however , not all experts accept this .
