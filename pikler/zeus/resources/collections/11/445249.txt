Pseudosuchia     pseudosuchia ( `` false crocodiles '' ) is one of two major divisions of archosaurs . it includes living crocodilians . it also includes archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles than to birds : `` crocodile-line archosaurs '' . pseudosuchia is one of the two `` daughter '' clades of the archosauria . it includes a group of superficially crocodile-like prehistoric reptiles from the triassic period . these are relatives of living crocodiles , but more distant than the archosaurs . the skull is often massive . the snout is narrow and often long . the neck is short and strong . the standing position may be a typical reptilian sprawl . more often it is an erect stance like dinosaurs or mammals , though done a different way . the body is often protected by two or more rows of armored scutes . many crurotarsans get to lengths of three metres or more . pseudosuchians appeared in the late lower triassic . by the late middle triassic they were the dominant land carnivores . their great time was the upper triassic , during which time their ranks included a number of carnivore groups , and one group of herbivores .
