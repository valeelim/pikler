Blockade runner     a blockade runner is usually a lighter-weight ship used for slipping past a naval blockade of a port or strait . this is not the same as ships used to challenge the blocking ships to break the blockade . very often blockade running is done in order to bring food or arms to a blockaded city . in other cases the blockade runners would carry mail in an attempt to communicate with the outside world . carrying trade goods from blockaded ports is another function . blockade runners are often the fastest ships available . they are usually lightly armed and armored . their operations are quite risky since blockading fleets would not hesitate to fire on them . however , the potential profits ( economically or militarily ) from a successful blockade run are tremendous . blockade-runners typically had excellent crews . although similar to smugglers , blockade-runners are often operated by state 's navies as part of the regular naval fleet . notable users of blockade runners include the confederate states of america during the american civil war and germany during both world war one and world war two .
