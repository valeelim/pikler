Holiday in Cambodia     `` holiday in cambodia '' is the second single off american hardcore punk band dead kennedys ' debut studio album `` fresh fruit for rotting vegetables '' . the song was released in may 1980. the cover art for the song was taken during the thammasat university massacre on 6 october 1976 in thailand . it shows a member of a right-wing crowd beating the corpse of a student protester with a chair . the song is against both eastern totalitarianism and western complacency . the original version of the song features the satirically quoted word `` niggers '' , later performances of the song by the dead kennedys , as well as other artists have replaced the word with `` brothers '' . biafra , however , has often replaced the word with `` blacks '' . lead singer jello biafra was sued by the other members of dead kennedy because he would not allow the song to be used in a levi 's dockers commercial . biafra opposed levi 's because he believes they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor . the other members of the band said that they had had their royalties defrauded . `` the record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning , '' according to dead kennedys guitarist east bay ray . `` this case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties . many people doubted the claims we made against our former record label back in 1998 but with this announcement there is no denying we were the victims here .
