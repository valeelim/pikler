Metatarsus     the metatarsus or metatarsal bones are a group of five long bones in the foot . they are between the tarsal bones of the hind and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes . the metatarsal bones are numbered from the side of the large toe : the first , second , third , fourth , and fifth metatarsal . they can be numbered with roman numerals . the metatarsals are like the metacarpal bones of the hand . the metatarsal bones are often broken by soccer players . this may be caused by the lightweight design of modern football boots , which give less protection to the foot . in 2010 some soccer players began testing a new sock that had a rubber silicon pad over the foot to protect the top of the foot .
