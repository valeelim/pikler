Resultant force     a resultant force , also called a net force , is a force equal to the sum of all forces applied to an object . if 10n and 10n are applied to the right , then the resultant force is 20n . if 40n is applied to the left and 30n applied to the right , the resultant force is 10n to the left . note that `` n '' is an abbreviation of `` newton '' , which is a unit of force .
