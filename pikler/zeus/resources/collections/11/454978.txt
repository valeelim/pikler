Open star cluster     an open star cluster , also known as galactic cluster , is a group of a few hundred or thousand stars . they have roughly the same age , and were formed from the same giant molecular cloud . more than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the milky way galaxy , and many more are thought to exist . they are loosely bound together by mutual gravitational attraction , but they get disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas . open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years , with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years . in contrast , the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members , and can survive for longer . open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies , in which active star formation is occurring . young open clusters may still be in the molecular cloud from which they formed . they light it up and create an h ii region . over time , radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud . typically , about 10 % of the mass of a gas cloud will form stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away .
