Cercopithecinae     the cercopithecinae are an important subfamily of old world monkeys . there are 12 genera and about 71 species . the baboons , the macaques and the vervet monkeys . most of then live in sub-saharan africa , but the macaques range from the far eastern parts of asia through northern africa , and gibraltar . the various species are adapted to the different terrains they inhabit . tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) species are slim , delicate and have a long tail . ground-dwelling species are heavier , and their tail may be small or nonexistent . all species have well-developed thumbs . like many old world monkeys , they have pads on their bottoms . these are called `` ischial callosities '' . they let the monkeys sleep sitting upright on thin branches , beyond reach of predators , without falling off . in some species , these pads change their colour during the mating period . these monkeys are active in the daytime , and live together in social groups . they live in all types of terrain and climate , from cool mountains to rain forests , savannah , bald rocky areas or even snowy mountains , as does the japanese macaque .
