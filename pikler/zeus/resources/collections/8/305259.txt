Sautéing     sautéing is a method of cooking food . it uses a small amount of fat in a shallow pan . the heat must be quite high . ingredients are often cut into pieces or sliced thinly . it makes things cook faster . food that is sautéed is browned , but it keeps the same texture , moisture and flavor . if meat , or fish is sautéed , the sauté is sometimes finished by using the pan 's remains to make a sauce . sautéing is different from pan-frying . people sometimes confuse the two . in pan-frying larger pieces of food ( for example , chops or steaks ) are cooked quickly . sautéing is also different from searing . searing only browns the surface of the food . olive oil or clarified butter are commonly used for sautéing . most others fats will work too . regular butter will produce more flavor . however it burns at a lower temperature and more quickly than other fats . this is because of the milk solids in it . therefore clarified butter is better for sautéing .
