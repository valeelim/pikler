Charged particle     a charged particle , also called an ion , is an atom with a positive or negative charge . this happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms . two particles that have different numbers of electrons ( the smallest particle in an atom which is negative ) start reacting to each other . the particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particle 's electrons . one becomes positive because it lost an electron , and the other negative because it got another electron . the two particles become attracted to each other and mix together , making a new kind of particle .
