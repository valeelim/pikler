Algebraic equation     in mathematics , an algebraic equation , also called polynomial equation over a given field is an equation of the form where `` p '' and `` q '' are polynomials over that field , and have one ( univariate ) or more than one ( multivariate ) variables . for example : is an algebraic equation over the rational numbers . two equations are called equivalent if they have the same set of solutions . this means that all solutions of the second equation must also be solutions of the first one and vice versa . the equation formula_1 is equivalent with formula_4 . so the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials . if an algebraic equation is over the rationals , it can always be converted to an equivalent one , where all the coefficients are integers . for example , in the equation given above , we multiply by 42 = 2·3·7 and group the terms in the first member . the equation is converted to the solutions of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true . but for algebraic equations there are also called roots . when solving an equation , we need to say in which set the solutions are allowed . for example , for an equation over the rationals , one can find solutions in the integers . then , the equation is a diophantine equation . one may also look for solutions in the field of complex numbers . one can also look for solutions in real numbers .
