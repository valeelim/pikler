Substituent     in organic chemistry and biochemistry , substituent is the name for a single atom or for a group of atoms that take the position of another atom in a molecule . they replace this atom . this reaction is called a substitution reaction . the atom or group of atoms that gets replaced is called the leaving group . the terms substituent , side chain , group , branch , or pendant group are used in the same way to describe branches from a parent structure . these terms have different meanings in polymer chemistry . in polymers , side chains extend from a backbone structure , while they are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in proteins . organic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups . the substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain . the suffix -yl is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen . -ylidene and -ylidyne are used for double bonds and triple bonds respectively . when naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent , position numbers may be used . these number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to . one case where this information is needed is that of isomers .
