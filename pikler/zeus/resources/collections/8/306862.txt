Mass spectrum     a mass spectrum is an intensity versus `` m/z '' ( mass-to-charge ratio ) plot that represents a chemical analysis . the mass spectrum of a sample is a pattern representing the distribution of ions by mass ( more correctly : mass-to-charge ratio ) in a sample . it is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer . not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same . it can depend on the operating conditions of the instrument . for example , some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces ; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation . a mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment ; however , all plots of intensity vs. mass-to-charge are called `` mass spectra '' . common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the mclafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage . in the past , chemists with phd degrees were needed to interpret mass spectra . today , computer programs read the data and identify the compounds in a sample .
