Rearrangement reaction     a rearrangement reaction are organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged . the result is a structural isomer of the original molecule . often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule . in the example below , the substituent r moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2 : intermolecular rearrangements also take place . sometimes chemists draw diagrams with arrows that show how electrons are transferred between bonds during a rearrangement reaction . many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams . but they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism . the actual mechanism of a rearrangement with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond , not ionic bond-breaking and forming . one example of this is the wagner-meerwein rearrangement : in pericyclic reactions , the orbital interactions are important . the reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers . but , the curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction . yet , the diagrams are not necessarily realistic . in allylic rearrangement , the reaction is ionic .
