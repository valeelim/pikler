M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle     the browning automatic rifle ( bar ) was a group of american automatic rifles and light machine guns . it was used by the united states and several other countries . the most-used type of bar was the m1918 . it was designed by john browning in 1917. it was supposed to replace the french chauchat and the m1909 benet-mercie machine guns . the bar was designed to be carried by soldiers that were moving forward . it was supposed to be put over the shoulder on a strap and fired from the hip . this was called `` walking fire '' . it was thought that walking fire was needed for trench warfare . however , it was usually used as a light machine gun and fired from a bipod . when the united states joined world war i , they did not have very good machine guns . one reason for this was because there was no military doctrine for their use . the u.s. declared war on germany on 6 april 1917. at this time , the commanders were told that the u.s. only had 670 m1909 benet-mercies , 282 m1904 maxims and 158 colts , m1895 to fight the war . after a lot of arguments , they decided that the u.s. would have to build up more american weapons . however , until then , u.s. soldiers would have to take what the french and british could give them . the machine guns given to the u.s. by the french were often not very good . they also fired different cartridges from what the u.s. soldiers usually used . this meant that soldiers and machine gunners had to be given different kinds of cartridge .
