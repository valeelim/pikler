Conjugated system     in chemistry , a conjugated system is a system of connected p-orbitals with delocalized electrons . conjugated systems are created by several multiple bonds , each separated by single bonds . in general , conjugated systems may lower the overall energy of the molecule and increase how steady it is . they can contain lone pairs , radicals or carbenium ions . the compound may be cyclic , acyclic , linear or mixed . in most cases , the atoms in a molecule are held together by single bonds ( where orbitals from adjacent atoms overlap ) . molecules which have a conjugated system have unique properties different from normal compounds created by the sharing of the delocalized electrons among many atoms . conjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with another across a sigma bond ( or single bond ) that is in between . ( the d-orbitals of larger atoms can also contribute to a conjugated system ) . a conjugated system has a region of overlapping p-orbitals , bridging the single bonds that are between . they allow a delocalization of pi electrons across all the adjacent aligned p-orbitals .
