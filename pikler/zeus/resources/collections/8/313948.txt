Muhammad Ali Pasha     muhammad ali pasha al-mas'ud ibn agha ( 4 march 1769 – 2 august 1849 ) was an albanian commander in the ottoman army . he became wāli , and self-declared khedive of egypt and sudan . though not a modern nationalist , he was the founder of modern egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army , economy , and culture of egypt . he also ruled some levantine territories outside egypt . the dynasty he established ruled egypt and sudan until the egyptian revolution of 1952. muhammed ali was born in the ottoman empire , in the area which is now the greek province of macedonia . his parents were albanian , and their language was the only one he spoke well . he also spoke some turkish , but not arabic . he led a group of albanian troops sent to egypt . they were part of an ottoman force that reoccupied egypt after napoleon 's french troops left . the ottomans had ruled egypt by a wali ( governor ) with mamluk troops . the mamluks were former slaves . the french capitulation of alexandria left a power vacuum in the ottoman province . mamluk power had been weakened , but not destroyed , and ottoman forces clashed with the mamluks for power . during this period of anarchy muhammad ali used his loyal albanian troops to play both sides , gaining power and prestige for himself . as the conflict drew on , the local populace grew weary of the power struggle . a group of prominent egyptians demanded that the then wāli , ahmad khurshid pasha , step down and muhammad ali be installed as the new wāli in 1805 .
