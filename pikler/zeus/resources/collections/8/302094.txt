Page Three     many tabloid newspapers use a photo of a topless or a naked girl to improve their sales . very often , this photo is placed on page three of the newspaper ; that is where the name of this feature is from . for this reason , the feature is referred to as page three or page 3. the newspaper the sun , who introduced this in 1970 , holds a copyright on the name . the sun showed a picture of a topless girl on page three . other newspapers , such as the `` daily star '' and `` daily mirror '' had pictures of naked women ; the mirror changed for models in swimsuits after a few years . claire short tried to stop this.she did not want to penalize the depiction of nude women , but she wanted to define a newspaper as a publication that did not show naked or topelss men or women . this would have meant that british rainbow press would no longer have been newspapers . she reveived 3.000 letters supporting the idea . the sun , and other papers fought against the bill , which was known as `` page three bill '' . eventually , the bill failed , because it did not get enough support .
