Melbourne Observatory     the melbourne observatory , in melbourne , victoria , australia , was built in 1861. it replaced an earlier observatory at williamstown . the melbourne observatory is now part of melbourne 's royal botanic gardens . the observatory had an important role as it used observations of the stars to keep accurate time . it also kept the weather records and scientists were able to make weather predictions . in 1869 the observatory installed the great melbourne telescope ( 48 inch ) which at that time was the largest steerable telescope in world . there were problems with its size and image accuracy and by 1890 it was no longer used . as melbourne increased in size the light from the city limited the use of the observatory for serious astronomy . the great melbourne telescope was sold to the mount stromlo observatory in canberra in 1944. it was destroyed in a bushfire in 2003 , but there are plans to rebuild it and set it up as a display at the melbourne observatory . the melbourne observatory is no longer used , but the historic equipment is kept in working condition by the astronomical society of victoria . this is an amateur group of volunteers interested in astronomy . they have regular tours , talks and observation nights using the telescopes . the historic buildings are now used as offices for the gardens , a cafe and a shop .
