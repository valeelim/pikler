Virus classification     virus classification is the way viruses are put into groups by scientists . there are many different kinds of viruses . scientists classify viruses to make it easier to learn about them . classification also helps scientists to remember viruses and the diseases they cause . the international committee of taxonomy of viruses ( ictv ) is in charge of virus classification . sometimes different viruses have things in common . this is used in classification . for example , if they are made from dna and protein , or rna and protein . other things that are taken into account are the size and shape of the viruses and the diseases they cause . similar viruses are first put into `` families '' . each family has a name . this family name always ends with `` '' -viridae '' . for example , rotaviruses are in the `` reoviridae '' family and herpes viruses are in the `` herpesviridae '' family . viruses in any one family that are almost the same are then put in a smaller group called a `` genus '' . another way of classifying viruses is called the baltimore classification . this is different from the ictv one . some scientists prefer the baltimore classification because it is based on how viruses grow in cells .
