Binary adder     binary adders are devices used to add binary numbers . they are used in computers . they take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum . in its most basic form , it uses two xor gates , two and gates , and an or gate . these gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not . when solving this example 1001 + 1100 ( 9 + 12 ) , it would need five single bits to give an answer . the first digits in each number would go to one adder , 1 and 0. it would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1 , so that first digit would be 1. the second digits from each are 0 and 0 , and 0 + 0 = 0 , so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0 , and 1 + 0 = 1 , so the third digit is 1. the fourth digit in each are 1 and 1 , and 1 + 1 = 10 , but because this is a 2 digit number , it holds the first digit ( 0 ) and send the second digit to the next adder . the next adder sees 1 , and 1 = 1 , so the fifth digit is 1. if we take the sum digits in order , they come out as 10101 ( 21 ) , so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 ( 9 + 12 = 21 ) .
