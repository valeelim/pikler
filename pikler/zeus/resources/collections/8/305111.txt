Conscription     conscription , also called draft , is when a government forces people to join the armed forces . usually , only men are conscripted , but in israel , women are as well . a soldier who has been forced to serve in the army is called a `` conscript '' . conscription is a very old way to build up armies , but also usually very unpopular , since very few men enjoy fighting and killing other people . historically conscription was called `` levy '' , but it was so unpopular that it was used only when the country was in really dire danger . 18th century prussia had a conscript army but the first large , modern conscript army was the french grand army in the french revolution . the leaders drafted all french men into the army . the result was that the french army was five times larger than that of neighbour countries , and the sheer numbers often won battles . while the french soldiers were less well trained and equipped than the soldiers of the neighbour armies , they were so many that they could win . conscription became the universal way of making up the armies after the french revolution . almost all the powerful armies in the world except united kingdom were conscripted armies . without conscription , the large armies of world war one and world war two would have been impossible to form .
