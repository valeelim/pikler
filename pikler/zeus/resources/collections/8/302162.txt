Manifest Destiny     manifest destiny was the idea that the united states had a god-given right to take over every part of north america . the phrase `` manifest destiny '' was created in 1845 by a newspaper writer named john l. o'sullivan . quickly , the idea became very popular . the idea of manifest destiny told americans that they had a mission a special job given only to americans . this mission was to make the united states bigger so the `` borders of freedom '' could be open to even more people . only they could make sure that people living in un-free countries across the world could learn how to govern themselves and live freely in america . in 1845 , james k. polk was elected president . polk believed very strongly in the idea of manifest destiny . during his presidency , the united states grew by a million square miles . ever since he was running for president , polk had talked about wanting the area that is now around texas . at that time , mexico controlled that land . in june 1845 , the united states decided to add texas to the united states . president polk sent the united states military to take over the area . the two sides fought for two years . finally , mexico surrendered . on february 2 , 1848 , it signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo , which ended the war . it also gave the united states all of the land above the rio grande . this meant the united states had gained all of texas , arizona , and new mexico ; parts of utah , nevada , and colorado ; and northern california .
