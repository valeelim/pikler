Hermaphroditus     in greek mythology , hermaphroditus was the son of hermes and aphrodite . he was a minor god of fertility and symbolized the unity of male and female . his name is the origin of the word hermaphrodite . according to a myth of ovid , he was raised by nymphs in a cave on mount ida . at the age of fifteen , he traveled to the cities of lydia and caria in asia minor . it was there that he came upon a pool of fresh water . he undressed and bathed in the pool . meanwhile , the nymph of the pool salmacis , fell in love with him . she jumped into the pool and embraced him , not letting go , he struggled to get away from her . salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer , merged their bodies together , transforming hermaphroditus into an androgynous being . hermaphroditus , in anger of his transformation , cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate . the worship of hermaphroditus originated from cyprus , under the name of aphroditus . the cult was introduced into mainland greece around the late 5th century bc . at rituals and sacrifices to the god , worshipers cross-dressed ; men wearing women 's clothing and women dressed in men 's clothing . the god was also identified with the moon , because the moon was thought to be both male and female .
