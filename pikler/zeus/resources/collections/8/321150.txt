Surface tension     surface tension is an effect where the surface of a liquid is strong . the surface can hold up a weight , and the surface of a water droplet holds the droplet together , in a ball shape . some small things can float on a surface because of surface tension , even though they normally could not float . some insects ( e.g . water striders ) can run on the surface of water because of this . this property is caused by the molecules in the liquid being attracted to each other ( cohesion ) , and is responsible for many of the behaviors of liquids . surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length , or of energy per unit area . the two are equivalent—but when referring to energy per unit of area , people use the term surface energy—which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids . in materials science , surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface free energy . the cohesive forces among the liquid molecules cause surface tension . in the bulk of the liquid , each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules , resulting in a net force of zero . the molecules at the surface do not have other molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards . this creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area .
