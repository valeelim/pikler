Palaeognathae     the palaeognathae or paleognaths are one of the two living superorders of birds . the other living superorder is neognathae . together these two clades form the subclass neornithes . paleognath is a word derived from the ancient greek for `` old jaws '' in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate , which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds . paleognathous birds are uncontroversially the most primitive , or basal , living birds , though there is some controversy about the precise relationship between them and the other birds . this superorder contains four extant orders of flightless ratites and one order of flying tinamous ; the order tinamiformes ( tinamous ) includes nine living genera and forty-seven species . the apterygiformes ( kiwis ) include five species in one genus ( `` apteryx '' ) . the casuariiformes have two genera . the cassowaries ( `` casuarius '' ) have three species and the emus ( dromaius ) have one living and one recently extinct species . the rheiformes ( rheas ) have two genera with one species each .
