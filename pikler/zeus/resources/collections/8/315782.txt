Pyroxene     the pyroxenes are a group of important rock-forming inosilicate minerals found in many igneous and metamorphic rocks . they share a common structure consisting of single chains of silica crystals with the general formula xy ( si , al ) o where x and y represents metal ions . although aluminium substitutes extensively for silicon in silicates such as feldspars and amphiboles , the substitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes . pyroxenite is an igneous rock made up of minerals from the pyroxene group .
