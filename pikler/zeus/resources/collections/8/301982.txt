Atrax     atrax is a genus of spiders . they have very strong venom . these spiders aggressively defend their territory and chase off attackers who may scare them by making a threat display . next they will bite . the fastest death occurred in 1927 when a young boy died within fifteen minutes of being bitten . thirteen deaths were recorded in the fifty years before antivenom was invented for this spider 's bite . in english they are sometimes called sydney funnel web spiders because they come from around that part of australia . under the heading `` spiders '' ( aranae ) there are three main groups . one is so very old that only a few species still live on earth . another is the group that includes the spiders that can be seen making webs or chasing prey almost everywhere in the world . the third group includes the tarantulas and a few other kinds of spiders . the atrax spiders belong to this third group . there are also species called `` funnel-web spiders '' that belong to the second group mentioned above . so they are not close relatives of atrax , and they are not dangerous . they just have a similar way of making a funnel-shaped web that leads down to some kind of shelter where the spider hides in wait for some insect to eat . atrax is a very large and very aggressive spider , and these other spiders are from small to medium size and are extremely timid .
