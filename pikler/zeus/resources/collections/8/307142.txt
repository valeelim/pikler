Diabetic ketoacidosis     diabetic ketoacidosis ( dka ) is a medical emergency that can happen in people with diabetes mellitus . dka happens mostly in people with type 1 diabetes , although it may happen in some people that have type 2 diabetes . dka happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body . all of the cells in the body need glucose ( sugar ) to survive , because the body needs sugar to make energy . insulin breaks down glucose into a form that the body can use for energy . without insulin , sugar stays in the blood and can not get into the cells . this causes high blood sugar levels and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy . dka can be caused by not having enough insulin , eating too many carbohydrates , and sometimes physical or mental stress . dka can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered , or is not being controlled well . dka is diagnosed through blood and urine testing . these tests will show high blood sugar , which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis .
