Burnout     a burnout ( also known as a peel out or power brake ) is the practice of keeping a vehicle still ( or close to ) and spinning its wheels , causing the tires to heat up and smoke due to friction . the origins of burnouts can be traced to drag racing , where they have a practical purpose : drag racing tires perform better at higher temperatures . a burnout is the fastest way to raise tire temperature before a race . it also cleans the tires of any debris and lays down a layer of rubber near the starting line for better traction . drag race tracks sometimes use specially-reserved , wet-surface areas ( burnout boxes ) for burnouts . burnouts are also common in informal street racing , usually for show value . as with all street racing activities , burnouts on public property are illegal in most countries but the severity of punishments vary . in new south wales , for example , police have the power to confiscate the offending vehicle for 3 months for a first offense . in march 2010 , british formula 1 world champion , lewis hamilton had his mercedes car impounded for allegedly performing a burnout in melbourne , australia while leaving the albert park grand-prix circuit .
