Thalamus     the thalamus is a symmetrical structure in the brains of vertebrates . it is between the cerebral cortex and midbrain . it relays sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex , and regulates consciousness , sleep , and alertness . the thalamus sits above the hypothalamus , and below the cerebral cortex . it is a collection of nuclei with various functions . it acts as a relay station , gathering sense information of all kinds ( except olfactory ) and passes it on to the cerebral cortex . there are action systems for several types of behaviour , including eating , drinking , defecation , and copulation . these behaviours satisfy short-term needs , and are called 'consummatory ' behaviours .
