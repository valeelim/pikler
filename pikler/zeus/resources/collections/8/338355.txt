Septicemic plague     septicemic ( or septicaemic ) plague is a deadly blood infection . it is one of the three main forms of plague ( the other two being the bubonic and penumonic ) . it is caused by the bacterium `` yersinia pestis '' . septicemic plague can cause the blood to form small clots through the body . without treatment it is almost always fatal . the death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent . septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck europe in 1348 , the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague . this disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect . in rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human . in septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood , causing severe sepsis . the endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) . this is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas . this causes the cells in the area to die . dic uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot , so that it can no longer control bleeding . this means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs , which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and coughing up or vomiting of blood ( hemoptysis/haemoptysis ) . there are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites . these bumps are usually red , and sometimes white in the center . early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent . people that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die . in some cases , people may even die on the same day they get the disease .
