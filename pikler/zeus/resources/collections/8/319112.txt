Döbereiner's lamp    döbereiner 's lamp döbereiner 's lamp is one of the first lighters . it was developed in 1823 by the german chemist johann wolfgang döbereiner . the lighter was produced until around 1880. the heidelberg castle and also the deutsches museum ( `` german museum '' ) still have original döbereiner lamps to show . the lighter works based on a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen . in the glass cylinder ( `` a '' in the picture on the right ) is sulfuric acid . in the open bottle ( `` b '' ) is zinc and at the top is a valve . with the lever ( `` f '' ) , the bottle will be opened . then , the sulfuric acid flows into the bottle . when it reaches the zinc , a reaction starts . it produces hydrogen . formula_1 the hydrogen can go out of the bottle at the top . next to the valve , there is platinum . the hydrogen gas has to bypass the platinum . the hydrogen and the oxygen from the air react because of the catalytic effect of platinum . the gas mixture ( called oxyhydrogen ) then burns , because the reaction is exothermic , and produces water .
