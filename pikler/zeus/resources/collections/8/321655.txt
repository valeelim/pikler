Oxford Movement     the oxford movement was a religious movement within the church of england , based at the university of oxford , which began in 1833. members of this movement were known as 'tractarians ' ( from `` tracts for the times '' , a collection of books , pamphlets and essays that described their beliefs ) ; opponents of the movement called them newmanites ( before 1845 ) and puseyites ( from 1845 ) , after john henry newman and edward bouverie pusey , two leading tractarians . the members of the movement tried to bring back catholic doctrine and forms of service ( how sunday services and other forms of worship were carried out in anglican churches , the oxford movement wanting to make these more like a catholic mass ) into the church of england . they also believed the anglican church was an 'apostolic ' church , connected directly to the church of saint peter and the other apostles . john keble was another leader of the movement . after publishing ninety tracts , newman decided , in tract 90 , that the branch theory ( that the anglican , eastern orthodox and roman churches were all part of the one church ) was not enough , and converted to catholicism , and later became a cardinal . enemies of the movement thought this proved that they were trying to reunify with rome . others followed newman to rome ( for example , henry edward manning , another important tractarian , converted in 1851 ) while others , such as pusey and john keble , remained in the anglican church to continue the work of reforming it .
