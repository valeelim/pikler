Alienation     alienation is the feeling of being left out , not belonging or not understanding yourself in relation to your environment . alienation can be talked about in many ways . in psychology , researchers talk about alienation in terms of how well or unwell people fit in to their social groups . this may include how well people relate to their peers in a school or workplace , and how connected they feel to those around them . in sociology , alienation is a more complex and difficult idea . alienation is how people understand themselves in relation to their entire society . a good example of this is how people think of themselves when they are working and doing a job . karl marx wrote about this . this kind of alienation happens when people do work that they are not interested in or find boring . however , in almost all societies some people may have to do jobs that they do n't like because they need to earn money . this can be seen as a type of alienation because a person 's true feelings and their actions are separated and unrelated . on the other hand , a person might feel empowered and connected if they do a job that they do like . empowerment and the feeling of being connected is the opposite of alienation .
