Grouped data     grouped data is a statistical term used in data analysis . raw data can be organized by grouping together similar measurements in a table . this frequency table is also called grouped data . for example , someone gave a group of students a simple math question , and timed how long it took them to answer it . the numbers are below : the smallest amount of time was 8 seconds , and the largest was 34 seconds . one method we could use to analyze the needed time is to group close numbers together . in order to keep the analysis fair , we 'll make each group be the same amount of seconds . we can then count how many students fell in each group . for example , if we organized scores into 5 second ranges : another way to group data is to organize the scores data into groups based on their performance . suppose there are three types of students : - smart ( 5 to 14 seconds ) - normal ( 15 to 24 seconds ) - below average ( 25 or more seconds ) then the grouped data looks like the following : an estimate , formula_1 , of the mean can be calculated from grouped data .
