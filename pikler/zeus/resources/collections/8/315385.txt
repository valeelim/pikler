SnRNP     small nuclear rna ( snrnp , or 'snurps ' ) , joins with proteins to form spliceosomes . the spiceosomes govern alternative splicing . the background to this is that , in eukaryotes , most genes code for a protein in separated strings of dna . this is because , of a total gene , coding bits ( exons ) are separated by non-coding bits ( introns ) . the process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways . alternative splicing produces alternative messenger rnas , and these produce different proteins . spliceosomes control the details of the splicing . the two essential components of snrnps are protein molecules and rna . the rna found within each snrnp particle is known as small nuclear rna , or snrna , and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length . the snrna component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises ' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns . the snrna in snurps is similar to ribosomal rna : it acts both as an enzyme ( catalyst ) and builds structure .
