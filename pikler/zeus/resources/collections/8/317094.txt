Numerical control     numerical control ( nc ) is a way to automate machines . in numerical control , the commands these machines get come from a storage medium ; they are not controlled and operated manually . the first such machines were jacquard looms controlled by punched cards . machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s . they used punched tape instructions . soon , the tools were changed , to use computers . numerical control with computers is known as computerized numerical control , or cnc . nowadays , it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools , based on a cad drawing of the piece to be produced . attempts to automate machines in the 19th century , for example copying-lathes , used cams . these are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine . the basic difference to modern nc is that these cams only automated one given task ; modern nc and cnc machines can be programmed to a greater extent .
