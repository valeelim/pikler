L118 Light Gun     the l118 light gun is a howitzer . it was first made for the british army in the 1970s . it has been moved around the globe a lot since then . the united states use a changed version of the l118 called the m119a1 . the proper name for it is `` gun , 105mm , field , l118 '' but it is usually just called `` the light gun '' . the l118 can be towed by a medium-weight vehicle . it can also be moved around by a chinook helicopter . from 1961 until the 1970s , the british army used the 105 mm pack howitzer l5 as its light howitzer . this howitzer was used a lot . it was first designed in italy for the alpini . it was light enough to be lifted by westland wessex helicopters or towed by land rovers . however , it could not fire very far ( had a short range ) , had bad sights and was not very popular . in 1965 the british army asked for a new 105 mm howitzer because the pack howitzer `` lacked range and lethality '' ( had a short range and was not very lethal ) . the new gun was soon called the 'light gun ' . it was designed by the government royal armament research and development establishment ( rarde ) . prototypes were tested in 1968. however , it was noticed that more weight was needed for a gun to be as sturdy and strong as was needed . several guns were redesigned because of this .
