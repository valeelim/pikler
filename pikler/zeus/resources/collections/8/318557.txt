Ice storm     ice storms are weather phenomena caused by freezing rain . the falling rain comes into contact with surfaces and turns into a thin sheet of ice . ice storms cause accidents , take power lines down and cause serious damage . it starts with a layer of warmer ( not freezing ) air above a layer of sub-freezing temperatures lower down . frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer , and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below . 1. if the precipitate refreezes while still in the air , it will land on the ground as sleet . 1. or , the liquid droplets continue to fall without freezing . they pass through the cold air just above the surface . this thin layer of air cools the rain to a temperature below freezing ( ) , but the drops themselves do not freeze . this is a phenomenon called supercooling . when the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below ( e.g . power lines , tree branches , aircraft ) , a layer of ice builds up , hence `` freezing rain '' .
