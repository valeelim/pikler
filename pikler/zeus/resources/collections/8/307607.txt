Isodesmic reaction     an isodesmic reaction is a chemical reaction where the type of chemical bonds broken in the reactant are the same as the type of bonds formed in the reaction product . this type of reaction is often used as a hypothetical reaction in thermochemistry . an example of an isodesmic reaction is equation 1 describes the deprotonation of a methyl halide by a methyl anion . the energy change associated with this exothermic reaction can be calculated using a computer . the energy change increases going from fluorine to chlorine to bromine and iodine . this shows that the chi anion is the most stable and least basic of all the halides . each of these reactions are isodesmic . the energy change in each example also depends on the difference in bond energy of the c-x bond in the base and conjugate acid . in other cases , the difference may be due to steric strain ( the blocking of atoms by other atoms ) . the steric strain is small in fluorine ( which is a small diameter atom ) but large in iodine ( in favor of the anion ) . so , the energy change grows between each example halide despite the fact that c-f bonds are stronger than c-i bonds .
