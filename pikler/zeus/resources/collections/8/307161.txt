Antiknock agent     an antiknock agent is added to gasoline . it reduces engine knocking and increase the fuel 's octane rating . gasoline is a fuel mixture . high compression internal combustion engines place gasoline under great pressure . the pressure can cause the gasoline to ignite early ( `` pre-ignition '' or `` detonation '' ) causing a damaging knocking sound , also called `` pinging '' or `` pinking '' . originally , organic compounds with lead were added to petrol to prevent knocking : `` tetraethyllead '' ( tel ) . this is now banned because the lead affects people 's health . various alternatives have been tried . 2,2,4- '' trimethylpentane '' , an isomer of octane , is one example .
