Blind spot (vision)    blind spot ( vision ) a blind spot is a part of the visual field our brains get no information from . it is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc of the retina . since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc , a part of the field of vision is not perceived . the brain fills in with surrounding detail with information from the other eye , so the blind spot is not normally perceived . although all vertebrates have this blind spot , cephalopod eyes , which are superficially similar , do not . in them , the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind , so it does not create a break in the retina . the first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the 1660s by edme mariotte in france . at the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina ; however , mariotte 's discovery disproved this theory .
