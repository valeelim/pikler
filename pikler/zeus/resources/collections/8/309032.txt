Lophotrochozoa     the lophotrochozoa ( `` crest-bearing animals '' ) are a group of animals above the level of phylum . it is not part of the usual system of classification . they were recently discovered through molecular phylogeny . they include two of the most successful animal phyla , the mollusca and annelida . the lophotrochozoa comprise two groups , the trochozoans and the lophophorata . the exact relationships between the different phyla are not entirely certain . however , it seems that neither the lophophorates nor the trochozoa are monophyletic groups by themselves , but are mixed together . - trochozoans produce trochophore larvae , which have two bands of cilia around their middle . the trochozoa include the nemertea , mollusca , sipuncula , echiura and annelida . - the lophophorata are united by the presence of a lophophore , a fan of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth . some authors considered them deuterostomes , before rna trees placed them together with the trochozoans . the lophophorata include the bryozoa , phoronida , and brachiopoda .
