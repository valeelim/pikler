Altitude     altitude means height above the ground or above the sea level . common uses include aviation ( flying , parachuting , gliding ) , and geography/surveying . in geometry it is also used as the height of the object itself . generally , altitude is the distance one thing is above another thing . this is in the vertical or `` up '' direction . for the height of the ground ( such as for hills and mountains ) , the word elevation is also used and might be a better choice . ( mountain climbers usually use the word altitude , especially when talking about how it affects the body ) . buildings and other things on the ground usually just use the word height . vertical distance measurements in the `` down '' direction are commonly referred to as depth . in aviation , the altitude can be measured and shown in several different ways . the height is either from the average sea level ( also called `` mean sea level '' or msl ) , or from the ground ( also called `` above ground level '' , or agl ) . airplanes can find their altitude by using air pressure . the air gets thinner the higher it is ( and it has less pressure , because there 's less air pushing down on it from above ) . this pressure can be measured and this can be converted into a height above sea level . the instrument for measuring altitude is the altimeter ( from `` altitude '' and `` meter '' ) . the common pressure altimeter is a type of barometer with a dial showing distance ( feet or metres ) instead of atmospheric pressure .
