Gansus     gansus is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the lower cretaceous period , between 115 to 105 million years ago ( mya ) . it was found in what is now gansu province , western china . it is the oldest-known of the ornithurae , the group which includes modern birds ( neornithes ) and extinct related groups , such as `` confuciusornis '' , `` ichthyornis '' and `` hesperornis '' . the genus `` gansus '' contains a single species , `` g. yumenensis '' , which was about the size of a pigeon and similar in appearance to loons and diving ducks . `` gansus '' was discovered in the form of a single fossil foot in 1981. five more well-preserved fossils were found in 2003â€“2004 in mudstone at the site of an ancient lake at changma , gansu ; the geological stratum in which the fossils were found is the xiagou formation . their bodies had settled in anoxic mud and were soon covered with further extremely fine silty sediments . without oxygen , their remains resisted decay : these specimens preserved remains of flight feathers and traces of the webbing between their toes .
