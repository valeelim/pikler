Herring gull     the herring gull ( `` larus argentatus '' or european herring gull ) is a large gull ( up to 26 inches or 66 cm long ) . it is the most abundant and best known of all gulls along the shores of western europe . it breeds across northern europe , western europe , scandinavia and the baltic states . some herring gulls , especially those resident in colder areas , migrate further south in winter , but many are permanent residents , e.g . in the british isles , iceland , or on the north sea shores . european herring gulls are also abundant around inland garbage dumps , and some have even adapted to life in inland cities . the taxonomy of the herring gull / lesser black-backed gull group is very complicated , with different authorities recognising between two and eight species . this group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere . differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small , but by the time the circuit is completed , the end members , herring gull and lesser black-backed gull , are clearly different species .
