Tuning fork     a tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork . the prongs , called tines , are made from a u-shaped bar of metal ( usually steel ) . this bar of metal can move freely . it resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object . it sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out . the pitch depends on the length of the two prongs . its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments , and in some tests of hearing . the tuning fork was invented in 1711 by british musician john shore . he was the sergeant trumpeter to the court , who had musical parts written for him by the composers george frideric handel and henry purcell . the fork shape produces a very pure tone . most of the vibrational energy is at the fundamental frequency , with very few overtones ( harmonics ) . this is not the case with other resonators . the reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about 5/2 = 25/4 = 6¼ times the fundamental ( about 2½ octaves above it ) . by comparison , the first overtone of a vibrating string is only one octave above the fundamental . so when the fork is struck , little of the energy goes into the overtone modes ; they also die out correspondingly faster , leaving the fundamental . it is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone , when listening to compare with the tone of each other instrument .
