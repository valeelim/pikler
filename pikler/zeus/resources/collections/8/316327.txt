Map projection     a map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three-dimensional sphere on a flat surface . such projections are necessary to create maps . the problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way ; this is called distorsion . depending on the purpose of the map , some distorsions may be acceptable . for this reason , there are different map projections that serve different purposes . carl friedrich gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane , without distorting it . this theorem is known as theorema egregium today . to understand the projections , it is easier to imagine a light source , a globe , and another geometric object . the light source shines `` a shadow '' of each point of the globe onto the geometric object . at the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled , this yields the map . it is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used . - using a plane gives azimuthal projections . - using a cone gives conical projections .
