Didcot power station     didcot power station refers to a combined coal and oil power plant ( didcot a power station ) and a natural-gas power plant ( didcot b power station ) that supply the national grid . they are right next to one another in the civil parish of sutton courtenay , next to the town of didcot in oxfordshire ( formerly in berkshire ) , in the uk . the combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the united kingdom , and six hyperbolic cooling towers , which can be seen from much of the surrounding area . this was the first power station here . it is the biggest one with the big cooling towers ( that make the cooling water cooler and make lots of steam ) that are in two groups . one group is northwest , the other group is southeast . the power station can make up to 2000 megawatts ( 2000 million watts - an 'average ' lightbulb uses only 50 or 60 watts ) at any one time . didcot 'a ' mainly burns coal , but can also burn oil , or in some cases gas . this power station can use some biomass such as wood . the fuel ( coal , oil and so on ) is first ground up in big mills if it is solid ( similar to old flour windmills , but powered by electric motors ) to give it a large surface area , and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air . here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam , which is used to turn a large steam turbine . this turbine is connected to a generator , which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the national grid .
