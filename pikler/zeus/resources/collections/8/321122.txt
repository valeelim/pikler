Transition-minimized differential signaling     transition minimized differential signaling ( or tmds ) is a standard that is used to transport uncompressed data to a digital device . the data transmitted is digital . by using a digital signal instead of an analogue signal , the impact of electromagnetic interference on the signal is reduced . this mode of transmission is mainly used for audio and visual data . tmds uses 8b/10b encoding . the code set is different from the original , developed by ibm . encoding is a two stage process that uses xor and xnor gates . whether to use xor or xnor operation is selected , so that the number ofsignal transitions is minimal ; this is where the name is from . s/pdif is a similar standard , used in consumer audio equiment .
