Vladimir Stasov     vladimir vasilievich stasov ( born 14 january 1824 , saint petersburg ; died 23 october 1906 , saint petersburg ) was a russian art and music critic . he wrote a lot about art and music in journals , newspapers and in letters to the press . he lived at a time when classical music and other forms of culture were quite new in russia . russian artists were imitating european art , but stasov encouraged them to create a culture which was typically russian , showing its own nationalism . people saw him as the champion of the new russian school in all the russian arts . he knew most of the great russian writers , artists and composers of his day , and he wrote many letters including letters to the press in which he stated his views very forcefully . stasov ’ s father was an architect . stasov graduated from the school of jurisprudence in 1843. in 1847 he began his career as a music critic . he gave a lot of support to glinka who was trying to compose music that reflected russian nationalism . in 1856 a group of five composers often got together to discuss ideas about music . stasov called this group moguchaya kuchka ( “ the mighty handful ” ) . the oldest one of the group was balakirev who was like a leader and teacher to the others . the other four were mussorgsky , cui , borodin and rimsky korsakov . they had ideas about music which were very different from those of anton rubinstein , the composer who had founded the petersburg conservatory . rubinstein thought that russian composers such as glinka were all amateurs and that music should be taught like it was in germany . stasov and balakirev were very angry about his views . they started a free music school as a rival to the conservatory . they wanted music to reflect russian folk singing , dancing and the tolling of russian church bells .
