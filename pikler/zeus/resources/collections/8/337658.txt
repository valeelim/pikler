Planning     planning is the way most organizations work to do big projects . it is thinking about what needs to happen , and then making a detailed plan . all humans plan to some extent : it is a fundamental property of intelligent behaviour . in big organisations and government planning is a main activity . it combines forecasting developments with scenarios of how to react to them . forecasting is predicting what the future will look like , whereas planning predicts what the future `` should '' look like . the `` nuts and bolts '' of planning are the documents , diagrams , and meetings , the objectives and the strategy to be followed . beyond this , planning has a different meaning depending on the context in which it is used . the counterpart to planning is self-organization , when order emerges spontaneously out of seeming chaos .
