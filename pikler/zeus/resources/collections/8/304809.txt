List of Interstate Highways     primary interstate highways are the major interstate highways of the united states and have a one or two-digit route number . `` even '' ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , or 0 ) route numbers are given to east/west routes , with the smaller numbered routes in the south ( i-10 ) and bigger numbered routes in the north ( i-90 ) . similarly , `` odd '' ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 ) route numbers are given to north/south routes , with the smaller numbered routes in the west ( i-5 ) and the bigger numbered routes in the east ( i-95 ) . there are five sets of numbers that are used more than once throughout the system ; the highways whose numbers are used more than once are separated by big distances to avoid confusion . below , these are made separate from each other by west and east . three-digit interstates are spur or loop interstates that usually are in big cities and areas outside of cities . the last two digits of a three-digit interstate are always the number of the route it is related to . if the first digit is `` odd '' ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 ) , the interstate is usually a spur route while if the first digit is `` even '' ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , or 0 ) , the interstate is usually a loop route .
