Masked booby     the masked booby , `` sula dactylatra '' , is a large seabird of the booby family , sulidae . these birds often fight each other for certain types of fish . many adults will create a flock of their own to take down a school of fish but many boobies hunt alone so their catch is not stolen by the other birds in the area . they are often mistaken for the common seagull due to the primary white color on its feathers . the masked booby nests in small colonies . it lays two chalky white eggs on sandy beaches in shallow depressions , which are incubated by both adults for 45 days . in most cases , the first chick will kill its smaller , weaker sibling after it hatches . siblicide is what it is called . research shows that the boobies can feed two chicks , but they do so at a cost to health and future reproductive success . compared to other species of boobies such as the blue-footed booby , siblicide always happens in the masked booby . one reason is because the masked boobies build very shallow flat nests , so older chicks can expel their younger siblings with relative ease . blue-footed booby parents , meanwhile , build nests with steeper sides , thus preventing some older chicks from engaging in siblicidal behaviour .
