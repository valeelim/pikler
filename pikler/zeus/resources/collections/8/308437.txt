Metric system     the metric system is a system of measurement with length based on the meter , mass or weight on the gram , and capacity ( volume ) based on the liter . this system is used around the world . it was developed in france and first introduced there in 1791 , 2 years after the beheading of king louis xvi . the metric units are based on decimal groups ( multiples of ten ) . at first the metric system was based on two quantities : length and weight . the basic units were called the `` metre '' and the `` gramme '' . in 1866 the united states started to use the metric system , but it still is not the main us system of measurement . by 1875 many countries in europe and in latin america had changed to using the metric system . in 1875 seventeen countries signed the metre convention agreeing to share responsibility for defining and managing the metre and kilogram standards . the prototype copies of the metre and of the kilogram were called the `` international prototype metre '' and `` international prototype kilogram '' . a new organization called the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm ) was set up . the international prototype metre and kilogram was kept at the bipm headquarters . in 1960 the rules for the metric system was revised . the revised system was called the `` international system of units '' ( which is often written `` si '' for short ) . the definition of si also included rules for writing si quantities . these rules are the same for all languages . in the 1970s many people in the united kingdom and the rest of the commonwealth started using the metric system at their places of work .
