Abugida     an abugida is a writing system which is between syllabic and alphabetic scripts . in such systems , sequences of consonants and vowels are written as a unit : each unit is based on the consonant letter . vowels need to be written down as well , but are secondary . this is different from a truly alphabetic script , where vowels and consonants have the same status , and an abjad , where vowels are absent , or can be left out . examples , where abugidas are used are ethiopic , and some languages found on the indian subcontinent . certain forms of shorthand use diacritics for vowels .
