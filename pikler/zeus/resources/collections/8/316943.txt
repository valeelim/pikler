Rings of Uranus     the rings of uranus are planetary rings ( circles of rock and dust ) that go around the planet uranus . there are 11 rings in total . in order of increasing distance from uranus , they are : 1986u2r/ζ , 6 , 5 , 4 , α , β , η , γ , δ , λ , ε , ν and μ. nine rings were found on 10 march 1977 by james l. elliot , edward w. dunham and douglas j. mink . scientists found two more rings in 1986 in images from the voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings in 2003–2005 in images from the hubble space telescope . most of the rings are only a few kilometres wide and are very dark . most rings are made of rocks 0.2–20 meters wide . but some rings are made of very small dust particles . the closest ring is 38,000 km away from the center of uranus and the furthest ring is 98,000 km away . scientists think that the rings are at not more than 600 million years old . the ring system was created when several moons crashed together . after crashing , the moons broke up into many pieces and made rings.people may discover more rings .
