Great Attractor     the great attractor ( ga ) is a gigantic mass in space which pulls our milky way galaxy , and many other galaxies towards it . the great attractor is known by its effect on the movement of galaxies across hundreds of millions of light years ( mly ) . its mass is equivalent to the mass of tens of thousands of milky ways . all the galaxies in the ga are redshifted , in accordance with the expansion of the universe . they are receding relative to us and to each other , but the variations in their redshift show the existence of the attractor . the variations in their redshifts range from about +700 km/s to -700 km/s , depending on where they are in relation to the great attractor . the position of the great attractor was finally worked out in 1986. it is between 150 and 250 million light years ( 47â€“79 million parsecs ) away . objects in that direction lie in the zone of avoidance , which is the part of the night sky obscured by the milky way galaxy . because of this , they are difficult to study with visible light . however , x-ray observations have revealed that the region of space is dominated by the norma cluster , a massive cluster of galaxies , with large , old galaxies , many of which are colliding with their neighbours , and/or radiating large amounts of radio waves .
