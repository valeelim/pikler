Mirex     mirex is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that was commercialized as an insecticide . it was later banned because it was harmful to the environment . this white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of cyclopentadiene . it was popularized to control fire ants but by virtue of its chemical robustness and lipophilicity it was recognized as a bioaccumulative pollutant . however , the spread of the red imported fire ant was actually encouraged by the use of mirex , as it also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants . the united states environmental protection agency prohibited its use in 1976 .
