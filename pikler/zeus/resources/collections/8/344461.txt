Viviparity     vivparous animals have internal fertilisation and the eggs develop inside the mother . the key idea is that the growing embryo gets its nutrition from a placenta in the mother 's womb . it is the standard method for all mammals except monotremes . those reptiles which do not lay eggs mostly keep soft-shelled eggs inside their bodies . the embryo exists on the material in the egg . they are ovoviviparus , because of the source of nutrition . however , there are some amphibians and a few reptiles which are genuinely viviparous because they get their nutrition direct from the mother . viviparous plants produce seeds that germinate before they detach from the parent . in many mangroves , for instance , the seedling germinates and grows under its own energy while still attached to its parent . then it drops into the water to transport away . in some trees , like jackfruit , the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe . this condition is not vivipary because the moist and humid conditions just mimics a wet soil . however , the seeds can germinate under soil too .
