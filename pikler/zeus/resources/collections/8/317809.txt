Kenneth G. Wilson     kenneth geddes wilson ( june 8 , 1936 â€“ june 15 , 2013 ) was an american theoretical physicist and nobel prize winner . as an undergraduate at harvard , he was a putnam fellow . he earned his phd from caltech in 1961 , studying under murray gell-mann . he became a junior faculty member in cornell university physics department in 1963. he became a full professor in 1970. in 1974 , he became the james a. weeks professor of physics at cornell . he was a co-winner of the wolf prize in physics in 1980 , together with michael e. fisher and leo kadanoff . he got the 1982 nobel prize in physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions . in other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group . in this theory he gave not only important , and even numerical , insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics , but indirectly also basic answers to the question : `` what is quantum field theory ? '' and `` what does renormalization mean ? '' . he also gave a constructive answer to another important `` renormalization '' problem from solid-state physics , the kondo effect .
