Crab nebula     the crab nebula is a supernova remnant and 'pulsar wind nebula ' in the constellation of taurus . the nebula was observed by john bevis in 1731 ; it corresponds to a bright supernova recorded by chinese and islamic astronomers in 1054. the nebula is about 6,500 light-years ( 2 kpc ) from earth . it has a diameter of 11 ly ( 3.4 pc ) and expands at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second . it is part of the perseus arm of the milky way galaxy . at the center of the nebula lies the crab pulsar , a neutron star ( or spinning ball of neutrons ) , 28â€“30 km across , which emits pulses of radiation from gamma ray bursts to radio waves with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second . the nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion . the nebula acts as a source of radiation for studying celestial bodies between it and us . in the 1950s and 1960s , the sun 's corona was mapped from observations of the crab 's radio waves passing through it , and in 2003 , the thickness of the atmosphere of saturn 's moon titan was measured as it blocked out x-rays from the nebula .
