Interpolation     in many domains of science , measurements are done . if these measurements are drawn in a graph , they will be shown as simple unconnected points . such data are called data points , or discrete . handling and analysis of the data is easier , if it can be described using a continuous function , or a line connecting the discrete data point together . in order to do this , the line between two measurements , or data points , need to be created . this process of connecting the data points together with a line called interpolation . there are different ways to invent the data , such as simply drawing a straight line between two data points , which is not very accurate , or using polynomials to create a more accurate representation . in many cases , the results of this interpolation are usable , either as a replacement for missing data points , or as a tool to help understand more complicated data . interpolation tries to find the values between two known points of data . it is not to be confused with extrapolation , which is a similar process that tries to find data points at the edge or outside the currently defined points .
