Mount Stromlo Observatory     mount stromlo observatory ( mso ) just outside of canberra , australia , is part of the research school of astronomy and astrophysics at the australian national university ( anu ) . the observatory was built in 1924 as the commonwealth solar observatory . mount stromlo had already been used for observations in the previous decade , with a small observatory being built in 1911 by pietro baracchi using the oddie telescope . the dome built to house the oddie telescope was the first commonwealth building built in the new australian capital territory . until world war ii , the observatory specialised in solar and atmospheric observations . during the war the workshops made gun sights , and other optical equipment . after the war , the observatory began stellar and galactic astronomy and was renamed the commonwealth observatory . when anu began in 1946 in nearby canberra , they shared staff and started graduate studies . in 1957 the mount stromlo observatory became part of the anu . on january 18 , 2003 , a huge bushfire hit canberra and mount stromlo . the observatory was surrounded by a plantation pine forest . five telescopes , workshops , seven homes and the historic administration building were destroyed . the only telescope to escape the fires was the 1868 15-centimetre farnham telescope . some items from the fire are on display in the national museum of australia . they include a melted telescope mirror and a piece of melted optical glass ( flint ) . the latter has pieces of charcoal and wire fused into it from the fierce heat of the fire .
