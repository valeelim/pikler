Overfishing     overfishing is catching too much fish . it is a type of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to low levels . it is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term . also , what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them ( tragedy of the commons ) . so much fish is caught that the there are too few adults of certain species left . with cod , for example , the greatest production of eggs is from large females . but these are caught , and the average size of spawning females has gone down . eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced . the artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females . the northwest atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range , resulting in a crash in the fishery in the united states and canada during the early 1990s . consumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them . related pages .
