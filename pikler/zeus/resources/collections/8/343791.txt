Macedonian phalanx     the macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by philip ii . it was used by his son alexander the great to conquer the persian empire . the formation was made up of spearmen carrying 18 to 20 ft ( 5.56 m ) long spears . these were called sarissas . they were two-handed ; the smaller shields were slung over the left shoulder . the macedonian phalanx was impregnable from the front , but vulnerable from the sides and back , where it could be attacked by the enemy cavalry . therefore , the system required protection , which it got from the macedonian cavalry , which was the most flexible force . at the start of a battle , alexander used the phalanx to pin down the enemy . his heavy cavalry would drive the enemy horse from the field , and then charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks . then , the phalanx would move against the centre . the early greek city states often fought on narrow valley floors , where cavalry was not so important . often , there was little or no cavalry . but in the greco-persian wars , the battles were fought on more open land , where cavalry was a great force . an example of this is the battle of gaugamela . there , alexander manoeuvered to the right to prevent a double envelopment from the persian army . darius commanded his cavalry on his left flank to check the oblique movement of the greeks by attacking their cavalry . alexander 's companion cavalry then charged the weakened enemy center where darius was posted and were followed by the phalanx formation .
