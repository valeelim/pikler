Manicouagan crater     the manicouagan crater is one of the oldest known impact craters . it is in the côte-nord region of québec , canada . it was caused by the impact of a diameter asteroid about 215.5 million years ago , in the upper triassic . the crater is a multiple-ring structure about across . its inner ring is its most prominent feature . this is a diameter annular lake , the manicouagan reservoir , surrounding an inner island plateau . it is the earth 's fifth largest confirmed impact crater . the manicouagan crater may have been part of a multiple impact event which also formed the rochechouart crater in france , saint martin crater in manitoba , obolon ' crater in ukraine , and red wing crater in north dakota . the five craters form a chain , indicating the breakup and subsequent impact of an asteroid or comet , like the impacts of comet shoemaker-levy 9 on jupiter in 1994. laser argon-argon dating of the glass formed by the impacts , and stratigraphic evidence , support an age of 215 ± 25 myr . the impact locations have moved large distances in the intervening 214 million years . three of the craters—rochechouart , manicouagan and saint martin—formed a chain at latitude 22.8° n , while obolon ' and red wing lay on identical declination paths with rochechouart and saint martin respectively . all of the craters had previously been known and studied , but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated . the chance that these craters could be aligned like this due to chance are nearly zero .
