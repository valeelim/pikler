Sonar     sonar is a machine that uses underwater sound waves to find other objects in the sea . a sonar can work by sending out sound and listening for echoes ( active sonar ) , like a radar , or by listening for sound made by the object it is trying to find ( passive sonar ) . the basic parts of an active sonar are : - the transmitter creates the sound waves . - the hydrophone or hydrophone array converts the sound waves into electricity . active sonar was first used in 1917 by paul langevin . the word `` sonar '' was created during the second world war as an acronym for sound navigation and ranging . this acronym replaced the british acronym asdic . the word is now thought by many people as a regular word , no longer as an acronym .
