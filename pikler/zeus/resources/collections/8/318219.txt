Volcanic winter     a volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption . such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities . they form aerosols of sulfuric acid . when they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected , and some is absorbed by the stratosphere . these reactions heat up the stratosphere , but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground . the siberian traps , emeishan traps , and deccan traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism . they are the cause , or part of the cause , of several mass extinctions , especially the permian–triassic extinction event . nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war . the effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant . most recently , the 1991 explosion of mount pinatubo , a stratovolcano in the philippines , cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years . in 1883 , the explosion of krakatoa ( krakatau ) created volcanic winter-like conditions . the next four years after the explosion were unusually cold , and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards . record snowfalls were recorded worldwide .
