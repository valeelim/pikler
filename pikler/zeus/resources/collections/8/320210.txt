Electric flux     imagine an electric field e passing through a surface . consider an infinitesimal area ( da ) on that surface across which e remains constant . also assume that the angle between e and da is i. the electric flux is defined as edacos ( i ) . e and da are vectors . flux is the dot product of e and da . using full vector notation , the electric flux formula_1 through a small area formula_2 is given by the electric flux over a surface `` s '' is therefore given by the surface integral : where e is the electric field and da is a differential area on the surface formula_5 with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction . for a closed gaussian surface , electric flux is given by : where q is the net charge enclosed by the surface ( including both free and bound charge ) , and Îµ is the electric constant . this relation is known as gauss ' law for electric field in its integral form and it is one of the four maxwell 's equations . electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface . but the net electric field , e , in the gauss ' law equation , can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface . gauss ' law is true in all situations , but people can only use it to calculate when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field . examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry . otherwise , the calculations are too hard to do by hand and must be worked out using a computer .
