Sonitpur     sonitpur is a major district of assam , india . the name `` sonitpur '' as well as `` tezpur '' literally means `` the city of blood '' . it reminds of the romantic legend of usha and anirudha . the legend revolves around banasura , the great asura king of ancient tezpur , his beautiful daughter usha and her friend chitralekha . the princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him . chitralekha , a talented artist , not only painted his portrait from usha 's description but recognised him to be aniruddha , the grandson of lord krishna and ruler of dwarka . using her magical powers , chitralekha spirited aniruddha away to the princess ' boudoir where the two married each other according to gandharva rites , without the knowledge of the king . when banasura learnt of the clandestine romance , he imprisoned aniruddha , which led to the arrival of lord krishna to rescue his grandson . a fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood , hence the name sonitpur or tezpur , i.e . ‘ the city of blood ’ .
