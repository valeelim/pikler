Direct proof     a direct proof is a way of showing that something is true or false by using logic . this is done by combining known facts . no assumptions are made when doing a direct proof . lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs . a statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form `` if `` p '' , then `` q '' . '' here , `` p '' and `` q '' are facts . to solve a statement like this , every case where `` p '' is true must be considered . for example , this statement can be solved with a direct proof : `` if x and y are even integers , then x+y is an even integer . '' since x and y are even , then we can say that `` x=2m '' and `` y=2n , '' where `` m '' and `` n '' are integers . ( this is a lemma . ) we can also say that `` m+n '' is an integer , because adding two integers gives an integer . ( this is another lemma . ) then we can say that `` x+y=2m+2n=2 ( m+n ) '' . since `` m+n '' is an integer , we can say `` 2 ( m+n ) =2k '' , where `` k=m+n '' . we know that any integer times 2 is an even integer . we can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer .
