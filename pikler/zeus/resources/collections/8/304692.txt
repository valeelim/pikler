Oxytocin     oxytocin is a hormone found in mammals . it acts on the brain . in humans it is released during female reproduction , especially during and after childbirth . it has other effects . it encourages pair bonding , and parental behaviour . it is released during intimate moments during orgasms and even hugs . for this reason it is often called the 'love hormone ' . strange to say , the oxytocin released by the pituitary gland can not reach the brain : it does have effects on the rest of the body . the reason is that there is a bloodbrain barrier which prevents large molecules from getting into the brain . instead , the hormone is produced by special nerve cells inside the brain . oxytocin is also released through the use of recreational drugs like mdma and some prescription anti-depressants . oxytocin was the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced and synthesized , by vincent du vigneaud and colleagues in 1953 .
