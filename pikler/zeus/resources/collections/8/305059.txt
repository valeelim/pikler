Lower Triassic     the lower triassic is the first of three epochs of the triassic period . it lasted from about 252.2 million years ago ( mya ) to ~247.2 mya . the lower triassic is the oldest epoch of the mesozoic era . these rocks were laid down just after the great permianâ€“triassic extinction event . the lower triassic was called the scythian stage , which can be found in older literature . in europe , most of the lower triassic is composed of sandstone . it is a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds . they were formed on land under desert conditions . the massive extinctions that ended the paleozoic era caused extreme hardship for the surviving species . many types of corals , brachiopods , molluscs , echinoderms , and other invertebrates had completely disappeared . the most common hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves , gastropods , ammonites , echinoids , and a few articulate brachiopods . the most common land animal was the herbivorous synapsid `` lystrosaurus '' . the earliest triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were like that throughout the epoch . recovery on land took 30 million years .
