Overclocking     overclocking is the process of configuring a computer processor or other electronic circuit to run faster than it was designed to . overclocking allows a computer to be faster and more responsive . overclocked processors tend to use more electricity and make more heat than those running at their intended speed . it is often necessary to install a better heat sink to avoid overheating the processor . if a processor is overclocked too high , it can damage the processor or make the computer unstable . increasing the voltage to the processor can allow it to be run at even higher speeds where it would otherwise be unstable , but this carries an especially high risk of damaging the processor . overclocking is usually done in the computer 's bios setup utility . most brand-name computers such as dell , hp , and others do not allow overclocking in the bios setup utility , but custom-built computers usually do . it is also possible to do the opposite , called underclocking , where the processor is run at a lower speed than intended . this may be done to extend battery life and reduce heat output . underclocking will not usually damage a processor and may in fact make it last longer . some processors automatically underclock themselves when the computer is not doing a lot of work .
