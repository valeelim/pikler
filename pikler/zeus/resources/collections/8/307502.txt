Biophysical chemistry     biophysical chemistry studies biological systems . it is a relatively new branch of chemistry . it looks for explanations of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems . biophysical chemists employ various tools used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems . these tools include spectroscopic methods like nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and x-ray diffraction . for example , the nobel prize in chemistry in 2009 was based on x-ray diffraction studies of ribosomes . biophysical chemists study protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes . for example , enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion . similarly , biophysical chemists study the structure and function of the biomembranes using model supramolecular structures . these include liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes .
