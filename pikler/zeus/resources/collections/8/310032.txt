Zygomycota     zygomycota , or zygote fungi , is a large group of 1600 species of fungi . fungi are put into groups by the way they reproduce . the name `` zygommcota '' comes from zygosporangia , where strong and tough round shaped spores are formed during sexual reproduction . they are mostly found living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material . some are parasites of plants , insects , and small animals . others form symbiotic relationships with plants , where the plant and the fungi need each other to grow . zygomycete hyphae may be a syncytium , that is , having a mass of nuclei not divided into separate cells . on occasion these can be divided into separate parts by a cell wall called a septum . this only happens where gametes are formed , or to wall off dead hyphae .
