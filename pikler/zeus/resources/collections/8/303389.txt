Adélie penguin     the adélie penguin ( `` pygoscelis adeliae '' ) is a penguin that is all black except for a white chest and belly , and a white ring around their eyes . there are about 2.5 million adélie penguins in the southern ocean around antarctica . adélie penguins travel the furthest to breed because they build their nests from stones and need to find stones . adélies come ashore to breed in the summer . in the winter , they live on ice that floats off the antarctic shore . adélie parents take turns keeping their chicks warm and fed . while one watches the nest , the other goes into the ocean to catch krill . the penguins carry the krill back to the nest in their stomachs . then they regurgitate it to feed their chicks . most adélie penguins incubate two eggs at a time . the little chicks hatch out at about the same time . one is usually stronger than the other and has a better chance of surviving . when first born , the chicks are kept warm by their parents . but after two or three weeks , they grow a thick , woolly gray down . then they join other chicks in creches , or nursery groups .
