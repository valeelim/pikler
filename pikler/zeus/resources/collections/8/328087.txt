Orion nebula     the orion nebula , or messier 42 , m42 , or ngc 1976 , is a diffuse nebula . it is one of the brightest nebulae , and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky . m42 is at a distance of 1,344 Â± 20 light years . it is the closest region of massive star formation to earth . it is south of the orion 's belt in the constellation of orion . big as it is , the orion nebula is just part of an even larger star-forming area known as the orion complex . the nebula is a huge stellar nursery . 700 stars are in the process of forming there . at its heart is a very young open cluster , known as the trapezium because of the pattern formed by its main stars . recent observations with the hubble space telescope have shown protoplanetary disks inside the orion nebula . this is a major discovery . they are called `` proplyds '' for short . there are more than 150 of these in the nebula . they are thought to be to be systems in the earliest stages of planetary system formation . the sheer numbers have been used as evidence that the formation of star systems is fairly common in the universe .
