Endogamy     endogamy is the idea that a person ought to marry another person from the same group as them . the type of group is not always the same ; it could be based on a religion , a class or a social group . often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages , this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love . by marrying a person with the same group characteristics , it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something . many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility , which can be due to choice . but there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed . by doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds . for example , when moving to another country , a sikh family may actively look for other sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate sikh marriages . by merging , they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority .
