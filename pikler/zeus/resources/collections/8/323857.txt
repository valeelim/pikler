Cantor set     the cantor set is a subset of real numbers with certain properties that are interesting to mathematicians . these properties relate to topology , measurement , geometry , as well as set theory . some of them are : - when represented geometrically , the set is a fractal , it has a hausdorff dimension which is not an integer - it has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers - it is self-similar the set is named after georg cantor . henry john stephen smith discovered it in 1875 , and cantor first described it in 1883. the set is made by starting with a line segment and repeatedly removing the middle third . the cantor set is the ( infinite ) set of points left over . the cantor set is `` more infinite '' than the set of natural numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. ) . this property is called uncountability . it is related to the smith–volterra–cantor set and the menger sponge . the cantor set is self-similar . related pages . - fractal - set theory - smith–volterra–cantor set - cantor dust - menger sponge
