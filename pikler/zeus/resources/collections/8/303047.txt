Vector calculus     vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that investigates vector fields and how they change over time . vector calculus usually studies two- or three-dimensional vector fields , but can be used in higher dimensions , too . it is a part of the study of multivariable calculus . vector calculus is useful in physics and engineering because of how it can look at `` electromagnetic '' and `` gravitational '' fields .
