Lee Hartwell     leland harrison ( lee ) hartwell ( born october 30 , 1939 , in los angeles , california ) is former president and director of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , washington . he shared the 2001 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with paul nurse and tim hunt , for their discoveries of protein molecules that control cell division . when cells divide , they divide in phases called g1 ( growth ) , s ( synthesis ) , g2 ( growth ) , and m ( mitosis ) . nurse , hartwell and hunt together discovered two proteins , cyclin and cdk ( cyclin dependent kinase ) , which control the change from one stage to another . these proteins are called `` checkpoints '' , because they check whether the cell has divided properly . if the cell does not divide correctly , other proteins will try to repair it . if that does not work , they will destroy the cell . if a cell divides incorrectly and survives , it may cause cancer and other serious diseases . working in baker 's yeast ( `` saccharomyces cerevisiae '' ) , hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control , and cdc genes such as cdc28 , which controls the start of the cycle â€“ the progression through g1 .
