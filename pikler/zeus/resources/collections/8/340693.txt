Rheumatoid arthritis     rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a serious , painful , and chronic ( long-lasting ) disease . it is an autoimmune disease - a disease where the body 's immune system attacks healthy cells . when a person has ra , their immune system attacks the joints and the tissues around the joints in the body . this causes different problems , like : - the capsules around the joints get swollen - the body makes too much synovial fluid ( the special fluid that is supposed to cushion the joints ) - tough fibrous tissue builds up in the synovium area ( which is also supposed to help cushion the joints ) eventually , ra can destroy a person 's articular cartilage . normally , articular ( having to do with the joints ) cartilage covers the end of bones where they come together to form joints . this keeps the bones from rubbing against each other . if the articular cartilage has been destroyed by ra , the bones will rub against each other , which is very painful . no one knows what causes ra , but some theories are that it has to do with hormones , environment , and genes . there is no cure , but doctors have determined ways to help slow down and reduce the impact of the disease . women are two to three times more likely than men to get rheumatoid arthritis . most cases of ra occur in people between the ages of 25 and 55 .
