Mathematical model     a mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language . the process of building a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling . mathematical models are used in the natural sciences ( such as physics , biology , earth science , meteorology ) and engineering disciplines ( e.g . computer science , artificial intelligence ) . they are also used in the social sciences ( such as economics , psychology , sociology and political science ) . physicists , engineers , statisticians , operations research analysts and economists use mathematical models a lot . mathematical models can take many forms . the types of models include : - dynamical systems - for systems that change , - statistical models - for finding patterns in large groups of measurements or data , - differential equations - to study how variables change over time , or - game theoretic models - for studying how many independent decision makers can interact . these and other types of models can overlap , with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures . mathematical models can include logical models . in many cases , the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models built on theory agree with results of repeatable experiments . when theoretical mathematical models do not match experimental measurements , scientists try to correct the model . such corrections lead the way to better theories to explain the facts .
