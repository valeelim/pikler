Type specimen     in biology , a type specimen is a particular specimen to which a scientific name is formally attached . for this purpose a specimen is something that can be kept , unchanging , for a long time ( for centuries ) . a specimen may be an organism , a part of an organism , or many small organisms together . preferably a type specimen should be kept where researchers may have a chance to study it . often , type specimens are kept in museums and the like . a type specimen need not be typical , that is , it need not be representative . a type specimen can be assigned when a name is first published , or it can be assigned later . besides type specimens there are other form of types . one particular type specimen may have any number of scientific names attached to it . for example the names `` fabaceae '' ( family ) , `` faboideae '' ( subfamily ) , and `` faba '' ( genus ) all have the same specimen as the type . for any one circumscription , position , and rank of a taxon only one name can be correct ( for a genus that includes the type specimens of the names `` vicia '' and `` faba '' , both , the correct name will be `` vicia '' ) .
