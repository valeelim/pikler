Nematode     the nematodes or roundworms are one of the most diverse of all animal phyla . they are one of the ecdysozoan phyla . nematode species look very similar to one another . over 80,000 have been described , of which over 15,000 are parasitic . it has been estimated that the total number of described and undescribed roundworms might be more than 500,000. the body structure is fairly constant . a thick cuticle gives protection , and acts as a kind of hydrostatic skeleton . `` caenorhabditis elegans '' has had its genetics studied intensively , and had its genome analysed in 1998. dna sequence analysis of nematodes is quite advanced , including trees of species relationship . cell numbers in the organs are constant within a species . nematodes have a fixed , genetically determined number of cells , a phenomenon known as eutely . the male `` c. elegans '' has 1031 cells , a number which does not change after cell division stops at the end of the larval period . growth is solely due to an increase in the size of individual cells .
