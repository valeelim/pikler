Facies     facies is a term in geology . it means the look of a rock . if one looks up at a cliff of rock , the appearances changes from one layer to another . this because the ecological conditions changed as the rock was laid down . so , the facies reflect the process of sedimentation . regular changes in the facies usually means regular changes in the ancient climate . as the climate chaged , so the sea level rose and fell . what was deep water became shallow water , and so on . in the milankovich cycle , the climate changes regularly . as it does so , deeper water carbonates may alternate with shallow-water shales and silts . these `` facies '' are seen in the column of rocks . definition :
