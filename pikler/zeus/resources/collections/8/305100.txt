Harmonium     a harmonium , also called a `` melodeon '' , `` reed organ '' or `` pump organ '' , is a keyboard instrument that is a lot like an organ . it makes sound by blowing air through reeds , which are tuned to different pitches to make musical notes . a harmonium can be made to work using either the feet or the hands : - in a foot-pumped harmonium , the player presses two pedals with his or her feet , one at a time . this is joined to a mechanism which operates a bellows , sending air to the reeds . in this way , both of the player 's hands are free to play the keyboard . this type was invented in 1842 by alexandre debain of paris , although similar instruments have been made in other places around the same time . - in a hand-pumped harmonium , the player pushes and pulls a handle back and forth with one hand , which is joined to the bellows that blows the air . because of this , he or she can only use one hand to play the keys as the other has to keep pumping the bellows . some players can pump enough air with one hand , and then play the keys with both hands , when necessary .
