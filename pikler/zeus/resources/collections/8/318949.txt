Nucleophile     a nucleophile is a species that donates an electron-pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a reaction . all molecules or ions with a free pair of electrons can be nucleophiles . this pair of electrons is called lone pair . because nucleophiles donate electrons , they fit the definition of lewis bases . nucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei . nucleophilicity , sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength , refers to a substance 's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms . neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are called `` solvolysis '' . nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions . in those reactions , a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge . the terms `` nucleophile '' and `` electrophile '' were introduced by christopher kelk ingold in 1929 , replacing the terms `` cationoid '' and `` anionoid '' proposed earlier by a. j. lapworth in 1925. the word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the greek word φιλος , philos for love .
