Islam in Iran     the islamic conquest of persia ( 637-651 ) led to the end of the sassanid empire and the eventual decline of the zoroastrian religion in persia . however , the achievements of the previous persian civilizations were not lost , but were to a great extent absorbed by the new islamic polity . islam has been the official religion of iran since then , except short duration after mongol raid and establishment of ilkhanate . iran became an islamic republic after the islamic revolution of 1979. before the islamic conquest , the persians had been mainly zoroastrian , however , there were also large and thriving christian and jewish communities . eastern iran ( what is now afghanistan ) was predominantly buddhist . there was a slow but steady movement of the population toward islam . when islam was introduced to iranians , the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert , islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the `` dihqans '' , or landed gentry . by the late 11th century , the majority of persians had become muslim , at least nominally .
