Vulcanoid asteroid     vulcanoid asteroids are a special group of asteroids which may orbit close to the sun , closer than the orbit of the planet mercury . no vulcanoid has ever been discovered ; it is not known if they ever existed . because they would orbit so close to the sun they could only be seen during twilight , or a solar eclipse . there very small size could make them impossible to see . this part of the solar system is described as being gravitationally stable , and every other similar stable area has asteroids . if they do exist , vulcanoids would be made of material that would help explain the formation of the planets . if they do not exist , then theories about how the planets were formed might have to change . they are called vulcanoids after a planet , vulcan , which early astronomers thought they had seen close to the sun .
