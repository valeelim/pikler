Palaeoproterozoic     the palaeoproterozoic was the first era of the proterozoic eon . it came after the archaean eon , and lasted from 2500 to 1600 million years ago ( mya ) . in the palaeoproterozoic , there was a huge production of stromatolites by cyanobacteria . the first unicellular eukaryote organisms also appeared in the fossil record . the first supercontinent grew , and some of the rocks were normal sedimentary rocks , not metamorphosed . because the earth was only half as old as now , there were some basic differences from today . heat in the earth 's interior was greater than today . this was mainly due to the higher abundance of radioactive isotopes , which decay as time passes . temperatures at the surface were also higher , due to radiation from the earth 's interior , and due to a methane and carbon dioxide-based greenhouse atmosphere . during the previous eon , the archaean , the oceans were hot ( 55–85 °c ) . this was only partly balanced by the fact that the sun 's radiation was lower at that time .
