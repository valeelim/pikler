Rocket candy     rocket candy is a type of fuel that pushes model rockets . the fuel burns and pushes air out of the rocket 's nozzle ( the narrowest part of the motor ) , which pushes the rocket in a forward direction . rocket candy is not really a type of candy . it is made of sugar , but it is used to power rockets . rocket candy is made of three different parts . the three parts are the fuel , the part that uses oxygen ( air ) to make the fuel burn more completely , and the extra chemicals . the fuel is made of a sugar . sucrose is the most commonly used type of sugar . sucrose is known as table sugar . the most common part that uses oxygen to make the fuel burn more completely is potassium nitrate ( kno ) . this part is also called an oxidizer . the extra chemicals can be many different things . they can change the speed of the fuel burning . extra chemicals can also make the liftoff and flight more exciting and interesting to watch . a normal rocket candy ‘ recipe ’ is made of 65 % oxidizer and 35 % fuel . rocket candy is made in different ways . one of these ways is ‘ dry compression ’ . for dry compression , the rocket candy does not need to be heated . the parts need to be ground into small particles . then the mixture is packed into the motor . another way to make rocket candy is called ‘ dry heating ’ . dry heating does not actually melt the kno ( chemical used as the oxidizer ) , but it melts the sugar and then the kno is mixed into the sugar . there is also a third way of making rocket candy called ‘ dissolving and heating ’ . in dissolving and heating , the mixture of fuel ingredients is heated , and both the oxidizer and the fuel are melted and then combine together .
