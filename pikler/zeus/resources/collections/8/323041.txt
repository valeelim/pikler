Collatz conjecture     the collatz conjecture is a conjecture ( an idea which many people think is likely ) in mathematics . it is named after lothar collatz . he first proposed it in 1937. it is about what happens when something is done repeatedly ( over and over ) starting at some integer `` n '' : - if `` n '' is even ( divisible by two ) , `` n '' is halved ( divide by two = take its half ) . - if `` n '' is odd ( not divisible by two ) , `` n '' is changed to formula_1 . the conjecture states that if `` n '' is positive , `` n '' will always reach one . here is an example sequence : - 9 - 28 ( 9 is odd , so we triple it and add one ) - 14 ( 28 is even ; 14 is half of 28 ) - 7 ( 14 is even , 7 is its half ) - 22 ( formula_2 ) - 11 - 34 - 17 - 52 - 26 - 13 - 40 - 20 - 10 - 5 - 16 ( 16 is a power of two , so it will lead to 1 , halving each time ) - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 ( after 1 comes 4 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 2 , 1 , etc . )
