Temporal lobe     the temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain . the temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex . it is also important for the processing of semantics ( meaning ) in both speech and vision . the temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory . an area in the sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex . this part of the cortex ( primary auditory cortex ) is involved in hearing . other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing . in humans this includes speech , for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized . wernicke 's area , which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes , plays a key role ( with broca 's area , which is in the frontal lobe ) . the functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension , naming , verbal memory and other language functions .
