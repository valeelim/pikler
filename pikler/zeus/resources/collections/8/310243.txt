Dieldrin     dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon originally produced in 1948 by j. hyman & co , denver , as an insecticide . dieldrin is closely related to aldrin . aldrin reacts further to form dieldrin . aldrin is not toxic to insects ; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound . both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the diels-alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene . dieldrin was developed as an alternative to ddt and has proved to be a highly effective insecticide . it was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s . endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin . however , it is an extremely persistent organic pollutant ; it does not degrade easily . furthermore it tends to biomagnify as it is passed along the food chain . long-term exposure has proven toxic to a very wide range of animals including humans . for this reason it is now banned in most of the world . it has been linked to health problems such as parkinson 's disease , breast cancer , and immune , reproductive , and nervous system damage . it can also adversely affect testicular descent in the fetus if a pregnant woman is exposed to dieldrin .
