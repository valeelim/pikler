Simple aromatic rings     simple aromatic rings , also known as simple arenes or simple aromatics , are aromatic organic compounds . they consist only of a conjugated planar ring system with delocalized pi electron clouds . many simple aromatic rings have trivial names . they are usually found as substructures of more complex molecules ( `` substituted aromatics '' ) . typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene , indole , and cyclotetradecaheptaene . simple aromatic rings with non-carbon ring atoms are called `` heterocyclic '' . for example , rings can include oxygen , nitrogen , or sulfur . molecules with one ring are called monocyclic as in benzene . molecules with two rings are called bicyclic as in naphthalene . molecules with more than two rings are called polycyclic as in anthracene . simple monocyclic aromatic rings are usually five-membered rings like pyrrole or six-membered rings like pyridine . fused aromatic rings consist of monocyclic rings that share their connecting bonds . the nitrogen ( n ) -containing aromatic rings can be separated into basic aromatic rings that are easily protonated , and form aromatic cations and salts ( e.g. , pyridinium ) , and non-basic aromatic rings .
