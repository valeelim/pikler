Solid-state chemistry     solid-state chemistry , ( also called materials chemistry ) is the study of the synthesis , structure , and properties of solid phase materials . it focuses on non-molecular solids . it has much in common with solid-state physics , mineralogy , crystallography , ceramics , metallurgy , thermodynamics , materials science and electronics . it focuses on the synthesis of new materials and their characterization . technology helps solid-state inorganic chemistry . solid-state chemistry works to make materials used in commerce . researchers serve industry , as well as answering academic questions . there were many important discoveries in the 20th century : zeolite and platinum-based catalysts for petroleum processing in the 1950s , high-purity silicon as a core component of microelectronic devices in the 1960s , and “ high temperature ” superconductivity in the 1980s . william lawrence bragg invented x-ray crystallography in the early 1900s , which brought further discoveries . carl wagner 's worked on oxidation rate theory , counter diffusion of ions , and defect chemistry . this work showed how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state . because of this , he has sometimes been referred to as the `` father of solid state chemistry '' .
