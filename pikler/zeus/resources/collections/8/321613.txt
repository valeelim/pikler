Teleology     teleology is a philosophical idea that things have goals or causes . it is the `` view that developments are due to the purpose or design which is served by them '' . an example would be aristotle 's view of nature , later adopted by the catholic church . the word `` teleological '' comes from the ancient greek `` telos '' , which means `` end '' or `` purpose '' . a simpler example would be a tool such as the clock , which is designed by man to tell the time . whether or not an entity ( man or god ) is needed to cause teleology to happen is one of the most important questions . all cultures we know of have creation stories in their religions . however , much of science operates on the principle that the natural world is self-organising . this applies particularly to astronomy and biology , which were once explained as the action of a deity , and are now seen as natural and automatically self-organising . cybernetics is the basic science of self-organising systems . the general issue of whether the original sense of teleology applies to the natural world is still a matter of controversy between religion and science .
