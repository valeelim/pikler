Drag racing     drag racing is a competition between specially prepared automobiles or motorcycles . racers compete , two at a time , to be the first to cross a finish line . races are run from a standing start , in a straight line , over a measured distance , usually a Â¼-mile straight track . the race track , known as a dragstrip , usually uses an electronic timing system to decide the winner . before each race , each driver is allowed to perform a burnout by spinning the driving tires . burnouts heat the driving tires and lay rubber down at the beginning of the track to improve traction . the drivers then line up at the starting line . races are started electronically by a system known as a christmas tree . below the staging lights are three large amber lights , a green light , and a red light . when both drivers are staged , the tree is set to start the race causing the three large amber lights to illuminate , followed by the green light . if the front tires leave the starting line before the green light illuminates , the red light for that driver 's lane illuminates instead . this indicates disqualification ( unless a more serious violation occurs ) . once a driver commits a red-light foul ( also known as `` redlighting '' ) , the other driver can also commit a foul start by leaving the line too early but still win , having left later . should both drivers leave after the green light illuminates , the one leaving first is said to have a `` holeshot advantage '' .
