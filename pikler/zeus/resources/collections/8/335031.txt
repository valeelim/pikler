Bombyliidae     the bombyliidae are a family of flies . their common name is bee flies . the bombyliidae are a large family of flies . it has hundreds of genera , but the life cycles of most species are known poorly , or not at all . some are very small ( 2 mm in length ) , but some can be very large for flies ( wingspan of some 40 mm ) . adults normally feed on nectar and pollen . those with a spectacularly long proboscis are adapted to plants ( such as `` lapeirousia '' ) which have long , narrow floral tubes . the bombyliidae include a large number of species , but for its size this is one of the least understood families of insects . there at least 4,500 described species , and certainly thousands still to be described . the adult flies usually feed on nectar and pollen , and some are important pollinators . many bombyliidae look like bees and so a common name for the family is the bee flies . the reason is probably aposematic : the adults are safer from predators because they share the warning colours of bees . the adult females usually lay eggs near the nests of possible hosts , often in the burrows of solitary bees , wasps or beetles .
