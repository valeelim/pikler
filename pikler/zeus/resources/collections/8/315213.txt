Atmel AVR     the avr microcontroller architecture was developed by atmel in 1996. it is based on the harvard microcontroller architecture . the avr was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage , as opposed to one-time programmable rom , eprom , or eeprom used by other microcontrollers at the time . many people think that avr stands for alf ( egil bogen ) and vegard ( wollan ) 's risc processor '' . this architecture replaces older mcs-51 architecture . one machine cycle of mcs-51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle . avr microcontrollers ( mcus ) can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too , but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle . performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with avr . the core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to alu . it allowing two independent registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle . tinyavr - 0,5-8 kb program memory
