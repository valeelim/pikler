Jahbulon     jahbulon ( or jabulon ) is a word that was used in the past in some rituals of certain parts of masonry . it is also said to be used in ordo templi orientis rituals . the origin and meaning of this word are not completely known . different groups think the word means different things . even masonic researchers do not all agree to what the word means or where it came from . one masonic scholar says that the word was first used in an early 18th century royal arch ritual . he said it was the name of an explorer looking for king solomon 's temple . another masonic scholar thinks it is a name for god in hebrew . the most used masonic explanation is that it is a word that comes from putting together parts of the name of god in different historic languages . writers who are not masons , especially those against masonry , have said that it is a masonic name for god . some say it is the name of a unique `` masonic god '' . freemasonry 's officials have said many times that `` there is no separate masonic god '' . they have also said that there is no separate proper name for a deity in any branch of freemasonry . this meaning of the word has caused many religious groups to argue about and condemn freemasonry . in england , no ritual with the name has been in official masonic use since february 1989. stephen knights , author of the brotherhood : the secret world of the freemasons , says it is a trinity composed of three ancient middle eastern gods , jah , god of the jews , baal , god of the phoenicians , and on , an egyptian god .
