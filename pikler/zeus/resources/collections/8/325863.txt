The Five     the five , often known as the mighty handful , are a group of five russian composers who met regularly in saint petersburg , russia , in the mid-19th century . the russian name for the group : `` moguchaya kuchka '' ( `` the mighty handful '' ) was given to them by vladimir stasov , the famous music critic . the five composers were : mily balakirev , c√©sar cui , modest mussorgsky , nikolai rimsky-korsakov and alexander borodin . the group all wanted to write music in a russian style , rather than imitating european composers . they were part of the movement known in music as nationalism . they were five of the most important composers of the time . note that tchaikovsky was not one of the group . his music is more european-based , but he , too , often wrote very russian music based on folk tunes . before the five were established as a group , mikhail glinka and alexander dargomyzhsky were trying to create a russian kind of music . all the composers of the five were amateur composers . this does not mean that they were bad , it means that they earned their living in other ways and composed when they had time . rimsky-korsakov was a naval officer , borodin was a professor of chemistry , cui was an expert in military armaments and mussorgsky had been in the guards and then in the civil service before he took up music full time . balakirev , the leader of the group , worked for a time for the warsaw railways . he was the spiritual leader of the group : a kind of teacher and guide .
