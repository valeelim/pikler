Neusis construction     the neusis is a geometric construction method that was used by ancient greek mathematicians . at that time , people did not have good rules to measure distances . they did not know algebra . so , they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper . the neusis construction ( from greek νεῦσις from νεύειν `` neuein '' `` incline towards '' ; plural : νεύσεις `` neuseis '' ) fits a line element of given length ( `` a '' ) in between two given lines ( `` l '' and `` m '' ) , in such a way that the line element , or its extension , passes through a given point `` p '' . that is , one end of the line element has to lie on `` l '' , the other end on `` m '' , while the line element is `` inclined '' towards `` p '' . a neusis construction might be performed by means of a 'neusis ruler ' : a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point `` p '' ( this may be done by putting a pin into the point `` p '' and then pressing the ruler against the pin ) . in the figure , one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs : this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler . a second marking on the ruler ( the blue eye ) indicates the distance `` a '' from the origin . the yellow eye is moved along line `` l '' , until the blue eye coincides with line `` m '' . the position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar .
