Carl Woese     carl richard woese ( july 15 , 1928 â€“ december 30 , 2012 ) was an american microbiologist and physicist . woese is famous for defining the archaea ( a new domain or kingdom of life ) in 1977. he used phylogenetic taxonomy of 16s ribosomal rna , a technique pioneered by him which is now standard practice . he was also the originator of the rna world hypothesis in 1977 , although not by that name . he was the stanley o. ikenberry professor of microbiology at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign . after defining archaea as a new domain , woese redrew the taxonomic tree . his three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships . it divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains : bacteria , archaea , and eukarya . archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes . looked at another way , they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria . the tree of life shows the diversity of microbes . single-celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biosphere 's diversity . this is surprising to some , given our familiarity with the larger metazoan world . microbes are responsible for many biochemical cycles and are crucial to the whole biosphere . woese 's efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes was an invaluable service to ecology , conservation and evolutionary biology .
