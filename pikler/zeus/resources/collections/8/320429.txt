Rhabdodontidae     rhabdodontids were herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs from the cretaceous . they were similar to large , robust hypsilophodonts , with deep skulls and jaws . the family were defined as `` the most recent common ancestor of `` zalmoxes robustus '' and `` rhabdodon priscus '' and all the descendants of this common ancestor '' . in 2005 , paul sereno defined the family as `` the most inclusive clade containing `` rhabdodon priscus '' but not `` parasaurolophus walkeri '' '' . the rhabdodontidae includes the type genus `` rhabdodon '' , `` zalmoxes '' , `` mochlodon '' , and possibly `` muttaburrasaurus '' . rhabdodontid fossils have been found in europe and australia in formations from 100 to 65 million years ago .
