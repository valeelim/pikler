Wildfire     wildfire is a general term which includes forest fires , grassland fires , bushfires , brush fires and any other vegetation fire in countryside areas . wildfires occur on every continent except antarctica . they can occur naturally , but many are caused by humans , accidentally or deliberately . fossil records and human history show that wildfires do occur at intervals . wildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life , but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas . some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction , although large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects . strategies of wildfire prevention , detection , and suppression have varied over the years . one of the more controversial techniques is controlled burning : permitting or lighting small fires to cut the amount of flammable material for a potential wildfire . while some wildfires burn in remote forested regions , they can cause extensive destruction of homes and other property in the zone between developed areas and undeveloped wilderness .
