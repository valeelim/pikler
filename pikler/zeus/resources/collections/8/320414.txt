Ceiling balloon     a ceiling balloon is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the base of clouds above ground level during daylight hours . the principle behind the ceiling balloon is a balloon with a known ascent rate ( how fast it climbs ) and determining how long the balloon rises until it disappears into the cloud . ascent rates yield the ceiling height .
