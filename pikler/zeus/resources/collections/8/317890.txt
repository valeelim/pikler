Weevil     weevils are herbivorous beetles . they have a long 'snout ' at the front of their head , called a `` rostrum '' . weevils are a family , the curculionidae , which may be the largest beetle family , with about 45,000+ named living species . that makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom . in addition , the superfamily curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil-type beetles . the family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans . the most famous weevil is the boll weevil , which ruins cotton crops . the `` ips '' genus , feeding on ponderosa pine , introduces a fungus to the tree . the fungus blocks resin canals , which leaves the weevil free to eat . resin would normally wash the insects out ; it is a defence mechanism . the fungus often kills the tree , and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires . in this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires . the maize weevil , `` sitophilus zeamais '' , is a major pest . it attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products , including wheat , rice , sorghum , oats , barley , rye , buckwheat , peas , and cottonseed .
