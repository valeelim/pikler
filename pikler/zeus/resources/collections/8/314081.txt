Neornithes     the neornithes are the modern birds . these are the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and all its descendants . there are about 9 to 10,000 known living bird species in the world . modern birds are divided into two superorders ; the palaeognathae ( tinamous and flightless ratites ) , and the neognathae , containing all other birds . it is generally agreed that the neornithes evolved in the cretaceous and that the split between the palaeognathae and neognathae , and then the split between fowl and the other neognathae , occurred before the k/t extinction event . the earliest fossil remains of the neornithes might be about ten million years after the start of the cretaceous . `` gallornis '' may be the first fossil , but its remains are only a worn partial femur and a fragment of the humerus . there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs . molecular dating suggests a cretaceous radiation , while fossil evidence suggest an early tertiary radiation . attempts made to bring together the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial .
