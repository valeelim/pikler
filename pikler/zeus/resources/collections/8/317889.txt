Geostationary orbit     a geostationary orbit ( or geostationary earth orbit - geo ) is a type of geosynchronous orbit directly above the earth 's equator ( 0° latitude ) . like all geosynchronous orbits , it has a period ( time for one orbit ) that is 24 hours . this means it goes around the earth as fast as the earth spins , and so it appears to stay above the same spot all the time . a person watching from earth sees a satellite in a geostationary orbit as not moving , at a steady place in the sky . communications satellites and weather satellites often use these orbits , so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them . the ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky . this is cheaper and easier than having a satellite dish that is always moving to track a satellite . each one stays above the equator at a set longitude ( distance east or west ) . the idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication was first published in 1928 ( but not widely so ) by herman potočnik . the idea of a geostationary orbit became well known first in a 1945 paper called `` extra-terrestrial relays — can rocket stations give worldwide radio coverage ? '' by the british science fiction writer arthur c. clarke , published in `` wireless world '' magazine . the orbit , which clarke first described as good for broadcast and relay communications satellites , is sometimes called the clarke orbit . named after the author , the clarke belt is this part of space above the earth - about above sea level , over the equator , where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented . the clarke orbit ( another name for a geostationary orbit ) is about around .
