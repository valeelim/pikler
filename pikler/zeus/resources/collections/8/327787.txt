Dragstrip     a dragstrip is a facility for conducting automobile and motorcycle acceleration events such as drag racing . although a quarter mile ( 402 m ) is the best known measure for a drag track , many tracks are eighth mile ( 201 m ) tracks . the race is begun from a standing start . three factors decide the outcome of the race : reaction time , torque , and traction . a dragstrip is a straight racetrack , usually an eighth or a quarter of a mile long ( 660/1320 feet , 201/402 metres ) , followed by a `` shutdown area '' to allow automobiles room to stop after crossing the finish line . common features also include a 'water box ' where cars and motorcycles start their burn-outs to clean and heat up their tires to improve traction . there is a set of lights known as a 'christmas tree ' that counts down to the start . there are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area .
