Surjective function     in mathematics , a surjective or onto function is a function `` f '' : '' a '' â†’ `` b '' with the following property . for every element `` b '' in the codomain `` b '' there is at least one element `` a '' in the domain `` a '' such that `` f '' ( `` a '' ) = '' b '' . this means that the range and codomain of `` f '' are the same set . the term `` surjection '' and the related terms `` injection '' and `` bijection '' were introduced by the group of mathematicians that called itself . in the 1930s , this group of mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics . the french prefix `` sur '' means `` above '' or `` onto '' and was chosen since a surjective function maps its domain on to its codomain . formally : the element formula_4 is called the image of the element formula_5 . - the formal definition means : every element of the codomain `` b '' is the `` image '' of at least one element in the domain `` a '' . the element formula_5 is called a pre-image of the element formula_4 . - the formal definition means : every element of the codomain `` b '' has at least one pre-image in the domain `` a '' .
