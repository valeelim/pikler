Andrew Wiles     sir andrew john wiles , kbe , frs ( born cambridge , 11 april 1953 ) is a british mathematician and a royal society research professor at oxford university . he specializes in number theory . he is most famous for proving fermat 's last theorem . he is a foreign member of the united states national academy of sciences since 1996. in the summer of 1986 , wiles decided to prove the theorem . gerhard frey , jean-pierre serre and ken ribet had done successful research in the last few years . wiles realised that he could prove a limited form of the modularity theorem . so , he decided to solve this problem . this was done somewhat secretly . in 1993 , he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in cambridge . in august 1993 , however , it turned out that the proof contained a gap . wiles tried to fill in this gap . but the error he made was a very basic one . wiles got the crucial idea for avoiding , rather than closing this gap . this came to him on 19 september 1994. together with his former student richard taylor , he published a second paper . this avoided the error and thus completed the proof . both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the `` annals of mathematics '' .
