Negro     the word “ negro ” is used in the english-speaking world to refer to a person of black ancestry or appearance . it has been used for people of african ancestry as well as people from other places . the word `` negro '' means 'black ' in spanish and portuguese . it comes from the latin `` niger '' which means 'black ' . `` negro '' replaced the term `` colored '' as the most polite term . this was done when the term `` black '' was more offensive . this use of the word was accepted as normal until the civil rights movement in the late 1960s . it was accepted even by the people it was used to describe . one example of this is martin luther king , jr. using the term `` negro '' when talking about his own race in his 1963 speech `` i have a dream . '' during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s , some african-american leaders in the united states did not like this word . people like malcolm x wanted the word `` black '' to be used . this was because they saw a connection between the term `` negro '' and slavery , segregation , and discrimination .
