Kundalini     in the hindu religion , there is a strong spirit energy called kundalini . it lives in all people but nearly always sleeps , curled like a snake near the bottom of their spine , in the first chakra . if it ever wakes up , it climbs the spine and the other chakras , and the whole body and mind of the person fill with energy and understanding . this feels so special that people can not find words to say what it is like . some people try to wake kundalini up by meditation or yoga . a person with awake kundalini can help , by sending energy to them . this is called shaktipat . kundalini is a hindu name , but ideas that are nearly the same come from all around the world . some of these are the taoist 'greater kan and li ' , egyptian 'sekhem ' , hebrew 'shekinah ' , christian 'pentecostal fire ' , kaballist 'secret fire ' and kalahari 'num ' .
