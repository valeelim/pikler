Dalit     dalit ( from sanskrit ‘ dal ’ which means to split , to crack , to break ) is the name given to a group of people who have been historically considered outcasts in societies from south asia ( india , nepal , sri lanka , pakistan , bangladesh ) and eastern africa ( somalia ) . today , the dalits , formerly known as “ untouchables ” , have increasingly adopted the term “ dalit ” as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system . untouchability , is an ancient form of discrimination based upon caste . it is not merely the inability to touch a human being but also an attitude towards a minority group translated into various physical acts , norms and practices . the dalit status carries with it the stigma of “ untouchability ” because it is associated with menial , degrading tasks immediately connected with their traditional occupations which include unclogging sewers , disposing of dead bodies and cleaning latrines . the discrimination against the dalits takes various forms such as : - in rural areas , dalits are often not allowed to engage in cultural and social activities with the rest of the community , including entering temples , sitting in the main spaces of villages , taking part in religious programs , and eating with the rest of the community during village ceremonies ;
