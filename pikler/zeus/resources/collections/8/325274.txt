Tree fern     tree ferns are a large group of ferns with tree-like form . they are part of a subclass of ferns which is proved to be monophyletic by dna sequence analysis . the tree-ferns and some other ferns with creeping rhizome stems make up the cyatheales group of ferns ( as a sub-class or order ) . the tree-like habit has evolved a number of times in this group . they can grow up to 20 metres tall , with their large fronds at the top . tree ferns are found growing in tropical and subtropical areas as well as temperate rainforests in australia , new zealand , and other island groups nearby . a few genera extend further , such as `` culcita '' in southern europe . like all ferns , tree ferns reproduce by means of spores developed in sporangia on the undersides of the fronds . the fronds of tree ferns are usually very large , and multiple-divided fronds . the young fronds of tree ferns emerge in coils that uncurl as they grow . unlike flowering plants , tree ferns do not form new woody tissue in their trunk as they grow . rather , the trunk is supported by a fibrous mass of roots that expands as the tree fern grows .
