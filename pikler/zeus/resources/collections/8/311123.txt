Human zoo     a human zoo was an exhibition that showed people from other cultures . very often , this was done in similar ways than animals are shown in zoological gardens today . most such exhibitions were done between 1870 and 1940. human zoos attracted many people in europe . they were often based on the idea of unilinealism , scientific racism and social darwinism . unilinealism or unilineal evolution is the idea that evolution only happens in one direction ; some animal will be `` at the peak '' of evolution . as a consequence of these ideas , some human zoos placed indigenous people ( particularly africans ) in a continuum somewhere between the great apes and humans of european descent . ethnographic zoos have since been criticized as highly degrading and racist .
