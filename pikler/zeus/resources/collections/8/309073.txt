Dormancy     dormancy is a period in an organism 's life cycle when growth , development , and ( in animals ) physical activity are temporarily stopped . this minimizes metabolic activity and therefore helps an organism to conserve energy . dormancy tends to be closely associated with environmental conditions . organisms can synchronize entry to a dormant phase with their environment through predictive or consequential means . predictive dormancy occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase `` before '' the onset of adverse conditions . for example , day length and decreasing temperature are used by many plants as triggers to start dormancy before the onset of winter . consequential dormancy occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase `` after '' adverse conditions arise . this is often found in areas with an unpredictable climate . sudden changes in conditions may lead to a high mortality rate among animals relying on consequential dormancy . on the other hand , its use can be advantageous , as organisms remain active longer and are able to make greater use of available resources .
