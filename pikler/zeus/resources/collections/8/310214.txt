Radio frequency     the term radio frequency refers to electromagnetic radiation in the range of frequencies lower than microwaves . radio waves at these frequencies have been found useful for long-range communications . among these frequencies , shortwave radio communications operate at frequencies that can be reflected by the ionosphere and therefore can bounce around the earth . long-wave frequencies are used for relatively short range communications such as the most ordinary of the commercial amplitude modulation ( am ) radio stations . their transmissions ordinarily do not get long bounces . different short-wave frequencies ( with wavelengths shorter than 120 meters ) can be reflected well and transmitted by long bounces around the world during times when different conditions prevail in the ionosphere . so transmitters for such organizations as voa ( voice of america ) and bbc ( british broadcasting corporation ) will change operating frequencies from month to month and also from time to time during a 24 hour period .
