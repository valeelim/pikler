Coke (fuel)    coke ( fuel ) coke is a fuel used mainly in blast furnaces to reduce iron oxide to produce iron . it contains carbon , and is similar to coal . it is made from coal by cooking out things that are not carbon . volatile parts of the coal , such as water , gas , and tar , are driven off by baking . this is done in an airless furnace or oven ( kiln ) at temperatures as high as but usually around . coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace . the carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide ( hematite ) to the iron product . although coke is more expensive than coal , it can be used in households as a clean fuel , relatively free of smoke and impurities . at the present day its use in domestic heating has been less than oil or gas , but in the 20th century it was often used in kitchen stoves .
