Lophophore     the lophophore is the characteristic feeding organ of four major groups of animals : the brachiopoda , bryozoa , entoprocta , and phoronida . all lophophores are found in aquatic organisms . it can most easily be described as a ring of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth . it is often horseshoe-shaped or coiled . phoronids have their lophophores in plain view , but the valves of brachiopods must be opened wide to get a good view of their lophophore . the lophophore surrounds the mouth and is an upstream collecting system for suspension feeding . the gut is u-shaped with the anterior mouth at the center of the lophophore . the anus , where present , is also anterior , and is above the mouth . in the bryozoa it is outside the ring of the lophophore ; in the entoprocta the anus is within the ring of the lophophore . some brachiopods do not have an anus .
