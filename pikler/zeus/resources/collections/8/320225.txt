Gastrolith     gastroliths , or gizzard stones , are small rocks kept by an animal inside its stomach or at an early part of the alimentary canal . the function of these is to mash up the food so digestion takes place faster . typically , animals which do this do not have suitable teeth for grinding , and the gastroliths are a good substitute for this . a second function , in aquatic animals , is that gastroliths can be used for ballast to make diving easier . several pieces of evidence are needed to show that a rock was used by a fossil animal to aid its digestion . first , the stone must be unlike the rock found in its geological vicinity . secondly , it should be rounded and polished , because inside a gizzard any genuine gastrolith would grind against other stones and fibrous materials , like the action of a rock tumbler . lastly , the stone must be found with the fossils of the animal which ingested it .
