Irish Parliament     the irish parliament ( ) was a legislative body created in 1297 to represent the anglo-irish in the english monarch 's lordship of ireland . like the english parliament , it had its own houses of commons and lords . when king henry viii of england elevated ireland to a kingdom in 1541 through an act of the irish parliament , he invited the gaelic irish to sit in the england parliament for the first time . however , later english monarchs ' penal laws prevented roman catholics from entering parliament . so , the native irish after this were virtually unrepresented since they were almost all catholic . the irish parliament 's power was restricted by `` poynings law '' . poynings law was a bill sponsored by english lord deputy of ireland sir edward poynings in 1494. in 1782 , the bill was repealed and the kingdom of ireland had brief period of legislative autonomy . but in 1800 it passed a law called the act of union to abolish itself and the kingdom of ireland , and incorporate ireland into the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . after that , the island was represented in the british parliament in london .
