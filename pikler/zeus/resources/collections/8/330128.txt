Syphon     the word syphon ( , also spelled siphon ) can refer to any device that conducts the flow of liquids through tubes . used in the right way , the word refers to a tube in an upside-down u shape . the tube makes liquid flow up hill . it flows higher than the source of the liquid , to come out at a level lower than the surface of the source . the movement is done without pumps . it is powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity . the syphon must touch the liquid in the ( upper ) reservoir ( the source , where the liquid comes from ) in order for it to work . this allows atmospheric pressure to push the liquid up the tube . the top of the tube is where the lowest pressure is , so the liquid will move towards that area in the same way as a barometer . the top of a syphon is the same as the height of a barometer , because they work in the same way . the lower pressure is caused by the liquid falling on the downhill side . a syphon can raise water to a height of 25 feet above the source elevation . new discoveries in syphon pump metering allows for dispensing liquid above the source . united states patent # 5,358,000 was the first to teach this method .
