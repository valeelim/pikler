Scipionyx     scipionyx samniticus is one of the most important recent dinosaur finds . it is a tiny theropod ( meat-eater ) fossil found in cretaceous limestone in southern italy near naples . although it was unearthed thirty years ago in 1981 , its true importance was not realized until 1994. it is a very important specimen in that it has fossilized remains of many of its internal organs and muscles . this type of detail is rare in fossils since the soft tissues from an animal do not usually fossilize ; they almost always rot before mineral replacement can take place . this new fossil will yield a lot of information about dinosaurs ' anatomy and physiology as it is studied . the fossil is a theropod , perhaps a compsognathid ( related to `` compsognathus '' ) . it is a hatchling 9.5 inches ( 24 cm ) long . it is from 113 million years ago ( during the cretaceous period ) and has been named `` scipionyx samniticus '' . during the cretaceous period it lived near a shallow lagoon .
