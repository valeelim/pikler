Ultralight material     ultralight materials are very light substances . they include silica aerogels , carbon nanotube aerogels , metallic foams , polymeric foams , and metallic microlattices . the density of air is about 1.275 mg/cm , which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material . the lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. it is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes â€“ a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes . the researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than styrofoam and is very strong . the material is low density : it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre . silica aerogels , the world 's lightest `` solid '' materials , are only as low as 1.0 mg per cubic cm . the metallic micro-lattices are 99.99 % air and only 0.01 % solid . the metal used is nickel . the material is not just light : it has some elastic properties . when it is squashed , the little tubes are also squashed , but when the pressure is removed , they rebound . a sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98 % when the pressure is lifted . that makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers : they are materials used to cushion against shock .
