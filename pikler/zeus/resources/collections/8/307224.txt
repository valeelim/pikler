Deep frying     deep frying is a way of cooking food by putting it in hot oil or fat . deep frying cooks food very quickly . if done well , deep-frying does not make food too greasy , because the moisture in the food repels the oil . the hot oil heats the water in the food , steaming it from the inside out . the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface of the oil . as long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not in the oil for too long , oil will only enter the surface of the food . however , if the food is cooked in the oil for too long , much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food . the correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food , but is usually between 175 and 190 °c ( 345–375 °f ) . some fried foods are given a coating of batter or breading prior to frying . this makes the outside of the food crispy and browned , while the inside becomes tender , moist , and steamed . some foods – such as potatoes or whole , skin-on poultry – have a natural coating and do not require breading or battering .
