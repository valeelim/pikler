Roux     roux is a cooking mixture of wheat flour and butter ( or other fat ) . it is the basis of many types of french sauce for cooking . roux is the thickening agent of three of the mother sauces of classical french cuisine : `` sauce béchamel '' , `` sauce velouté '' and `` sauce espagnole '' . clarified butter , vegetable oils , or lard are commonly used fats . it thickens gravy , other sauces , soups and stews . it is made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight . when used in italian cooking , roux is traditionally equal parts of butter and flour . in cajun cuisine , roux is almost always made with oil instead of butter and is dark brown in colour . this lends much richness of flavour , but less thickening power . hungarian cuisine uses rendered lard or vegetable oil instead of butter for the preparation of `` roux '' ( called `` rántás '' in hungarian ) .
