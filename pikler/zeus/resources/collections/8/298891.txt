Cornish Rebellion of 1497     the cornish rebellion of 1497 was a popular uprising by the people of cornwall in the far southwest of britain . its primary cause was the people 's response to the raising of war taxes by king henry vii to pay for a campaign against scotland . tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by edward i of england to the cornish stannary parliament which exempted cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income . in reaction to king henry 's tax levy , michael joseph ( an gof ) , a blacksmith from st keverne and thomas flamank a lawyer from bodmin , persuaded many of the people of cornwall to revolt against the king . an army of 15,000 marched into devon , attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went . apart from one isolated incident at taunton their march was not accompanied by any violence or looting . from taunton , they moved on to wells , where they were joined by the seventh baron audley , an able soldier . after issuing a declaration of grievances , the army left wells and marched to winchester via bristol and salisbury , remarkably unopposed as they progressed across the south of england . at this point , having come so far , there seems to have been some questioning of what exactly should be done . flamank proposed that they should head for kent , 'the classic soil of protests ' , the home of the peasants ' revolt of 1381 and jack cade 's rebellion , to rally the volatile men of kent to their banner . having failed to attract support in kent part of the army abandoned the march and returned home while the rest turned towards surrey .
