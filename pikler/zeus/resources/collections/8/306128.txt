Conrotatory and disrotatory     these terms describe two classes of an electrocyclic reaction ( a type of organic chemical reactions ) . in a conrotatory mode , the substituents located at the ends of a conjugated double bond system move in the same ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) direction during ring opening or ring closure . in a disrotatory mode , they move in opposite directions . an example is the conversion of trans-cis-trans-2,4,6-octatriene to cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene ( top of figure ) . the orbital mechanics of the reaction needs a disrotatory mode . the orbital symmetry of the octatriene 's highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) requires for the end pi orbitals to move in opposite directions to form the correct symmetry found in the sigma bond . thermal rearrangements of all conjugated systems containing 4n + 2 pi electron are stereospecific . this is based on preservation of orbital symmetry in the highest occupied molecular orbital . systems containing 4n pi electrons show the opposite conrotatory mode . this is also true for rearrangements of 4n + 2 pi ( where n is a whole number ) electrons driven by light ( photoinduced ) . photoinduced rearrangements of 4n pi electron systems ( where the number of electrons is divisible by 4 ) follow the disrotatory rule .
