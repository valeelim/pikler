Sawfish     the sawfish are a family of rays which have a long body , like a shark . one feature that separates a sawfish from other rays is its long , saw-like snout . on either side of this `` rostrum '' are little teeth like a saw . sawfish have a mouth , nostrils , and gill slits under their body , just like a ray . also , their pectoral fins are enlarged , like those of a ray . also like rays , when they settle on the bottom , they take in water through two spiracles just behing the eyes . this gets water for the gills , without sand . several species can grow to about . the sawfish 's most distinctive feature is the saw-like rostrum . the rostrum is covered with motion- and electro-sensitive pores . these allow sawfish to detect movement and even heartbeats of prey hiding under the ocean floor . the rostrum serves as a digging tool to unearth buried crustaceans . if a suitable prey swims by , the normally lethargic sawfish springs from the bottom and slashes at it with its saw . this generally stuns or injures the prey sufficiently for the sawfish to devour it . sawfish also defend themselves with their rostrum , against predators such as sharks and intruding divers . the 'teeth ' protruding from the rostrum are not real teeth , but modified tooth-like structures called `` denticles '' .
