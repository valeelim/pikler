Chaturanga     chaturanga is the earliest known form of chess , 6th century ad . this precursor of modern chess originated in the northern indian subcontinent during the gupta empire . 'chaturanga ' translates as 'the four divisions ' , meaning infantry , cavalry , elephantry , and chariotry . they were the four divisions of an indian army at the time , and no doubt the game was thought of as a war-game . at that time the game had no female piece : what we now call the queen was called `` mantri '' , meaning a minister or advisor . the game eventually spread to the rest of the world after the muslim conquest of persia . it was then called shatranj . from the beginning until the end of the 15th century the pieces we call bishops and queens had limited movement , and it took longer to get the pieces into action . in modern chess , the original pieces evolved into the modern pawn , knight , bishop , and rook , respectively. < ref name= '' h/w '' > hooper , david and whyld , kenneth 1992 . `` the oxford companion to chess '' 2nd ed , oxford university press . isbn 0-19-866164-9 < /ref >
