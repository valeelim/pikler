Standing start     a standing start is a type of start in auto racing events where cars are standing still when the race begins . in a standing start , cars are completely still when a green signal is given to start the race . this often follows a set of lights that count down to the start of the race . standing starts are common in many motorsports , including drag racing , most single-seat ( formula one and gp2 series ) , touring cars ( most notably british and world touring cars ) , v8 supercars , and many types of short-course off-road races . the standing start often occurs following a parade lap . the opposite of a standing start is a rolling start . standing starts are often deemed safer in formula sports because of high acceleration speeds , which could cause problems if a rolling start were used . a standing start can cause problems like stalled cars being hit by the driver who starts behind them on the grid . motorsports using standing starts usually penalize drivers who `` jump the start '' , or redlight , by moving before the green light is lit .
