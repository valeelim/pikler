Gabbro     gabbro is a large group of dark , coarse-grained , igneous rocks . they are chemically equivalent to basalt . the rocks are plutonic , formed when molten magma is trapped under the earth 's surface and cools into a crystalline mass . most of the earth 's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust , produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges . in general , when the gabbro is formed , it lies above the earth 's mantle , and below the basalt . gabbro is generally coarse grained , with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater . it is an essential part of the oceanic crust . long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins .
