Booster seat     a booster seat is a seat cushion that is used to elevate children in cars . children have to use booster seats so that the seat belt fits better . in general most booster seats can be used for children who are between four and twelve years of age and between 40 and 59 inches ( 100â€“150 cm ) tall . children under 40 inches are usually too small to use booster seats and have to use a car seat ( a child safety seat with an own seat belt system , used for children under the age of 4-6 ) . many countries have laws that require the use of booster seats . in the united states of america children under 57 inches ( 145 cm ) and younger than 9 years old have to use a booster seat . many european countries require a booster seat until the child is either twelve years old or 59 inches tall . there are some exceptions . in the united kingdom for example children are allowed to ride without a booster seat when they are 53 inches tall and in austria children who are not 59 inches tall have to use a booster seat until their 14th birthday . however booster seats are used to keep children safe , not because of a law . in general no child can ride safely in a car without booster seat when he is not 57 inches tall . it is proved that children under 57 inches who do not use a booster seat are more likely to suffer serious injuries or even death in the event of an accident .
