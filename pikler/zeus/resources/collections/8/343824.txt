Sustainable seafood     for thousands of years , people have caught and eaten fish and seafood . today this has become a problem : the population has increased , and more fish and seafood need to be caught to feed all the people . this means that the populations of fish have less time to regenerate , and they get depleted , which is known as overfishing . sustainable seafood is the idea of catching the fish , without putting the ecosystem they come from in danger . sustainable seafood is either caught wild , or it is farmed , but without endangering the ecosystem , and giving the stocks a chance to grow . there are different non-profit organizations that watch over these rules . special `` labels '' have been created so the consumer can see that the fish or seafood was bred or caught in accordance with these rules .
