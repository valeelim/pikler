Ecological footprint     an ecological footprint measures how much people take from nature . the footprint is then compared to what natural resources there are to provide for people . the ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land , forest area , grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use . more simply , footprint calculations answer the questions : how much nature do we have ? and how much do we use ? when analysing the world as a whole , humanity is using nature about 1.5 times faster than nature renews itself . it is like using 1.5 planet earths . since people consume differently around the world , it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population . for instance , if everybody consumed like the germans , it would take nearly 3 planet earths . another estimate says `` the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capital on earth . this means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30 % and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of `` natural capital '' .
