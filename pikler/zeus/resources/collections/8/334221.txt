Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)    afternoon of a faun ( nijinsky ) the afternoon of a faun ( ) is a modern ballet . it was choreographed by nijinsky to a short symphonic work by claude debussy called `` prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune '' . both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem `` l'après-midi d'un faune '' by stéphane mallarmé . it was nijinsky 's first choreographed work . the ballet was first performed by diaghilev 's ballets russes in paris at the théâtre du châtelet on 29 may 1912. the costumes and sets were designed by léon bakst . nijinsky danced the role of the faun . grace robert writes in `` the borzoi book of ballet '' that bakst was responsible for the choreography . nijinsky simply carried out his directions . however , nijinsky 's sister alleged that bakst and diaghilev were not involved with the choreography and were admitted to rehearsals only in the last stages . the truth will never be known ; those involved are dead . the choreography however caused a scandal , especially the ending . here , the faun appears to climax upon a nymph 's scarf . gaston calmette , the editor of `` le figaro '' , attacked the choreography on moral grounds . sculptor auguste rodin defended it . the furor assured the public 's interest in the ballet , then and now .
