Stress analysis     stress analysis is the study of stresses and strains in materials and structures as force is applied against them . it is a topic in engineering . stress may cause deformation or fractures in materials . stress analysis is about finding out how much stress causes deformation in a given material . stress analysis is an important task for civil , mechanical and aerospace engineers . they work on the design of structures of all sizes , such as bridges and dams , machines , and even plastic cutlery and staples . stress analysis is also used in the maintenance of such structures , and to investigate the causes of structural failures .
