System of linear equations     in mathematics , a system of linear equations ( or linear system ) is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables . mathematicians show the relationship between different factors in the form of equations . `` linear equations '' mean the variable appears only once in each equation without being raised to a power . a `` system '' of linear equations means that all of the equations are true at the same time . so , the person solving the system of equations is looking for the values of each variable that will make all of the equations true at the same time . if no such values can satisfy all of the equations in the system , then the equations are called `` inconsistent . '' for example , is a system of three equations in the three variables formula_2 , formula_3 , formula_4 . a `` solution '' to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied . a solution to the system above is given by since it makes all three equations valid :
