Wilfred Owen     wilfred edward salter owen mc ( 18 march 1893 â€“ 4 november 1918 ) was an english poet and soldier , one of the leading poets of the first world war . owen was born in shropshire , and had two brothers and a sister . when he was very small , the family moved to birkenhead , where he went to school . later , he attended shrewsbury technical school . although he passed the exams necessary to go to university , he was unable to go because his parents could not afford the fees . before the war , he worked as an assistant to a vicar , and then went to france to teach english to the children of a french family . about a year after war broke out , he joined the army as a junior officer , and was eventually sent back to france with the manchester regiment in 1916. conditions for troops on the western front were very harsh , and owen suffered several bad experiences that led to him being considered unfit to continue fighting . he was sent to craiglockhart war hospital in edinburgh for treatment by a psychiatrist . while there , he wrote poetry , and became editor of the hospital magazine , which was called `` the hydra '' . soon afterwards , a better-known poet called siegfried sassoon arrived at the hospital as a patient , and the two became great friends . sassoon helped owen to improve his writing , and introduced him to other writers and publishers . although sassoon had made a public protest against the war , he quickly grew tired of life at the hospital , and went back to france to continue fighting . in the meantime , owen was given a job in the northern command depot at ripon , where he did not have to do any fighting .
