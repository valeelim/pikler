Van der Waals force     in chemistry , van der waals ' forces are a type of intermolecular force . an intermolecular force is a relatively weak force that holds molecules together . van der waals ' forces are the weakest type of intermolecular force . they are named after the dutch scientist johannes diderik van der waals ( 1837–1923 ) . negatively charged electrons orbit molecules or ions . the electrons create slightly different charges from one end of the molecule to the other . these slight differences are called `` partial charges '' , as δor δ. the term is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for `` all '' intermolecular forces . van der waals forces are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds , but play a fundamental role in supramolecular chemistry , enzymes , polymer science , nanotechnology , surface science , and condensed matter physics . van der waals forces define many properties of organic compounds , including their solubility .
