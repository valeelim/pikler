Telomere     a telomere is a region of dna at the end of a chromosome . it protects the end of the chromosome from deteriorating ( getting worse ) or fusing ( joining ) with other chromosomes . the telomeres are made of repeated sequences of dna ( 'repetitive dna ' ) . during cell division , enzymes that duplicate dna can not continue their work all the way to the end of chromosomes . if cells divided without telomeres , they would lose the ends of their chromosomes , and the information they contain . the telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of the chromosomes . they are destroyed during cell division , and are remade by an enzyme , telomerase reverse transcriptase . the australian elizabeth blackburn and the americans carol greider and jack szostak won the 2008 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on telomeres .
