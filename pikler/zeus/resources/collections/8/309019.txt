Judaism in Palestine     a palestinian jew is a jewish inhabitant of palestine ( or land of israel ) at various points in the region 's history ( see dispute over usage of the term below ) . jews in palestine prior to the establishment of the state of israel are more commonly referred to as `` yishuv '' ( jewish community ) . a distinction is drawn between the `` old yishuv , '' that is , the pre-existing jews in the land of israel , and the `` new yishuv , '' that is , the newly-arrived jewish immigrants after the first aliyah in 1881. after the modern state of israel was born in 1948 , native jews in palestine became citizens of israel , and the term `` palestinian jews '' largely fell into disuse .
