Sigmatropic reaction     a sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction . a sigmatropic reaction does not use a catalyst and involves a single molecule ( an uncatalyzed intramolecular process ) . it changes one σ-bond into a different σ-bond . the name `` sigmatropic '' is the result of a compounding of the long-established `` sigma '' name for single carbon-carbon bonds and the greek word `` tropos '' , meaning turn . this is a rearrangement reaction which means that the bonds in a molecule shift between atoms without any atoms leaving or new atoms added to the molecule . in a sigmatropic reaction , a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system . true sigmatropic reactions usually do not need a catalyst . some sigmatropic reactions are catalyzed by a lewis acid . sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions . the most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [ 3,3 ] cope rearrangement , claisen rearrangement , carroll rearrangement and the fischer indole synthesis .
