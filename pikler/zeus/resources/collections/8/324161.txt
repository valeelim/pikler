Julia set     a julia set is a fractal . it is a set defined given a rational function ( written `` j ( f ) '' ) . the fatou set of a rational function ( `` f ( f ) '' ) is the complementary set of the julia set of `` f '' . the fatou set of a function are the values such that all nearby values behave similarly when the function is repeatedly iterated . related pages . - fractal - mandelbrot set
