Focal length     focal length tells how strongly a lens , a curved mirror or another optical device brings light together or spreads it out . if rays of light go straight into a lens and the focal length is positive , the focal length is the distance to the point behind the lens where the rays will be brought to a focus . if the focal length of the lens is negative , the focal length is the distance at which the light has spread to twice its original size . light from a large distance produces an image at f ( focal point ) . the distance from the centre of the lens to f is the focal length
