Romney Marsh     romney marsh is a coastal marshland of southern england . it runs from hythe in kent to rye in east sussex . it covers about 100 miles ( 260 km ) . romney marsh is one of three english wetlands , the others being the fens of east anglia and the somerset levels . much of the area has been reclaimed over the centuries , and is now flat farmland . before the area was drained , it was a cause of malaria among the inhabitants . for much of its history , the marsh was fringed by a lagoon , which was protected by a shingle beach at dymchurch . the marsh still contains some water features , particularly the royal military canal , completed in 1809 , and the river rother . at romney marsh the coast is at its closest to france , and was several times the point of invasion . in ad 892 , a danish fleet of 250 ships sailed right into the river rother and took the fortress at appledore ( allegedly built by king arthur ) , which they destroyed . the romans used the romney area for a salt industry . pans of brackish water were left to evaporate , and the salt collected for use in food .
