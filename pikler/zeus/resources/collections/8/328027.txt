Hamitic     hamitic theory is a theory that claims that so called `` hamitic '' race is superior to the negroid races on the african continent . john hanning speke started the theory . karl richard lepsius and carl meinhof extended the theory : they used languages to classify people into hamitic or non-hamitic ; this is no longer done today . another way they classified people into hamitic or non-hamitic is by ethnic roots . for example , a person who has ancestry from rome would be considered closer to a hamite than a person who 's ancestry is in africa . this theory also included giving classes to those members of the negroid races of africa upon colonization . this , in part , contributed to the rwandan genocide , which pinned the members of the tutsi ethnicity or tribe against the members of the hutu people , although the tension between them was over small differences .
