Sign (mathematics)    sign ( mathematics ) in mathematics , the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative . every real number ( that is not zero ) is either positive or negative , and therefore has a sign . zero itself is without a sign , or signless . in addition to putting signs in to real numbers , the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity . usually , if numbers are seen without a sign , they are seen as a positive number . the word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs , such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign . a real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero , and negative if it is less than zero . the attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number . zero itself is not considered to have a sign . in arithmetic , the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number . for example , +3 would denote a positive 3 , and âˆ’3 would denote a negative 3. when no plus or minus sign is given , the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive .
