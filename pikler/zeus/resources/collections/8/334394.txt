Nasty Party     the term nasty party was first used by theresa may where in october 2002 she described the conservative party of the united kingdom as `` there 's a lot we need to do in this party of ours . our base is too narrow and so , occasionally , are our sympathies . you know what some people call us -- the nasty party . '' the term `` nasty party '' applied to conservative party members with traditional conservative stances which included being anti-gay , anti-minorities , and pro-business , and lacking concern for the poor . many conservatives felt this one the reasons the conservative party lost the last three general elections and needed to broaden their traditional base to have a chance of reelection .
