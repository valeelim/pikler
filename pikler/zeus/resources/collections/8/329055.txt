Water Music (Handel)    water music ( handel ) the water music is a group of pieces for baroque orchestra . the pieces were composed by george frideric handel . the `` water music '' is made up of three suites . these suites include minuets , hornpipes , bourr√©es , and other dances . in sum , there are three suites ( f major , d major , g major ) , made up of 21 individual pieces . legend says the three suites were first played on a trip taken by king george i of england up the thames to chelsea or lambeth on 17 july 1717. the king had known handel for a long time . for some reason though , he was angry with handel . the `` water music '' was handel 's way of appeasing the king . fifty musicians floated alongside the king 's barge playing the suites . the king was so pleased he ordered `` water music '' played three times . all the instruments in the baroque orchestra were included in the composition , except the harpsichord and timpani . it would have been difficult to bring these instruments aboard a barge . the instruments in a complete performance are a flute , two oboes , one bassoon , two horns , two trumpets , strings , and continuo .
