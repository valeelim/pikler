Kallima     kallima , also known as the oakleaf or dead leaf butterflies , is a genus of butterflies of the family nymphalidae . they are found asia . their common name is a reference to the under surface of their wings , which is various shades of brown . when the wings are held closed , this results in a remarkable similarity to a dead leaf . there are dark dots or patches which look like the effects of fungi and lichen , which are so common on dead leaves . the camouflage is perfected by the rear wings , which have a little 'tail ' , which looks like the stalk of a leaf . when at rest in closed position , the 'tail ' touches the branch , completing the illusion . there are two morphs of the common indian species `` kallima inachus '' . nothing seems to be known about why these morphs exist . there is also variation in the colour of the under surfaces .
