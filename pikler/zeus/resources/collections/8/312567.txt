Premise     a premise is a statement which an argument claims will justify a conclusion . the proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument . aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to three premises and a conclusion . premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises , for example : it is understood that socrates is a man . the fully expressed reasoning is thus : in this example , the first two independent clauses before the comma ( namely , `` all men are mortal '' and `` socrates is a man '' ) are the premises , while `` socrates is mortal '' is the conclusion . in logic , an argument requires a set of two declarative sentences ( or `` propositions '' ) known as the premises , with another declarative sentence ( or `` proposition '' ) known as the conclusion . this structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure . more complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion , or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises . an example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic .
