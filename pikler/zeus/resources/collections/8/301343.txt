Craton     a craton is the oldest part of a continental plate . it is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere . after surviving cycles of merging and rifting of continents , cratons are usually found in the interiors of tectonic plates . they are composed of ancient crystalline basement rock , which may be covered by younger sedimentary rock . they have a thick crust and deep roots that extend as much as several hundred kilometers into the earth 's mantle . cratonic lithosphere is much older than oceanic lithosphere â€“ up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years . the term `` craton '' is used to distinguish the stable portion of the continental crust from regions that are more geologically active and unstable . cratons can be described as shields , in which the basement rock crops out at the surface , and platforms , in which the basement is overlain by sediments and sedimentary rock . cratons are subdivided geographically into geologic provinces . a geologic province is an area with common geologic properties .
