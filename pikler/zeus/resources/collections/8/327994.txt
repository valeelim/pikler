Doubochinski's pendulum    doubochinski 's pendulum doubochinski 's pendulum is an experiment with an oscillator and a magnet . the most simple case is that of a pendulum that interacts with an oscillator . the pendulum ( with a magnet at the end ) will swing at a frequency of one swing per period of 1-2 seconds . a stationary electromagnet is placed under the equilibrium point of the pendulum . the electromagnet is then supplied with an alternating current of a fixed frequency , of between 10 and 10.000 hz . when the pendulum is released at any location , its movement will then evolve to stop at a height which depends on the frequency of the current of the electromagnet . this phenomenon was first discovered by the brothers danil and yakov doubochinski in 1968â€“69 .
