Social Security Income     ssi or social security income is a type of government check that is given to those in the united states with some type of disability . those who are above age 65 are automatically qualified to receive ssi benefits . however , children who have a disability can also qualify for ssi benefits . in all cases with children , they can receive ssi until the age of 18 ( when they finish school ) . some children continue to receive ssi if their disability worsens , or if they continue to develop more disabilities . when a child reaches the age of 18 , they are evaluated by a professional physiatrist . the physiatrist asks several questions ranging from their moods to how they are doing in their life . the evaluation also consists of several mental work problems that are based on decision-making . at the end of the evaluation , the physiatrist will determine if the child is still disabled or has more disabilities . there has been mixed to negative commentaries by the general public who believe that ssi is a mere waste and should n't exist . while others argue that if ssi is taken away , the elderly and children with disabilities would struggle with medical expenses and other lifetime economic issues . ssi is founded by the government . the money given to those with ssi are taken from taxes from those who work in the united states . ssi benefits include : insurance , automatic qualification for low income housing , free transportation to and from appointments and a monthly check that arrives on the first of every month .
