Cultigen     a cultigen is a plant that is the result of artificial selection by humans . liberty hyde bailey , an american botanist was the first to use the term , in 1918. bailey noticed that the classification linn√© introduced for plants was not useful for classifying plants which came from human cultivation and selection . he called the plants which grow in the wild without human selection indigens . a cultigen was : `` ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown ... [ it has ] such characters as to separate it from known indigens , and is probably not represented by any type specimen or exact description '' . the point is that a cultigen can not always be placed in the traditional linnean system of botanical classification . bailey later changed his definition to `` plant or group known only in cultivation ; presumably originating under domestication ; contrast with indigen '' , which is the definition used above . examples of cultigens are maize and cabbage . cultigen and cultivar may be confused with one-another . cultigen is a general-purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well ( see introductory text above ) . cultivar is a formal classification category in the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants ( icncp ) .
