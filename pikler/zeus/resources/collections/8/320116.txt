Santana Formation     the santana formation is a high quality fossil site in brazil . it is in northeastern brazil 's arar ipe basin . it qualifies as a lagerstätte , which means it is one of the best fossil sites , with many undisturbed fossils . the strata come from the lower cretaceous , laid down about 92 million years ago in a shallow inland sea . some 25 species of fish are found , many with stomach contents preserved . this lets palaeontologists study predator–prey relationships in the ecosystem . there are also fine examples of pterosaurs , reptiles , amphibians , invertebrates ( especially insects ) and plants . even dinosaurs are found here : a new maniraptor was described in 1996. limestone nodules formed around dead organisms ; this preserved even the soft parts of their anatomy . the limestone was etched away using a mild acid . the fossils were then preserved by the 'transfer technique ' which means they were embedded in a plastic resin such as polyester or epoxy . the nearby crato formation is also a lagerstätte . it was produced in similar conditions , about 10 million years before the santana formation .
