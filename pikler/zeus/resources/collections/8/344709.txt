Le Dieu Bleu     le dieu bleu ( ) is a ballet in one act . jean cocteau and federico de madrazo y ochoa wrote the story of the ballet . reynaldo hahn wrote the music . michel fokine designed the dances , and léon bakst designed the sets and costumes . the ballet was first performed in paris at the théâtre du châtelet on 13 may 1912. it was a failure . critics thought nijinsky the dancer for whom the ballet was designed did more posing than dancing . producer sergei diaghilev blamed hahn 's music for the failure . `` le dieu bleu '' was staged three times in paris in 1912 and three times in london in 1913. the ballet has not been revived . ballet impresario and producer sergei diaghilev staged two exotic ballets for the ballets russes : `` cléopâtre '' in 1909 and `` schéhérazade '' in 1910. both were great successes with the parisian public . he hoped that `` le dieu bleu '' ( another exotic ballet ) would be equally successful . `` dieu '' was one of six new ballets for the 1911 ballets russes season . the others were `` narcisse '' , `` la peri '' , `` le spectre de la rose '' , `` sadko '' , and `` petrushka '' . michel fokine would design the dances for all of them . léon bakst would design the sets and costumes for the first four . when fokine and bakst started work on ida rubinstein 's ballet `` le martyre de saint sébastien '' , diaghilev felt betrayed . he pushed `` dieu '' forward to 1912. he lost interest in `` dieu '' , but spent huge amounts of money on the production . he hoped `` dieu '' would make nijinsky a great international star .
