Phytosaur     phytosaurs are an extinct group of large semi-aquatic upper triassic archosaurs . phytosaurs were long-snouted and heavily armoured , bearing a remarkable resemblance to modern crocodiles in size , appearance , and lifestyle . this is an example of convergence or parallel evolution . the name 'phytosaur ' means 'plant reptile ' : the first fossils of phytosaurs were mistakenly thought to belong to plant eaters . the sharp teeth in phytosaur jaws clearly show they were predators . although phytosaurs were not true crocodilians themselves , they were more closely related to the crocodilians than to other modern reptiles . crocodiles did not become phytosaur-like until the lower jurassic . `` consensus generally places phytosaurs as basal crurotarsans , possibly the basal-most group '' . phytosaurs had a nearly global distribution . fossils have been recovered from europe , north america , india , morocco , thailand , brazil and madagascar .
