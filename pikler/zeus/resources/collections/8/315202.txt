Indo-Pakistani War of 1971     the indo-pakistani war of 1971 was a military conflict between india and pakistan . lasting just 13 days , it is considered one of the shortest wars in history . during the war , indian and pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts . the war effectively came to an end after the eastern command of the pakistani armed forces signed the instrument of surrender ( 1971 ) on december 16 , 1971. after the surrender , east pakistan seceded as the independent state of bangladesh . around 97,368 west pakistanis who were in east pakistan at the time of its independence , including some 79,700 pakistan army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians , were taken as prisoners of war by india . the soviet union sided with the bangladeshis , and supported the indian army and mukti bahini during the war . the soviets thought that the independence of bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivalsâ€”the united states and china . the ussr gave assurances to india that if a confrontation with the united states or china developed , it would take counter-measures . this assurance was enshrined in the indo-soviet friendship treaty signed in august 1971 .
