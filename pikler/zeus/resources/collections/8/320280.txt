Beamline     in particle physics , a beamline is the path in a particle accelerator of the particles . in materials science , physics , chemistry , and molecular biology a beamline leads to the experimental endstation utilizing particle beams from a particle accelerator , synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron , or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor . in particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground , cased inside a cement housing . the beamline is usually cylindrical metal . typical names include , `` beam pipe '' , and/or a blank section called a `` drift tube '' . this entire section must be under a good vacuum in order to have a the beam travel for a long distance . a survey and alignment crew carefully align the beamline segments by using a laser tracker . all beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance . good alignment helps to prevent beam loss , and beam from colliding with the pipe walls , which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation . regarding synchrotrons , a beamline is the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station , which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron light source . a typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography . scientists also use synchrotron light in many other ways .
