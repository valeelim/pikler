Dependent and independent variables     in an experiment , the variables used can be classed as either dependent or independent variables . the `` dependent '' variable is the possible outcome of the experiment ; the effect . it depends on what happens to other variables in the experiment . the dependent variable is basically the part that you are changing . for example , if you want to know how much light a plant needs to grow , the amount of growth is the dependent . if you wanted to see if a plant would grow better in hot or cold areas your independent variable would be the temperature of the air . the `` independent '' variable is the variable that you have control over , what you can choose and manipulate . it is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable . in some cases , you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable . it may be something that is already there and is fixed , something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else , the independent variable like color , kind , time . as an example , you are interested in how stress affects heart rate in humans . your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate . you can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate .
