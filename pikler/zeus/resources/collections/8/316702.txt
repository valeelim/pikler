Computer network     it is possible to connect a number of computers and other electronic devices to create a computer network . the computers and devices which are part of the network can `` talk '' to each other and exchange information . in addition to the computers and devices which are connected , other devices are often needed for the network to work correctly . examples for such devices include hubs and switches . different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router . in general , networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology . a local area network ( lan ) connects computers which are close together . building a lan is easier than connecting different networks ( by a wide area network ) . the largest wide area network is the internet . computers can be part of several different networks . networks can also be parts of bigger networks . the `` local area network '' in a small business is usually connected to the `` corporate network '' of the larger company . these connections may allow access to the `` internet '' . for example , a shop may use it to show merchandise on its web site through a web server , or to convert received orders into shipping instructions .
