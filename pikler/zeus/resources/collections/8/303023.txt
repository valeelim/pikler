Physical chemistry     physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems . it studies them at macroscopic , atomic , subatomic , and particulate levels . it looks at concepts like motion , energy , force , time , thermodynamics , quantum chemistry , statistical mechanics and dynamics . physical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics . physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra-molecular science . the majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecular/atomic structure alone . these include chemical equilibrium and colloids . some of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of : 1. intermolecular forces on the physical properties of materials ( for example , plasticity , tensile strength , surface tension in liquids ) . 1. reaction kinetics on the rate of a reaction . 1. the identity of ions on the electrical conductivity of materials . 1. surface chemistry and electrochemistry of membranes . the term `` physical chemistry '' was first used by mikhail lomonosov in 1752. he presented a lecture course with the title `` a course in true physical chemistry '' ( russian : « курс истинной физической химии » ) to the students of petersburg university .
