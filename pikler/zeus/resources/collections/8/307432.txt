Maxillopoda     maxillopoda is a diverse class of crustaceans which includes the barnacles , copepods and a number of related animals . it does not appear to be a monophyletic group , and no single character unites all the members . with the exception of some barnacles , maxillopodans are mostly small , including the smallest known arthropod , `` stygotantulus stocki '' . they often have short bodies , with the abdomen reduced in size , and generally lacking any appendages this may have arisen through paedomorphosis . apart from barnacles , which use their legs for filter feeding , most maxillopodans feed with their maxillae . their bodyplan has 5 head segments , 6 thoracic segments and 4 abdominal segments , followed by a telson ( tailpiece ) . the fossil record of the group extends back into the cambrian , with fossils of barnacles and tongue worms known from that period . six subclasses are generally recognised , although many works have included the ostracods among the maxillopoda . of the six groups , only mystacocarida are entirely free-living ; all the members of the tantulocarida , pentastomida and branchiura are parasitic , and many of the copepoda and thecostraca are parasites .
