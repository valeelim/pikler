Chimaera (fish)    chimaera ( fish ) chimaeras are cartilaginous fish in the order chimaeriformes . they are sometimes known informally as 'ghost sharks ' . they may be the `` oldest and most enigmatic groups of fishes alive today . their closest living relatives are sharks , though in evolutionary terms they branched off from sharks nearly 400 million years ago and have remained isolated ever since . at one time they were a `` diverse and abundant '' group , based on the fossil record . they are now confined mainly to deep water . there are 50 living species in six genera and three families . the evolution of these species has been problematic given the paucity of good fossils . dna sequences have become the preferred approach to understanding speciation . the order appears to have originated about 420 million years ago during the silurian . the three living families appear to have diverged during the late jurassic to early cretaceous ( 170â€“120 million years ago . they do not have shark-like skin or teeth . they have smooth scales on their bodies , and three pairs of grinding tooth plates . they have a poisonous spine on their backs between the head and the dorsal fin .
