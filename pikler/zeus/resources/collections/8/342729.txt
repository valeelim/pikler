Error (baseball)    error ( baseball ) in baseball statistics , an error is the act , in the judgment of the official scorer , of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases , when such an advance would have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder . an error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless , in the scorer 's judgment , the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base ( s ) reached was the result of the fielder 's mistake . in that case , the play will be scored both as a hit ( for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to ) `` and '' an error . however , if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder 's mistake , it is scored as a `` hit on error , '' and treated the same as if a batter was put out , which would lower his batting average . similarly , a batter does not receive credit for an rbi when runs score on an error , unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake . for example , if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error , the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in .
