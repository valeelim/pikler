Kitchen stove     a kitchen stove , cooking stove , cookstove , or cooker is a kitchen appliance designed for cooking food . kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven , used for baking . modern gas stoves were developed already in the 1820s , but these remained isolated experiments . at the great exhibition in london in 1851 , a gas stove was shown , but only in the 1880s did this technology start to become a commercial success . the main factor in this delay was the slow growth of the gas pipe network . there are still many traditional stoves made , which burn wood or solid fuel . the look and feel may be very similar to many traditional stoves , but the way fuel is burnt has evolved . many also have back boilers for domestic heating .
