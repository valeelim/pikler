Topoisomerase     topoisomerase is an enzyme that unwinds and winds dna in order to help the creation of dna structures . dna is in a helix/spiral which helps make the structure of dna strong and stable . however , when undergoing dna replication , the spiral needs to be untwisted , and when spirals are being untwisted knots , and breaks can happen . when studying the structure of dna , james d. watson and francis crick knew that there was need for an enzyme to overcome this problem . topoisomerase binds to either side of the dna strands and allows the dna to be untangled or unwound .
