Bioinorganic chemistry     bioinorganic chemistry studies the role of metals in biology . it also studies natural phenomena such as the behaviour of metalloproteins and artificially introduced metals in medicine and toxicology . many biological processes such as respiration depend on some inorganic molecules . bioinorganic chemistry also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the way metalloproteins work . it is a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry . bioinorganic chemistry studies the implications for biology of electron-transfer proteins , substrate bindings and activation , atom and group chemistry as well as metal properties . paul ehrlich used organoarsenic ( “ arsenicals ” ) for the treatment of syphilis . this demonstrated the relevance of metals , or at least metalloids , to medicine . then rosenberg discovered the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin ( cis-ptcl ( nh ) ) . the first protein ever crystallized was urease . this has nickel at its active site . vitamin b , the cure for pernicious anemia , was shown by crystallography by dorothy hodgkin to have a cobalt atom in a corrin macrocycle . the watson-crick structure for dna demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers .
