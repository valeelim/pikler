False dilemma     false dilemma , also called the either-or fallacy and the fallacy of false choice , is a mistake in logic that allows only two possibilities when more exist . for example , there is `` either-or fallacy '' in saying that an apple must be green or red . the premise is that the apple is either one color or another ; but this beginning is a mistake because some apples—not most—are other colors . in other words , most apples are red or green , but some are also yellow . a `` fallacy of false choice '' may hide a deliberate attempt to eliminate agreement on an issue . eldridge cleaver used this tactic when he said : `` you 're either part of the solution or part of the problem . '' a false dilemma may also be used for comedic effect . stephen colbert used this tactic when he asked guests on the colbert report : `` george bush ... great president or the greatest president ?
