Pons     the pons is part of the hindbrain , the ancient rear part of the brain . it acts as a bridge , and has nerve fibres connecting the cerebellum to the medulla oblongata . in humans it is above the medulla and below the midbrain . mainly , its function is to carry white fibres ( `` wiring '' ) which conduct signals from the cerebrum down to the cerebellum and medulla , and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the thalamus .
