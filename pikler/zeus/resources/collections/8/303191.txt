Mass spectrometry     mass spectrometry ( ms ) is a process that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles . you can use it to find out the mass of particles , and to find the basic chemicals in a sample or molecule . it can also make clear the chemical structures of molecules , such as peptides and other chemical compounds . it works by giving the particles in the sample an electric charge , which means an electron is removed from each particle , producing positively charged ions . this is done by using an electron gun - a high energy beam of electrons is passed through the sample to make electrically charged particles or ions . the ions are accelerated through a short tunnel , by use of negatively charged plates to which the positively charged ions are attracted . on passing through the tunnel , the ions are exposed to a magnetic field which causes their path to curve , depending on how heavy they are . heavier ions are bent less than lighter ions ( assuming they have the same `` +1 '' charge ) , when experiencing the same 'pull ' from the magnetic field , because they are more massive than lighter ions . this results in heavier ions hitting a detection plate , at the end of the tunnel , at a different position to lighter ions . from this information , the `` mass-to-charge ratio '' of the particles , and the `` relative abundance '' ( how much was in the sample ) of each type of particle can be worked out .
