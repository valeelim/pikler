Curtsey     a curtsey ( also spelled curtsy or courtesy ) is a traditional gesture of greeting , in which a girl or woman lowers her body by bending her knees . it is the female equivalent of male bowing in european cultures . the word `` curtsy '' comes from `` courtesy '' which means `` politeness '' . according to desmond morris , the movements in the curtsey and the bow were similar until the 17th century . only later did the difference between the female and the male gesture develop . the earlier , combined version is still performed by restoration comedy actors . when a curtsey is very formal , the girl/woman bends the knees outward ( rather than straight ahead ) , often sweeping one foot behind her . she may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body . in victorian times , when women wore floor-length , hooped skirts , they curtsied using the pli√© movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight . both feet and knees point out so the body lowers straight down . in this way , the lady lowers herself evenly , not to one side .
