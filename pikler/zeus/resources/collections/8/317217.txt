Gas discharge lamp     gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources ( or lamps ) . these lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas . most of these lamps use a noble gas , or a combination of noble gases , but they often contain other materials , such as mercury , sodium or metal halides . the gases in these lamps are ionized in operation . this means that there are free electrons . when an electric current is sent through the gas , electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals . this will mean that some reach a higher energy state . when they fall back into the lower energy state , they will emit the energy in the form of light . the fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp . sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights . gas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency , but they are more complicated to manufacture , which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps . due to their greater efficiency , gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century . early in the 21st century , light-emitting diodes improved , with even higher efficiency . they began to replace some gas discharge lamps .
