Polar bond     in chemistry , a polar bond is a type of covalent bond between two atoms or more in which electrons are shared unequally . a covalent bond is the `` strong '' kind of bond that makes something into a molecule . electrons are negatively charged . if the two atoms share the electrons equally , then the negative charge is evenly spread out over the entire molecule , balanced out by the positive charges of the protons in the atoms ' nuclei . this makes the entire molecule neutral - a non-polar bond , making a non-polar molecule . however , if one of the atoms is particularly greedy for electrons ( called electronegativity ) , then its side of the bond will have more electrons . therefore , that side of the bond will have a slightly negative charge , and the other side will have a slightly positive charge . this is important because it turns the bond into a magnet with two poles . because it acts like a magnet , if other bonds that are a lot like magnets are nearby , it will react to them . when these polar bonds are positioned right , the entire molecule can act like a magnet . water does this . you can see in the image below that the hydrogen ( small and white ) is positively charged and the oxygen ( big and red ) is negatively charged . this picture shows how the little water magnets line up with each other , in the same way that if you toss a bunch of little magnets into a box , they 'll line up with each other.this is one of the most basic and important differences between bonds ( and the resulting molecules ) in chemistry . this is a very easy behaviour to predict ( because we know how electronegative all of the atoms in the periodic table are ) , and it creates an enormous difference in how the molecules behave .
