Rhineland     in the past , the rhinelands meant an area on both banks of the rhine in central europe . but now , the rhineland ( or rheinland in german ) has become a general word for areas of germany along the middle and lower rhine . it borders luxembourg , belgium and the netherlands to the west , and the rhine to the east . after the french were defeated in the early 19th century , the german and dutch speaking areas at the middle and lower rhine were added to the kingdom of prussia . the area was called rhine province ( also known as rhenish prussia ) . after world war i of the early 20th century , the western part of rhineland was under entente control , and demilitarized ( no military activities allowed ) under the treaty of versailles . german forces sent armies back to it in 1936 , three years before world war ii .
