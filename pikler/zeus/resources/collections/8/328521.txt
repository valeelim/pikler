GRB 970228     grb 970228 was a gamma-ray burst ( grb ) . it was the first grb which had an afterglow . it was seen on 28 february 1997. since 1993 , scientists had predicted grbs to be followed by afterglows . but , until this event , grbs had only been seen in very bright bursts of high-energy gamma rays . the burst had several peaks in its light curve . it lasted around 80 seconds . the light curve was not normal . this suggested that a supernova may have happened as well . grb 970228 happened in the same place as a galaxy about 8.1 billion light-years away . this means that grbs happen outside the milky way . reichart showed that the light curve of grb 970228 could only have been caused by a supernova . definitive evidence linking gamma-ray bursts and supernovae was eventually found in the spectrum of grb 020813 , and the afterglow of grb 030329. however , supernova-like features only become apparent in the weeks following a burst , leaving the possibility that very early luminosity variations could be explained by dust echoes .
