Rotating furnace     a rotating furnace is a special type of furnace used to make lenses or mirrors for telescopes . glass is placed in the furnace which is then spun up and heated . the top surface of the melted glass takes on a concave shape . the glass is cooled while still spinning . the spinning makes the glass the same shape as the main mirror used in a telescope . computer controlled grinding machines can correct the shape of the glass . the concave top surface can be coated with silver and be used as a focusing mirror . the shape of bottom surface is made by the container the glass was melted in . the technology is being used for the giant magellan telescope 's seven mirrors . large focusing mirrors can also be made using liquid mercury , such as the large zenith telescope . the rotation is continuous and the metal remains liquid ; once all waves and imbalances die out , the telescope is then used .
