Numerical analysis     numerical analysis studies different algorithms to get approximations for problems of mathematical analysis . approximations are used for the following reasons : 1. there are no known ways to solve a problem using calculus . examples for such problems are the navierâ€“stokes equations or the three-body problem 1. there is a way to solve a problem using calculus . getting an exact solution is impractical though , because it requires a long time , or many resources . an example for this is calculating power series . one of the earliest known uses of numerical analysis is a babylonian clay tablet , which approximates the square root of 2. in a unit square , the diagonal has this length . being able to compute the sides of a triangle is extremely important , for instance , in carpentry and construction . numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations . much like the babylonian approximation of formula_1 , modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers , because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice . instead , much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors .
