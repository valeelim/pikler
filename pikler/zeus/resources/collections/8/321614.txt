'' it is a type of logical fallacy : a bad argument that makes no sense . a non sequitur argument takes something that people accept is true , and says that because this is true , the conclusion is right . the problem is that the conclusion has nothing to do with the premise ( original statement that people agree on ) . usually , this argument seems convincing on the surface . however , consider the following example : this is wrong because 1 ) stupid people can still know things , just not have good ideas or use their knowledge well , and 2 ) knowledge is not the only source of power . this argument tries use a statement that people agree with as bad support for a new idea that is not the logical conclusion of the statement .
