Galactic plane     the galactic plane is the plane in which most of a disk-shaped galaxy 's mass lies . the directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the galactic poles . in actual use , the terms `` galactic plane '' and `` galactic poles '' usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the milky way , the galaxy where the earth is . some galaxies are irregular and do not have any well-defined disk . even in the case of a spiral galaxy like the milky way , defining the galactic plane is imprecise since the stars are not perfectly in the plane . external references . - http : //arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0408107
