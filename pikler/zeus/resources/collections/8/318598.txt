Pachypleurosaur     pachypleurosaurs were primitive sauropterygian reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic lizards , and were limited to the triassic period . they were long animals , ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length , with small heads , long necks , paddle-like limbs , and long deep tails . the limb girdles are greatly reduced , so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land . the widely spaced peg-like teeth project at the front of the jaws , indicate that these animals fed on fish . pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the nothosaurs .
