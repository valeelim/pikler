Battleship     a battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of heavy caliber guns . battleships are larger , better armed and armored than cruisers and destroyers . after the old wooden sailing ship of the line became obsolete around 1870 , battleships were the new capital ships , the largest armed ships in a fleet . they were used to take command of the sea , and represented the apex of a nation 's naval power . in 1906 the new hms dreadnought made all older battleships obsolete . battleships gave support gunnery ( that is : shooting targets on coast or inland ) for amphibious invasions . they often served as flagships . after world war ii with the rise of bombers and guided missiles , a battleship 's large guns and thick armor were less useful for fighting other ships . battleships were no longer made , and faded from use . the united states navy used battleships until 2004 , when the last ones were made museums . aircraft carriers and large submarines took their jobs . the development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron armor plate on warships necessary . in 1859 france launched '' gloire '' , the first ocean-going ironclad warship . she had the profile of a ship of the line , cut to one deck due to weight considerations . although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys , '' gloire '' was fitted with a propeller , and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor . `` gloire '' prompted further innovation from the royal navy , anxious to prevent france from gaining a technological lead .
