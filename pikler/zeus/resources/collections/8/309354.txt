Radiata     the radiata is a superphylum which includes both the echinoderms and the ctenophores . it is not part of the usual classification system , and is not used by all biologists . the group includes the radially symmetric animals of the eumetazoa . the echinoderms , however , are members of the bilateria , because they exhibit bilateral symmetry in their developing stages . their radial symmetry is secondary . thomas cavalier-smith in 1983 defined a subkingdom called radiata consisting of the phyla porifera , myxozoa , placozoa , cnidaria and ctenophora in radiata , that is , all the animals that are not in bilateria . the `` five kingdom '' classification of lynn margulis and k.v . schwartz keeps only cnidaria and ctenophora in radiata . cladistic classifications do not recognize radiata as a clade . the radiata , in this sense , are diploblastic , meaning they have two primary germ layers : endoderm and ectoderm . cavalier-smith 's use of the term radiata includes animals with a single germ layer such as sponges .
