Australian gold rush     gold rushes last for quite a long time . the gold rush started because of pieces of gold being found , so a lot of people came here to find more . the australian gold rush was a large number of gold discoveries in australia . thousands of people came to australia in the hope of finding a lot of gold and becoming rich . the rush started in 1851 when gold was found near bathurst , new south wales and ended with the last rush in 1893 to kalgoorlie , western australia . at each place gold was easily found in rivers and creeks . this was known as alluvial gold and could be found by individual miners using very basic equipment such as a spade and a dish . in most places this alluvial gold was taken in the first few months . to get at the gold that was buried deeper in the ground meant that miners needed to work together and dig tunnels . eventually large companies were started to raise money so that deep gold mines could be built . the gold rushes happened when alluvial gold was found . miners would quickly move there in the hope of being the first to find the surface gold . for example , miners rushing to clunes , victoria in august 1851 , quickly changed their minds and went to buninyong when they heard of a new gold discovery . weeks later gold was found at ballarat a few miles to the north and within six weeks there were more than 10,000 people digging . but by 1852 most miners had left ballarat and rushed to the new goldfields at bendigo . in 1854 , miners in ballarat were angry and upset at paying for gold licences . they burned their licences and raised the eureka stockade flag in protest . the miners fought soldiers and police officers to protect their rights . this was called the eureka stockade . many people died , but afterwards the miners did n't have to pay for their licences anymore .
