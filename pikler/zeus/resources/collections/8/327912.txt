Mortar (weapon)    mortar ( weapon ) a mortar is an artillery weapon which fires explosive shells . the shells are known as ( mortar ) bombs . they are fired at targets which are close , as mortars do not have long range . it has a short barrel which fires the mortar bomb at a low speed high into the air to reach its target . they have been used since medieval times . mortars are made in different sizes , from large and heavy mortars to infantry mortars which can be carried by just one soldier . they are called an indirect fire weapon because the bomb drops onto the target from above , rather than being aimed straight at it . soldiers firing a mortar do not need to be able to see their target . a mortar is quite simple and easy to use . mortars used today are made up of a tube that a gunner drops a bomb into . the tube is usually set at between 45 and 90 degrees angle to the ground . the higher the angle , the shorter the range . when the bomb reaches the bottom of the tube it hits a firing pin . the mortar bomb 's weight is enough to set off the firing pin which ignites the round and fires it . some larger mortars have a firing pin that is set off by using a string instead of automatically .
