Laser tag     laser tag , what is now considered a game , started out as a military training exercise . in the beginning laser guns and the laser targets worn on the soldiers bodies were not connected , this means that the soldiers were able to continue firing the gun even if they had been tagged . one other problem was that they could just reboot the packs , essentially getting their second life , which does not happen on the battle field . laser tag does not actually use lasers for the actual tagging device , it utilizes infrared leds that are focused with mirrors . today 's laser tag systems work on the following , where a sensor pack that is attached to the pack , your pack is wireless and reports back to a master computer that tabulates the amount of times that you were hit or hit someone else . when you pull the trigger , the infrared led lights up , but the infrared can not be seen by humans . the packs sensors are actively looking for infrared lights , if you are in range your pack will register the hit . the part of the laser tag beam that you can see is sometimes a laser or a very bright focused red led .
