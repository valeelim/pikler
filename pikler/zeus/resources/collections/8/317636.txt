Ovipositor     an ovipositor is the long hollow tube on the rear of female insects ( and some other animals ) . through this tube they lay eggs . the ovipositor is formed by the union of three pairs of rear appendages . in many species it is a piercing organ which allows the insect to put its eggs into a specific place . in some species of wasp , the female drills through tree bark with her ovipositor and lays eggs in the bodies of grubs eating under the bark . however , in many hymenoptera the ovipositor is used as a sting , and the female does not use it for egg-laying .
