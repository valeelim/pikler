Biasing     biasing in electronics is using specific voltages and/or currents at points of an electronic circuit to set an appropriate operating point . the operating point of a device , also known as bias point , is the point that shows the direct current ( dc ) , collector-emitter voltage ( vce ) , and the collector current ( ic ) with no input signal . the term is normally used with transistors .
