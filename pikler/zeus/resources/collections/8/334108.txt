Bridge of Sighs     the bridge of sighs ( italian : ponte dei sospiri ) is a small bridge in venice , northern italy . the bridge has walls and a roof . it is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars . it passes over the rio di palazzo and connects the old prisons to the interrogation rooms in the doge 's palace . it was designed by antoni contino ( whose uncle antonio da ponte had designed the rialto bridge ) , and built in 1602. the view from the windows of the bridge of sighs was the last view of venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment . the bridge was named by lord byron in the 19th century . it was thought that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful venice through the windows before being taken down to their cells . in reality , the days of inquisitions and summary executions were over by the time the bridge was built and the cells under the palace roof were occupied mostly by small-time criminals . in addition , little could be seen from inside the bridge due to the stone grills covering the windows .
