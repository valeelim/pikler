Kepler conjecture     the kepler conjecture is a mathematical conjecture , about sphere packing in three-dimensional euclidean space . it is named after johannes kepler ( 1571-1630 ) who first had this idea . kepler supposed that the ways to pack spheres of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are face-centered cubic or hexagonal packings . these packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent , this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available .
