X rating     before the existence of the nc-17 rating , x rating was the original rating that represented no one 17 and under were allowed to any movie with this rating . the rating was not copyrighted , and that caused the rating to become tied to pornography , which in turn caused theaters to not take an x rated movie and in addition caused newspapers to not run ads for such movies . certain movie companies had to release their films without rating , in particular independent movies . in autumn 1990 the x was replaced with nc-17 , but over the years , nc-17 absorbed exactly the same stigma that the x rating acquired earlier .
