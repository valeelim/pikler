Local Group     the local group is the group of galaxies that includes our galaxy , the milky way . the group has more than 50 galaxies ( including dwarf galaxies ) . its gravitational center is somewhere between the milky way and the andromeda galaxy . the galaxies of the local group cover a 10 million light-year diameter and have a binary ( dumbbell ) shape . the group has a total mass of about ( 1.29 Â± 0.14 ) m. the group itself is part of the virgo supercluster ( also called the local supercluster ) . the term `` local group '' was introduced by edwin hubble in 1936. he describes it as `` a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field '' . he listed the galaxies , by decreasing luminosity , as the andromeda galaxy , the milky way , triangulum galaxy , the large magellanic cloud , the small magellanic cloud and half-a-dozen others . by 2003 , the number of known local group members has increased from his initial twelve to thirty-six , by way of the discovery of almost two dozen low-luminosity galaxies .
