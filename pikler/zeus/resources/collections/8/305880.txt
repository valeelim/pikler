Carbon–hydrogen bond activation     carbon–hydrogen bond activation or c-h activation is a reaction that breaks a carbon–hydrogen bond . most times , the reaction involves organometallic complexes . the reaction path has coordination of a hydrocarbon to the inner-sphere of the metal atom ( “ m ” ) . the reaction path includes either an intermediate “ alkane or arene complex ” or as a transition state leading to a `` m-c '' intermediate . the reaction path makes c-h activation different from other reactions . during the c-h breaking event the hydrocarbyl group remains linked in the inner-sphere and under the influence of the metal atom . chemists study c-h activation because for many years chemists believed that c-h bonds were unreactive . both theoretical studies as well as experiments now show that c-h bonds can be broken . this is done by a nearby metal atom changing the electron distribution of the c-h bond ( coordination ) . much chemical research looks at the design and synthesis of new reagents and catalysts that can affect c-h activation . the goal of this research is the conversion of cheap and abundant alkanes into valuable functionalized organic compounds .
