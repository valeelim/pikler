Scat singing     scat singing is used in jazz music . it is performed by using the voice to make sounds , but not using any recognisable words . a singer would improvise ( make up ) a solo using nonsense syllables which is like a musical instrument solo in a song . scat singing probably started when singers like louis armstrong and ella fitzgerald began to use their voices copy the sounds of instruments .
