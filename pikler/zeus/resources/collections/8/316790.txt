Environmental impact of aviation     air travel has a major impact on the world 's environment , especially the atmosphere . with fast globalisation , air traffic has quickly increased , and is one of the biggest causes of climate change . this is due to the noise pollution emitted from the aircraft while it is flying . it also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution . aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle . public awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with motor vehicles ( such as cars ) . references . - international civil aviation organization , air transport bureau ( atb ) ( undated ) . `` aircraft engine emissions '' . retrieved 2008-03-19 . - enviro.aero ( undated ) . `` what is the impact of flying ?
