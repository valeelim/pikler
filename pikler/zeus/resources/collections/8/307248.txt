Superacid     a superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100 % pure sulfuric acid . according to the modern definition , a superacid has a chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid . chemists use strong acids to break down other molecules . some molecules are so strong ( held together with strong chemical bonds ) that they resist attack by common acids . supercids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids . commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid ( cfsoh ) , also known as triflic acid , and fluorosulfonic acid ( fsoh ) . both acids are about a thousand times stronger ( that is , have more negative `` h '' values ) than sulfuric acid . the strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components , a strong lewis acid and a strong br√∏nsted acid . the strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid . other pages . - superbase
