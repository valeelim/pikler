Rings of Jupiter     the rings of jupiter are a number of rings which circle the planet jupiter . it was the third set of rings found in the solar system after the rings found around saturn and uranus . the rings are very difficult to see from earth , needing the most powerful telescopes . they were not discovered until the voyager 1 space probe visited the planet in 1979. the galileo space probe carried out more studies in the 1990s . the hubble space telescope and large earth telescopes have provided information recently . the ring system is faint and is made mainly of dust . it has four main parts : a thick inner ring known as the `` halo '' ring , a bright but very thin `` main '' ring , and two outer , wide , faint `` gossamer '' rings . these gossamer rings are made from dust from the moons amalthea and thebe and have been name after them . they are known as `` gossamer '' rings because they are transparent , or `` see through '' .
