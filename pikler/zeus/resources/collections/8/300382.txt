Barycenter     the barycenter ( or barycentre ; from the greek `` βαρύκεντρον '' ) is the point between two objects where they balance each other . for example , it is the center of mass where two or more planets orbit each other . when a moon orbits a planet , or a planet orbits a star , both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies outside the center of the larger body . for example , the moon does not orbit the exact center of the earth . it actually orbits a point on a line between the center of the earth and the moon . this is about 1,710 km below the surface of the earth . this is the point where the mass of the moon and the mass of the earth balance . this is the point about which the earth and moon orbit as they travel around the sun . the solar system of course also has a barycenter—depending on the current locations of the planets the barycenter of the solar system is below the surface of the sun or more than twice the sun ’ s diameter outside of the sun 's surface . also the barycenter exists in the world of geometry . for example , the circle has a barycenter .
