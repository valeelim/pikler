Crown group     a crown group is a group of living species and their ancestors back to the most recent common ancestor . it is a term in cladistics and phylogenetics . it is a clade with at least some members that have survived to the present day . how a crown group is defined depends on which living species are chosen . one definition stresses the need for members of the crown group to have the clade 's characteristic synapomorphy . the idea was developed by willi hennig , the founder of phylogenetic systematics , but he did not use this term . the terms `` crown group '' and `` stem group '' were invented by r.p.s . jefferies in 1979. though invented in the 1970s , the term was not often used until it was reintroduced in the 2000s . one very simplified cladogram for birds is shown below : - aves - † '' archaeopteryx '' and its extinct relatives - † '' avisaurus '' and its extinct relatives - † '' hesperornis '' and its extinct relatives - † '' ichthyornis '' - crown group , neornithes includes all living birds - neoaves ( most modern birds and their extinct ancestors )
