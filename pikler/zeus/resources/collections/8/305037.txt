Structured program theorem     the structured program theorem is a theory in programming and computer science . a computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task . according to the structured program theory , these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done . a program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily . these smaller tasks are called `` subprograms '' in computer science . according to the structured program theorem , the three ways subprograms can be combined are : 1 . `` in sequence . '' executing ( running ) one subprogram , and then executing another subprogram . 1 . `` by selection . '' executing a subprogram based on a certain condition . 1 . `` in repetition . '' executing the same subprogram over and over again . the theorem was first published in 1966 by corrado b√∂hm and guiseppe jacopini . it comes from the 1946 description of the von neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by stephen kleene .
