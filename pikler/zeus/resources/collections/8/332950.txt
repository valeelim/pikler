Subalpine zone     the subalpine zone is the zone of plants just below tree line around the world . species that occur in the zone vary according to where they are on the earth . for example , snow gum in australia , or subalpine larch , mountain hemlock and subalpine fir in western north america . trees in the subalpine zone often become crooked , stunted and twisted in form . at treeline , tree seedlings may germinate on the lee ( sheltered ) side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock shelters them from wind . further growth is more horizontal than vertical , and additional rooting may occur where branches touch the soil . snow cover may protect trees during the winter , but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed . well-established trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old . montane grassland and shrubs may be found in the subalpine zone . tuolumne meadows in the sierra nevada of california is an example of a subalpine meadow .
