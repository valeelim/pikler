Li (Confucian)    li ( confucian ) li ( 禮 pinyin : lǐ ) is a classical chinese word used in confucian and post-confucian chinese philosophy . the english meaning is `` the way things should be done . '' in li one must be aware of the way one should act and function within a society . in li one can best cultivate their character by understanding what it entails . li encompasses most importantly the doctrine of the mean , and the five constant relationships . the doctrine of the mean is the way in which one should make decisions in life , in which the best decision is always the middle between unworkable extremes . taking the middle road as confucius said would guide one to the way things should be done . the five constant relationships outline how one should act in society , being the relationships between parent and child , husband and wife , elder sibling and junior sibling , elder friend and junior friend , and ruler and subject . with these constant relationship guidelines , li sets up a hierarchy between the two people and terms the accepted responses and actions between them .
