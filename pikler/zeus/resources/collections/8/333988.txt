Romantic ballet     the romantic ballet is a genre of ballet that evolved in the early 19th century as a reaction against the classicism that dominated 18th century art and literature . balletomanes of the early nineteenth century were bored with stories about ancient gods and goddesses , plots based on myths , and ancient costumes . they wanted ballets about real people and real places . `` pointe '' work became artistic expression rather than stunt work , and the long , white , ballet skirt of tulle was introduced . both produced the illusion of ethereal weightlessness . gas lighting made capable special dimming effects and wires made it possible for ballerinas to `` fly '' . the romantic era in ballet began with `` the ballet of the nuns '' in 1831 and was followed by `` la sylphide '' in 1832. the genre began a slow decline . `` copp√©lia '' of 1870 is said to mark the end of the romantic ballet , although the three ballets composed by tchaikovsky are romantic ballets . tchaikovsky 's `` swan lake '' of 1876 is considered a romantic ballet . even his `` the nutcracker '' of 1892 is a romantic ballet . michel fokine 's `` les sylphides '' of 1906 is considered a tribute to the romantic ballet in its atmosphere and tone .
