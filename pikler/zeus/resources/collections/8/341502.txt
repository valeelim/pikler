Ichneumon     the ichneumonoidea are parasitic wasps . they are a superfamily in the suborder apocrita . the superfamily is made up of the ichneumon wasps , ( family ichneumonidae ) , and the braconids ( family braconidae ) . the superfamily contains well over 80,000 different species . members of the family ichneumonidae are usually larger than members of the braconidae , and the family has three times as many species as the braconids . the two families are distinguished mainly by details of wing venation . almost all are solitary insects , and most are parasitoidsâ€”the larvae feeding on or in another insect which finally dies . being in the same order , ichneumonoids are closely related to other hymenoptera such as ants and bees . many species in both families use polydnaviruses ( with double strand dna ) to suppress the immune system of the host insect . some species use many different insects as hosts , others are very specific in host choice . various ichneumons are used successfully as biological control agents in controlling pests such as flies or beetles .
