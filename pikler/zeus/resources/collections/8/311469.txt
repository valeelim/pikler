Gestalt psychology     gestalt psychology is a theory of mind and brain formed in berlin early in the 20th century . the idea is that the brain sees things as a whole . the gestalt effect is most clear with sight . we recognise figures and whole forms , not just a collection of lines and curves . in psychology , gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism . the phrase `` the whole is greater than the sum of the parts '' is often used when explaining gestalt theory . a better wording is : `` the whole is different from the parts '' . early 20th century theorists , such as kurt koffka , max wertheimer , and wolfgang köhler ( students of carl stumpf ) saw vision of objects as all elements taken together in a global construct . this 'gestalt ' or 'whole form ' approach sought to understand perception – seemingly innate mental laws which determined the way in which objects are perceived . it is based on the here and now , and in the way you view things . it can be broken up into two : figure or ground , at first glance do you see the figure in front of you or the background ?
