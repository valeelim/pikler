Nasal consonant     a nasal consonant is a type of consonant produced with a lowered velum in the mouth , allowing air to come out through the nose , while the air is not allowed to pass through the mouth because something ( like the tongue or the lips ) is stopping it . examples of nasal consonants in english are and , in words such as `` nose '' and `` mouth '' . nearly all nasal consonants are nasal stops ( or nasal continuants ) , where air comes out through the nose but not through the mouth , as it is blocked by the lips or tongue . most nasals are voiced , and , in fact , the nasal sounds and are among the most common sounds used in languages of the world . voiceless nasals are used in a few languages , such as burmese and welsh . in terms of acoustics , nasal stops are sonorants , meaning that they do not significantly stop the flow of air ( as it can come out the nose ) . however , nasals are also stops in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked completely . so nasal consonants sound both like sonorants and like obstruents .
