Galactose     galactose ( from the greek stem γάλακτ– `` galakt– '' , `` milk '' ) is a sugar . it has almost the same chemical structure as glucose . large amounts of pure galactose do not exist in nature . instead , galactose is usually found with glucose in lactose , a sugar found in milk and other milk products . after lactose is digested and absorbed , galactose arrives in the liver . there it is changed into either glucose or glycogen .
