Chemical biology     chemical biology is a science that combines the fields of chemistry and biology . it involves the application of chemical techniques and tools , often compounds produced through synthetic chemistry , to the study and manipulation of biological systems . this is a slightly different from biochemistry . biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of biological molecules . for example , a biochemist studies the three-dimensional structure of a protein and how that structure relates to the chemistry of the protein . also , biochemistry studies the way enzymes work . chemical biologists use chemical principles to modulate systems . they do this to either investigate biology relationships or create new functions . in this way , the research done by chemical biologists is often closer to that of cell biology than biochemistry . in short , biochemists deal with the chemistry `` of '' biology , chemical biologists deal with chemistry `` applied to '' biology . other websites . - chemical biology - biochemweb.org
