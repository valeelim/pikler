Nuclear magnetic resonance     nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is the physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb , then re-emit electromagnetic radiation . this energy is of a specific resonance frequency that depends on the magnetic field strength , and the magnetic properties of the isotopes of the atoms . many scientific techniques exploit the nmr phenomena to study molecular physics , crystals and non crystalline materials through nmr spectroscopy . nmr is also used for advanced medical imaging techniques , for example , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . all isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or of neutrons ( see isotope ) have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum , in other words a nonzero spin , while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero . the most commonly studied nuclei are h and c , although nuclei from isotopes of many other elements ( e.g . h , li , b , b , n , n , o , f , na , si , p , cl , cd , xe , pt ) have been studied by high-field nmr spectroscopy as well .
