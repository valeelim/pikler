Variety (botany)    variety ( botany ) in botany , variety is a rank ( like species or subspecies ) or a taxon in that rank . like a subspecies , a variety gets a three-part name ( a trinomial ) ; such a variety name will include the name of the species and the variety epithet . the term `` variety '' is often shortened to `` var . '' some examples of this use are : - `` acer palmatum '' var . `` atropupureum '' ( purple japanese maple ) - `` abies lasiocarpa '' var . `` arizonica '' ( corkbark fir ) - `` hosta undulata '' var . `` undulata '' ( plantain lily ) a variety is a plant that is different in some way , and continues to be different , from the rest of the species but is not different enough for it to be classified as a new species or as a sub-species . this difference will usually be bigger than those of a form ; a form will have one or more small differences , for example , different coloured flowers , lack of thorns , variegation or different coloured leaves . these variations come about by natural evolutionary process to which most plants are subject . however , a taxonomist can use his own judgement as to at what rank he wants to recognize a different plant . what one taxonomist will call a variety , another will call just a form , or will decide not to recognize as being distinct .
