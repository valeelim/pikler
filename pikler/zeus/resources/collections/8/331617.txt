Pierre-Simon Laplace     pierre-simon laplace ( 23 march 1749 – 5 march 1827 ) , later marquis de laplace , was a french mathematician and astronomer . his work helped to develop mathematical astronomy and statistics . his five volume `` mécanique céleste '' ( celestial mechanics ) ( 1799–1825 ) was a key work . in it , he changed the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus , which meant it could tackle a wider range of problems . in statistics , the so-called bayesian interpretation of probability was mainly developed by laplace . he invented laplace 's equation , and pioneered the laplace transform which is used in many branches of mathematical physics . the laplacian differential operator , widely used in mathematics , is also named after him . laplace 's view on the origin of the solar system is still ours today . he recognised , like newton , that the key force in the solar system was gravitation . gravitation caused the coming together of gas and small particles into one central mass ( which became the sun ) with other smaller groups ( the planets ) , held to the central star by gravitation .
