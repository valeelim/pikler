Crocker Land     crocker land is the name for a supposed eighth continent in the arctic ocean . in the year 1906 , robert peary thought he had seen a landmass , which he named after george crocker , a member of peary arctic club . he thought that the land was about 130 miles ( 210 km ) north of ellesmere island , at 83 degrees north and 100 degrees west . in 1913 , the crocker land expedition started , to find crocker land . this expedition turned out to be a failure . the captain of the first ship became drunk and ran aground on the rocks . later an inuit guide was deliberately shot and killed by one of the expedition members under suspicious circumstances . the expedition eventually became stranded and was not rescued until four years later . the macgregor arctic expedition in 1937â€“1938 also took aerial photographs . these show that there is no land at that location . despite this , some pseudo-scientific organizations still try to present a case for its possible existence . the expedition did not find crocker land . later , satellite images showed that the continent did not exist , and could not be found . today , it is believed that what peary saw , was a fata morgana mirage .
