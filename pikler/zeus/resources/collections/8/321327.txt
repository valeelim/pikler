Infinitesimal     infinitesimals are objects too small to measure . newton and leibniz developed the calculus based on an intuitive notion of an infinitesimal . in 1870 karl weierstra√ü provided the first rigorous treatment of the calculus , using the limit method . but in 1960 abraham robinson found that infinitesimals also provide a rigorous basis for the calculus . many calculus courses still begin with the difficult limit concept , but others now adopt the easier to understand infinitesimal concept . in differential calculus , in both the limit and infinitesimal versions , the velocity of a particle is represented by ds/dt , where s is the position of the particle and t the time at which the velocity is measured . in infinitesimal calculus , ds and dt are simply very small quantities . assume that s = t2 , therefore at time t + dt , s + ds = ( t + dt ) 2. from these equations we can determine ds in terms of dt using simple algebra , and moderate rigour , as follows : and because dt is infinitesimal you can just ignore it , so the instantanous velocity is v = 2t . you get the same result using the limit version , with greater rigour . the infinitesimal derivation can also be made more rigorous .
