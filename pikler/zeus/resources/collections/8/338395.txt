The Dream of Gerontius     the dream of gerontius is a large musical work for choir , three solo singers and orchestra composed by edward elgar . it was composed and first performed in 1900. it is an oratorio , although elgar did not like it being called an “ oratorio ” , but this is how it is usually described . it is usually thought of as the best choral work elgar ever wrote . the words are from a poem by john henry newman . they are supposed to be the words of a man called gerontius who is dying . he imagines what is going to happen to him when he dies : how he will meet god who will judge whether he has been good enough to go to heaven . the angel speaks to him in the poem . there is also a priest , and a short solo for the angel of agony . the work is in two parts . part i is about 40 minutes long and part ii lasts about an hour . the work was composed for the birmingham music festival of 1900 and the first performance took place on 3 october 1900 , in birmingham town hall . there were problems at the first performance : the chorus master died while the work was being learned . some of the music sounded strange to the choir who found it very difficult . the soloists were not very good , and it was difficult for the conductor , hans richter ( who was an excellent conductor ) to stop the choir from singing out of tune . richter had not had time to prepare the work properly : he was only given the full score on the day before the first rehearsal . the next year the work was performed in germany where it was well received .
