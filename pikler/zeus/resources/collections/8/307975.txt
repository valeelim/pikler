Odontochelys     odontochelys is the oldest known turtle to have been discovered . it was first described from three 220 million year-old specimens excavated in upper triassic rocks in guizhou , china . as a primitive turtle , `` odontochelys '' differed from modern turtles in several ways . modern turtles possess a horny beak without any teeth in their mouth . in contrast , `` odontochelys '' fossils had teeth in their upper and lower jaws . one of the most striking features of turtles , both modern and prehistoric alike , are their dorsal shells , forming an armored carapace over the body of the animal . `` odontochelys '' only had the bottom portion of a turtle 's armor , the plastron . it did not yet have a solid carapace as most other turtles do . instead of a solid carapace , `` odontochelys '' had broadened ribs like those of modern turtle embryos that still have not started developing the ossified plates of a carapace . in a comparison of skull proportions , the skull of `` odontochelys '' is far more elongated in front of the eyes compared to other turtles . the tail of the prehistoric turtle was longer in proportion to its body than other turtles . in addition , the transverse processes found in the tail are not fused such as in later turtles .
