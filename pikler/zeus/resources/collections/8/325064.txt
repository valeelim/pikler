TCP/IP model     the tcp/ip model ( transmission control protocol/internet protocol ) is a model with four layers which is used for both modelling current internet architecture , as well as providing a set a rules that govern all forms of transmission over a network . darpa , an agency of the united states department of defense , created it in the 1970s . it evolved from arpanet , which was an early wide area network and a predecessor of the internet . the tcp/ip model is sometimes called the `` internet model '' or less often the `` dod model . this model was being made at the same time as the osi model was created . the tcp/ip model is not the same as the osi model , however it was influenced by the model , which is why many names of the different layers are the same . the tcp/ip model describes a set of general design guidelines and implementations of specific networking protocols to enable computers to communicate over a network . tcp/ip provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted , addressed , transmitted , routed and received at the destination . protocols exist for a variety of different types of communication services between computers .
