Algal bloom     an algal bloom is an accumulation of algae ( typically microscopic ) or a rapid increase in their amount in a body of water . algal blooms may occur in fresh water as well as salt water . algal bloom concentrations may reach millions of cells per milliliter of water . algal blooms are often green , but they can also be other colors such as yellow-brown or red , depending on the species of algae . so-called algal blooms are often caused by cyanobacteria such as `` aphanizomenon flosaquae '' , which are no longer considered to be algae . some kinds of algal blooms , such as red tides , are poisonous . algal blooms are often caused by eutrophication . eutrophication occurs when abnormal amount of nutrients , especially phosphorous and nitrogen , enter a body of water . algal blooms are a big problem to ecosystems because , like any sudden unnatural growth , it harms the other animals in that ecosystem , usually decreasing their numbers quickly . the abundance of algae in algal blooms causes layers of algae that are unable to get sunlight , and this causes the algae to die and start to decompose . the top layers of algae is able to photosynthesize and continue living . the lack of nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the water inhibits other life . fish become unable to breathe and other aquatic vegetation can not photosynthesize . all the organisms in the water start to die and decompose . the decomposition of the dead organisms use up most of the remaining dissolved oxygen in the water . without a sufficient amount of nutrients and dissolved oxygen all living organisms in the water die which leads to a dead zone .
