Protein Data Bank     the protein data bank ( pdb ) is a collection of information about the three dimensional ( 3-d ) structure of large biological molecules , such as proteins and nucleic acids . biologists and biochemists from around the world send in the data . most data comes from x-ray crystallography or nmr spectroscopy . anyone can access the pdb for free online . the worldwide protein data bank , wwpdb , manages the pdb . the pdb is useful for scientists studying structural biology and structural genomics . many scientists have to send their information to the database . major scientific journals and some funding agencies , such as the national institutes of health in the united states have rules telling scientists to send the data to the pdb . the pdb has the original or primary data . hundreds of other databases reuse the data . these secondary databases organize the information in different ways . for example , both scop and cath put structures into groups organized by type of structure and ideas about how they are related through evolution . gene ontology puts the data into groups based on genes .
