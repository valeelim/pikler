Period 1 element     a period 1 element is an element in the first period ( row ) of the periodic table . the periodic table is arranged in rows to show repeating properties of the elements . when the atomic number increases , the element have different properties . a new row begins when chemical properties repeat . it means that elements in the same group have similar properties . the first period has less elements than any other periods in the periodic table . there are only two elements in the first period : hydrogen and helium . we can explain why `` there is less elements in the first row '' in modern theories of atomic structure . this is because in quantum physics , this period fills up the 1s orbital . period 1 elements follows the duet rule , they only need two electrons to complete their valence shell . these elements can only hold two electrons , both in the 1s orbital . therefore , period 1 can have only two elements . as period 1 only has two elements , there are no remarkable periodic trends . although both hydrogen and helium are in the s-block , they do not behaves similarly to other s-block elements . there is argument over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table .
