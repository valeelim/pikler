3D television     the function of 3d television is making a two-dimensional screen look like its picture is in three dimensions . this effect starts when we observe two shifted displays . basic division of 3d technologies - stereoscopic 3d display – `` requires glasses '' - autostereoscopic 3d display – `` without glasses '' 3d televisions in shops and e-shops are in 90 % of cases stereoscopic . glasses are used to see the picture in three dimensionals . the glasses divide display into two components ( either shifted in color or otherwise ) . 3d tv can do anything as well as 2d tv . the newest types of tv even can convert 2d into 3d but the quality is low . movies in 3d format are still scarce . few people would invest their money into partially exploited machine . the best 3d television images are on larger television screens . the closer a person sits to the screen , the stronger the 3d effect . three-dimensional image processing is also more difficult for the brain . because the observation of 3d space in a 3d tv is so hard , viewers should be sitting during the watching 3d tv .
