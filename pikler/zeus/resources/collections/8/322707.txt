Haemocyanin     haemocyanin ( or hemocyanin ) is a protein which transports oxygen in the bodies of some invertebrates . their active centre has two copper atoms which reversibly bind a single oxygen molecule ( o ) . unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates , hemocyanins are not bound to blood cells . the molecules are carried in the haemolymph . hemocyanins are found only in the mollusca and arthropoda . however , the molecule is used only in a few insects . this is because insects evolved another system : the direct transfer of oxygen to tissues by a system of tubes called trachea . this delivers oxygen direct to the wing muscles and other organs .
