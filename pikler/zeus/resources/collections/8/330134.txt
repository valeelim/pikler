DSM IV     the dsm-iv is the fourth version of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm ) . the dsm is a manual written by the american psychiatric association ( apa ) . they are numbered using roman numerals : dsm-i , dsm-ii , dsm-iii , dsm-iv , and dsm-v. after the dsm-iv was published , some changes ( or revisions ) were made to the descriptions in the manual . because of this , the most recent version of the dsm-iv is officially called the dsm-iv-tr ( the tr stands for `` text revision '' ) . the dsm lists every condition that is officially called a mental illness by the apa . the dsm organizes these conditions into different categories . each condition is given a code , made up of numbers or a combination of numbers and letters . along with the condition 's name and code , the dsm also gives other information , like : 1. symptoms of the condition . 1. diagnostic criteria : the requirements that need to be met before the condition is diagnosed . 1. differential diagnosis : other conditions that have some of the same symptoms . these conditions should be ruled out before a diagnosis is made .
