Bruce Beutler     bruce alan beutler m.d . ( born december 29 , 1957 in chicago , illinois ) is an american immunologist and geneticist . together with jules hoffmann , he received one-half of the 2011 nobel prize in physiology or medicine , for `` discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity '' ( the other half went to ralph steinman for `` his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity '' ) . beutler is currently director of the center for the genetics of host defense at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas , texas and professor and chairman of the department of genetics at the scripps research institute , in la jolla , california . his father , ernest beutler , a hematologist and medical geneticist , was also a professor and department chairman at scripps . beutler is best known for his pioneering molecular and genetic studies of inflammation and innate immunity . interested in the mechanism by which lipopolysacchride ( lps ) activates mammalian immune cells , beutler identified the lps receptor . identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning ( a method of gene identification ) of the mammalian `` lps '' locus , which had been known since the 1960s as a key gene for biological responses to lps .
