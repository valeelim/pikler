Trachea     the trachea , or windpipe , is the bony tube that connects the nose and mouth to the lungs , and is an important part of the vertebrate respiratory system . the trachea begins at the lower part of the larynx and continues to the lungs , where it branches into the right and left bronchi . inflammation of the trachea can lead to other conditions , such as tracheitis , which is the inflammation of the linings of the trachea . the invertebrate trachea refers to the open respiratory system of terrestrial arthropods . it consists of spiracles , tracheae , and tracheoles that take metabolic gases to and from tissues . the distribution of spiracles varies , but in general each segment of the body has only one pair of spiracles , each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it . the smallest tubes , tracheoles , penetrate cells and diffuse water , oxygen , and carbon dioxide . gas may be moved actively or by passive diffusion . unlike vertebrates , insects do not generally carry oxygen in their haemolymph .
