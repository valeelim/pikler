Frontal lobe     the frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals , at the front of each cerebral hemisphere . it is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes . the frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information ( sight , sound , touch ) from the three rear areas of the cerebrum . the action is moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex . the system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain , such as hunger , self-defence and sex , with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable . the precentral gyrus , forming the back of the frontal lobe , contains the primary motor cortex . this controls voluntary movements of specific body parts . for many years , many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans than in other primates . they thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the main reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates .
