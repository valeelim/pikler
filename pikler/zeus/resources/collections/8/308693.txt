Echiura     the echiura , or spoon worms , are a small group of marine animals . they are often considered to be a group of annelids , although they lack the segmented structure found in other members of that group , and so may also be treated as a separate phylum . however , phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences place echiurans and sipuncula within the annelida .
