Fezouata Formation     the upper and lower fezouata formations of morocco are burgess shale type deposits dating to the lower ordovician . in the fossilized fauna were numerous organisms previously thought to have died out after the mid-cambrian . the discovery proves conclusively that the burgess shale biota did not go extinct in the cambrian . over 1500 non-mineralized burgess shale types , representing 50 taxa , have been recovered from the formations . there are also a less abundant shelly fauna . the make-up of the community varies significantly through the stratigraphic sequence , with both abundances and faunal composition changing as time progresses . small ( 1â€“3 mm wide ) burrows are present in the sediment , but major burrowing is absent ; this may suggest a paucity of oxygen in the water or sediment . particularly notable is the presence of bryozoa and graptolites , forms that are absent in the cambrian period . various echinoderms indicate a normal range of salinity , and the overall shelly assemblage is not significantly different from the normal shelly fauna expected in open ordovician waters .
