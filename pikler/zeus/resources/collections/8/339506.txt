Bias (textile)    bias ( textile ) the bias of a piece of woven fabric is at 45 degrees to its warp and weft threads . every piece of woven fabric has two biases , at right angles to each other . fabrics which are not woven , such as felt , do not have a bias . when cut on the bias , woven fabric is more elastic as well as more fluid in movement , compared to the on-grain direction . this helps many types of garment , such as skirts , dresses and neckties . the `` bias-cut '' is a technique used by tailors and dress-makers for cutting cloth . the greater stretch in the bias ( diagonal ) direction of the fabric , helps it accentuate body lines and curves and drape softly . for example , a full-skirted dress cut on the bias will hang more gracefully or a narrow dress will cling to the figure . bias-cut garments were prominent in haute couture clothes designed by madeleine vionnet in the 1920s . it is still used often in both haute couture and high street clothing . in the middle ages , before the development of knitting , hose leggings were cut on the bias in order to make them fit better .
