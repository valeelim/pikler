Rhombozoa     the rhombozoa , or dicyemida , are a group of tiny parasites that live in the renal appendages of cephalopods . classification is controversial . they are probably a new phylum . traditionally , dicyemids have been grouped with the orthonectida in the mesozoa . however , molecular phylogeny indicates that dicyemids may be more closely related to the roundworms . adult dicyemids range in length from , and they can be seen through a light microscope . they have eutely : each adult individual of a given species has the same number of cells . cell number is a useful identifying character . the organism 's structure is simple : a single axial cell is surrounded by a jacket of twenty to thirty ciliated cells . dicyemids exist in both asexual and sexual forms . the asexual forms are found in juvenile and immature hosts ; and the sexual forms in mature hosts . the asexual stage is termed a `` nematogen '' ; it produces `` vermiform '' ( worm-like ) larvae in the axial cell . these mature through direct development to form more nematogens . nematogens proliferate in young cephalopods , filling the kidneys . later , as the hosts mature , sexual forms called `` rhombogens '' are formed . they are hermaphrodites , with gonads of both sexes . the rhombogens self-fertilise , and later release larvae .
