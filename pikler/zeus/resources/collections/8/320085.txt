Magnetic flux     magnetic flux it is the number of magnetic field lines passing through a surface ( such as a loop of wire ) . the magnetic flux through a closed surface ( such as a ball ) is always zero . this implies that there can not be magnetic charges in classical electromagnetism . the si unit of magnetic flux is the weber ( wb ) ( in derived units : volt-seconds ) . the cgs unit is the maxwell . magnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos . physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate magnetic flux . other pages . - magnetic field - james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces are two complementary aspects of electromagnetism . - maxwell 's equations describe the behavior of both the electric and magnetic fields , as well as their interactions with matter . - gauss 's law gives the relation between the electric flux flowing out a closed surface and the electric charge enclosed in the surface . - magnetic circuit is a method using an analogy with electric circuits to calculate the flux of complex systems of magnetic components .
