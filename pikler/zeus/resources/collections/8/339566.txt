To each according to his contribution     when a society transforms from capitalism to socialism and then to communism , every person should be rewarded for the amount they contribute to society . economists such as david ricardo ( 1772-1823 ) had this idea . ricardo founded a movement that is known as ricardian socialism today . many people in the labour movement had this idea too . ferdinand lassalle ( 1825–1864 ) and eugen dühring ( 1833-1921 ) expressed such ideas towards leon trotsky . despite this , vladimir lenin was the first person to say that this element is fundamental to marxist theory . according to libertarian socialist thinkers , such as american anarchist benjamin tucker , socialism is a system in which the laborer receives the full product of his labor . this eliminates exploitation and `` unearned '' income accrued to the capitalist . the term `` to each according to his contribution '' simply means that each worker in a socialist society receives wages and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed . that way , highly productive workers will receive more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity , and substantially more than workers of low productivity . what is more , the more difficult the job is , the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed . difficulty can result from factors such as greater training requirement , job intensity or safety hazards . according to trotzky , the idea is to promote productivity . this is done by creating incentives to work harder , longer , and more productively . in the end , the principle comes from capitalism , but will vanish , according to marx , as work becomes more automated and enjoyable , and as goods become available in greater quantities .
