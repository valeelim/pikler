Gristmill     a grist mill grinds grain into flour . most old ones are watermills . they have a waterwheel and 2 stones for grinding . water pushes the wheel causing it to spin . this movement causes an axle inside to turn . the axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin . at the top , there is a chute filled with grain . the grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones . some old grist mills are windmills .
