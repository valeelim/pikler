Tawny owl     the tawny owl or brown owl ( `` strix aluco '' ) is a stocky , medium-sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of eurasia . there are eleven recognised subspecies , and some variation in the colouring . the nest is usually in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators . this owl is resident through the year , and highly territorial . many young birds starve if they can not find a vacant territory once parental care ceases . this nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents , usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey , which it swallows whole ; in towns its diet includes a higher proportion of birds . vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting . the tawny is capable of catching smaller owls , but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk . red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young . although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision , its retina is no more sensitive than a human 's . rather , it is its asymmetrically placed ears that are key to its hunting . they give the tawny owl excellent directional hearing . like most owls , it hunts at night . it has a rather strange , but easily imitated , call .
