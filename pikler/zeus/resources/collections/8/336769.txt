Nautiloid     nautiloids are a large and varied group of marine cephalopods ( mollusca ) in the subclass nautiloidea . they began in the later cambrian . `` nautilus '' is the only surviving genus . nautiloids flourished during the early palaeozoic era , when they were the main predatory animals . they developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms . some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known , though only a few species survive today . nautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods . the cephalopods are an advanced class of molluscs . the cephalopods also include ammonoids , belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid . traditionally , the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids , ammonoids , and coleoids . this article is about nautiloids in that broad sense , sometimes called nautiloidea `` sensu lato '' . cladistically speaking , nautiloids are a paraphyletic group united by shared primitive ( basal ) features not found in derived cephalopods . in other words , they are a evolutionary grade that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids . they are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups . both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from bactritids , which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthocerid nautiloids .
