Defence against predators     for most animals , defence against predators is vital . being eaten is not the only threat to life : parasites and diseases may also be fatal . but animals , especially small animals , are often eaten . since life is about reproduction , anything that keeps a creature alive long enough for it to reproduce will be selected for . the next generation comes from the fertilised eggs of the previous generation . not surprisingly , then , animals have developed a wide range of defences against predation . some of these defences apply also to plants : herbivory on plants can be very damaging , and reduce a plant 's fertility . many plants have some defence against herbivores . primary defences make it less likely that there will be a meeting between the predator and the prey . in many cases this means the predator has not noticed or recognised the prey . there are various definitions of what a primary defence is : - robinson 1969 : those defences which operate before a predator starts any prey-catching behaviour .
