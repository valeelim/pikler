Structural isomer     structural isomerism ( iupac call this constitutional isomerism ) is a kind of isomerism . two chemical in this isomerism have the same molecular formula , but the molecules have bonded together in different orders . the opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism . there are many words that represents structual isomers . there are three kinds of constitutional isomers . they are skeletal isomers , positional isomers , and functional isomers . positional isomers are also called regioisomers . tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers . in skeletal isomerism , or chain isomerism , components of the skeleton ( usually carbon ) are re-ordered to make different structures . pentane has three isomers . they are `` n '' -pentane ( often called simply `` pentane '' ) , isopentane ( methylbutane ) and neopentane ( dimethylpropane ) . in position isomerism , a functional group or other substituent changes its position on a parent structure . in the table below , the hydroxyl group can stay in three different positions on an n-pentane chain to make three different compounds .
