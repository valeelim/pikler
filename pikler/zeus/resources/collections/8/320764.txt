Near-Earth object     a near-earth object ( neo ) is a solar system object whose orbit brings it close to the earth . their least distance from the sun , their perihelion , is less than 1.3 au . neos include near-earth asteroids ( neas ) and near-earth comets . they include more than ten thousand near-earth asteroids ( neas ) , near-earth comets , some solar-orbiting spacecraft , and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before striking the earth . collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the planet . in some cases neos hit the earth . most of these explode harmlessly in the upper atmosphere . but some neos are dangerous . on 30 june 1908 , a meteorite of around 45 metres in diameter exploded over the basin of the podkamennaya tunguska river . it released an energy of 10â€“15 megatons of tnt and destroyed roughly 2,000 square kilometres of forest . such an explosion , similar to one of the biggest nuclear weapons , could have razed london about as far out as the m25 ring road . however , because the location was remote , no deaths were recorded . the association of space explorers estimates that a tunguksa-like event happens two or three times every thousand years on average . an asteroid roughly 10 km in diameter is thought to have hit earth 66 million years ago and caused the k/t extinction event , including the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs .
