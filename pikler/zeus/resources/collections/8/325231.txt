Chromatophore     chromatophores are pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells found in amphibians , fish , reptiles , crustaceans , and cephalopods . they are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in cold-blooded animals . some species can rapidly change colour so as to keep in camouflage , or to signal . they do this by moving pigment and reflective plates in chromatophores . this process is called physiological colour change . cephalopods such as octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this . the display is under central nervous control based usually on input from the eyes . vertebrates such as chameleons get a similar effect by cell signalling . such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters . they may be started by changes in mood , temperature , stress or visible changes around the animal . colleoid cephalopods have complex organs which they use to change colour rapidly . this is seen in squid , cuttlefish and octopuses . each chromatophore unit is a single chromatophore cell and muscle , nerve , glial and sheath cells . inside the chromatophore cell , pigment granules are in an elastic sac . to change colour the animal changes the sac form or size by muscular contraction . this changes its appearance . this differs from the mechanism used in fish , amphibians and reptiles , because the shape of the sac is being changed rather than pigment being moved in the cell . however , a similar effect is achieved .
