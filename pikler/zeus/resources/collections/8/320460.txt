Criticism of Buddhism     the criticism of buddhism is much like the criticism of any other religion . it is mainly done by people who do not agree with what the religion says and what it believes . the criticism often come from agnostics , skeptics , materialist philosophy , people who follow other religions , or by buddhists who want change . criticisms include some beliefs that are only found in some buddhist cultures and institutions . these are not all true to original buddhist principles . sam harris , a new atheism supporter , and believers in buddhist meditation say that many followers of buddhism treat it as a religion in the wrong way . they say that their beliefs are often `` naive , petitionary , and superstitious '' . ( `` petitionary '' means making a petition , or a request , as when asking for help . ) they think this stops the followers from living the true buddhist principles . some critics say that buddhist followers and leaders have been interested in property and money . they think that they are corrupt and are more interested in wealth and power rather than buddhist principles . there have been many sex scandals involving teachers in western buddhist groups .
