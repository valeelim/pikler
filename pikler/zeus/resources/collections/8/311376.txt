Conservative Judaism     in conservative judaism , jewish values can be divided into ethical and ritual laws - the ethical laws do not change , while the ritual laws are used in different customs . because often times jews have to be a part of the society they live in , some of the ritual laws must be adapted to it . such adaptations also allow modern lifestyles . another belief in conservative judaism is that the texts that are the basis of judaism should not be read literally , and that they can be analyzed and criticized like any other text . in conservative judaism , women are seen as equal to men and are allowed to sit with the men when attending synagogue , whereas in orthodox judaism for example , women are expected to sit in a different area . women are also allowed to not wear head coverings when attending synagogue . other websites . - the core principles of conservative judaism , by ismar schorsch on behalf of the jewish theological seminary - conservative jews in israel : official masorti movement website
