Circuit breaker     a circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing . this usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit . circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel . some circuit breakers also have gfci protection . inside the circuit breaker , there is usually an electromagnetic coil . when too much current flows through the coil , it pulls on the switch , shutting the power off . the coil reacts to immediate short circuits . there is also a bimetal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot . this reacts to extended periods of too much current . some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically , and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current . a circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse , but unlike a fuse , a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset , except in some severe cases such as very high-current short circuits and lightning strikes that may damage the circuit breaker .
