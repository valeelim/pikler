Appendage     appendages are parts of animals attached the main body . many arthropods have appendages on each , or most , of their segments . millipedes , for example , have many segments , and almost all carry two legs . insects have exactly six legs , two on each segment of the thorax . antennae ( feelers ) attached to their heads are another type of appendage . wings , parts of the tail , legs , some mouthparts , external sex organs can all be described as appendages . appendages may be uniramous , as in insects and centipedes , where each appendage comprises a single series of segments , or it may be biramous , as in many crustaceans , where each appendage branches into two sections . all arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure ( homologous ) . which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes . changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals ( such as `` drosophila melanogaster '' ) with modified appendages , such as legs instead of antennae .
