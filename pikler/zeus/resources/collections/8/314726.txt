Kimmeridge clay     the kimmeridge clay formation is a sedimentary deposit of fossiliferous marine clay and mudstones . it is of upper jurassic age , and occurs in europe . it gives its name to a stage in the upper jurassic called the kimmeridgian , lasting from 157.3â€“152.1 million years ago . kimmeridge clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of europe , because it is the major source for oil fields in the north sea . the clay is named after the village of kimmeridge on the dorset coast of england , where it is well exposed and forms part of the jurassic coast world heritage site . it exists across england , in a band stretching from dorset in the south-west , north-east to east anglia and hull . the river humber bridge 's foundations are in the kimmeridge clay deposits under the humber estuary . the fossil fauna of the kimmeridge clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles , crocodiles , dinosaurs , plesiosaurs , pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs , as well as many invertebrate species such as `` gryphaea '' .
