Saint Sebastian     saint sebastian ( died c. 268 ) was a christian saint and martyr . he is said to have been killed during the roman emperor diocletian 's persecution of christians . he is usually depicted in art and literature tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows . this is the most common artistic depiction of sebastian . however , he was rescued and healed by irene of rome . he then criticised the emperor . he was clubbed to death . he is venerated in both the roman catholic and the orthodox churches . saint sebastian is possibly the earliest gay icon . his strong and shirtless physique , symbolic arrow-pierced flesh , and rapturous look of pain combined have intrigued both gay and straight artists for centuries . this interest launched the first explicitly gay cult in the 19th century . journalist richard a. kaye wrote , `` contemporary gay men have seen in sebastian at once a stunning advertisement for homosexual desire ( indeed , a homoerotic ideal ) , and a prototypical portrait of tortured closet case . '' because saint sebastian is a gay icon , tennessee williams chose to use that name for the martyred character sebastian in his play , `` suddenly , last summer '' . the name was also used by irish writer and poet oscar wilde ( as sebastian melmoth ) when in exile after his release from prison . wilde was about as `` out of the closet '' as was possible for the late 19th century . he is himself considered a gay icon .
