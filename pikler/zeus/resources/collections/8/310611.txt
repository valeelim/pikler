Fugacity     in thermodynamics , the fugacity is a state function of any isothermal system . the fugacity , which has units of pressure , represents the tendency of a fluid to escape or expand isothermally . for gases at low pressures where the ideal gas law holds , fugacity is equal to pressure . the ratio formula_1 between fugacity formula_2 and pressure formula_3 is called the fugacity coefficient ; therefore , formula_4 for an ideal gas . the fugacity formula_5 is defined at fixed temperature formula_6 by the following differential relation : where formula_8 is the gibbs free energy , formula_9 is the molar gas constant , and formula_10 is the fluid 's volume . for any two isothermal physical states , represented by subscripts 1 and 2 , the ratio of the two fugacities is as follows :
