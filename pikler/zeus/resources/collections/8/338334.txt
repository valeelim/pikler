Administrator of the Northern Territory     the administrator of the northern territory is the person selected by the governor-general of australia to act as the governor of the northern territory of australia . the selection of administrator is made by the governor-general-in-council , that is , the governor-general acting on the `` advice '' of the australian government , not the advice of the government of the northern territory . the northern territory became self-governing on 1 july 1978. now the governor-general-in council accepts a `` recommendation '' from the northern territory government . unlike an australian state governor , the administrator does not represent the queen in the territory . they represent the governor-general who is the queen 's representative in the commonwealth . the administrator 's role is to govern the territory under the law which gave it self-government . the administrator 's constitutional role is almost the same as a state governor and can be considered the queen 's `` indirect '' representative in the territory .
