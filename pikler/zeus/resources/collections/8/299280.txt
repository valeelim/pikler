Icknield Street     icknield street or ryknild street is a roman road in britain that runs from the fosse way at bourton on the water in gloucestershire to templeborough in south yorkshire . it passes through alcester , birmingham , lichfield and derby . four roman roads are named in the laws of edward the confessor ; watling street , ermine street , the fosse way and hikenild ( or icknield ) street . hikenild street , is generally supposed to be connected with the iceni . various forms of the name , the earliest , in anglo-saxon , are icenhilde weg or icenilde we . these roads are from the borders of norfolk through cambridgeshire , bucks , berks , hants , and wilts into dorset . these locations however would identify the path as icknield way , an iron age trackway running from norfolk to dorset . this road got the name ryknild street during the 12th century when it was named by ranulf higdon , a monk writing in 1344 in his `` polychronicon '' . higdon , gives the name of the fourth road as rikenild strete , which , he says , tends from the south-west to the north , and begins at st. david 's and continues to the mouth of the tyne , passing worcester , droitwich , birmingham , lichfield , derby , and chesterfield . it has borne that name , or rigning , reenald , or rignall , from early times . in three of the four mss . of higdon , the name is given rikenilde , rikenyldes , and in the fourth , which is said to be one of the earliest , hikenil street . trevisa 's english translation ( 1387 ) calls it rykeneldes street . harverfield writing in the victoria county history of warwickshire doubted if the road had any real and original right to either name , preferring ryknild as no less correct , ( or no more wrong ) and being able to separate it from icknield street in oxfordshire and berkshire . it is now called icknield or ryknild street to separate it from the older icknield way . a kept part of the roman road can be seen at sutton park in birmingham .
