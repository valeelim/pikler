Cognitive dissonance     cognitive dissonance is a concept in social psychology . it is the discomfort felt by a person who holds conflicting ideas , beliefs or values at the same time . in this state , people may feel surprise , dread , guilt , anger , or embarrassment . reacting to this unpleasant state , people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance . leon festinger 's theory of cognitive dissonance was developed to predict and explain how people reacted to this situation . cognitive dissonance theory says that people have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality . according to festinger , people engage in a process he termed `` dissonance reduction '' . this can be got in one of three ways : 1. lowering the importance of one of the discordant factors , 1. adding consonant elements , or 1. changing one of the dissonant factors . this bias sheds light on otherwise puzzling , irrational , and even destructive behavior . people in dissonance may change their feelings , thoughts or memories so they are less in conflict . however , often they do not , and instead set out to manipulate the social scene around them so that their embarrassment is less . for example , they may try to explain away the dissonance with a wider theory or they may intensify their efforts at persuasion and publicity so that others join them in their beliefs .
