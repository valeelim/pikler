Classical Chinese     classical chinese or literary chinese is a traditional register of written chinese . it is based on the grammar and vocabulary of ancient chinese , so it is different from any modern spoken form of chinese . classical chinese was once used for almost all formal writing before and during the beginning of the 20th century in china , and during various different periods in korea , japan and vietnam . among chinese speakers , classical chinese has been largely replaced by written vernacular chinese , or 白话/白話 `` báihuà '' ( `` plain speech '' ) . written vernacular chinese is a writing style very closely related to modern spoken mandarin chinese . at the same time , non-chinese speakers have largely given up classical chinese , and use their local languages or dialects instead . although many words and phrases used in classical chinese have been replaced by words and phrases made up of different characters in standard chinese , many of the characters that were common in classical chinese can be found in modern chinese words and phrases as well as retain their meanings . for example , while the word `` to eat '' is 食 ( shí ) in classical chinese , it is 吃 ( chī ) in standard chinese . however , the character 食 is still found in words related to food and eating like 食品 ( shípĭn ) , which is the standard chinese word for `` food '' . the chart below compares classical chinese words to the standard chinese words that replaced them .
