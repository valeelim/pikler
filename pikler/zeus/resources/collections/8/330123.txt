Psychological nativism     in psychology , nativism is a theory that says that most basic skills are hard-wired in the brain at birth . this theory is the opposite of the theory called the blank slate , or `` tabula rasa '' . blank slate theories said that humans have almost no skills or abilities at birth : they learn these skills over the course of their life . people who believe in nativism ( within certain limits ) include jerry fodor , noam chomsky and steven pinker . these psychologists believe that humans are born with a set of abilities that help them learn other skills , such as speech . some mammals do seem to inherit emotional reactions . monkeys fearing snakes is an example . most of the behaviour of insects , reptiles and birds is inherited in some detail . mammals , however , show a greater ability for learning than other kinds of animals . charles darwin , in `` the expression of emotions in man and animals '' ( 1872 ) , showed that the way most emotions were shown was common between human cultures . he said this was inherited and had been the result of evolution . behaviorism says that man 's behaviour is affected by its results ( operant conditioning ) . behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours , instincts , or an inherited tendency to behave . people who believe in evolutionary psychology think this is wrong . they think human behaviour has deep roots in our evolutionary past .
