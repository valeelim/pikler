Woodward–Hoffmann rules     the woodward–hoffmann rules are a set of organic chemistry rules to predict the stereochemistry of pericyclic reactions . pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions where the molecule is a ring ( e.g . benzene ring ) . they were written by robert burns woodward ( a chemistry professor at harvard university ) and roald hoffmann ( a chemistry professor at cornell university ) . hoffmann was awarded the 1981 nobel prize in chemistry for this work , shared with kenichi fukui who developed a similar model . woodward did not share the prize because he died two years before . generally , the nobel prize is awarded only to living people . woodward had already won a nobel prize in chemistry for a different discovery . a recent paper in the journal `` nature '' describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate woodward–hoffman rules . related pages . - woodward 's rules for calculating uv absorptions - torquoselectivity
