Eigenvalues and eigenvectors     linear algebra talks about functions , which are often called transformations . in that context , an eigenvector is a vector—different from the null vector—which does not change direction in the transformation ( except if it turns the vector exactly around ) . the vector may change its length , or become null . the value of the change in length of the vector is known as eigenvalue . if there exists a square matrix called a , a scalar `` λ , and a non-zero vector v , then λ '' is the eigenvalue and v is the eigenvector if the following equation is satisfied : in other words , if matrix `` a '' times the vector v is equal to the scalar `` λ '' times the vector v , then `` λ '' is the eigenvalue of v , where v is the eigenvector . an eigenspace of `` a '' is the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector . however , the zero vector is not an eigenvector . these ideas often are extended to more general situations , where scalars are elements of any field , vectors are elements of any vector space , and linear transformations may or may not be represented by matrix multiplication . for example , instead of real numbers , scalars may be complex numbers ; instead of arrows , vectors may be functions or frequencies ; instead of matrix multiplication , linear transformations may be operators such as the derivative from calculus . these are only a few of countless examples where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important .
