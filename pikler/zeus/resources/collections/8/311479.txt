Optical illusion     an optical illusion ( also called a visual illusion ) is one which shows images that differ from normal reality . the information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception . that is normal , but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source . there are three main types of visual illusion : 1. literal optical illusions that create images which are different from the objects that make them 1. physiological illusions : they are the effects on the eyes and brain of over-stimulation of brightness , colour , size , position , tilt , movement 1. cognitive illusions , the result of unconscious inferences ( brain makes the wrong decision ) . the general explanation for most illusions is the way the brain works on sense data to produce a meaningful perception . a great 19th century psychologist hermann von helmholtz described perception as `` unconscious inferences from sensory data and past experience '' . richard gregory discussed how the brain makes an hypothesis about what 's out there , and sometimes the hypothesis does not quite work out . his model of perception is an interaction between data from sense organs and previous knowledge and experience .
