Monomer     a monomer is a single atom or molecule which is able to join with other monomers to make new substances called polymers . the words come from the greek language where `` mono '' means `` one '' , `` poly '' means `` many '' , and `` meros '' means `` a part '' . a feature of monomers is that they have two carbon atoms which are joined , called a carbon double bond . the double bond allows the monomer to make the long chains of polymers . there are thousands of different monomers . examples of monomers include monosaccharide which is simple sugar , glycerol , amino acid and nucleotide . the most made monomer is ethylene
