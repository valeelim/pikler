Eosinophil granulocyte     eosinophil granulocytes , usually called `` eosinophils '' or `` eosinophiles '' , are granulocyte white blood cells that fight off certain parasites and infections in vertebrates . when they are activated , eosinophils release a cocktail of proteins from their granules , including heparin . like mast cells and basophils , their main targets are parasites , and they are part causes of the syndromes called asthma and allergy . eosinophils make up 1-6 % of white blood cells circulating in the body . they are similar in size to neutrophils but have reddish-orange granules ( when stained with eosin ) and a bilobed nucleus . eosinophil granulocytes are important defenders against large , multi-cellular parasites , such as worms and flukes . their numbers increase during a parasitic infection .
