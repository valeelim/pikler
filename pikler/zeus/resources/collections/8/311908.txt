Solid-state drive     a solid-state drive ( ssd ) is a data storage device , typically used in a computer . it uses flash memory to store data even after power is turned off . ssds are designed to access data in the same way as traditional hard disk drives ( hdds ) . a hdd can usually be directly replaced with a ssd . the best thing about solid state drives is that they have a much faster read/write speed than hard disk drives . they also have no moving parts , which means they do n't make noise or break as easily . unfortunately , ssds are much more expensive than hard disk drives . this also means that for the same price , someone can get much more capacity if they select a hdd instead . a hybrid drive combines the features of an hdd and an ssd into one unit . it contains a large hdd and a smaller ssd cache to improve performance of frequently accessed files . a hybrid drive can offer almost the same performance as an ssd and it can contain more capacity . the price is also lower than of an ssd . the solid state drive technology is improving quickly and new ssd models are being introduced often .
