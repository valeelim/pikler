Lasseter's Reef    lasseter 's reef lasseter 's reef was a legendary rich gold deposit that was said to be in remote central australia . a prospector , harold bell lasseter , claimed to have discovered the site in 1897. but lasseter forgot the exact location of it . he died when he went back into the desert to look for it again . the gold 's location remains a mystery—nobody even knows whether it really exists . lasseter told the story in 1929. he said that he had found the gold near the border of the northern territory and western australia . this area at the time was uncharted ( no maps had been made of it ) . when he came out of the desert , he spent the next thirty years trying to get people to fund an expedition to go back and look for it . but people ignored him because people were already making fortune from the gold rush at kalgoorlie in western australia . nobody wanted to risk going into unchartered desert . but during the great depression , people became interested . lasseter got enough money for an expedition to relocate the gold . but the expedition was hard—there were long distances involved , no maps to guide them , and it was very hard to find water . when the expedition party became lost , the people who went with lasseter called him a liar . they left him , but lasseter continued , with one other man . the man later said that lasseter became crazy in the desert , and he too left him .
