Euclid's lemma    euclid 's lemma euclid 's lemma , also called euclid 's division lemma or euclid 's first theorem , is an important lemma . it was made by the mathematician euclid . he basically proposed that for any two integers ( let us call them 'a ' and 'b ' ) there exists 2 unique integers ( let us call them ' q ' and ' r ' ) that satisfies the equation , a = qb + r , where r < a . in the equation , the variable 'b ' is dividing the variable 'a ' . this makes 'b ' the divisor and 'a ' as the dividend 'q ' is the quotient and 'r ' is the remainder the equation thus means that a dividend is equal to its divisor multiplied with its quotient and added with its remainder .
