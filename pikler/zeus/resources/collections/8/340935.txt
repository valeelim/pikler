Hala'ib Triangle     the hala'ib triangle ( مثلث حلايب in arabic , transliterated muthāllath ḥalāʾib ) is an area of land measuring located on the red sea 's african coast . the area , which is named after the town of hala'ib , is created by the difference in the egypt–sudan border between the `` political boundary '' set in 1899 by the anglo-egyptian condominium , which runs along the 22nd parallel north , and the `` administrative boundary '' set by the british in 1902 , which gave an area of land north of the line to sudan . when sudan became independent in 1956 , both egypt and sudan claimed sovereignty over the area . after egypt sent military units to the hala'ib triangle in the 1990s , egypt has controlled the area as part of the red sea governorate , and has been actively investing in it . the area is not shaped like a triangle—it is actually a complicated polygon . only the southern border is a straight line . a smaller area , called bir tawil , touches the hala'ib triangle at its westernmost point . bir tawil is not claimed by either sudan or egypt .
