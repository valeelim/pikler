Abloy     abloy is the leading manufacturer of disc-detainer locks . the name abloy is an abbreviation of `` ab lukko oy '' , which , roughly translated from finnish , means `` lock company '' . abloy 's current lock cylinder is called the protec2 , and is considered to be almost impossible to pick . it has many anti-pick features , including false gates and return bars that lock all of the discs in place if there is an attempt to manipulate them individually . there is one video of an abloy protec lock being decoded , but it is a cutaway lock , which means that it is possible to see inside the cylinder . older cylinders made by abloy include the classic , profile , disklock , and exec . abloy is a finnish company which was started in 1907 by emil henriksson , who invented the disc-detainer lock . in 1994 abloy was purchased by swedish company assa to form the assa abloy group , which also owns medeco , sargent , and several other lock manufacturers . abloy has patents on the protec key and cylinder , making it illegal for other companies to make or copy protec keys . only licensed abloy distributors and the abloy factory can copy keys , and only at the lock owner 's request . this makes it safe to lend a protec key to a janitor , tenant , or other person without worrying that they may have copied the key . the classic key is no longer patented , but it is still difficult for someone to obtain a copy from other than an abloy dealer because normal key cutting machines can not cut the left-to-right pattern on an abloy key .
