Seamount     a seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean sea floor . it does not reach to the water 's surface ( sea level ) , and so is not an island . these are usually formed from submarine volcanoes . they are usually 1,000–4,000 metres ( 3,000–13,000 ft ) in height from the sea floor . the peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface , and so are in the deep sea . there are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe , but only a few have been studied . seamounts come in all shapes and sizes , and follow a distinctive pattern of growth , activity , and death . in recent years , several active seamounts have been observed , for example loihi seamount in the hawaiian–emperor seamount chain . seamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world . interactions between seamounts and underwater currents , and their raised position in the water , attract plankton , corals , fish , and cetacea alike . their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry , and many seamounts support extensive fisheries . there are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems . there are well-documented cases of stock decline . 95 % of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling , which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts .
