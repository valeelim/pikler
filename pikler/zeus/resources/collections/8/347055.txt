Electrical filament     in a light bulb there is a small thin wire with two bigger wires holding it up . this wire is called a filament . the filament is the part of the light bulb that produces light . filaments in incandescent light bulbs are made of tungsten . when electric current goes through the filament , the filament glows . it may also be known as the electron emitting element in a vacuum tube . to make the bulb produce more light , the filament is usually made of coils of fine wire , also known as the coiled coil . the first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon . as the filaments got hotter , their electrical resistance decreased . carbon filaments were heated up by current passing through them . changing the carbon to graphite changed the lamp to a positive temperature number ( rather than a negative ) like a metallic conductor . changing the filament helped stabilize the amount of power it used . in 1902 a tantalum filament was developed which made lamps even more efficient . tantalum filaments could operate at higher temperatures . in 1906 the tungsten filament was invented . the tungsten filament is a solid cylinder equal to the power of the coiled coil .
