Binary pulsar     a binary pulsar is a pulsar with a binary companion , often a white dwarf or neutron star . in at least one case , the double pulsar psr j0737-3039 , the companion star is another pulsar as well . binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test general relativity in the case of a strong gravitational field . although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe , the timing of the pulses from the pulsar can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by radio telescopes . binary pulsar timing has indirectly confirmed the existence of gravitational radiation and verified einstein 's general theory of relativity . two objects orbiting do not do so in absolutely circular paths . the paths are virtually always elliptical . so twice a circuit they are closest , and twice a circuit they are furthest away . this is obvious for the earth and sun , but the idea applies much more widely . when the two bodies are close , the gravitational field is stronger , and the passage of time is slowed . with pulsars , the time between pulses ( or ticks ) is lengthened . as the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time . this is a relativistic time delay . it is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion , and what is actually observed .
