Swing (seat)    swing ( seat ) a swing is a hanging seat . it is usually found in a playground for children . acrobats in a circus can also have swings which hang from the top of the tent . sometimes chairs in gardens are made to swing gently . the seat of a swing is suspended from chains or ropes . the child sits on the swing and kicks off from the ground with his feet . the swing then starts to swing to and fro . the child can make the swing go higher by pulling ( as he goes forwards ) and pushing ( as he goes backwards ) the rope and by making his legs straight as it goes up . once a swing is in motion it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until something brings it to a halt . in children 's playgrounds some swings are made for very young children . they have safety bars with holes for the legs . their parents can push them to help the swing . at the highest point on a swing , the person sitting on it is weightless . usually the ground is made of a soft material so that they do not hurt themselves too much if they fall off , although this should not happen if they are being sensible . sometimes several swings are hung from one long metal or wooden frame .
