Camposaurus     camposaurus is a dinosaur from the late triassic of north america . it is a relative of `` coelophysis '' . this relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis . with fossils dating back to 205â€“210 million years ago ( mya ) , it is the oldest known neotheropod . it is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material . a study of `` camposaurus arizoniensis '' by ezcurra and brusatte discovered two unique features . this meant the specimen was a valid genus and species . `` camposaurus '' is definitely a neotheropod . based on phylogenetic analysis , its closest known relative is `` megapnosaurus rhodensis '' , because they share similarities in the tibia , and ankle . spielman et al . ( 2007 ) put `` camposaurus '' in the family coelophysidae .
