Gigantoraptor     gigantoraptor is a genus of giant oviraptorosaur theropod dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago in the later cretaceous . it was discovered in 2005 in inner mongolia . since 2001 , in a quarry , remains of the sauropod `` sonidosaurus '' had been uncovered . in april 2005 chinese paleontologist xu xing was asked to reenact the discovery of `` sonidosaurus '' for a japanese documentary . xu obliged them by digging out a thighbone . as he wiped the bone clean , he suddenly realized it was not from a sauropod , but from an unidentifiable theropod about the size of `` albertosaurus '' . he stopped the filming to secure the serendipitous find . this way , the discovery of the `` gigantoraptor '' fossil was captured on videotape . in 2007 the `` gigantoraptor erlianensis '' was named and described by xu and colleagues . the type specimen was found in strata dating to about 70 million years ago . it is the remains of a single subadult individual.the partial skeleton lacks the skull but includes the lower jaws , a single neck vertebra , most of the back , tail and leg elements .
