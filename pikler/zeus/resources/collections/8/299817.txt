Euglena     euglena is a large genus of unicellular protists , which have both plant and animal characteristics . all are motile by means of a flagellum ( animal characteristic ) . most have chloroplasts ( alga and plant characteristic ) . euglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis . over 1,000 species of `` euglena '' have been described , and there are more to be discovered . marin `` et al . '' ( 2003 ) revised the genus to include several species without chloroplasts , formerly classified as `` astasia '' and `` khawkinea '' . when acting as a heterotroph ( animal ) , the `` euglena '' surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by phagocytosis . when acting as an autotroph , the `` euglena '' uses chloroplasts to produce sugars by photosynthesis . the number and shape of chloroplasts within `` euglena '' varies greatly . `` euglena '' are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large flagellum for locomotion . to detect light , the cell has an eyespot , a primitive organelle that filters sunlight into light-detecting , photo-sensitive structures at the base of the flagellum ; allowing only certain wavelengths of light to hit it .
