Populus     populus is a genus of trees common in the northern hemisphere . they are commonly called poplars . the genus has 25–35 species in three sub-groups , commonly called poplars , aspens , and cottonwoods . in the september 2006 issue of `` science '' , it was announced that the western balsam poplar ( `` p. trichocarpa '' ) was the first tree to have its full dna code sequenced . the flowers are mostly dioecious ( rarely monoecious ) and appear in early spring before the leaves . they are borne in long , drooping catkins . the male flowers have a group of 4–60 stamens on a disk . the female flower is a single-celled ovary in a cup-shaped disk . pollination is by wind . the fruit is a two to four-valved capsule , green to reddish-brown , mature in mid summer . it contains tiny light brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long , soft , white hairs which help wind dispersal . poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees . the aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees . poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of lepidoptera species . `` pleurotus populinus '' , the aspen oyster mushroom , is found exclusively on dead wood of `` populus '' trees in north america .
