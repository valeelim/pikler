Environmental chemistry     environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places . environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources , reactions , transport , effects , and fates of chemical species in the air , soil , and water environments ; and the effect of human activity on these . environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric , aquatic and soil chemistry , as well as uses analytical chemistry . it is related to environmental and other areas of science . it is different from green chemistry , which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source . environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works . it identifies the chemicals that are present naturally . it studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals . then , it accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals . environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment . important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations , solutions , units , sampling , and analytical techniques . chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones .
