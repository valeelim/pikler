CNDO/2     cndo is the short cut for complete neglect of differential overlap . it is both 1 ) a method for learning key facts about molecular orbitals as well as 2 ) the name of a particular set of computer programs . cndo is based on quantum chemistry . it is one of the first semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods . it uses two approximations : - core approximation - only the outer valence electrons are explicitly included . - zero-differential overlap cndo builds a mathematical model of a molecule . cndo starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them . quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals . from this information , cndo computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals . cndo/2 is the main version of cndo . john pople and coworkers first wrote cndo/2 . other websites . - cndo/2 calculation ( pirika ) - molecular modeling for educators - density functional modelling of point defects in semiconductors
