Placodont     placodonts were a group of triassic marine reptiles which had heavy flat teeth . these teeth were used for crushing shellfish . placodonts are in the order sauropterygia , the group that includes plesiosaurs . placodonts were mostly between in length , up to a maximum long . they are found in marine sediments of the middle and upper triassic , 235â€“250 million years ago . the first specimen was discovered in 1830 , and they have since been discovered throughout central europe , north africa , the middle east and china . the earliest forms like `` placodus '' , which lived in the early to middle triassic , looked rather barrel-shaped . later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while feeding . by the upper triassic , these plates had grown so much that placodonts of the time such as `` henodus '' and `` placochelys '' looked like the sea turtles of modern day more than their ancestors . other placodonts like `` psephoderma '' developed plates as well , but in a different articulated manner that resembled the shells of horseshoe crabs and trilobites more than those of sea turtles . all these adaptations are examples of convergent evolution , as placodonts were not related to any of these animals .
