Johann Friedrich Blumenbach     johann friedrich blumenbach ( 11 may 1752 – 22 january 1840 ) was a german physician , naturalist , physiologist and anthropologist . he was one of the first to explore the study of mankind as an aspect of natural history . he used comparative anatomy to classify human races , of which he listed five . blumenbach divided the human species into five races in 1779. later he based them on the anatomy of the human skull . blumenbach 's work included the description of sixty skulls published as `` decas craniorum '' ( göttingen 1790–1828 ) . this was a founding work for other scientists . he called the five races ( 1793/1795 ) : - the caucasian race or white race - the mongolian or yellow race ( = chinese ) - the malayan or brown race - the ethiopian , or black race - the american or red race . he did not think other races were inferior to the caucasian race , and were potentially good members of society . anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual africans differ as much , or even more , from other individual africans as europeans differ from europeans ' . furthermore he thought that africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding , excellent natural talents and mental capacities ' .
