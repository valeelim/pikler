Discrete mathematics     discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous . in contrast to real numbers that vary `` smoothly '' , discrete mathematics studies objects such as integers , graphs , and statements in logic . these objects do not vary smoothly , but have distinct , separated values . discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in `` continuous mathematics '' such as calculus and analysis . discrete objects can often be counted using integers . mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets ( sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers , including rational numbers but not real numbers ) . however , there is no exact , universally agreed , definition of the term `` discrete mathematics . '' many times , discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded : continuously varying quantities and related notions . the set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite . the term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets , particularly those areas relevant to business .
