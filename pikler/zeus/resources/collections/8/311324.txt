Howard Stern     howard stern ( born january 12 , 1954 ) is an american radio and television personality known for shocking his audiences . stern was born in jackson heights , queens , new york city . he originally started as a disc jockey for a new york station playing rock music . he discovered a talent for comedy , and developed a wide-ranging confrontational style that encouraged listeners to call in . eventually , in the 1990s , his show was widely distributed . as an example , in one of his most infamous episodes , he persuaded a female caller to have phone sex with him on the air . he made deep buzzing noises into his microphone , and had her sit on a speaker with the volume turned up . stern 's crude style of entertainment ( which many listeners support ) has earned him the title `` king of all media '' -- at least in the eyes of his fans . his show is frequently the subject of complaints by various listeners ( and occasionally ethnic groups ) who find his shows offensive . radio stations airing his show have occasionally been subjected to fines for violating fcc requirements due to the content of the show , but the parent conglomerate ( infinity broadcasting ) that hosts stern 's show seems to consider these fines a necessary price to pay , in order to support stern 's continuing popularity . in 1994 stern ran for governor of the state of new york .
