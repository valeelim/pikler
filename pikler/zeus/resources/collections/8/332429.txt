Lake Amadeus     lake amadeus ( ) is a huge salt lake in the southwest corner of the northern territory , in australia . it is about north of uluá¹Ÿu . the lake is 180 km long and 10 km wide . it is the largest salt lake in the northern territory . because of the dryness of the area , the lake is usually a dry salt crust . when it rains enough , water flows through it towards the east . it eventually connects to the finke river . lake amadeus holds up to 600 million tonnes of salt . the groundwater soaks into the ground , and the lake supports several reliable springs . the first european to find the lake was the explorer ernest giles in 1872. he had seen kata tjuta from far away and was making his way there . the lake blocked his path . he could not go over it because the dry lake bed was not able to hold the weight of his horses . he described the lake as `` an infernal lake of mud and brine '' . giles was going to name it `` lake ferdinand '' after baron ferdinand von mueller . but mueller asked giles to instead name it after king amadeus i of spain . amadeus had honoured mueller a few years before .
