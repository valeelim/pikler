Graphene     graphene is one of the forms of carbon . like diamonds and graphite , the forms ( or 'allotropes ' ) of carbon have different crystal structures , and this gives them different properties . graphene is the basic 2d ( two dimensional ) form of a number of 3d allotropes , such as graphite , charcoal , fullerene and carbon nanotubes . the term `` graphene '' was coined as a combination of graphite and the suffix '-ene ' by hanns-peter boehm , who described single-layer carbon foils in 1962. graphene is like a honeycomb or 'chicken wire ' structure , made of carbon atoms and their bonds . graphite is many graphene sheets stacked together . three million graphene sheets stacked to form graphite would be only one millimetre thick . the nobel prize in physics for 2010 was awarded to sir andre geim and sir konstantin novoselov `` for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene '' . an international team from the university of manchester made a membrane of graphene oxide . they showed it blocked many gases and liquids but let water through . sir andre geim said : `` helium gas is hard to stop . it slowly leaks even through a millimetre-thick window glass but our ultra-thin films completely block it . at the same time , water evaporates through them unimpeded . materials can not behave any stranger '' .
