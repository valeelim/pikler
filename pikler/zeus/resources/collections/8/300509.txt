Bayeux Tapestry     the bayeux tapestry is a long embroidered cloth – not an actual tapestry – which depicts the events leading up to the norman conquest of england as well as the events of the invasion itself . the tapestry is annotated in latin . it is exhibited in a special museum in bayeux , normandy called `` musée de la tapisserie de bayeux '' . the tapestry tells the story of the norman conquest of england . the two combatants are the anglo-saxon english , led by harold godwinson , recently crowned as king of england , and the normans , led by william the conqueror . the tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of anglo-saxon art , because , though ordered by a norman , it was made by english ( anglo-saxon ) artisans . it is also extremely important as a historical document . in common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period , this piece is conventionally referred to as a `` tapestry '' , although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth ; it is in fact an embroidery .
