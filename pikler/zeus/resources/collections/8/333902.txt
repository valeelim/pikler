Orc     an orc is a mythical creature . in the 20th century , j. r. r. tolkien gave orcs their traits : they are servitors of evil and small creatures . the word can probably be traced to orcus . this is a different name for pluto or hades . pliny the elder writes about orcs in his `` naturalis historia '' . they are long-toothed sea monsters . ludovico ariosto ( 1474-1533 ) wrote an epic `` orlando furioso '' : there , the virgin angelica is captured by a sea monster called orc . the hero , rogero , is able to free her as he rode a hippogriff . the latin name of the killer whale , `` orcinus orca '' is likely to come from that story . there is another creature called `` orc '' in `` orlando furioso '' : a blind man-eating giant who abducts king norandin of damascus and his lover lucina . this orc can not be vanquished ; only fooled by trickery . there is another orc that lives in the alps . it is a demon living on mountain tops . it sometimes is described as protector of the forest . at other times it is said to be an evil spirit who brings doom to cattle and wild beasts .
