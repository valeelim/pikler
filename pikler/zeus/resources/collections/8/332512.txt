Aboriginal land rights in Australia     aboriginal land rights in australia are the special set of rights given to indigenous australians to own land . there are many different types of land rights laws . they all allow the government to grant land to indigenous ( native ) australians under many different conditions ( terms ) . land rights schemes are in place in the northern territory , queensland , new south wales , south australia , and victoria . under these laws , the title to the land is normally given to a community or ethnic group , not an individual . usually , land that has been granted in a land rights claim can not be sold , traded , or mortgaged . grants will be normally require that the land be passed down to future generations through inheritance . the passing of aboriginal land rights laws in australia was caused by many important aboriginal protests . it was not until the 1970s , though , that there came an `` organised '' movement for the recognition of aboriginal land rights . on 1 may 1946 , more than 800 aboriginal stockmen in the pilbara region of western australia went on strike . they demanded wages for their work . they were joined by other aboriginal workers from the towns of port hedland and marble bar . the strike ended in 1949 .
