URL shortening     url shortening is a technique on the world wide web in which a uniform resource locator ( url ) may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page . this is achieved by using an http redirect on a domain name that is short , which links to the web page that has a long url . for example , the url http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/url_shortening can be shortened to http : //wrapr.co/gvr7j , http : //evg.in/az41 or http : //evg.in/urlwiki . this is especially convenient for messaging technologies such as twitter and identi.ca , which severely limit the number of characters that may be used in a message . short urls allow otherwise long web addresses to be referred to in a tweet . in november 2009 , the shortened links on one url shortening service were accessed 2.1 billion times . browser extensions - add-ons for google chrome https : //chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hec-url-shortener/bfcbeeddfchjfdgcgfnlmcdagbeoomho - add-ons for mozilla firefox https : //addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/lanbin/
