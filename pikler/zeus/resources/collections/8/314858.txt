Drake equation     in 1961 , frank drake wrote down an equation for the chance of a contactable alien civilization from another planet in the milky way galaxy . this is known as the drake equation ( sometimes called the green bank equation or the green bank formula ) . carl sagan mentioned the drake equation often so it that has been mistaken for the 'sagan equation ' . the drake equation states that : where : and we do n't know the solution to the equation . although written as an equation , drake 's formulation is not particularly useful for getting a value of formula_2 . the last four parameters , formula_3 and formula_4 are not known . they are very hard to guess , with values ranging over many orders of magnitude . therefore , the seti league says the importance of the drake equation is not in solving it , but in thinking about it . it may be more useful to think of it as a series of questions framed as a numbers game . other pages . - fermi paradox
