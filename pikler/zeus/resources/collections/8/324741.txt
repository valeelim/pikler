Sociobiology     sociobiology is a field of scientific study which is based on the assumption that social behaviour has resulted from evolution . it attempts to explain and examine social behaviour in that way . a branch of ethology and sociology , sociobiology draws from anthropology , evolution , zoology , archaeology , population genetics , and other disciplines . as a study of human societies , sociobiology is allied to darwinian anthropology , ethology and evolutionary psychology . ethology investigates collective animal behaviour , such as mating patterns , territorial fights , pack hunting , and the hive society of social insects . it argues that selection pressure led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behaviour . in other words , a typical behaviour pattern is inherited because it has raised the inclusive fitness of individuals as compared to other behaviours . this is mainstream biology . its extension into human social behaviour is for ethologists absolutely normal , but for others it may be controversial .
