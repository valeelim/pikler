Dust devil     dust devils are twirling masses of air that form in the desert and send sand spinning . the height of a dust devil can range from a few meters tall to more than 1000 meters tall . they are usually harmless , but occasionally they can cause some damage to both people and property . a dust devil forms when hot air near the ground rises quickly through small pocket of cooler , low-pressure air above it . if conditions are just right , the air may begin to rotate . as the air rapidly rises , the hot air is stretched vertically and because of angular momentum , the spinning gets much more intense . as the hot air cools when it rises , it eventually goes down to the base and expands horizontally , while more hot air shoots up the column to replace the lost air . the air that is displaced falls to the ground around the dust devil , creating a balancing force . thus , a dust devil is formed . certain conditions help the formation of dust devils : 1. flat barren , desert terrain : flat terrain and hot conditions help the hot air `` fuel '' being always available . the dust and sand helps the dust devil be seen .
