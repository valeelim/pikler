Plant cell     like all organisms , plants have cells . plant cells have a nucleus with chromosomes and dna , and they have mitochondria . those are common to all eukaryote cells . but in some ways they are different from animal cells and the cells of other eukaryotes . diagrams of cell insides : - they have cell walls composed of cellulose and some other compounds . pectin , and sometimes lignin , is secreted on the outside of the cell membrane . this is different from the cell walls of fungi ( which are made of chitin ) , and of bacteria ( which are made of peptidoglycan ) . the cell wall gives the cell a definite shape . - there are special cell-to-cell communication pathways known as plasmodesmata . these are pores in the cell wall through which the cell content of adjacent cells ( including endoplasmic reticulum ) are continuous . - they have plastids . the most notable are the chloroplasts , which contain chlorophyll . this green-colored pigment absorbs sunlight , and allows the plant to make its own food by photosynthesis . other types of plastids are the amyloplasts , whch store starch , elaioplasts for fat storage , and chromoplasts for making and storing pigments . like mitochondria , plastids have their own genomes of about 100â€“120 unique genes . it is thought they started as prokaryotic endosymbionts living in the cells of an early eukaryotic ancestor of the land plants and algae .
