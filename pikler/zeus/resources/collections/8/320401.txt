Henry (unit)    henry ( unit ) in physics , and electronics , the henry ( symbol h ) is the si unit of inductance . it is named after joseph henry ( 1797–1878 ) , the american scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction . ( in england , michael faraday ( 1791–1867 ) discovered the same thing independently . they invented it about the same time . ) the magnetic permeability of a complete vacuum is 4π×10 h/m ( henry per meter ) . the national institute of standards and technology provides guidance for american users of si to write the plural as henries . people do not capitalize unit names . if the rate of change of current in a circuit is one ampere per second and the resulting electromotive force is one volt , then the inductance of the circuit is one henry . other equivalent combinations of si units are as follows : where a = ampere < br > c = coulomb < br > f = farad < br > j = joule < br > kg = kilogram < br > m = meter < br > s = second < br > wb = weber < br > t = tesla < br > v = volt < br > ω = ohm . other pages . - impedance - inductor - weber ( unit )
