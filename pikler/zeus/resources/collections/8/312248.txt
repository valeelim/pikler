Moulting     moulting ( or molting ) is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off part of its body ( usually the outer layer or covering ) at particular times of year , or at specific points in its life cycle . moulting is also known as sloughing , shedding , or for some species , ecdysis . moulting can involve the epidermis ( skin ) , and hair , fur , wool , or other external layer . in some species , other body parts may be shed , for example , wings in some insects . examples include old feathers in birds , old hairs in mammals ( especially dogs and other canidae ) , old skin in reptiles , and the entire exoskeleton in arthropods . in arthropods , such as insects , arachnids and crustaceans , moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton ( or shell ) . this process of moulting is called ecdysis . it is the defining feature of a whole group of invertebrates , the clade ecdysozoa . this group includes the arthropods , nematodes , velvet worms , horsehair worms , rotifers , tardigrades and cephalorhyncha . since the cuticles of these animals often forms an inelastic exoskeleton , it is shed during growth and a new , larger covering is formed . amongst fossils , trilobites and eurypterida used ecdysis .
