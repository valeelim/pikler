Nanboku-chō period     the , also known as nambokuchō or the period of northern and southern courts , started in 1333 or 1336 and ended 1392. during 60+ years of the 14th century , kyoto was the seat of an pretender imperial group known as the northern court . the series of pretender emperors in kyoto were supported by the ashikaga shogunate , but some disputed whether they were true monarchs . during these years , a southern court was established in the yoshino district of what is today nara prefecture . the series of emperors in yoshino were rejected by the ashikaga shoguns and their supporters . forces loyal to the two rival courts fought for more than six decades . this period of rivalry is sometimes identified as the early part of the muromachi period of the history of japan . in 1392 , the southern court stopped fighting ; and the northern court seemed to have won the long struggle . however , the claims of the kyoto pretenders were undermined by scholars and historians . the so-called `` emperors '' in kyoto did not have of the essential imperial regalia until after 1392. the succession ( `` senso '' ) was not passed to them from emperor go-daigo . the pretenders were not confirmed with valid ceremonies ( `` sokui '' ) .
