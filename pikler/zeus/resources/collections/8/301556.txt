Zoonosis     zoonosis or a zoonotic disease is an infectious disease which an animal can give to a human . these diseases may be caused by bacteria , viruses , fungi , or parasites . zoonotic diseases are very common . about 60 % of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals . zoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways . they may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human - for example , through bites and infected saliva ( like with rabies ) , or through the air . this is called `` direct zoonosis '' . zoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector . this is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected . diseases like this are called `` vector-borne diseases '' . sometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal . for example , rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans . instead , fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick . then , if the flea bites a human , they can pass the bacteria on to the human , and the human can get the plague . the rat is the host of the disease , and the flea is the vector .
