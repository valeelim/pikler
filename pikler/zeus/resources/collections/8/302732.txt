Robert Woodward     robert burns woodward ( april 10 , 1917 – july 8 , 1979 ) was an american organic chemist . he made many important discoveries in modern organic chemistry . he worked on the synthesis and structure of complex natural products . he worked closely with roald hoffmann on the theory of chemical reactions . woodward won the nobel prize in chemistry for 1965. woodward was born in boston , massachusetts . when he was one year old , his father died in the influenza pandemic of 1918. he was interested in chemistry at an early age . by the time he entered high school , he had already done most of the experiments in ludwig gattermann 's textbook of experimental organic chemistry . in 1928 , woodward asked the consul-general of the german consulate in boston , to send him copies of a few original papers published in german journals . he was fascinated to read otto diels and kurt alder 's original communication about the diels–alder reaction . in 1933 , he entered the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) , but did not do well enough to continue . mit readmitted him in 1935 , and by 1936 he had received the bachelor of science degree . only one year later , mit awarded him the doctorate . this was very unusual at the time , because most mit students earned only a bachelor of science degree after four years . woodward 's studies were about the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone , a natural type of estrogen . he held a junior fellowship at harvard university from 1937 to 1938 , and stayed at harvard for the rest of his life . in the 1960s , woodward was named donner professor of science , a post which allowed him to spend all his time on research .
