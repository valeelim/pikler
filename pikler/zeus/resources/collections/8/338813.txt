Romantic poetry     romantic poetry was one branch of the romantic movement . the first generation of romantic poets ( 1798 ) were primarily coleridge , william blake and wordsworth . the second generation was at its culmination in the 1820s , with poets such as shelley , byron and keats . the movement showed an interest in the gothic , medieval art , and nature . the ballad form was re-introduced , and the poems often took their form from fairy tales and folk songs . poets were enjoying writing for themselves rather than senior nobility , and later they were the source of inspiration for the pre-raphaelite painters .
