Macaque     the macaques are a genus ( `` macaca '' ) of old world monkeys of the subfamily cercopithecinae . the 22 species of macaques live in sub-saharan africa , and more widely in asia . one species is the well-known gibraltar 'ape ' . macaques are of some interest to human researchers for their social structures , and their usefulness in animal testing , particularly regarding eyesight . macaques have a very intricate social structure and hierarchy . if a macaque of a lower level in the social chain has eaten berries and none are left for a higher-level macaque , then the one higher in status can , within this social organization , remove the berries from the other monkey 's mouth . in 2014 selfies taken by a crested black macaque seemed to establish a legal precedent , after the wikimedia foundation rejected a copyright claim . the photos had been sold widely by david slater , a professional nature photographer , whose camera was temporarily carried away by a group of macaques . after the photos were uploaded to wikipedia , the organisation refused to delete them , claiming `` this file is in the public domain , because as the work of a non-human animal , it has no human author in whom copyright is vested .
