Okroshka     okróshka is a cold soup from russia . it is also found in ukraine and belarus . the name is probably from `` kroshit ' '' ( крошить ) , which means to crumble into small pieces . the classic soup is a mix of mostly raw vegetables ( like cucumbers and spring onions ) , boiled potatoes , eggs , and a cooked meat such as beef , veal , sausages , or ham with kvass . kvass is a mildly alcoholic beverage made from fermented black or rye bread . okroshka is usually served with sour cream . later versions use light or diluted kefir , vinegar , mineral water , or even beer instead of kvass . the ingredients are diced and then mixed with kvass just before eating . the ratio of chopped food to kvass is similar to that of cereal to milk . this lets the vegetables to keep their texture . even though the ingredients are similar to those in a russian salad , the taste of okroshka is quite different . okroshka is mostly served in summer . this is because the soup adds the taste of kvass and the lightness of a salad . salt and sugar can be added according to taste .
