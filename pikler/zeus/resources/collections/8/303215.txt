Pi bond     in chemistry , pi bonds ( π bonds ) are covalent chemical bonds where the orbital path of one electron crosses ( overlaps ) with the path of another . the electrons have a lobe shaped figure of eight path ( see picture ) . there are two areas of overlap as the paths overlap on both lobes . only one of the orbital 's nodal planes passes through both of the involved nuclei . the greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals . the orbital symmetry of the pi bond looks the same as the p orbital when seen down the bond axis . p orbitals usually have this sort of bonding . d orbitals are also assumed to use pi bonding but this is not necessarily what happens in reality . the idea of bonding d orbitals fits in with the theory of hypervalence . pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds . quantum mechanics says this is because the orbital paths are parallel so there is much less overlap between the p-orbitals . pi bonds happen when two atomic orbitals are in contact through two areas of overlap . pi-bonds are more spread out bonds than the sigma bonds . electrons in pi bonds are sometimes called pi electrons . molecular fragments joined by a pi bond can not rotate about that bond without breaking the pi bond . the rotation destroys the parallel paths of the two p orbitals .
