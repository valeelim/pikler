Ampère's circuital law    ampère 's circuital law ampère 's circuital law , discovered by andré-marie ampère in 1826 , relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop . it is now one of maxwell 's equations , which form the basis of classical electromagnetism . the law relates magnetic fields to electric currents that produce them . a scientist can use ampere 's law to determine the magnetic field associated with a given current or current associated with a given magnetic field , if there is no time changing electric field present . in its original form , ampère 's circuital law relates the magnetic field to its electric current source . the law can be written in two forms , the `` integral form '' and the `` differential form '' . the forms are equivalent , and related by the kelvin–stokes theorem . it can also be written in terms of either the b or h magnetic fields . again , the two forms are equivalent ( see the `` proof '' section below ) . ampère 's circuital law is now known to be a correct law of physics in a magnetostatic situation : the system is static except possibly for continuous steady currents within closed loops . in all other cases the law is incorrect unless maxwell 's correction is included ( see below ) .
