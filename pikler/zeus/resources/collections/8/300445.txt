Capacitance Electronic Disc     the capacitance electronic disc ( also known as a ced ) was a type of video disc . it was made in 1964 by the company rca . the ced is similar to a record because it stores the video and sound as small groves on a black disk . because of this , the ced is an analog disc format instead of a digital format like a cd . the ced is stored inside a plastic case so you can not touch the disk as it is very easy to damage . on the plastic case is a label that has the name of the movie on the disc as well as other information such as a summary of the movie . the first ced was made in 1964 but were not available for purchase until 1981. about 200 movies were made available on ced . each movie that was on ced was about $ 15 to $ 35 depending on the length of the movie . the ced did not sell well , this is because you could not record on the disc like you could with a video tape . the production of the ced stopped in 1986. ceds are conductive vinyl platters that are 30.0 cm ( 11.8 in ) in diameter . to avoid using the metric system to name their discs , they were called `` 12 inch discs '' even though they were actually slightly smaller . each side of the disc has grooves that are about 19 miles long and are 37 times smaller than the grooves on a regular phonograpg record . when the disc is playing , it spins at about 450 times per minute and each rotation of the disc contained several frames of audio and visual information .
