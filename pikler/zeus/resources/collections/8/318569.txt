Heterojunction bipolar transistor     the heterojunction bipolar transistor ( hbt ) is a type of bipolar junction transistor ( bjt ) which uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions , making a heterojunction . the hbt can handle signals of much higher frequencies , ( up to several hundred ghz ) than bjt . hbt is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits , mostly radio-frequency ( rf ) systems , and in applications requiring a high power efficiency , such as rf power amplifiers in mobile phones . the idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional bjt , dating back to a patent from 1951. the principal difference between the bjt and hbt is in the use of different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions , making a heterojunction . this limits the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region , since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band . unlike bjt technology , this allows a high doping density to be used in the base . the high doping density reduces the base resistance while maintaining gain . the efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the kroemer factor .
