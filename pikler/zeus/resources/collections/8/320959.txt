Rhythmite     a rhythmite is layers of sediment or sedimentary rock laid down in a repeated pattern . this pattern may be varves , which are an annual pattern , or shorter or longer-term rhymites . tides in some places have left rhythmites . rhythmites can show long-term prehistoric events , such as periodic floods , sea level changes , glaciation changes , earth 's orbital variations , and other periodic climate changes . many rock formations show repeating patterns of strata . for example , clay layers may alternate with sandstone layers ; or carbonate layers alternate with shales . this is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate . in warmer times the sea rises , and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow subtropical seas . later , ice builds up at the poles and the sea level drops . then the same area is close to shore , and gets sand and mud washed down by rivers . deposits on land show patterns for similar reasons . a low-lying area will be a lake or a swamp during hot , wet periods , and maybe a desert or a mudflat during dry periods . erosion takes place during the dry periods , and deposition takes place during the wet periods .
