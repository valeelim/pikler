François Pierre La Varenne     françois pierre de la varenne ( burgundy , 1615 – dijon 1678 ) was the author of `` le cuisinier françois '' ( 1651 ) , the founding text of modern french cuisine . la varenne , in the 17th century , broke with the italian traditions that had revolutionized mediaeval french cookery in the 16th century . la varenne wrote for professional chefs , and codified french cuisine for the age of louis xiv . the seventeenth century saw french cooking come into the modern era . the heavily spiced flavours of the middle ages were abandoned in favour of the natural flavours of french foods . exotic spices ( saffron , cinnamon , cumin , ginger , nutmeg , cardamom , nigella , seeds of paradise ) were , with the exception of pepper , replaced by local herbs ( parsley , thyme , bayleaf , chervil , sage , tarragon ) . new vegetables like cauliflower , asparagus , peas , cucumber and artichoke were introduced . special care was given to the cooking of meat in order to conserve maximum flavour . vegetables had to be fresh and tender . fish , with the improvement of transportation , had to be impeccably fresh . preparation had to respect the taste and visual look of the ingredients instead of masking them as had been done before .
