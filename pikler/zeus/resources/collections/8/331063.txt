Fusion power     nuclear fusion is when two atoms merge to form a new one . this reaction generates energy . the idea behind a fusion reactor is to build a nuclear power plant that uses this process to produce electricity . nowadays , nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to produce energy . nuclear fission is not the same as nuclear fusion . nuclear fusion is the same type of process the sun uses to generate heat . the most powerful nuclear weapons also use fusion . as of 2012 , there are no commercial power plants that use this technology ; there are a few academic ones ; these include the joint european torus , in england . this reactor uses a principle called tokamak . a tokamak uses magnets that are shaped like a doughnut to squish the atoms .
