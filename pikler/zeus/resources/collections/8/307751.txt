Demersal     demersal animals live on or near the bottom of the sea or lakes . the term is usually applied to fish . they occupy the sea floors and lake beds , which usually consist of mud , sand , gravel or rocks . in coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf , and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise . they are not generally found in the deepest waters , such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain , but they can be found around seamounts and islands . the word `` demersal '' comes from the latin `` demergere '' , which means `` to sink '' . demersal fish are bottom feeders . they can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column . demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil ( one to four percent ) , whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent .
