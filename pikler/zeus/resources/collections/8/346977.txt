Fang     a fang is a sharp tooth used for catching prey found on many animals , such as wolves and spiders . spiders , tarantulas , and venomous snakes have hollow fangs . venom glands fill these hollow fangs with venom so that when these animals catch their prey with their fangs , they paralyze the prey to make it easier to eat . the fangs on a snake can be folded under the skin like a cat 's claws . spider and tarantula fangs are found outside of their mouth instead of inside it .
