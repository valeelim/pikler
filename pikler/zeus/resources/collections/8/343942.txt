Special forces     special forces , or special operations forces are military units used to trained to perform unconventional ( not ordinary ) , difficult , often high-risk missions . they are highly-trained and are the most valuable units in the world . because of the hard training and the high risk , there are not many special forces units . those elite units are often used to operate deep behind enemy lines . in a war they are also used for unconventional warfare . because special forces are really rare , they mostly have to do unusual , difficult things like : - gathering intelligence - destroying targets ( for example bunkers , ports , missiles etc . ) - protecting and rescueing important people - reconnaissance - unconventional warfare special forces were very important in the history of warfare where war is more defined as `` hit and run '' and sabotage , and not traditional army combat where quantity was more important than quality . the chinese strategist `` jiang ziya '' said about 1,000 b.c . ago that such elite units had many advantages , recruiting talented and motivated men to be serving in specialised units should be more important than other things .
