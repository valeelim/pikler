Rectifier     a rectifier is a device that can convert alternating current ( ac ) to direct current ( dc ) . this is a process called rectification . many rectifiers in the 20th century were made of metals like copper , iron , and silver . nowadays most are semiconductors . `` half-wave rectifiers '' only have one side of a waveform , while the `` full-wave rectifiers '' use both sides of a waveform . the left-hand side of the full-wave rectifier circuit consists of four diodes : a diode bridge . half-wave current is a current that can only flow in alternate current , a full-wave current can flow both alternating current and direct current . diode bridge is electrical circuit that consists of four diodes . it acts as a full wave rectifier to convert alternating current to direct current .
