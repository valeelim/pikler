Organic synthesis     organic synthesis is a special part of chemical synthesis . it builds organic compounds using organic reactions . organic molecules can have a higher level of complexity compared to inorganic compounds . so , the synthesis of organic compounds has developed into one of the most important parts of organic chemistry . there are two main areas of research fields within the general area of organic synthesis : `` total synthesis '' and `` methodology '' . a total synthesis is the complete chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simple , commercially available ( petrochemical ) or natural precursors . in a `` linear '' synthesis—often used for simple structures—several steps are performed one after another until the molecule is complete . the chemical compounds made in each step are usually called `` synthetic intermediates '' . for more complex molecules , a different approach may be preferable : convergent synthesis involves the individual preparation of several `` pieces '' ( key intermediates ) , which are then combined to form the goal product .
