Oviraptorosaur     oviraptorosaurs are a group of feathered maniraptoran dinosaurs from the cretaceous period of what are now asia and north america . they have short , beaked , parrot-like skulls , with or without bony head crests . they ranged in size from `` caudipteryx '' , which was the size of a turkey , to the 8 meter long , 1.4 ton `` gigantoraptor '' . the most complete oviraptorosaur specimens have been found in asia . the north american oviraptorosaur record is sparse . the group ( and all maniraptoran dinosaurs ) is close to the ancestry of birds . oviraptorosaurs might be primitive flightless birds . on the other hand , they might just be close relatives of the birds . the earliest and most basal ( `` primitive '' ) known oviraptorosaurs are `` protarchaeopteryx robusta '' and `` incisivosaurus gauthieri '' , both from the lower yixian formation of china , dating to about 125 million years ago in the lower cretaceous . some fragmentary species , such as `` calamospondylus oweni '' and `` thecocoelurus daviesi '' , may have been even earlier members of the oviraptorosauria . a tiny neck vertebra from england shares some features in common with oviraptorosaurs . it may represent an earlier occurrence of this group , at about 140 million years ago .
