Grignard reaction     the grignard reaction ( pronounced ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides ( grignard reagents ) attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds ( for example , in a carbonyl group as in the example shown below ) . grignard reagents act as nucleophiles . the grignard reaction produces a carbon–carbon bond . it alters hybridization about the reaction center . the grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds . it also can form carbon–phosphorus , carbon–tin , carbon–silicon , carbon–boron and other carbon–heteroatom bonds . it is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction . the high pk value of the alkyl component ( pk = ~45 ) makes the reaction irreversible . grignard reactions are not ionic . the grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster ( in ether ) . the disadvantage of grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents ( such as water ) , or with functional groups with acidic protons , such as alcohols and amines . atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide . one of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame-dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture , which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning . chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present . this can allow grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present .
