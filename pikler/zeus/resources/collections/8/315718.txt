Oppidum     oppidum ( plural oppida ) is a latin word for the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient rome . the word comes from `` ob-pedum '' , an `` enclosed space . '' this may in turn have come from the proto-indo-european word , `` *ped√≥m- '' , meaning an `` occupied space '' or `` footprint . '' julius caesar called the larger celtic iron age settlements he found in gaul `` oppida '' . the word is now used to describe the large pre-roman towns that existed across western and central europe . many oppida grew from hill forts , but not all of them had an important defensive role . the main features of the oppida are : - the planned building of the walls and gates - the spacious layout - a view of the surrounding area . the development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of europe . they were the first large settlements north of the mediterranean that could be described as towns . caesar pointed out that each tribe of gaul would have several oppida , but that they were not all of equal importance . this suggests that there was some form of hierarchy .
