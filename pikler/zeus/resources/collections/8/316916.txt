Multiple sclerosis     multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time . in this disease , the body ’ s natural guard against illness ( the immune system ) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the axons of cells called neurons in the central nervous system . the disease makes people ’ s bodies , eyesight , speech , and minds work poorly . people with ms do not normally live as long as healthy people . in healthy people , myelin sheaths help neurons work . electric signals in neurons move quickly through long , narrow axons like electricity in a wire . the myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end . a person with ms has myelin that is too thin or completely gone . without the protective covering , the signals between neurons do not travel well . because of this , the mind and body can not work like they normally do . scientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of ms , but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for ms :
