Plutonism     plutonism ( or vulcanism ) is the theory that the rocks forming the earth were formed in fire by volcanic activity . it was named after pluto , the classical ruler of the underworld , or alternatively after vulcan , the ancient roman god of fire and volcanoes . the theory was first proposed by abb√© anton moro who had studied volcanic islands . it was subsequently developed by james hutton as part of his `` theory of the earth '' published in 1788. the plutonists strongly disputed the neptunist view that rocks had been formed by processes that no longer operated , instead supporting hutton 's uniformitarianism .
