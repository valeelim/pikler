Little penguin     little penguins ( `` eudyptula minor '' ) are also called fairy penguin , little blue penguin , or blue penguins . they are a species of penguin that lives near the coasts of australia and new zealand . the little penguin is the smallest of all penguins . the penguins weigh around 0.9 kg ( 2 lbs ) and are up to 40 cm ( 15 in ) tall . on average , they are 33 cm ( 13 in ) tall . the little penguin is slate gray or indigo along the head and back , with a white belly and neck . the flippers - wings - are dark blue , with a white edge along the back . males and females of the species are very similar but males have a curve on the end of their beak . juvenile little penguins , which are younger than adults , have lighter colors . little penguin chicks have blue-grey bellies and brown feathers . originally , the eudyptula genus includeded two different species of penguin , the little penguin ( `` e. minor '' ) and the fairy penguin ( `` e. undina '' ) . in 1976 , scientists combined these two species into one species ( `` e. minor '' ) with six subspecies . however , new research on the penguins ' mitochondrial dna shows that the dna of populations in the australia and southern new zealand region are very different from those of little penguins in northern new zealand . because of those discoveries , some researchers still argue about whether these two populations should be divided into two different species . another common argument is over the classification of the white-flippered penguin . while most believe the white-flippered penguin is a subspecies of the little penguin , some argue that it is a different species . others argue that it is not a subspecies at all , but a morph that just has different colors .
