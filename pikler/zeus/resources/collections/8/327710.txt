AS-90     the as-90 ( artillery system for the 1990s ) is a lightly armoured self-propelled artillery gun . it is used by the british army . it was first used in 1993. the as-90 's official name is gun equipment 155 mm l131 . the as-90 is used by five regiments of the royal horse artillery and royal artillery . as-90 was designed and built by vickers shipbuilding and engineering ( vsel , owned by bae systems since 1999 ) . they made 179 as-90s from 1992 to 1995. this cost Â£300 million . in 2002 bae systems were asked to give 96 british army as-90s a 52 calibre gun . this would make the range 30 km . with special shells , it would be able to reach 60 to 80 km . however , this project ended up being ended . as-90 started in the mid-1980s . it was made on a `` gamble '' that the sp70 would fail . when this happened , the ministry of defence ( mod ) asked for a new vehiicle . four designs were handed in , and as-90 was the only one that the mod liked . the mod has tried to get the royal navy 's main ship gun to be able to use the barrel and breech from the as-90 . this would make the gun calibre of the british army and royal navy the same . this would help with ammunition logistics . this would also make it possible for the army and navy to help each other develop weapons .
