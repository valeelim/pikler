Pericyclic reaction     in organic chemistry , a pericyclic reaction is a type of chemical reaction between organic compounds . in the case of pericyclic reactions , the transition state of the molecule is a ring ( has a cyclic geometry ) , and the reaction goes forward in a concerted way . pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions . the most important groups of pericyclic reactions are : - electrocyclic reactions - cycloadditions - sigmatropic reactions - group transfer reactions - cheletropic reactions - dyotropic reactions in general , pericyclic reactions are equilibrium processes . however , it is possible to push the reaction in one direction if the product is at a significantly lower energy level . this is applying le chatelier 's principle to a reaction involving a single molecule . many pericyclic reactions have similar stepwise radical processes connected with them . chemists disagree whether some reactions are pericyclic reactions . for example , it is not definitively known whether the [ 2+2 ] cycloaddition mechanism is concerted ( or may depend on the reactive system ) . many pericyclic reactions have similar reactions that are metal-catalyzed . but these metal-catalyzed reactions are also not really pericyclic . the metal catalysts stabilize the reaction intermediates . so the reaction is not concerted , but rather metal-stabilized .
