Materials science     materials science studies the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems . it uses applied physics and chemistry . supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years . there are many inventions of new material . work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering . the important material of a given era is often its defining point . examples are the stone age , bronze age , and iron age . materials science originally studied ceramics and metallurgy . these ancient crafts make materials science one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science . a major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century , when the american scientist josiah willard gibbs showed that the physical properties of a material were related to its atomic structure . as the phases changed , so did the physical properties of the material . important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race : the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys , and silica and carbon materials , used in the construction of space exploration vehicles .
