Mitochondrial DNA     mitochondrial dna ( mtdna or mdna ) is the dna in mitochondria . it is inherited only from mothers , though there are a few rare exceptions . mitochondria are cellular organelles in eukaryotic cells . they convert chemical energy from food into a form that cells can use , adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) . mitochondrial dna is only a small part of the dna in a eukaryotic cell . most of the dna is in the cell nucleus on chromosomes . in plants , the chloroplasts have dna as well . in humans , mitochondrial dna codes for 37 genes and with about 16,600 base pairs in a circle . human mitochondrial dna was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced . the mtdna in plants is much larger : `` arabidopsis '' has 367 kilobytes .
