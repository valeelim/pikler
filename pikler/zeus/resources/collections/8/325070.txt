Apostatic selection     apostatic selection is frequency-dependent selection by predators . it applies when prey are two or more forms ( morphs ) which look quite different . this is a kind of polymorphic species , where the predator learns to select the more common form . then there is an advantage in looking different , and this advantage keeps the frequency above the mutation rate . the second form , or 'morph ' , becomes better known by predators as its number increases . so the population tends to have a kind of balance between the frequency of the two morphs . apostatic selection is similar to the idea of prey switching . apostatic selection is the term used when the different forms are genetic morphs . in comparison , 'prey switching ' is used when describing the predator 's choice between different species .
