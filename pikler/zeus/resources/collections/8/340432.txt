Refining     refining is the name for a number of processes that purify or concentrate a substance . the name is used for natural resources , food and technical products . the place where this is done , is often called a refinery . petroleum contains hydrocarbons . after distillation , it still contains chemical compounds with sulfur , oxygen and nitrogen as well as other unwanted compounds , such as alkalenes . processed petroleum is used for lubricants ; the substances mentione are unwanted in lubricants as they can speed up the aging process . for this reason , they are extracted using a process called hydrogenation . in hydrogenation , hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gases are produced . these gases require special handling , as they are very toxic . vegetable oils and fats are produced by chemical or mechanical extraction from plants . this produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances , such as pigments and smell , which influence the quality of the refined product . in essence , the factors influenced are taste , shelf life , smell and color , as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations . depending on the process , between four and eight percent of usable vegetable oil is lost . there are two basic procedures to refine vegetable oil , chemical refining , and physical refining .
