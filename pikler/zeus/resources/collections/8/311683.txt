'' will generate a response such as `` the weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54 degrees today '' . these commands can vary greatly and control almost every section of the phone . the commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with natural language . siri makes it is much easier and/or possible for people to use device functions while driving , exercising , or when they have their hands full . it also means people with trouble reading , seeing , or typing can access the phone more easily .
