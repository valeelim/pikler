Specific impulse     specific impulse ( often shortened to `` i '' ) is a way to describe how well a rocket performs . it is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs . it can be used to compare rockets of different sizes . it is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel . to do this , one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine . a high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well . if the specific impulse is lower , it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well . specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines . it is used much like `` miles per gallon '' or `` litres per 100 kilometres '' is used to compare cars . an engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better . this means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted . a rocket engine with a higher specific impulse does n't mean it 's 'more powerful ' . that is , it will not make the rocket accelerate harder . in fact , the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse , like ion engines , are the 'weakest ' of all types of engines . they accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel . in a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead , but when it burns down all its fuel , the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate . eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage .
