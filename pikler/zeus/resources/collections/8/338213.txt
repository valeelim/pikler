Lycopod     the lycopods ( lycopodiophyta or lycophyta ) are the oldest surviving vascular plant division . it is a vascular plant subdivision of the plant kingdom . its earliest fossils are from 428â€“410 million years ago . the lycopods include some of the most primitive ( basal ) living species . they reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations . members of lycopodiophyta have a protostele , and the sporophyte generation is dominant . lycopods differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls , leaves that have only a single vein rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants . there are around 1,200 living species of lycopodiophyta ; they are generally divided into three orders . there are also some extinct groups . there are different opinions as to how the whole group should be classified . living groups are : - lycopodiales : clubmosses - isoetales : quillworts - selaginellales : spikemosses
