−1 (number)    −1 ( number ) in mathematics , −1 is the additive inverse of 1. that is , if it is added to 1 , the result is 0. it is the negative integer greater than negative two ( −2 ) and less than 0. negative one has some similar properties as positive one . but some are different . negative one is related to euler 's identity . this is because the identity states formula_1 in computer science , −1 is a common initial value for integers . it is also used to show that a variable has no useful information . multiplying a number by −1 is the same as changing the sign on the number . this can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom at 1 is the multiplicative identity , that is , a number multiplied by 1 is the number itself . so , for x real , we have where we used the fact that 0 multiplied by any real number x equals 0 , shown by cancellation from the equation in other words , so ( −1 ) · '' x '' or − '' x '' is the arithmetic inverse of `` x '' . the square of −1 , i.e . −1 multiplied by −1 , equals 1. so , a square of negative real numbers is positive .
