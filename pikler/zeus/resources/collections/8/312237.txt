Piculet     the piculets are a subfamily of small woodpeckers which are mostly in tropical south america , with just three asian and one african species . like true woodpeckers , piculets have large heads , long tongues to get their insect prey and zygodactyl feet , with two toes pointing forward , and two backwards . however , they lack the stiff tail feathers that woodpeckers use when climbing trees . they are more likely to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk . they eat insects and grubs mainly from decaying wood . they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting , rather than making their own holes . the eggs are white , as with many hole nesters . there are 30 species in all . it is known that they split off from mainstream woodpeckers in the middle miocene about 15 million years ago ( mya ) . splits between the three genera happened about 7.9 mya . typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts .
