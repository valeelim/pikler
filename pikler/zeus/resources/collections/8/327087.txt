The Conqueror Worm     `` the conqueror worm '' is a poem by edgar allan poe . it is about human mortality and the fact that death can not be stopped . it was first published in `` graham 's magazine '' in 1843. it was incorporated into poe 's short story `` ligeia '' in 1845. in the revised story , the poem is composed by ligeia . she teaches it to the narrator during her death throes . weeping angels watch a play performed by `` mimes , in the form of god on high '' , and controlled by vast formless shapes looming behind the scenes . the mimes chase a `` phantom '' which they can never capture . finally , a monstrous `` crawling shape '' emerges , and eats the mimes . the final curtain comes down , `` a funeral pall , '' signaling an end to the `` tragedy , 'man ' '' whose only hero is `` the conqueror worm '' . though poe was referring to an ancient connection between worms and death , he may have been inspired by `` the proud ladye '' , a poem by spencer wallis cone which was reviewed in an 1840 issue of `` burton 's gentleman 's magazine '' . that poem contained the lines `` let him meet the conqueror worm / with his good sword by his side '' .
