New Red Sandstone     the new red sandstone is a sandstone rock in britain and elsewhere . it was laid down in desert conditions from the permian ( 280 million years ago ) to the beginning of the triassic ( 240 million years ago ) . it underlies the jurassic lias , which are marine rocks such as the blue lias . the term distinguishes it from the old red sandstone , which is largely devonian in age . the new red sandstone is much brighter and redder in colour than the old red sandstone , as the examples show . the colour is caused by iron oxides in the rock .
