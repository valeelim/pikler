Photodissociation     photodissociation , photolysis , or photodecomposition is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons . one or more photons interact with the target molecule . photodissociation is not limited to visible light . any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound . since a photon 's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength , electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher , such as ultraviolet light , x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions . one example where this is used is the light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis .
