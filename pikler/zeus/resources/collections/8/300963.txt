Globular cluster     a globular cluster is a group of stars of a similar age which often orbits the central bulge of a galaxy . gravity holds clusters together and gives them their spherical shape . towards the centre of a clusters there are many stars in a relatively small space . globular clusters occur in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk . those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters in the disk . globular clusters are fairly common : there are about 150 to 158 known globular clusters in the milky way . large galaxies can have more : andromeda may have as many as 500. some giant elliptical galaxies , particularly those at the centres of galaxy clusters , such as m87 , have as many as 13,000 globular clusters . these globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to huge distances , 40 kiloparsecs ( approximately 131,000 light-years ) or more . every galaxy of sufficient mass in the local group has its group of globular clusters , and almost every large galaxy surveyed has a system of globular clusters . the sagittarius dwarf and canis major dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters ( such as palomar 12 ) to the milky way . this demonstrates how many of this galaxy 's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past .
