Ethernet hub     an ethernet hub is an electronic device that runs a computer network . it is a simple device and is easy to configure . a hub acts like a repeater : all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports ( without looking at ip address for the data 's destination ) . that means that all devices in this network will get all data . a hub is very simple device and does not operate ethernet traffic . in contrast , a switch hub has a lower latency . many hubs have led signal lamps to show the state of the hub ( which ports are conected and if the hub working ) . a `` collision '' happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time . when collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict . the process is set in the ethernet carrier sense multiple access with collision detection ( csma/cd ) protocol some hubs may also come with a bnc and/or attachment unit interface ( aui ) connector to allow connection to legacy 10base2 or 10base5 network segments .
