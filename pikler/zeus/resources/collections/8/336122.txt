Assembly line     an assembly line is a manufacturing process which is a very important part of industry . in an assembly line , parts are added to a product in a sequence . each worker and machine does one part , and the parts are put together to make the finished object . this makes a product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods , where one person made the whole object . the division of labour was discussed by adam smith in his book `` the wealth of nations '' ( 1776 ) . he used the manufacture of pins as an example . the assembly line developed by ford motor company between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous as an example of mass production . the result was a cheaper car , the ford model t , and higher wages for ford workers . henry ford was the first to master the moving assembly line , and was able to reduce labor hours needed to make a car , and increased numbers of cars and parts . ford was the first company to build large factories around the assembly line concept . mass production by assembly lines was the catalyst which started the modern consumer culture by making possible low unit cost for manufactured goods . it is often said that ford 's production system was ingenious because it turned ford 's own workers into new customers . the lower prices turned a huge potential market into a reality . the greater demand allowed further economies of scale to be exploited . this bootstrapping quality of growth made ford famous and set an example for other industries .
