Viking program     the viking program was a nasa mission that sent two spacecraft to the planet mars . these spacecraft were called viking 1 and viking 2. each spacecraft was made of an orbiter and a lander . the orbiters took pictures of mars while going around the planet and gave information to earth . the landers gathered scientific data on the surface of the planet . both viking spacecraft were launched in 1975 and both reached mars in 1976. scientists chose a landing places for both landers from the pictures that the orbiters had taken . then the landers were loosed from the orbiters and they went down to their landing places . the orbiters still took pictures while the landers studied the surface of the planet and did other things . all of the spacecraft , including both orbiters and both landers , kept working for longer than they had been planned to . but , eventually , they broke down . viking 2 orbiter broke down in 1978 , viking 1 orbiter and viking 2 lander in 1980 , and viking lander in 1982 .
