Arkose     arkose is a kind of sandstone which is rich in the mineral feldspar . it is made mostly of quartz , but also has at least 25 % feldspar . it may also consist of fragments ( bits ) of rock . arkose usually contains small amounts of calcite cement , which may also contain iron oxide . arkose is normally grey to reddish in colour . the sand grains making up arkose are usually coarse . arkose is generally formed from the weathering of igneous or metamorphic rocks . these are usually granite rocks , which contain a lot of feldspar and quartz . arkose is often found with conglomerate deposits where the sediment is made of granite . the central australian monolith uluru is made of late neoproterozoic/cambrian arkose , deposited by the erosion of a granite-based mountain range .
