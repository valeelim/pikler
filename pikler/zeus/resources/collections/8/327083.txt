VHF omnidirectional range     vor , short for vhf omnidirectional radio range , is a type of radio navigation system for aircraft , enabling them to find their position and stay on course by receiving radio signals emitted by a network of radio beacons . it uses frequencies in very high frequency ( vhf ) from 108 to 117.95 mhz . developed in the usa in 1937 , vor is the standard air navigational system in the world , used by both commercial and general aviation . there are about 3000 vor stations around the world . a vor station broadcasts a vhf radio signal including the identifier , voice , and navigation signal . the identifier is in morse code . the voice will have information from the station . the navigation signal allows the equipment to find a magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft . vor stations in areas of magnetic unreliability are oriented to true north . a line of position is called the `` radial '' from the vor . the crossing of two radials from different vor stations provides the position of the aircraft . vor signals have a range of about 200 miles .
