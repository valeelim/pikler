Droste effect     the droste effect is the name for a picture which contains a smaller image of itself , which in turn contains a smaller image of itself , etc . it is named after an advertisement . it is an example of recursion . in art , this is known as mise en abyme . in theory , the recursion goes on forever , but in practice , the number of recursions is limited by the resolution of the image . in practice , there are few iterations , until the size falls below 1 x 1 = 1 px . the reason for this is that this is a geometric progression , and each iteration reduces the size of the image . it is a visual example of a strange loop , a self-referential system of instancing which is the cornerstone of fractal geometry .
