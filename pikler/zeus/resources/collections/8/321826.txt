Adaptive unconscious     the adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making . it is different from conscious processing : it is faster , effortless , more focused on the present , but less flexible . in other theories of the mind , the unconscious is limited to `` low-level '' activity , such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously . in contrast , the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in `` high-level '' cognition such as goal-setting as well . the term 'adaptive unconscious ' suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past . indeed , for much of vertebrate evolution , all mental activity was unconscious . no-one supposes that fish have consciousness . thus our consciousness is added to an already-existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us . implicit ( or 'tacit ' ) learning is when a person learns without knowing it happens . an important point made by reber is that `` implicit learning is a fundamental `` root '' process , one that lies at the very heart of the adaptive behavioral repertoire of every complex organism '' . what that means is that implicit learning is very much more ancient than the conscious type of learning that we , as humans , normally notice .
