Aphroditus     the worship of aphroditus comes from cyprus , a cult of a masculine or hermaphrodite form of aphrodite . the divinity was introduced into greece and celebrated in athens in a cross-dressing ritual . it is thought that hesiod 's myth , explaining the birth of aphrodite , born when cronus cut off the genitals of uranus and threw it into the sea , originated from the cult of aphroditus . a terracotta plaque from the 7th century bc found at perachora in greece , representing aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals , suggests this , as there are two different myths of the creation of aphrodite . according to macrobius , aphroditus was represented in cyprus with a beard and phallus , wearing female clothing and holding a scepter . at sacrifices to the god , worshipers cross-dressed , men wearing women 's clothing and women dressed in men 's clothing . the cult spread from cyprus into southern asia minor , eventually reaching mainland greece around the late 5th century bc . in athens , the iconography of the god took on the `` anasyromenos '' pose , a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus , a gesture that had apotropaic qualities , much like the god priapus . by the hellenistic period , the cult and votives had spread throughout asia minor , greece , and italy .
