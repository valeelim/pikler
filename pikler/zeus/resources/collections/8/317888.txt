Memristor     a memristor , or memory resistor , is described as one of the basic elements ( resistor , capacitor , inductor ) of electronic circuits , because it can â€™ t be replaced by any combination of these elements . this element can change its resistivity according to the voltage , but even after disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time . it can work like analog memory or a resistive switch , which can have an infinite number of states . professor leon chua mathematically described this element in 1971. in 2008 scientists from hp labs described a material that appeared to be a good candidate to construct the hypothetical memristor . the fourth element can change its conductivity by the voltage , and after power interruption the amount of the resistivity stays the same . no combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor . only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit . analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain .
