Periodic comet     a periodic comet is a comet which orbits around the sun . a short-period comet will complete its orbit in less than 200 years . a long-period comet will take more than 200 years to orbit . in most cases the comets are named after the person who discovered them . the shoemaker-levy comets were named after eugene shoemaker , carolyn shoemaker and david levy . a few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits , such as 2p/encke and 27p/crommelin . it is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long-period comet because of the effect of planets , or the release of gas or material from the comet itself . short-period comets can be predicted with a lot of accuracy . periodic comets sometimes have the same name , for example there are nine shoemaker-levy comets and twenty-four neat comets . the minor planet center , a part of the international astronomical union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as 181p/shoemaker-levy and 192/shoemaker-levy which are both `` comet shoemaker-levy '' . sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so 181p is comet shoemaker-levy 6 and 192p is comet shoemaker-levy 1. because non-periodic shoemaker-levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers , for example c/1991 b1 is between shoemaker-levy 2 and 3 , c/1991 t2 is between 5 and 6 , c/1993 k1 and c/1994 e2 after shoemaker-levy 9 .
