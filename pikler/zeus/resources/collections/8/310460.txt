Gene silencing     gene silencing is a general term describing epigenetic processes of gene regulation . it is used to describe the `` switching off '' of a gene by a mechanism other than genetic engineering . that is , a gene which would be expressed ( `` turned on '' ) under normal circumstances is switched off by machinery in the cell . when a gene is silenced it means that its rna is unable to make a protein . genes are regulated at either the transcriptional stage , or later , before translation . transcriptional gene silencing is done by histone modifications , which put heterochromatin around a gene . this means the transcriptional machinery ( rna polymerase , transcription factors , etc . ) can not get at the gene . genes may be silenced by dna methylation . this happens regularly during development , when genes are turned on and off at different stages . post-transcriptional gene silencing is done by blocking or destroying the mrna of a particular gene . the destruction of the mrna prevents translation to form an active gene product ( in most cases , a protein ) . a common way mrna gets silenced is by rnai .
