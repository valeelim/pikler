Stiff-tailed duck     the stiff-tailed ducks are part of the oxyurinae subfamily of ducks . all have , as their name implies , long stiff tail feathers , which are erect when the bird is at rest . all have relatively large swollen bills . these are freshwater diving ducks . their legs are set far back , making them awkward on land , so they rarely leave the water . their unusual displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat-sacs , head throwing , and erecting short crest . feather sequences are complicated , and it is hard to tell how old one of these ducks is . feathers are vital for survival because of this animals tendency to spend time in the water . without feathers this duck would die of hypothermia because it could not regulate its body temperature .
