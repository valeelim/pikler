Defence against herbivory     defence against herbivory describes plant defences to avoid being eaten . there are many adaptations which improve the survival and reproduction of plants by reducing the impact of herbivores . plants use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores . many plants produce chemicals which change the behaviour , growth , or survival of herbivores . these chemical defences can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores , or reduce plant digestibility . some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores , which in turn protect the plant . other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place . they may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores . they may grow when herbivores are not around . herbivores may get diverted towards non-essential parts , or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory . each type of defence can be either `` constitutive '' ( always present in the plant ) , or `` induced '' ( produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores ) . plants can and do react to damage .
