Auto-ethnography     auto-ethnography is a method of social research whose defining characteristic is that the author links personal experience and autobiography with social , political , and cultural concepts . its difference from ethnography is the high degree of subjectivity that is introduced to the study , and the fact that the perspective of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant observation invites . from the 1970s onwards , auto-ethnography has been gaining impact and is being used more and more . however , it still constitutes an issue of controversy and is , sometimes , criticized because of its individualistic and subjective nature , which is seen as potentially undermining of its scientific credibility . that is , the author â€™ s personal involvement with the events and society he/she describes and analyzes is sometimes considered as something that clouds his/her objectivity . it remains , however , questionable whether auto-ethnography should be judged on the same terms as traditional ethnography , as one may argue that they have different purposes altogether , and that a subjective point of view is advantageous and what auto-ethnography has to add to traditional methods .
