Varve     varves are patterns in sediment made by annual processes ( deposits which vary during the year ) . varves are amongst the smallest-scale events in stratigraphy . they form only in fresh or brackish water . varves are important in palynology , and can be fossilized as rhythmites . the classic varve archetype is a light/dark-coloured couplet deposited in a glacial lake . the light layer is usually silt and fine sand deposited when spring meltwater brings sediment into the lake . during winter , when meltwater and its sediment is reduced and the lake surface freezes , fine clay-size sediment is deposited forming a dark-coloured layer . varve formation needs the absence of bioturbation ( lake bottom disturbed by animals ) . therefore , varves usually form under anoxic conditions .
