Informal economy     the informal economy is that part of economy which does not show up in official statistics . the informal economy is not taxed , and does not contribute to the gross domestic product of a country . in developing countries over 70 % of the people work in this form of economy . they are self-employed , because it is difficult to find an employer to hire them . people working in this form of economy have no social benefits or social security , which are usually only given by the state to those who have made tax contributions . usually , most people working in this form of economy are women ; they work in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the job market . sixty percent of female workers in developing countries are employed by the informal sector . there are two main reasons why this is the case : first , the kind of employment that is available caters most to women . secondly , most women either work from home , because they also have to take care of children , or they work as street vendors ; both of these kinds of work are classified in the informal sector .
