Hilbert space     a hilbert space is a mathematical concept which is a more general type of euclidean space . it takes the mathematics used in two and three dimensions , and asks what happens if there are more than three dimensions . it is named after david hilbert . vector algebra and calculus are methods normally used in the two-dimensional euclidean plane and three-dimensional space . in hilbert spaces , these methods can be used with any finite or infinite number of dimensions . a hilbert space is a vector space that has the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured . hilbert spaces also have to be complete , which means that enough limits have to exist for calculus to work . the earliest hilbert spaces were studied in the first decade of the 20th century by david hilbert , erhard schmidt , and frigyes riesz . john von neumann first came up with the name `` hilbert space '' . hilbert space methods made a big difference to functional analysis . hilbert spaces show up a lot in mathematics , physics , and engineering , often as infinite-dimensional function spaces . they are especially useful for studying partial differential equations , quantum mechanics , fourier analysis ( which includes signal processing and heat transfer ) . hilbert spaces are used in ergodic theory which is the mathematical basis of thermodynamics . all normal euclidean spaces are also hilbert spaces . other examples of hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions , spaces of sequences , sobolev spaces made up of generalized functions , and hardy spaces of holomorphic functions .
