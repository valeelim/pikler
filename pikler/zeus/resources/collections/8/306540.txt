Evolution of cetaceans     the cetaceans ( whales , dolphins and porpoises ) are mammalian marine descendants of land mammals . their terrestrial origins are indicated by : - their need to breathe air from the surface ; - the bones of their fins , which resemble the limbs of land mammals - the vertical movement of their spines , characteristic more of a running mammal than of the horizontal movement of fish . the question of how land animals evolved into ocean-going leviathans was a mystery until recent discoveries in pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea . after many years when palaeontologists thought whales had evolved from mesonychids , dna sequence analysis showed the closest relationship was with artiodactyls , the even-toed ungulates . a new clade was created to include cetacea and their nearest relatives , the hippopotamus family . this clade is called the cetartiodactyla . hippo fossils are not found until the miocene , but whale ancestors have been found from the eocene . this leaves a gap of nearly 30 million years where no hippo ancestors are found . the most recent hypothesis is that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor which branched off from other artiodactyls around 60 million years ago ( mya ) . this ancestral group probably split into two branches around 54 mya . one branch evolved into cetaceans , possibly beginning with the proto-whale `` pakicetus '' from 52 mya . these early cetaceans gradually became adapted to life in the sea . they became the completely aquatic cetaceans .
