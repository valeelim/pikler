Big Bertha     big bertha is the name of a type of super-heavy howitzer made by the famous armaments manufacturer krupp in germany on the eve of world war i. another huge gun , 42-cm gamma-device howitzer , was the forerunner of the bertha . bertha 's official name was the l/12 ( the barrel was 12 calibre in length ) , or the m-device . many sources say that `` bertha '' is a reference to bertha krupp , heiress and owner of the krupp industrial empire . however , not all accept this . during the war , the germans gave numerous other nicknames to the m-device . 'dicke ' , meaning fat or big in german , is apparently not a reference to the physical aspect of ms krupp . the name `` big bertha '' subsequently came to be applied generally by the allies to any very large german gun . this included the railway guns which used mounted battleship guns known as `` langer max '' and the ultra-long range `` paris gun '' . strictly speaking , however , dicke bertha , or big bertha , is `` only '' applicable to the 42-cm m-device howitzer . bertha was the result of lessons learned by the germans ( and austrians ) from the russo-japanese war of 1904-05. during the war , the japanese had dismounted a number of their coastal defence 28-cm howitzers and used them to help break their siege of the fortified russian naval base at port arthur .
