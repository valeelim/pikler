Riace bronzes     the bronzi di riace ( ) , sometimes `` riace warriors '' , ( 460â€“430 bce ) are two large monumental greek bronze sculptures . the statues are of nude bearded warriors . it is possible the statues depict two individuals . it is more likely that they represent `` types '' . rich romans were collectors of greek sculpture . it is probable the two warriors were being transported from their original site in greece to one in rome . since the two warriors share so many similarities , they probably formed part of one greek monument . the bronzes were found in the ionian sea on 16 august 1972 by stefano mariottini . he was on a scuba diving vacation near reggio calabria , italy . the sculptures were found not far from shore at riace marina , a village near porto foricchio . the area was on an important shipping lane between the ports of rome and the coastal cities of greece . the bronzes may have been in an ancient shipwreck . they were either ripped from their moorings or thrown overboard to lighten the load .
