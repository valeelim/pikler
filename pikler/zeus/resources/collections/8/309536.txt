Wolf spider     a wolf spider is a member of the group of spiders whose is the `` lycosidae . '' `` lycos '' means `` wolf '' in . these spiders get their name from the way they hunt , which the people who named them thought was like the way wolves hunt . however , wolves hunt in but spiders are animals . their way of hunting is more like that of solitary cats such as the cheetahs . they generally wait for their to close by , and then they in to kill it . the wolf spiders belong to a large group . the smallest are less than 0.04 inches ( 1 mm ) in body length . the largest are around 1.5 inches ( 38 mm ) in body length . some wolf spiders spend all of their lives above ground ( taking the best shelter they can find ) , others dig burrows but come out of the burrows to wander about and hunt , and some spend almost all of their lives waiting for passing insects in their burrows . one species of wolf spider gives us the name that is now used in english for an entirely different kind of spider . this is `` hogna tarantula '' because it found around taranto , a city in italy . people there once believed that if a human were bitten by one of these wolf spiders , they would surely die unless made to do a wild dance . actually , `` hogna tarantula '' does not give bites that need medical help . any deaths from spiders in the area of taranto probably came from the local widow spider .
