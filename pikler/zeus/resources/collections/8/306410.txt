Chemical synthesis     in chemistry , chemical synthesis means using chemical reactions to get a product , or several products . this happens by physical and chemical manipulations . often , several different chemical reactions are used ; one after another . in modern laboratory usage , a chemical synthesis is reproducible ( if the experiment is done a second time , it will have the same results as the first time ) , reliable ( not broken by small changes in conditions ) , and established to work in multiple laboratories . chemists start to design a chemical synthesis by selecting compounds to combine . these starting compounds are known as reagents or reactants . chemists use various reaction types to these to synthesize the product , or an intermediate product . this requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel . ( the vessel can be a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask . ) many reactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is isolated . the amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield . typically , chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced . a side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that reduces the yield of the wanted product .
