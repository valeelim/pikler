Sosigenes the Peripatetic     sosigenes the peripatetic was a philosopher who lived in the 2nd century ad . he followed the aristotelian school of thought , and was one of the first people to write interpretations and commentaries to aristotle 's work . he was the tutor of alexander of aphrodisias , and wrote a work `` on revolving spheres '' . on 4th september 164 ad , he watched an 'annular ' solar eclipse . he noticed that , unlike a total solar eclipse , the apparent size of the moon was smaller than that of the sun . this meant the distances between the sun , moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses . for this reason , sun and moon could not be on a circular movement around the same centre . this was a significant discovery . it pinpointed a difficulty with the theory that the earth was the centre of the known universe . much later , nicolaus copernicus used the same idea when he proposed a heliocentric view . in this view , the earth , moon and the planets rotate around the sun , which does not move .
