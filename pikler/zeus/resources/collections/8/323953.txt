Bioleaching     bioleaching is getting metals from their ores by using living organisms . this is much cleaner than the traditional method using cyanide . bioleaching is one of several methods used to recover copper , zinc , lead , arsenic , antimony , nickel , molybdenum , gold , silver , and cobalt . bioleaching uses certain types of bacteria to produce a solution called a `` leachate '' . by leaving these bacteria with a low-grade metal ore , they can produce leachates which have a compound of that metal . because this is in a solution it can be used in electrolysis to make the pure metal . this only produces small amounts each time , and is repeated to make it economically viable .
