Stress (mechanics)    stress ( mechanics ) stress is the force per unit area on a body that tends to cause it to change shape . stress is a measure of the internal forces in a body between its particles . these internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to separate , compress or slide . external forces are either surface forces or body forces . stress is the average force per unit area that a particle of a body exerts on an adjacent particle , across an imaginary surface that separates them . the formula for uniaxial normal stress is : where Ïƒ is the stress , f is the force and a is the surface area . in si units , force is measured in newtons and area in square metres . this means stress is newtons per square meter , or n/m . however , stress has its own si unit , called the pascal . 1 pascal ( symbol pa ) is equal to 1 n/m . in imperial units , stress is measured in pound-force per square inch , which is often shortened to `` psi '' . the dimension of stress is the same as that of pressure .
