Refrain     a refrain is a verse or group of verses that is repeated at intervals in a piece of music or poetry . in song , it is often called the chorus . the refrain is often very different to the verse in melody , rhythm and harmonics . it usually has a higher level of dynamics and activity , often with added instrumentation . in music , a refrain has two parts : the lyrics of the song , and the melody . sometimes refrains use slightly different words as they are repeated . such lines are still able to be recognised as part of the refrain by the fact that it is always has the same tune or melody . the rhymes , if present , are also kept even if the words are sometimes different . in popular music , the chorus contrasts with the verse , which leads into it , while the bridge contrasts with and leads into both . many popular songs from the middle of the 20th century consist only of a chorus . the word comes from vulgar latin word `` refringere '' , and later from old french `` refraindre '' , both of which mean `` to repeat '' .
