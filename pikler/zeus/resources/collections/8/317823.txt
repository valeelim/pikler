Apex (diacritic)    apex ( diacritic ) in written latin , the apex ( plural : `` apices '' ) is a diacritic . it is close to the shape of an acute accent ( Â´ ) . the apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short . that means that the vowel is pronounced for longer . the shape and length of the apex can be different . it can even sometimes be different within the same writing . while pretty much all apices are made up of a line sloping up to the right , the line can be more or less curved , and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter . sometimes , it is put at the top with a hook , pointing out to the left . rather than being centered over the vowel it changes , the apex is often drawn to the right . later , it developed into the acute accent , which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length . in particular , czech and slovak , hungarian , irish , and ( a long time ago ) icelandic . although not really known by some modern latinists , the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times . the reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin . people who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum , not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings , but also in handwritten palaeographic things .
