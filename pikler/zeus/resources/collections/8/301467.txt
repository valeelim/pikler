Newton's Law of Cooling    newton 's law of cooling newton 's law of cooling describes how the temperature of an object changes . it states that the rate of change of its temperature depends on how much hotter it is than its surroundings . since it includes both temperature and the time derivative of temperature , is a first-order differential equation . it was made by physicist sir isaac newton . the law requires that the heat transfer coefficient is independent of the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings . this is the case in some situations , but not in others . the best example is the simple mechanics used in an air conditioning unit .
