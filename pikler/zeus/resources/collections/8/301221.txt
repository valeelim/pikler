Ecological genetics     ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations . this contrasts with classical genetics , which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains , and dna sequence analysis , which studies genes at the molecular level . research in ecological genetics is on traits related to fitness , which affect an organism 's survival and reproduction . examples might be : flowering time , drought tolerance , polymorphism , mimicry , defence against predators . research usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies . samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed . changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted , and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied . research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times . although work on natural populations had been done previously , it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the english biologist e.b . ford ( 1901â€“1988 ) in the early 20th century . ford was taught genetics at oxford university by julian huxley , and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. ford also had a long working relationship with r.a. fisher . by the time ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism , fisher had got accustomed to high natural selection values in nature . this was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations . ford 's magnum opus was `` ecological genetics '' , which ran to four editions and was widely influential .
