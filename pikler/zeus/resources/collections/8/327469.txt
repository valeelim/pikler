S-block     the s- is one of four s of elements on the periodic table . the s- group have a common property . the electron in their most outward electron shell are in the s-orbital . elements in the s- are in the first two periodic table groups . the elements in group one are called the alkali metals . the elements in group two are called the alkaline earth metals . the modern periodic law says that `` the properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic number . '' this means that some properties of elements are repeated as the atomic number of the elements gets larger . these repeating properties have been used to separate the elements into four s. these s are s- , p- , d- , and f- . all of the s- elements are metals ( except hydrogen & helium ) . in general , they are shiny , silvery , good conductors of heat and electricity . they lose their valence electrons easily . in fact , they lose their trademark '' s '' orbital valence electrons so easily that the s- elements are some of the most reactive elements on the periodic table .
