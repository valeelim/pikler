Skeleton key     a skeleton key ( or 'master key ' , or 'pass key ' ) is a key that can open all of the locks in the set . for example , in an office building , each employee would have a key that only opens his/her office , and the manager or owner would have a key that opens all of the offices in that building . more complicated setups are also possible . for example , if there are janitors in the office building , and each janitor only cleans a particular floor , the janitor for a particular floor could have a `` sub-master '' key that opens only the offices on that floor , while each employee still has a key that opens only his/her office and the manager still has a key that opens all of the doors . the exterior doors might also be configured so that they can be opened by any employee key , janitor key , or the manager 's master key . the more complicated the setup , the more important it is to use locks that have a large number of key possibilities . disc-detainer locks are especially suitable for master keying due to their large number of key possibilities .
