Endosperm     endosperm is a food reserve tissue inside the seeds of most flowering plants . it surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch . it may also contain oils and protein . the endosperm of cereal plants is an important source of nutrition for humans . wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread . with whole wheat bread the bran ( cover of seed ) is also in the flour . barley endosperm is the main source for beer production . other examples of edible endosperms are coconut 'meat ' and coconut 'water ' , and corn , including popcorn . some plants , like the orchids , lack endosperm in their seeds . primitive ( basal ) flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and big endosperms . the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with seeds with little or no endosperm . in more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is not developed or consumed before the seed matures . in these plants , the cotyledons contain the food reserve .
