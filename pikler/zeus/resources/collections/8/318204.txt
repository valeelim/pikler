Gamophobia     gamophobia ( prounced 'ga-me-pho-bia ' , from the greek 'gamo ' meaning 'marriage ' ) is the fear of getting married , being in a relationship , or commitment . the opposite of 'gamophobia ' is 'anuptaphobia'-it is the fear of not being in a relationship ( to be single or alone ) . a person who has gamophobia may like or love a person , but when he or she finds out about that person liking them back and attempting to be together , there is a possibility that their would change to hate . rather than a phobia , such behavior is linked to a number of personality disorders and neuroses . the majority of phobias are socially created , and are not found in any dsm psychology manual . the inability to allow oneself to be vulnerable and show their 'bad parts ' has a personality disorder . when the individual displays reaction formation ( love to hate ) this is a neurotic defense mechanism . references . - the hindu , 6 december 2011 , chennai , india
