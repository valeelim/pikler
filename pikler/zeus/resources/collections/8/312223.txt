Herbert A. Hauptman     herbert aaron hauptman ( february 14 , 1917 â€“ october 23 , 2011 ) was an american mathematician . he won a nobel prize . he made a mathematical method to find a molecular structures based on the x-ray patterns of crystallized materials . with jerome karle , he won the 1985 nobel prize in chemistry . he was born in new york city . he was the oldest child of israel hauptman and leah rosenfeld , and of jewish descent . hauptman was interested in science and mathematics from an early age . he studied at townsend harris high school . he graduated from the city college of new york ( 1937 ) . he earned an m.a . degree in mathematics from columbia university in 1939. he married edith citrynell on november 10 , 1940 , and had two daughters . after world war ii , he began working together with jerome karle , a physical chemist , at the naval research laboratory in washington , d.c.. he also enrolled in the ph.d. program at the university of maryland , college park . they used their mathematics and physical chemistry skills to solve the phase problem of x-ray crystallography . by 1955 , he had received his ph.d. in mathematics , and they had worked out the direct methods in x-ray crystallography . their 1953 article , `` solution of the phase problem i. the centrosymmetric crystal '' , contained the main ideas , the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods .
