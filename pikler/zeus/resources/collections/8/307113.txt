Isolobal principle     the isolobal principle ( also known as isolobal analogy ) is way to predict bonding properties of organometallic compounds . in organometallic chemistry , it relates the structure of organic ligands that can bind to inorganic molecular fragments . roald hoffmann described molecular fragments as isolobal `` if the number , symmetry properties , approximate energy and shape of the frontier orbitals and the number of electrons in them are similar â€“ not identical , but similar . '' one can predict the bonding and reactivity of a lesser-known pieces from that of a better-known pieces if the two molecular fragments have similar frontier orbitals , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) . isolobal compounds are analogs to isoelectronic compounds that share the same number of valence electrons and structure . a graphic representation of isolobal structures , with the isolobal pairs connected through a double-headed arrow with half an orbital below , is found in figure 1 .
