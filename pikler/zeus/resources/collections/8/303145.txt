McLafferty rearrangement     the mclafferty rearrangement is an organic reaction seen in mass spectrometry . a mass spectrometer breaks apart the molecule being studied . the molecule breaks apart in consistent ways that chemists can predict . most times , a carbon-carbon bond breaks and the atoms do not jump across the break between the fragments . the mclafferty rearrangement is an example of a hydrogen atom jumping to the other fragment as a part of the process of the bond breaking . it happens in an organic molecule containing a keto-group . the american chemist fred mclafferty was the first to describe the reaction in 1959. the keto-group undergoes β-cleavage , with the gain of the γ-hydrogen atom . this rearrangement may take place by a radical or ionic mechanism . related pages . - α-cleavage other websites . - fred mclafferty faculty webpage at cornell university
