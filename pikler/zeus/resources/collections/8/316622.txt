Thunderstorm     thunderstorms are small , intense weather systems that make strong winds , heavy rain , lightning , and thunder . thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions : the air near the earth 's surface must be warm and moist ( with lots of liquid ) , and the atmosphere must be unstable . 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second , and at any one moment , about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth . thunderstorms are rare in cold weather . when they happen , it is called thundersnow . usually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning . this is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for strong winds to blow upward from the ground ( these winds are called `` updrafts '' ) . if there is very little moisture , an updraft has to go much higher before the water vapor condenses into a cloud . sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000 feet ( 1,524 to 3,048 m ) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor . high , puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added . this moisture helps the updraft . moisture can add heat , which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster . the moisture makes the cumulus cloud `` mushroom '' upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud . the winds inside this cloud are very strong . thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000 feet ( 7,280 m ) high . the inside of the cloud is , by this time , cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals . a cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere . some thunderstorms grow twice as high as mount everest !
