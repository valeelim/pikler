Cantilever bridge     a cantilever bridge is a bridge built using a . a cantilever is only supported on one end . for small footbridges , the cantilevers may be simple beams . for large cantilever bridges , designed for road or rail traffic the cantilevers are trusses built from structural steel , or box girders built from prestressed concrete . the steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when it was first used , because it can span distances of over . they can be more easily built at difficult crossings as they do not need to be supported during the construction . engineers in the nineteenth century knew that a bridge which was built across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them . this meant there would be lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built . several nineteenth century engineers designed continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span . the use of a hinge in the multi-span system meant that engineers could better work out the loads and stresses on the bridge it also meant the bridge could handle the foundations settling at different rates .
