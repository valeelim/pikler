Middle Triassic     the middle triassic is the second of three epochs of the triassic period . it lasted from about 247.2 million years ago ( mya ) to ~237 mya . once the middle series in the triassic was known as the muschelkalk . this name is now only used for a unit of rock strata of middle triassic age , found in western europe . archosaurs were initially rarer than the therapsids which had dominated permian terrestrial ecosystems , but they began to displace therapsids in the middle triassic . this 'triassic takeover ' may have contributed to the evolution of mammals . it forced the surviving therapsids and their mammalian successors to live as small , mainly nocturnal insectivores . nocturnal life probably forced the proto-mammals to develop fur and higher metabolic rates . in their burrows , keeping warm , looking after the young and feeding them with milk were keys to their later success . the ancestors of crocodiles , and the ancestors of pterosaurs and dinosaurs , were the most important archosaurs of this epoch .
