Potentiometer     potentiometers are variable resistors . potentiometers are resistors where the resistance can be changed using a knob or a slider . potentiometers are used to control many things , including how bright or dim the lights in your house are and the volume controls on your television . the idea of a device that could be used to control the amount of electricity going to a component was thought by many people , but the carbon potentiometer we commonly use today was invented by thomas edison in 1872 at the age of 25. he called this device a `` coiled resistance wire rheostat '' . his patent for this device was issued in 1872. carbon resistors , as said above , are the most commonly used resistors today . they are used in radios to control the volume , in televisions to control picture brightness , contrast , and color response . some are used in voltage dividers . there are many different types of potentiometers . these different types include carbon potentiometers , plastic potentiometers , and wire potentiometers . carbon potentiometers are the most common potentiometers that we use today because they are inexpensive to make and are easy to put together . wire potentiometers are the most powerful type out of the three listed above . the wire inside the potentiometer is wound so that it has more power . plastic potentiometers have the same amount of power that carbon potentiometers do , but are of a higher quality . they are made of a special kind of plastic that conducts electricity just as effectively as carbon potentiometers . it as a better life than carbon potentiometers do . trimmer potentiometers are small .
