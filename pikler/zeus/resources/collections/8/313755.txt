Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood     the pre-raphaelite brotherhood ( also known as the pre-raphaelites ) was a group of english painters , poets , and critics , founded in 1848 by william holman hunt , john everett millais and dante gabriel rossetti . the three founders were soon joined by william michael rossetti , james collinson , frederic george stephens and thomas woolner to form a seven-member `` brotherhood '' . after they had broken up , john william waterhouse painted in their style . their influence shrank as the impressionists and post-impressionists became more important . the group 's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the 'mechanistic approach ' . this was first adopted by the mannerist artists who succeeded raphael and michelangelo . the brotherhood believed that the classical poses and elegant compositions of raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art . so , they are called pre-raphaelites . in particular , they objected to the influence of sir joshua reynolds , the founder of the english royal academy of arts , whom they called `` sir sloshua '' . to the pre-raphaelites , according to william michael rossetti , `` sloshy '' meant `` anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind '' . in contrast , they wanted to return to the abundant detail , intense colours , and complex compositions of quattrocento italian and flemish art .
