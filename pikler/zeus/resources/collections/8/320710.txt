Light curve     in astronomy , a light curve is a graph that shows the brightness of light from a celestial object or region , as a over a certain amount of time . the light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band . light curves can be periodic , that is they repeat in a regular pattern . examples are eclipsing binaries and cepheid variables . light curves can also be aperiodic , that is they are irregular with no pattern . examples include the light curve of a nova , a cataclysmic variable star , a supernova or a microlensing event . the study of the light curve , together with other observations , can give a lot of information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it . in the study of planets ( planetology ) , a light curve can be used to work out the rotation period of a minor planet , moon , or comet nucleus . from the earth many objects are so small that even the most powerful telescopes are unable to see objects clearly . because of this astronomers measure the amount of light produced by the object over a period of time , its light curve . the time between the peaks on the graph gives the rotational period of the object . the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness , the amplitude of the light curve , can be caused by either the shape of the object , or bright and dark areas on the surface . for example , an odd shaped asteroid 's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks , while a more spherical object 's light curve will be flatter . when the light curve covers a long period of time , it is called a secular light curve .
