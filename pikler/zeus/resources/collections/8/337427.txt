William Smith (geologist)    william smith ( geologist ) william 'strata ' smith ( 23 march 1769 â€“ 28 august 1839 ) was an english geologist , who created the first nationwide geological map . like another great scientist of his time , michael faraday , he was the son of a blacksmith . his geological discoveries were made when , as a young man , he was a surveyor , and so travelled the country . smith 's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type . so he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country . smith put together the geological history of britain ( england and wales ) and southern scotland into a single record . at the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community . his humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society . his work was plagiarised , he was financially ruined , and he spent time in debtors ' prison . it was only later in his life that smith got recognition for what he had done .
