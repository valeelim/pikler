Electronic gear shifting     in 1861 , pirren michaux invented the first bicycle with pedals . since that time , bicycles changed a lot . the first gear-shiftable bicycle was constructed at the beginning of 20th century . you could choose from 2 speeds . it 's not big deal nowadays , but then it was huge progress . standard system gearing up or down is provided all its way by bowdens . a bowden is special kind of wound-steel cable , which connects levers with the shifter , derailleur or brakes . as we pull or tap a lever , the bowden reacts at the same time . that causes the bicycle to change gear . electronic shifting works a little like that , but there are no bowdens . the system is digital . that means no wound-steel cable , but multiple combinations of 0 and 1 provides shifting . a battery placed under the frame powers the whole system . a battery should last for 1000km ( depending on the manufacturer ) , then it needs to be recharged . wires for data and powering are hidden inside the frame . parts of the shifting systems are connected together and are powered by the battery . shifting is done by servomotors . the shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built inside . a microchip in the derailleur gives us freedom . it is self-adjustable . it has its own logic , which keeps the chain from dropping . there is no need of maintenance , because the derailleur adjusts itself , thanks to a microchip .
