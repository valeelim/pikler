Uncountable set     an uncountable set is an infinite set that is impossible to count . if we try to count the elements , we will always skip some . it does not matter what size step we take . the set of real numbers is an uncountable set . there are many others . an uncountable set is bigger than an infinite countable set . we know that because georg cantor proved it . he showed that any list of numbers is not complete . this is true even if the list is infinite .
