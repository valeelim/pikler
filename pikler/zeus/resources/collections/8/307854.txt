Rahonavis     rahonavis is a genus of bird-like feathered dinosaur from the upper cretaceous , 70â€“65 million years ago ( mya ) of what is now northwestern madagascar . it is known from a partial skeleton found in a quarry . `` rahonavis '' was a small predator , at about long , with the typical `` velociraptor '' -like raised sickle claw on the second toe . `` rahonavis '' has quill knobs on its ulna ( forearm bone ) , which led at first to its inclusion among the birds . however , the rest of the skeleton is rather typically dromaeosaurid . makovicky and colleagues consider `` rahonavis '' to be closely related to the south american dromaeosaurids `` unenlagia '' and `` buitreraptor '' , and thus a member of the subfamily unenlagiinae . norell and colleagues ( 2006 ) also found `` rahonavis '' to lie within the unenlagiinae , as the sister taxon to `` unenlagia '' itself . a 2007 study by turner and colleagues again found it to be closely related to `` unenlagia '' . `` rahonavis '' was one-fifth larger than the closely related `` archaeopteryx '' , about the size of a modern raven .
