Geophysics     geophysics ( ) is the physics of the earth and its environment in space . it is also the study of the earth by measuring things and collecting data . sometimes `` geophysics '' means only studying the geology of the earth such as its shape , gravitational and magnetic field , internal structure and composition . it is can also mean how those create plate tectonics , magmas , volcanism and rock formation . some geophysicists now also study the hydrological cycle including snow and ice . they study how the oceans and the atmosphere move . they study electricity and magnetism in the atmosphere , ionosphere , and magnetosphere . how the earth and sun affect each other is also part of geophysics . geophysics was only recognized as a special area of study in the 19th century . but , there were geophysicists in ancient history . the first magnetic compasses were made in the fourth century bc and the first seismoscope was built in 132 bc . isaac newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox . instruments were developed to measure the earth 's shape , density and gravity field , as well as parts of the water cycle . in the 20th century , geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid earth and the ocean .
