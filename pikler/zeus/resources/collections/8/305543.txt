Delirium tremens     delirium tremens ( often called dts or the dts ) is a medical emergency . it is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal , which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking . `` delirium '' means very bad confusion that comes on quickly ; `` tremens '' means `` shaking . '' scientists think the dts happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited . it works too hard and will not shut off . dts were first described in 1813. most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the dts . but some people are more likely to get the dts if they suddenly stop drinking . dts are more likely in people who : - have had seizures when they tried to stop drinking alcohol before - have drunk a lot of alcohol every day for several months - have drunk alcohol for more than 10 years - are sick or have other medical problems when they suddenly stop drinking about 5 % of people who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms get the dts . about 5-10 % of chronic ( long-term ) alcoholics get the dts at some point in their life .
