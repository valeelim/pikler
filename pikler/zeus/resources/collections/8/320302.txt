Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009     the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of 2009 ( llfpa ) is an act of congress about pay discrimination that was signed into law by president barack obama on january 29 , 2009. the bill amends the civil rights act of 1964 stating that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck . the law was a direct answer to the `` ledbetter v. goodyear tire & rubber co. '' , , a u.s. supreme court decision holding that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision , not at the date of the most recent paycheck , as a lower court had ruled . a first bill to amend the statutory limitations period and supersede the `` ledbetter '' decision was introduced in the 110th united states congress but was never enacted , as after having been passed by the house it failed to survive a cloture vote in the senate due to the opposition of most of the republican senators .
