Converter (metallurgy)    converter ( metallurgy ) a converter is a chemical reactor which turns raw iron into steel . raw iron called `` pig iron '' which is the product of blast furnace , contains up to 4 % of carbon . it is too hard and brittle for meaningful use . the carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel . this process is called `` conversion '' and the reactor `` converter '' . the first converter was invented by sir henry bessemer in 1856. he built a pear-shaped large vessel with nozzles ( tuyeres ) for air in the bottom . hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter , and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure . the result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter . after ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel . the bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel , and the era of steel began . steel was now plentiful and cheap . however , steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in . air contains nitrogen , which is harmful for some steel grades . a modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air . it was invented 1949 in austria .
