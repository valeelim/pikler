Payment protection insurance     payment protection insurance ( commonly abbreviated ppi ) is a special insurance . people who get a loan can get an insurance against dying , having an accident or becoming unemployed during the runtime of this loan . if the person taking the loan dies , the rest of the loan is paid by the insurance company ; if they become unable to work because of an accident , or because of unemployment , the insurance company will pay the installments . this form of insurance has often been criticised because it is expensive ; also the insurance and the people selling the insurance usually have high margins on these kinds of insurance .
