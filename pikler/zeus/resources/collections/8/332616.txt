Alimentary canal     alimentary canal is the term used in zoology for the gut of animals . for humans in particular , see human gastrointestinal tract . the canal ( or tube ) is in bilaterian animals . it carries food through digestion and excretion . into the tube come various digestive enzymes . gut flora also help digestion.intestinal flora helps in production of vitamins . muscular movements pass the material down the tube . the gut usually has an exit , the anus , by which the animal disposes of solid wastes . some small animals have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means , for example through the mouth . animals that have guts are classified as either protostomes or deuterostomes , as the gut evolved twice , an example of convergent evolution . they are distinguished by the development of their embryos . protostomes develop their mouths first , while deuterostomes develop their mouths second . protostome include arthropods , molluscs , and annelids , while deuterostomes include echinoderms and chordates .
