Stability     stability is a property of many systems . it means being at rest , not liable to change . in mechanics and dynamics , a system is stable ( has stability ) if it will not change motion of its own accord , and will resist small efforts to change its direction or position . thus an airliner in flight is dynamically stable , and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure ( wind ) . to change its direction , its control system must be altered . on the other hand , a fighter plane is unstable , and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the pilot and a computer . most nuclear isotopes are unstable , but the world is mostly made of stable ones .
