Ternary form     ternary form is a musical form . it is also called song form or minuet and trio . these forms all have three distinct sections . the three sections are written in shorthand as aba . the music in the a sections is the same , or very nearly the same . the music in the b section is different from the a sections . the b section usually provides some sort of musical contrast to the a sections . it may be composed in a different but related key , for example . the b section is often called the `` trio '' , especially in minuets , scherzi , marches , polonaises , etc . the b section came to be called the `` trio '' because a baroque composer consistently scored this section in his minuets for three instruments . sources . - `` binary and ternary form '' in the `` harvard dictionary of music '' , 2nd ed . rev . and enlarged ( 1969 ) . willi apel , ed . cambridge , mass . : the belknap press of harvard university press - see `` trio ( 2 ) '' in the `` harvard dictionary of music '' , 2nd ed . rev . and enlarged ( 1969 ) . willi apel , ed . cambridge , mass . : the belknap press of harvard university press
