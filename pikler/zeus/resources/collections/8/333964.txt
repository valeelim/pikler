Tay Rail Bridge     the tay bridge ( or tay rail bridge ) is a railway bridge about two and a quarter miles ( three and a half kilometres ) long that spans the firth of tay in scotland , between the city of dundee and wormit , fife ( ) . as with the forth rail bridge , the tay bridge has been called the tay rail bridge since the construction of the tay road bridge over the firth . the original rail bridge replaced an early train ferry . the present tay bridge is the second rail bridge over the tay . the first one collapsed in 1879 in a storm , with great loss of life . the original tay bridge was designed by noted railway engineer thomas bouch , who received a knighthood when the bridge was completed . it was a lattice-grid design , combining cast and wrought iron . the design was well known : it was used with success in the crumlin viaduct in south wales in 1858 , after the use of cast iron in the crystal palace . a previous cast iron design , the dee bridge which collapsed in 1847 , failed due to poor use of cast-iron girders . later , gustave eiffel used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the massif central ( 1867 ) .
