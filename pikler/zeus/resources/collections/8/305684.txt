Mariner 2     mariner 2 was a nasa spacecraft . it was the second spacecraft in the mariner program . mariner 2 was the first successful mission from earth to another planet . mariner 2 was launched on august 27 , 1962 aboard an atlas-agena b rocket at cape canaveral air force station . the aim of the mariner 2 mission was to fly-by the planet venus and return information on the planet 's atmosphere , magnetic field , charged particle environment , and mass . mariner 2 was at its closest to venus , at a distance of 34,773 km , on december 14 , 1962. the spacecraft then went into orbit with the sun on secember 27 , 1962 , 105,464,560 km away . the last transmission from mariner 2 was received on january 3 , 1963. mariner 2 is still orbiting around the sun today . the spacecraft 's design was exactly the same as that of mariner 1. mariner 1 was the first spacecraft in the mariner program , but it had to be destroyed shortly after launch because its trajectory was wrong . the spacecraft found out that the surface temperature on venus was at least 425 °c ( 797 °f ) , on both the day and night sides . it discovered that venus rotates in the opposite direction from most planets in the solar system . the spacecraft also found that the atmosphere of venus is mostly of carbon dioxide and that there is a very high pressure at the planet 's surface . continuous cloud cover was detected but no magnetic field was , however . it also found that solar wind is continuous and that the density of cosmic dust between planets is much lower than it is near earth .
