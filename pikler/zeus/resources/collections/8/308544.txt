Welfare     welfare is an idea from economics and social security . the idea is that everyone should have a minimal living standard . people who can not reach this standard will be supported , usually by the state . using welfare , everyone has their basic needs covered . this idea is different from the idea of charity . welfare can take different forms : - certain goods are subsidized by the state . in that way , in many countries the price of goods people need daily , such as bread or rice may be fixed by the state . - a voucher is similar to a subsidy , except that it may only be used in a certain way . an example of this might be the cafeteria at the university ; certain students get their meals cheaper , because they have a voucher . the cafeteria then exchanges the voucher , and will be paid the difference . - it is also possible to pay money directly : people will then get a monthly amount of money . they can spend this money on anything , without restriction . - some countries need to have proof you applied for a job to receive welfare .
