Photoflash capacitor     a photo flash capacitor is a capacitor used in the flashes of cameras . a camera flash works by applying short bursts of high voltage to a type of gas in a glass tube . the electrical energy required is small , but it has to be given very fast because since the flash does n't last long . an ordinary battery can not give such a high voltage or give it so fast , so a photo flash capacitor is used . an electronic circuit increases the battery voltage , and charges a capacitor . when the button is pressed , the capacitor releases the stored energy in about a thousandth of a second and makes a bright flash .
