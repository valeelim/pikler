Thixotropy     thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick ( viscous ) under normal conditions , but flow ( become thin , less viscous ) when shaken , agitated , or otherwise stressed . in more technical language : some non-newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity ; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress , the lower its viscosity . a thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate . many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials , exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated . some fluids are anti-thixotropic : constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification . constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing . they are much less common . it is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it . this is a thixotropic response to pressure . in extremes , a quicksand may be danger to man and animals .
