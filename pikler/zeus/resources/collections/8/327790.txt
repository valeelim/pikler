Olympia (painting)    olympia ( painting ) olympia is an 1863 oil painting by édouard manet . when it was first exhibited in 1865 , the subject of the painting was controversial . manet reworked giorgione 's `` the sleeping venus '' ( c. 1510 ) and titian 's `` venus of urbino '' ( c. 1538 ) in creating `` olympia '' . `` olympia '' may also take inspiration from francisco goya 's `` la maja desnuda '' ( c. 1800 ) . this is uncertain however . victorine meurent was manet 's model for `` olympia '' . she posed as a bullfighter for him and also for the `` dejeuner sur l'herbe '' of 1862-63. manet painted `` olympia '' in the autumn of 1863. the work was first seen by the public at the 1865 salon in paris . manet delayed showing the painting because he feared it might produce some negative reactions . `` olympia '' did produce negative reactions : people hated it . some people thought the painting was immoral and vulgar . critic paul de saint-victor wrote in `` la presse '' , `` people throng in front of manet 's putrid `` olympia '' as they would in front of a body in the morgue . this is art fallen so low that it is not even worthy of censure '' . nathaniel harris writes , `` in reviewing `` olympia '' gautier wrote that the model was puny , the bed covered with cat 's footprints , the general effect ugly : but then he made the point that `` we would forgive the ugliness , were it only truthful ... the least beautiful woman has bones , muscles , skin , and some sort of colour '' , whereas on this woman the flesh colour was dirty and the modeling non-existent . '' some liked the painting . émile zola said it was manet 's `` masterpiece '' . he added , `` when other artists correct nature by painting venus they lie . manet asked himself why he should lie . why not tell the truth ? '' in 1866 zola wrote with tongue-in-cheek , `` if only manet had borrowed a powder puff ... and had lightly powdered olympia 's cheeks and her breasts she would have been a bit more presentable '' .
