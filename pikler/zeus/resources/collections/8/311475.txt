Max Wertheimer     max wertheimer ( prague , 15 april 1880 – new rochelle , new york , 12 october 1943 ) was a psychologist who was one of the three founders of gestalt psychology , with kurt koffka and wolfgang köhler . from 1929 to 1933 , wertheimer was a professor at the university of frankfurt . when adolf hitler became chancellor of the third reich in 1933 , it became apparent to wertheimer that he must leave germany . in the end , he accepted an offer to teach at the new school in new york . in new york he continued to investigate problem-solving , or what he preferred to call “ productive thinking '' . the relationship between the book and his earlier work was this : all the problems in the book except one could be solved by considering geometric diagrams . in other words , they were partly visual in essence , and could be represented and partly solved visually . that thread ran through much of the gestalt work . wertheimer completed the book ( his only book ) in late september 1943 , and died just three weeks later of a heart attack . wertheimer was buried in beechwood cemetery in new rochelle , new york .
