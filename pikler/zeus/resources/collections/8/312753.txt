Tidal stream power     tidal stream power is electricity made from the tidal movement of water . a tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides . tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents . tidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation . tidal stream power is a relatively new technology . it was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis . the potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine . water is about 800 times the density of air . so , water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed . also , the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project . in practice , the tide must move at speeds of at least 2 knots ( 1 m/s ) even close to neap tides to be a source of power .
