United Nations Human Rights Council     the united nations human rights council ( unhrc ) is in the united nations system . the unhrc was made after the united nations commission on human rights ( chr ) . it is a small part of the united nations general assembly . the general assembly made the unhrc on 15 march 2006. this was to replace the previous chr . people did not like the chr because they allowed countries with poor human rights records to be members . un secretary general ban ki moon and former united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson have not liked that the council acts for politics instead of human rights . several people have said the council focuses too much on the israeliâ€“palestinian conflict . the united states did not take part in the council when george w. bush was president . they changed when barack obama became president . on 18 june 2007 , the unhrc made a plan for future work . they will assess the human rights in all 192 un member states . they will also allow people and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the council .
