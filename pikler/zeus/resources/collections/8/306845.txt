Giant Magellan Telescope     the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) will be the world 's largest telescope when it is completed in 2018. instead of one large mirror , the gmt will have seven separate mirrors working together . this will mean its collecting area is bigger than the actual mirror surfaces . it will be made of seven diameter mirror parts . it will have a the resolving power of a mirror . its collecting area will be the same as a mirror . the telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes . it will produce images up to ten times clearer than the hubble space telescope . it will cost $ 700 million . the location of the telescope is the las campanas observatory , which is also the site of the magellan telescopes , some northeast of la serena , chile . this area has clear weather for most of the year . the night sky in most of the surrounding atacama desert region is free from atmospheric pollution . with few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution . all of this makes the area one of the best spots on earth for long-term astronomical observation .
