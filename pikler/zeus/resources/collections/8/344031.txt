Raven paradox     the raven paradox is a paradox german logician carl gustav hempel proposed in the 1940s . the paradox is about epistemology : it shows that inductive reasoning violates intuition . it reveals the problem of induction . according to the paradox , the properties of objects can be confirmed by observing other objects which do not have these properties . that way seeing a yellow car confirms the proposition `` all ravens are black '' . in strict logical terms , saying : is equivalent to saying : whenever ( 2 ) is true , ( 1 ) also is ; and likewise , in all circumstances where ( 2 ) is false ( i.e . if a world is imagined in which something that was not black , yet was a raven , existed ) , ( 1 ) is also false . this establishes logical equivalence . given a general statement such as `` all ravens are black '' , a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement . for example , is evidence supporting the hypothesis that `` all ravens are black '' .
