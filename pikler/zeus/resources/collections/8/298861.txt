Rounding     the word `` rounding '' for a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter , simpler , or more explicit form . for example , us $ 23.74 could be rounded to us $ 24 , or the fraction 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3 , or the expression formula_1 as 1.41. rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original . it may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number ; for example , a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as `` about 123,500 '' . on the other hand , rounding can introduce some `` round-off error '' in the result . rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations , especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic ; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots , logarithms , and sines ; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits . in a sequence of calculations , these rounding errors generally accumulate , and in certain `` ill-conditioned '' cases , then they may make the result meaningless .
