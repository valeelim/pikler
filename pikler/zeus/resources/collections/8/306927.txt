SN2 reaction     the s2 reaction ( also known as bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ) is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry . it is a type of nucleophilic substitution , where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it . this expels another group called a `` leaving group '' . so , the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step . since two reacting species are involved in the slow , rate-determining step of the reaction , this leads to the name `` bimolecular nucleophilic substitution '' , or `` s2 '' . among inorganic chemists , the s2 reaction is often known as the `` interchange mechanism '' . the reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp carbon center with an electronegative , stable leaving group attached to it - 'x ' - frequently a halide atom . the breaking of the c-x bond and the formation of the new c-nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate , and approximately sp hybridized . the nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180° to the leaving group , since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile 's lone pair and the c-x σ* antibonding orbital . the leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed .
