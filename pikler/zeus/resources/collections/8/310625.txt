Gerund     a gerund is a verb used as a noun . in english , the gerund is formed by adding -ing to a verb root . it is identical in form to the present participle ( ending in `` -ing '' ) and can behave as a verb within a clause ( so that it may be modified by an adverb or have an object ) , but the clause as a whole ( sometimes consisting of only one word , the gerund itself ) acts as a noun within the larger sentence . for example : `` eating this cake is easy . '' in `` eating this cake is easy '' , `` eating this cake '' , although traditionally known as a phrase , is referred to as a non-finite clause in modern linguistics . `` eating '' is the verb in the clause , while `` this cake '' is the object of the verb . `` eating this cake '' acts as a noun phrase within the sentence as a whole , though ; the subject of the sentence is the non-finite clause , specifically `` eating '' . other examples of the gerund : - `` i like swimming . '' ( direct object ) - `` swimming is fun . '' ( subject ) not all nouns that are identical in form to the present participle are gerunds . the formal distinction is that a gerund is a `` verbal '' noun â€“ a noun derived from a verb that retains verb characteristics , that functions `` simultaneously '' as a noun and a verb , while other nouns in the form of the present participle ( ending in `` -ing '' ) are `` de '' verbal nouns , which function as common nouns , not as verbs at all . compare :
