Polymer chemistry     polymer chemistry ( also called macromolecular chemistry ) is the science of chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers or macromolecules . according to iupac recommendations , macromolecules refer to the individual molecular chains and are the domain of chemistry . polymers describe the bulk properties of polymer materials and belong to the field of polymer physics ( a part of physics ) . the different kinds of macromolecules include : - biopolymers produced by living organisms : - structural proteins : collagen , keratin , elastin and others - chemically functional proteins : enzymes , hormones , transport proteins and others - structural polysaccharides : cellulose , chitin and others - storage polysaccharides : starch , glycogen and others - nucleic acids : dna , rna - synthetic polymers used for plasticsâ€”fibers , paints , building materials , furniture , mechanical parts , adhesives : - thermoplastics : polyethylene , teflon , polystyrene , polypropylene , polyester , polyurethane , polymethyl methacrylate , polyvinyl chloride , nylon , rayon , celluloid , silicone and others
