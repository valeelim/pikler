Sundown town     a sundown town is a town that is or was purposely all-white . the term is widely used in the united states in areas from ohio to oregon and well into the south . the term came from signs that were allegedly posted stating that people of color had to leave the town by sundown . the minority people could not visit after sunset or spend the night in the town ( even as a paying hotel customer ) . such towns are also sometimes called “ sunset towns ” or “ gray towns ” . some towns placed signs at the town 's borders with statements similar to the one posted in hawthorne , california , which read `` nigger , do n't let the sun set on you in hawthorne '' in the 1930s . in some cases , keeping minorities out was official town policy , through restrictive covenants written in land deeds , or by agreement between the real estate agents of the community . in others , the policy was enforced through intimidation . for example , law enforcement officers could stop all minorities found after sunset . though no one knows the number of sundown towns in the united states , the largest estimate was that the nation had several thousand . the highest proportion of confirmed sundown towns are in the state of illinois . it is difficult to confirm sunset towns because the towns did not keep , or do not want to show , official documents stating their status as sundown towns . for example , `` one hundred years of progress : the centennial history of anna , illinois , '' although more than 400 pages long , never mentions anna 's 1909 expulsion of african americans , the sundown signs at the northern and southern city limits in 1954 , or anything else about race .
