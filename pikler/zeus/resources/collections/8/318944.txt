Woodpecker Finch     the woodpecker finch is a species of birds in the family fringillidae . they live in the galapagos islands and are named for their habit of eating grubs that live in the woods . but the woodpecker finch , unlike woodpeckers , does not have a long tongue or a bill that is suitable for getting hold of the grubs . instead , it uses a cactus spine or twig that is the right shape to dig grubs out .
