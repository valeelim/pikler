Ox Mountain     ox mountain ( ) is a story by the chinese philosopher mencius . in his time this mountain was in very bad shape , and everybody knew how it looked . here is the story : mencius said , `` the woods on ox mountain were once beautiful ! on account of its being on the edge of a large country , it had been attacked with axes and hatchets , and then how could it remain beautiful ? the refreshing breezes of day and night , and the moisture provided by rain and fog , did not fail to give rise to sprouts of vegetation . but cows and sheep have been repeatedly pastured there , and for that reason it has remained desolate . people observe its denuded state and assume that it never had any good resources . but how could this state be the true nature of this mountain ? '' â€” `` mencius '' , 6a:8 mencius argued that `` bad '' human natures were produced just as the bad condition of ox mountain had been produced , so the answer to `` bad '' humans was to protect and nurture them from birth . he also thought that punishment does not do much good . it does not cure the root of the problem .
