Second moment of area     the moment of force ( also called the first moment of force ) about any point is the product of the force and perpendicular distance between them . if this first moment is again multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them , the product so obtained is called the second moment of force or moment of moment of the force . if instead of force , the area of the figure or mass of the body is considered , it is called the second moment of area or second moment of mass . they are also termed broadly as moments of inerta . there is no physical significance for moment of inertia . it is just a mathematical expression usually denoted by formula_1 related pages . - polar moment of inertia
