Chemical education     chemistry education is the study of the teaching and learning of chemistry . topics in chemistry education include understanding how students learn chemistry and how best to teach chemistry . researchers in chemistry education try to improve learning results by improving teaching methods and training chemistry teachers . researchers study many teaching modes , including : classroom lecture , demonstrations , and laboratory activities . there is a world-wide shortage of chemistry teachers . this is because people with science training can get jobs that pay more outside of teaching . it is hard to keep science teachers . more than 45,000 math and science teachers left teaching in the united states just after the 1999–2000 school year . there are several different ways of thinking about chemistry education . one is a `` practitioner ’ s perspective '' . the people who teach chemistry define chemistry education by their actions . another is defined by a self-identified group of `` chemical educators '' ( faculty members and instructors who focus on teaching rather than focus on chemical research ) . dr. robert l. lichter , then-executive director of the camille and henry dreyfus foundation , speaking in a plenary session at the 16th biennial conference on chemical education ( recent bcce meetings : , ) , posed the question “ why do terms like ‘ chemical educator ’ even exist in higher education , when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity , namely , ‘ chemistry professor. ’ '' one criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in education or background about education to their jobs . most chemistry professors do not have a professional perspective on teaching and learning efforts . they may not know about effective teaching methods and how students learn .
