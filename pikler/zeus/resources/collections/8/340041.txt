Small shelly fossils     small shelly fossils ( ssf ) , or small shelly fauna , are tiny fossils , many only a few millimetres long . they have a record from the latest stages of the ediacaran to the early cambrian period . almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites . most ssfs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate . this method of preservation is mainly limited to the later ediacaran and early cambrian periods , so the animals that made them may have arisen earlier and continued after this time . some of the fossils represent the entire skeletons of small organisms , including the mysterious `` cloudina '' and some snail-like molluscs . however , the bulk of the fossils are fragments or parts of larger organisms , including sponges , molluscs , slug-like halkieriids , brachiopods , echinoderms , and onychophoran-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of arthropods . one of the early explanations for the appearance of the ssfs – and the evolution of mineralized skeletons – is a sudden increase in the ocean 's concentration of calcium . however , many ssfs are made of other minerals , such as silica . the first ssfs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation , so it is likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well-defended prey . nevertheless it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible .
