The Cheetah Girls     the cheetah girls started out as a 2003 summer line-up movie for disney channel . within the two years of release , it gained one of the biggest fan franchises in disney history as well as on the soundtrack charts having a double platinum soundtrack and high-rated dvd release . after all of this success three of the original members adrienne bailon , kiely williams and sabrina bryan decided to reunite and record and a song for the `` disneymania 3 '' cd . raven-symoné however declined saying that `` i want to work on my solo career right now . i loved being a cheetah girl but i do n't want to be known as 'galleria from the cheetah girls ’ , and as 'raven baxter ' forever . right now i just want to be raven-symoné . '' adrienne bailon ( who at the time had a reoccurring role on `` that 's so raven '' ) claimed to `` understand '' but still said she was `` disappointed '' in raven for not continuing what she started . however , the 3 remaining cheetahs recorded `` i wo n't say ( i 'm in love ) '' for `` disneymania 3 '' . they also kept their names from `` the cheetah girls '' movie . kiely was known as `` aqua '' , adrienne was known as `` chanel '' and sabrina was known as `` dorinda '' . after seeing how much of a response `` i wo n't say ( i 'm in love ) '' received , disney quickly approached the cheetahs for a recording contract . raven was again offered her spot back in the group and again declined . this upset adrienne so much that she quit as her role of alana on `` that 's so raven '' . the newly reformed cheetah girls signed the contract for one album with walt disney records . the stage names dorinda , chanel and aqua were also dropped at this time . right before the release of their debut album they released a single for the `` chicken little '' soundtrack called shake a tail feather , a re-make of an old ray charles song . their debut album was a christmas album titled cheetah-licious christmas . they also made a music video for their debut single also titled `` cheetah-licious christmas '' . they performed this single at the walt-disney christmas day parade and were featured in the macy 's thanksgiving day parade . after the success of their christmas album they were reported as signing to hollywood records ( owned by disney but for more successful artists such as aly & aj and former cheetah raven-symoné ) .
