Accuracy and precision     the accuracy and precision of measurements have special meanings in the fields of science , engineering , industry and statistics . - the accuracy of a measurement system is how close it gets to a quantity 's actual ( true ) value . - the precision of a measurement system is the degree to which repeated measurements give the same results . a measurement system can be accurate but not precise , precise but not accurate , neither , or both . for example , if an experiment contains a error in the way it is done , then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy . the end result would be a consistent , yet inaccurate , set of results from the flawed experiment . eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision . a measurement system is valid if it is both `` accurate '' and `` precise '' . related terms include `` bias '' ( non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable ) and `` error '' ( random variability ) .
