MG 42     the mg 42 ( shortened from german : `` maschinengewehr 42 '' , or `` machine gun 42 '' ) was a general-purpose machine gun . it was created in nazi germany . it began being used by the `` wehrmacht '' in 1942. it was used with ( and sometimes replaced ) the mg 34 machine gun in the german armed forces . both weapons were made and used until the end of the war . the mg 42 was known for being reliable , simple and easy to use . however , it is best known for its very high rate of fire so the germans called it `` hitlers√§ge '' , or `` hitler 's saw '' . there were other automatic weapon designs with similar firepower . some examples of these are the french darne , the hungarian-gebauer , the russian 7.62mm shkas and the british vickers k machine gun . however , because the mg 42 got its ammunition from a belt and its barrel was easy to change , it could fire for longer periods of time than these weapons . the mg 42 was used to create new weapons after nazi germany surrendered . the mg1 ( mg 42/59 ) was nearly exactly the same as the mg 42. the mg1 became the mg1a3 , which in turn became the mg 3. the swiss mg 51 , sig mg 710-3 , austrian mg 74 , and the spanish 5.56mm ameli light machine gun were all designed from the mg 42. the m60 and belgian mag also copied some features . the mg 42 was still used by many armed groups after the war .
