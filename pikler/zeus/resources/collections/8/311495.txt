Guitar solo     a guitar solo is a portion of a musical performance when a guitar is used without other instruments . in addition to their roles of rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment , guitars are well-suited to performing solo lines . this can take the form of a prominent section where the guitar is heard over other instruments , or unaccompanied , the guitarist providing all the necessary melody and harmony themselves . many times , a guitar solo is a virtuosic performance in the rock music idiom with a heavily-overdriven electric guitar . however , solo instrumentation for the guitar can be found in a wide variety of musical styles and eras . many famous guitarists are known for their solo work . approaches to solo creation vary from the jagged/atonal approach of andy gill from gang of four and andy partridge from xtc , the studio-produced soundscapes of jimi hendrix or bill nelson , or the composed approach of frank zappa . the use of the guitar solo in popular music was especially notable during the 1980s , where a flashy and attention-grabbing instrumental was virtually obligatory for a guitar-based band . in later years , guitar solos became viewed as something of an `` 80s clich√© '' , and their usage declined . guitar solos in pop music have subsequently become much rarer , and more subdued and understated when used .
