Cycliophora     the cycliophora are a new platyzoan phylum , based on a single genus symbion . they are so different from other animals that they were put in their own phylum . they were discovered in 1995 , and are the most recent new phylum . so far , three species have been found . they live on the bodies of cold-water lobsters . they are microscopic : the feeding stage is about 0.3 mm long , and 0.1 mm wide . their life style is commensal , ( a form of symbiosis ) – they feed on the leftovers from the lobster 's own meals . they have three different body forms , and a two-stage life-cycle . - asexual feeding stage – at this stage , the tiny animal is neither male or female . on the posterior end of the sac-like body is a stalk with an adhesive disc , which attaches itself to the host . on the anterior end is a ciliated funnel ( mouth ) and an anus . - sexual stage – these are even smaller than the feeding stage . - male – has no mouth or anus , which shows the absence of a digestive system . it also has two reproductive organs .
