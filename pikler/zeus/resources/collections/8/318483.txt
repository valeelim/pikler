Diapsid     a diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae ( holes ) behind the eye on each side of its skull . most reptiles are diapsids , and the condition does not occur in mammals . the function of the holes is to improve jaw movements , and to reduce the weight of the skull . the holes give places for muscle attachment ; also , as jaw muscles contract , the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge . the `` allosaurus '' skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs , especially the large theropods . it is here not much more than a series of struts , yet provides massive bite power . some aquatic reptile groups lost the lower of the two openings , leaving just one behind the eye . this is called the euryapsid condition . it is fairly certain that this is secondary , and that the groups were originally diapsids . the groups include : - ichthyosaurs - plesiosaurs - placodonts
