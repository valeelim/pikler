Diet soft drink     diet sodas ( or diet pop , diet , sugar-free , or light soft drinks , refreshments , or carbonated beverages ) are usually sugar-free , artificially sweetened , non-alcoholic carbonated beverages targeted towards health-conscious people , diabetics , athletes , and other people who want to lose weight , improve physical fitness , or reduce how much sugar they eat . different artificial sweeteners are used instead of sugar to give diet soda a sweet taste and some are often used combined with one another . aspartame , commonly known by the brand name nutrasweet , is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners . when aspartame-sweetened diet coke was released in 1982 it make aspartame more popular . today , at least in the united states , when the word `` diet '' is seen or heard it is assumed to be aspartame . the first artificial sweeteners used in diet soda were cyclamates ( often synergistically with saccharin ) . while many say these cyclamate-sweetened soda had a better taste than the diet soda that came after them , in 1970 the food and drug administration banned cyclamates in the united states because there was proof that they caused cancer in lab rats . cyclamates are still used in many countries around the world , including for diet soda .
