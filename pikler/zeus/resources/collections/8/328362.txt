Japanese Imperial year     `` kōki '' emphasizes the long history of japan and the imperial dynasty . the summer olympics and tokyo expo were planned as anniversary events in 1940 ( `` kōki 2600 '' ) ; but the international games were not held because of the second sino-japanese war . the imperial japanese army ( ija ) and imperial japanese navy ( ijn ) used the `` kōki '' system for identification . for example , - the ija 's type 92 battalion gun was called `` ninety-two '' because its design was completed in 1932 ; and the 2592nd year since the first emperor of japan was 1932 ( `` kōki 2592 '' ) . - the mitsubishi a6m zero was called the `` zero '' because it entered service in 1940 ( `` kōki 2600 '' ) . in japan today , the system of counting years from the reign of emperor jimmu has been abandoned . related pages . - japanese calendar - japanese era names other websites . - national diet library , `` the japanese calendar ''
