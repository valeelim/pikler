Thames Barrier     the thames barrier is the world 's second-largest movable flood barrier , after the oosterscheldekering in the netherlands . it is downstream of central london . its purpose is to prevent london from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the north sea . it is raised ( closed ) only during high tide ; at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it . the barrier 's northern bank is in the london borough of newham and its southern bank is in the london borough of greenwich . the report of hermann bondi into the north sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the thames estuary and parts of london was what led to the building of the barrier . london is vulnerable to flooding . a storm surge generated by low pressure in the atlantic ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the north sea . the surge tide is funnelled down the north sea which narrows towards the english channel and the thames estuary . if the storm surge coincides with a spring tide , dangerously high water levels can occur in the thames estuary . this situation combined with downstream flows in the thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers .
