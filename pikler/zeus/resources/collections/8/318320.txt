Emeishan Traps     the emeishan traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in southwestern china , around sichuan province . many igneous rock types can be found there . this is known as large igneous province in geology . other names for the traps include permian emeishan large igneous province , and other variations . the traps are the step-like rock made up of many layers of basalt , which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma . the eruptions that lead to the emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago . the traps are much smaller than the siberian traps , which occurred not long afterwards , about 251 million years ago . despite this , the emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time , and on paleontology . they are part of the mass extinction events towards the end of the permian period . the emeishan traps are part of the scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions . the end-guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the emeshian traps were formed . this supports the argument , that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions . another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them . in this context , the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions , such as those which generated the emeshian traps . this hypothesis is not widely supported .
