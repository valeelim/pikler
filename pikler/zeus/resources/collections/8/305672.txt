Complexity class     a complexity class is a concept from theoretical computer science and mathematics : all problems that have the same complexity are in the same complexity class . this means , that for a given input , they need about the same amount of resources , such as compute time , or memory . the most often used models for complexity are time complexity , which measures the time needed to calculate a result , or space complexity , which looks at the amount of memory or storage needed . when talking about complexity classes , a `` worst case scenario '' is usually assumed .
