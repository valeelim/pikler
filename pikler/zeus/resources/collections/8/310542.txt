Party realignment in the United States     a party realignment in the united states is when the balance of power between a country 's political parties changes greatly . their electoral coalitions ( the groups of people who vote for them ) change dramatically . sometimes , this happens when political parties die out or are created . party realignments can be the result of major historical events . they can also be the result of changes in demographics . in the early 1800s , america had the `` first party system '' of federalists and democratic-republicans . by the election of james monroe , the federalists had died out . there was one party rule by the democratic-republicans . in the election of 1824 , four different people ran as democratic-republicans . john quincy adams was elected . after the election , andrew jackson formed a new party called the democrats . jackson 's party was strongest in the south and west , and in some cities ( at this time , only a few americans lived in cities ) . soon after jackson 's election , another party formed around supporters of adams and henry clay . it was first called the national republican party , and later the whig party . the whigs were strong in the north , and among the middle class and businessmen . the clash between democrats and whigs was called the `` second party system '' .
