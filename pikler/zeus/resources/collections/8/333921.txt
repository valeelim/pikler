Weighted average     a weighted average is the average of values which are scaled by importance . the weighted average of values is the sum of weights times values divided by the sum of the weights . given two school classes , one with 20 students , and one with 30 students , the grades in each class on a test were : the straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. the straight average of 80 and 90 is 85 , the mean of the two class means . however , this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class , hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade ( independent of class ) . the average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades , without regard to classes ( add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students ) : or , this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class ( using a weighted mean of the class means ) : thus , the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available .
