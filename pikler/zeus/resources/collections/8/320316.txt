Arena rock     arena rock ( also known as corporate rock , industry rock , or stadium rock ) is a word to describe a form of rock music which is played , or intended to be played , in large venues , such as stadia and open-air concert spaces . in such a way , genres which traditionally fall within the categories of arena rock tend to be ( yet not always ) loud and anthemic ; arena rock is most traditionally associated with heavy metal , progressive rock , hard rock , glam metal or pop rock genres . often , yet not always , arena rock is categorised as being more mass-scale , commercially appealing , and radio-oriented music . due to the often commercial nature of arena rock , it is occasionally called corporate rock . arena rock is generally associated with the grand shows that artists and groups within the style would hold . at these performances , large sound systems , and often elaborate lighting , additional effects and fireworks , would be included . the 1970s and 80s were a major period in arena rock . whilst arena rock has seen large popularity over the years , especially from the 1960s to the 1980s , it has also been criticised for its often commercial and extravagant nature , especially with regards to the shows and concert tours that arena rock bands and artists would have . to some extent , genres such as pub rock , punk rock , indie rock and alternative rock grew as a reaction against the nature and aesthetic of arena rock , opting for a less commercial and over-the-top style .
