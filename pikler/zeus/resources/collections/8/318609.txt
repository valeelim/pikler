Tteokbokki     tteokbokki ( ) is a korean traditional food which has sticks of rounded rice cake as the main ingredient . ' `` tteok '' ' is the korean word for rice cake and 'bokki ' is the korean word for something fried . tteokbokki is divided into gungjung tteokbokki and general tteokbokki as one of korean street foods . gungjung tteokbokki ( ) is made by frying beef and rice cake with soy sauce . it was developed in `` gungjung '' which means a korean court . general tteokbokki is cooked with seasoning using gochujang with starch syrup or sugar for the sweet taste . generally gungjung tteokbokki uses beef and vegetable because it was cooked at court but general tteokbokki uses fish cake , green onions and boiled egg . in a cook book named 'siuijeonseo ' which was written in late 1800s , there is a record of tteokbokki . however , tteokbokki might have existed before the late 1800s because the main ingredient is rice cake and there were rice cakes during the three kingdoms of korea period . gungjung tteokbokki is different from tteokbokki because there were no red peppers in joseon dynasty so they made gungjung tteokbokki with vegetables and meats . modern tteokbokki was first made by mabokrim who has sold tteokbokki with gochujang since 1953 .
