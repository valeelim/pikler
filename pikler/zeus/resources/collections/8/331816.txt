Bolshoi Ballet     the bolshoi ballet is a ballet company . it is based at the bolshoi theatre in moscow , russia . it was founded in 1776. it is one of the oldest ballet companies in the world . it achieved worldwide acclaim in the early 20th century when moscow became the capital of soviet russia . the bolshoi and the kirov ballet are recognised as the foremost ballet companies in russia . the origin of the bolshoi is found in the creation of a dance school for a moscow orphanage in 1773. in 1776 , dancers from the school were employed by prince pyotr urusov and the english theatrical entrepreneur michael maddox to form part of their new theatre company . they performed in privately owned venues . later they acquired the petrovsky theatre . the theatre would later be rebuilt as today 's bolshoi theatre . the early history of the bolshoi ballet is very sketchy . the company staged many famous ballets . it struggled to compete with the imperial russian ballet of st petersburg . it was not until alexander gorsky became ballet master in 1900 that the company began to develop its own unique identity . the company was acclaimed for productions of new or restaged ballets including , `` don quixote '' ( 1900 ) , `` coppélia '' ( 1901 ) , `` swan lake '' ( 1901 ) , `` la fille mal gardée '' ( 1903 ) , `` giselle '' ( 1911 ) , `` le corsaire '' ( 1912 ) and `` la bayadère '' ( 1917 ) .
