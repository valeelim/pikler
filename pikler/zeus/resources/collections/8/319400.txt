Neo-Keynesian economics     neo-keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that was developed after world war ii from the writings of john maynard keynes . a group of economists ( notably john hicks , franco modigliani , and paul samuelson ) , attempted to interpret and formalize keynes ' writings , and to synthesize it with the neo-classical models of economics . this model , the is/lm model , is nearly as influential as keynes ' original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education . it relates aggregate demand and employment to three variables , that is , the amount of money in circulation , the government budget , and the state of business expectations . this model was very popular with economists after world war ii because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory . their work has become known as the neo-classical synthesis . it created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-keynesian economics . these ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period , and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s , 60s and 70s .
