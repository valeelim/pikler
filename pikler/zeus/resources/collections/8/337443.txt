Cybele     in anatolian mythology , cybele was the personification of the earth . she was the goddess of nature , fertility , mountains , and wild animals . she is often represented sitting on a throne , flanked by two lions , and wearing a mural crown . in phrygian myth , she was born a hermaphroditic being named agdistis , a child of zeus and gaia . cybele had a shepherd consort named attis , and a priesthood of eunuchs called the galli . her cult was adopted by the greeks and later by the romans . zeus let fall in his sleep seed upon the earth , which in course of time gave birth to an androgynous being , born both male and female , whom they called agdistis . but the gods , fearing agdistis , cut off the male organ . the blood fertilized the soil and there grew up from it an almond-tree . a daughter of the river sangarius picked an almond and laid it in her bosom , where the almond disappeared . she then had a child , a baby boy named attis . her orgiastic cult dominated the central and north-western districts of asia minor , and was introduced into greece via the island of samothrake and the boiotian town of thebes . cybele was closely associated with a number of greek goddesses , firstly rhea , the greek mother of the gods ( meter theon ) , but sometimes also demeter ( especially in the samothrakian cult ) , aphrodite ( on mount ida ) and artemis ( in karia ) . her main cult followers were the galli , these were eunuch priests of a feminine nature , who celebrated her festivals with wild dancing , self-laceration , and self-scourging .
