Stereochemistry     stereochemistry is the study of how molecules are affected by the way their atoms are arranged in space . it is also known as 3d chemistry as the word `` stereo '' means `` three dimensional '' . using stereochemistry , chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms . they can also study the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships give molecules . when these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules it is called dynamic stereochemistry . in chemistry , some molecules have more than one isomer . this means that molecules can have different forms , even though all the forms made up of the same atoms . there are two kinds of isonomers . constitutional isomers have the same atoms , but they are joined differently . stereoisomers have the same atoms , they are joined the same way , but the atoms are arranged differently in space . an important part of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules . these molecules look almost identical , except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other .
