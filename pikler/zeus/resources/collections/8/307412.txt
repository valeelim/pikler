Remipedia     remipedia is a class of blind crustaceans found in coastal aquifers . so long as the water is salty , these little animals can be found . they are found in almost every ocean basin so far explored , including in australia , the caribbean sea , the atlantic ocean . the first described remipede was a fossil called `` tesnusocaris goldichi '' ( early pennsylvanian ) . since 1979 at least 17 living species have been identified . they live in the neo-tropical zone . remipedes are long . they have a head and a long trunk of up to forty-two similar body segments . the swimming appendages are on the sides of each segment , and the animals swim on their backs . they are generally slow-moving . they have fangs connected to secretory glands ; it is still unknown whether these glands secrete digestive juices or poisonous venom , or whether remipedes feed primarily on detritus or on living organisms . they have a primitive body plan in crustacean terms , and may be a basal , ancestral crustacean group . at least one species , `` godzilliognomus frondosus '' , has an organised brain , with a particularly large olfactory area . species which live in dark environments need to detect scents in the water . the size and complexity of the brain suggested that remipedia might be the sister taxon to malacostraca , regarded as the most advanced of the crustaceans .
