Cedar     cedar ( scientific name `` cedrus '' ) is a genus of cone-bearing trees in the plant family `` pinaceae '' . they are native to the mountains of the western himalaya and the mediterranean region . they are found at heights of in the himalaya and in the mediterranean.. cedars are trees up to ( occasionally ) tall with spicy-scented wood , thick ridged or square-cracked bark , and broad , level branches . the shoots are of two kinds , long shoots , which form the framework of the branches , and short shoots , which carry most of the leaves . the leaves are evergreen and needle-like , 8–60 mm long , arranged in an open spiral on long shoots , and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots ; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green , depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from drying out . the female seed cones are barrel-shaped , 6–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad , green at first , then maturing grey-brown , and , as in abies , disintegrate when mature to release the winged seeds . the seeds are 10–15 mm long , with a 20–30 mm wing ; as in abies , the seeds have 2–3 blisters , containing an unpleasant-tasting resin , thought to be a defence against squirrels eating them . cones take one year to mature , with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later . the male pollen cones are slender , egg-shaped , 3–8 cm long , produced in late summer and shedding pollen in autumn .
