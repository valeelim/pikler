Daphnia     daphnia are small , planktonic crustaceans , between 0.2 and 5 mm in length . `` daphnia '' are members of the order cladocera . they one of the several small aquatic crustaceans often called water fleas because of their jumpy swimming style . they live in various aquatic environments ranging from acidic swamps to freshwater lakes , ponds , streams and rivers . daphnia have open circulatory systems . instead of having blood vessels , the daphnia have a fluid called haemolymph . the haemolymph is pumped throughout the body cavity ( which is called a haemocoel ) . the daphnia ’ s nervous system consists of a brain that has two or three pairs of ganglia . ganglia are nerve cells that tend to cluster up . the nervous system also has nerve rings that go round the oesophagus . last of all , it has a paired ventral nerve cord . the daphnia reproductive system is parthenogenetic . the female daphnia produce eggs without mating . that means that their eggs can grow without being fertilized . the female daphnia carries its 50 or so eggs in the brood chamber , until they are ready to hatch . daphnia can still mate , the only difference is that the “ mated ” eggs have an extra hard shell that can protect them from harsh conditions for a long time . these eggs are called cysts , and they can hatch when conditions are favorable again , which is usually around spring .
