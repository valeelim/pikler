Hydron     in chemistry a proton is a positively charged hydrogen ion . according to iupac , the name hydron should be used for such a particle . in this sense , a `` hydron '' can be a proton in the sense of physics , a `` deuteron '' or a `` triton '' . a deuteron is the ion of deuterium , a triton that of tritium . ( so chemists use the term `` hydron '' because it covers all three hydrogen ion isotopes . ) in 1923 , johannes nicolaus br√∏nsted and thomas lowry used hydrons to describe acids and bases . they defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors .
