Hyperglycemia     hyperglycemia means high blood sugar levels at or beyond 200 mg/dl . it is a serious and life threatening health problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time . in a healthy body , insulin helps glucose ( sugar ) get from the blood into the body 's cells . there , the cells can use the sugar to make energy . however , when there is not enough insulin in the body , or if a person 's body does not react to insulin normally ( this is called insulin resistance ) , too much sugar stays in the blood . this can cause serious health problems . extremely high blood sugar means diabetes mellitus , a condition that often causes very high blood sugar . hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind , or may be developing under low insulin levels or resistance to insulin . three of the early signs of hyperglycemia are `` the 3 polys '' : polydipsia ( feeling very thirsty ) , polyphagia ( feeling very hungry ) , and polyuria ( urinating a lot ) . these things happen because : - the body senses that its cells are not getting enough sugar . the body triggers hunger , because eating is usually how people get sugar . this causes polyphagia .
