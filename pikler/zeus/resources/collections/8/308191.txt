Youth     youth is the opposite of elderly . when something is new , it can be called young . sometimes `` young '' is only for living things , and things that are not alive are '' new '' . the word youth is often used to describe young people between the pre-teen age and early twenties . old can refer to someone or something 's age . young can mean that something is current to date or well before its `` best by '' date . different things lose their youth or grow old at different rates . for example , technology has a short life span and can only be considered young for roughly one year . in many countries , humans are no longer young at 23 or 25 years old . in many countries , humans become `` adults '' at age 18 by law , but are still seen as kids/youth by adults . this is partly due to the fact that the mental and emotional development is n't done until around age 25 , and also that 18 and 19 year olds are still teenagers , many of them without any adult life experience . guys and girls will notice a sligtly big difference in their maturity between the age of 18 and age of 25 .
