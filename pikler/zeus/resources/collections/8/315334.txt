Mars Science Laboratory     the mars science laboratory ( msl ) is a nasa mission to land and control a rover named curiosity on the surface of the planet mars . the msl was launched on november 26 , 2011. the msl successfully did the first-ever precision landing on mars . it landed on mars at gale crater on august 5 , 2012 and began exploring the surface . the goal of the curiosity rover is to study the history of mars . it was to see whether mars has , or ever had , an environment able to support microbial life . it indeed did that , finding evidence that 3 billion years ago there was once water and a life-supporting environment . it is important to know that it found that life could have existed , not that it certainly did . it will also carefully look at samples scooped up from the soil and drilled powders from rocks . `` curiosity '' is five times as heavy as the mars exploration rovers `` spirit '' or `` opportunity '' and carries more than ten times their mass of scientific instruments . it was launched by an atlas v 541 rocket . `` curiosity '' will be expected to work for at least 1 martian year ( 668 martian sols/686 earth days ) , but may live a lot longer than that . it will explore mars with greater range than any other rover .
