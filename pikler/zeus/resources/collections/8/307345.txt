INDO     indo stands for intermediate neglect of differential overlap . it is a semi-empirical quantum chemistry method that is a development of the complete neglect of differential overlap ( cndo/2 ) method developed by john pople . like cndo/2 it uses zero-differential overlap for the two-electron integrals . integrals for over orbitals centered on the same atom are included in the indo method . the method is now rarely used in its original form . but it is the basis for several other methods , such as mindo , zindo and sindo . other pages . - computational chemistry
