Euclid's Elements    euclid 's elements euclid 's `` elements '' ( sometimes : `` the elements '' , greek : `` stoicheia '' ) is a large set of math books about geometry , written by the ancient greek mathematician known as euclid ( c.325 bcâ€“265 bc ) in alexandria ( egypt ) circa 300 bc . the set has 13 volumes , or sections , and has been printed often as 13 physical books ( numbered i-xiii ) , rather than one large book . it has been translated into latin , with the title `` euclidis elementorum '' . it is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times . euclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time . his `` elements '' is the main source of ancient geometry . textbooks based on euclid have been used up to the present day . in the book , he starts out from a small set of axioms ( that is , a group of things that everyone thinks are true ) . euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers , based on those axioms . the `` elements '' also includes works on perspective , conic sections , spherical geometry , and possibly quadric surfaces . apart from geometry , the work also includes number theory . euclid came up with the idea of `` greatest common divisors '' . they were in his `` elements '' . the greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers .
