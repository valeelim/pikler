Palate     the palate is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals . it separates the oral cavity ( mouth ) from the nasal cavity . a similar structure is found in crocodilia , but , in most other tetrapods , the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate . the palate is divided into two parts , the anterior bony hard palate , and the posterior fleshy soft palate or velum . the hard palate is formed before birth . if the fusion is not complete , it is called a cleft palate . this is a birth or congenital defect . as the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of taste , `` palate '' can also refer to this sense itself , as in the phrase `` a discriminating palate '' . by further extension , the flavour of a food ( particularly beer or wine ) may be called its palate .
