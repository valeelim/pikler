SN1 reaction     the s1 reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry . `` s '' stands for nucleophilic substitution and the `` 1 '' represents the fact that the rate-determining step involves only one molecule ( unimolecular ) . the reaction involves a carbocation intermediate . some common s1 reactions are of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or , under strongly acidic conditions , with secondary or tertiary alcohols . with primary alkyl halides , the alternative s2 reaction occurs . among inorganic chemists , the s1 reaction is often known as the `` dissociative mechanism '' . christopher ingold et al . first proposed the reaction mechanism in 1940. an example of a reaction taking place with an s1 reaction mechanism is the hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide with water to form tert-butyl alcohol : this s1 reaction takes place in three steps : - formation of a tert-butyl carbocation by separation of a leaving group ( a bromide anion ) from the carbon atom ; this step is slow and reversible .
