Rayon     rayon is a manufactured reconstituted cellulose fiber . it is made from purified cellulose . this is mainly from wood pulp , which is chemically changed into a soluble compound . it is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments . these are chemically solidified , resulting in man-made fibres of nearly pure cellulose . because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers , it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber . < br >
