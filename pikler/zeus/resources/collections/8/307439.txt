Cephalocarida     cephalocarida is a class inside the subphylum crustacea that has only twelve shrimp-like benthic species . they were discovered in 1955 , and are commonly referred to as horseshoe shrimps . all cephalocaridans are in just one family : hutchinsoniellidae . even though there is no fossil record of cephalocaridans , most specialists believe them to be basal ( primitive ) among crustaceans . these crustaceans are from in length , with a long body . they have no eyes , and live in a muddy natural habitat . the structural and functional similarity between the maxillae and the legs may be a sign of primitive organization ; the maxillae are not specialized , as they are in other crustaceans . the thorax consists of 10 segments , and the abdomen bears a telson but no other appendages . cephalocaridans are found from the intertidal zone down to a depth of 1500 metres , in all kinds of sediments . they feed on marine detritus . to bring in food particles , they make water currents with the thoracic appendages like the branchiopods and the malacostracans . food particles are passed forward along a ventral groove , leading to the mouthparts .
