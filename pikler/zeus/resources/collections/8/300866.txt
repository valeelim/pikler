Food Power     in politics , the use of agriculture or agricultural products to influence the outcome of decisions is called food power . several nations with crude oil have organised themselves and founded a cartel called opec . through this cartel , they can fix the price at which they will sell oil . food power works in much the same way . nations usually do what is best for their citizens , who usually want food . food power is part of food politics . embargoes can also be used to put pressure on a nation . in order for a nation to make use of food power effectively , the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity , supply concentration , demand dispersion , and action independence . the four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the united states , canada , australia , and new zealand . the u.s. does appear to use food power for punishment . some african countries have used food power in internal conflicts on a smaller scale .
