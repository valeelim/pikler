Segmentation     segmentation in biology means the division of some animal and plant bodies into a series of repeat sections or parts . it is common in some of the most successful groups of animals , such as arthropods , vertebrates and annelid worms . segmentation of the body allows different regions of the body to develop for different uses . we now know a good deal about how the development of segmented animals is controlled . in a series of experiments with the fruit-fly `` drosophila '' , e.b . lewis was able to identify a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes . the latter then activate or repress cell processes which direct the final development of the organism . furthermore , the sequence of these control genes show `` co-linearity '' : the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the body . not only that , but this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms .
