Adsorption     adsorption is the sticking of atoms or molecules to a surface ( called `` adsorbent '' ) . the particles which get stuck on can be from a gas , liquid or a dissolved solid . an example would be the way water sticks to the surface of sand grains on a beach , or to particles of soil . the exact nature of the force which holds them on varies according to the nature of the surface and the adsorbed molecules . the force may be a weak physical force , or weak chemical bonds , but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on . supplying more heat usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate . only `` free water '' ( that is not trapped inside solid particles ) can evaporate .
