Candidatus     candidatus is a term in the taxonomy ( scientific classification ) of bacteria . it is a label put before the name of a bacterium which can not be grown on an agar plate or in any other bacteriology culture . an example would be `` '' candidatus '' phytoplasma allocasuarinae '' . candidatus status may be used when a species or genus is well studied but can not be cultured . nowadays much information is got by 16s ribosomal rna sequence analysis . for correct publication of a species , bacteria must be isolated , cultured , described , and deposited in a bacteriology culture collection . however , some bacteria require special tissue culture conditions and can not be maintained in bacteriology culture collections . this includes bacteria which live inside other organisms or cells . these include obligately intracellular pathogens and endosymbionts , insect symbionts , and populations from oceans or sludge . in 1994 , murray and schleifer published a taxonomic note . they recommended that the new category of indefinite rank ( candidatus ) be established for certain putative taxa that could not be described in sufficient detail to warrant establishment of a new taxon . it was also recommended that a candidatus list should be established in the `` international journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology '' .
