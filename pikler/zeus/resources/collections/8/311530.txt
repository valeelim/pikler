Sound check     a soundcheck is an activity that takes place a couple hours before a concert . the performer and the sound crew run through a short song to make sure that the sound in the venue is clear and at the right volume and tonal frequencies . soundchecks are especially important for popular and other musical genres that use heavily-amplified pa systems ; having correct sound is very important to the success of such events . a soundcheck remains part art and not all science , however , because the acoustics of a venue often change somewhat once it is filled with an audience . artists who change their set list during the course of a concert tour often use soundchecks as a rehearsal opportunity to try out new material or revive old material , before possibly introducing such material into the concert proper .
