MTR Corporation Limited     on 5 october 2000 the operator of the mtr network , mtr corporation limited , became hong kong 's first privatised rail and metro company , which marked the start of the hong kong government 's planned initiative to wind down its interests in various public utilities . prior to its listing on the hong kong stock exchange , the mass transit railway coporation was wholly owned by the hong kong government . the offering involved the sale of around one billion shares , and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in hong kong . in june , 2001 , mtr corporation limited was transferred to hang seng index . mtr corporation limited has always been reliant on developing properties next to railway stations for its profits ( although the rail lines are profitable themselves ) ; many recently built stations are incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes . examples of this type of construction can be seen at tsing yi station , which is built next to the maritime square shopping centre , and directly underneath the tierra verde housing estate .
