Barnard's star    barnard 's star barnard 's star , also known as `` barnard 's runaway star '' , is a very low-mass red dwarf star approximately six light-years away from earth in the constellation of ophiuchus ( the snake-holder ) . it is very old , and moving relatively fast . in 1916 , the american astronomer e. e. barnard measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year . this is the largest-known proper motion of any star relative to the sun . at a distance of about 1.8 parsecs from the solar system , or just under six light-years , barnard 's star is the nearest known star in the constellation ophiuchus , and the fourth-closest known individual star to the sun , after the three components of the alpha centauri system . despite its proximity , barnard 's star , at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine , is not visible with the unaided eye ; however , it is much brighter in infrared light than it is in visible light . barnard 's star has been the subject of much study , and it has probably received more attention from astronomers than any other class m dwarf star due to its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator . barnard 's star is also notable as the target for project daedalus , a study on the possibility of fast , unmanned travel to nearby star systems .
