Basal ganglia     the basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) are three areas under the cerebral cortex . they are part of the cerebrum ( forebrain ) , and connected to the midbrain and the thalamus . they are vital to movement , and damage here results in damaged ability to move . the three areas are : 1. striatum 1. caudate nucleus 1. putamen 1. pallidum ( or globus pallidus ) 1. substantia nigra 1. nucleus accubens 1. subthalamic nucleus the range of behaviours controlled by the nuclei is wide . they control eye movements . they do voluntary motor control , learning procedures for routine behaviors or `` habits '' , and cognitive emotional functions . the basal ganglia also control motivation . they select actions , that is , the choice of what to do at a given time . experimental studies show that the basal ganglia inhibit ( suppress ) a number of motor systems . a release of this inhibition lets a motor system act . this `` behaviour switching '' is influenced by signals from many parts of the brain , including the prefrontal cortex , which plays a key role in doing things .
