M25 motorway     the m25 motorway , or london orbital , is a orbital motorway around greater london . the motorway was first suggested early in the 20th century , and a few sections were built in the early 1970s . the m25 was completed in 1986 : is one of the world 's longest orbital roads . it is one of the busiest and most congested parts of the british motorway network . 196,000 vehicles were recorded in a single day near london heathrow airport . the m25 is a cruclial link between the four main london airports : heathrow , gatwick , stansted and luton . bearing in mind that no motorways go through the centre of london , the m25 is a main route connecting north with south , and east with the west of england . the motorway was originally built with only six lanes ( three each way ) , despite research which suggested eight lanes were necessary . now a fourth lane exists over most of the motorway , and more in special sections ( see diagram ) . plans were scaled back in 2009 in response to rising costs , but work is still going on .
