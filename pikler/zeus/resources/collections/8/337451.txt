Agdistis     in anatolian , greek and roman mythology , agdistis was a hermaphroditic being , and symbolized the wild and uncontrolled powers of nature . she is the personification of a mountain of the same name in phrygia . she was born after zeus accidentally impregnated the earth goddess gaia . the gods feared agdistis because she held all the powers of creation within her body . dionysus tricked her into castrating herself , and from then on she was known as the goddess cybele . the blood from her severed gentials fertilized the earth , and from that spot an almond tree grew . one day the nymph nana picked an almond from the tree , and held it against her chest , the almond vanished and she became pregnant with attis . some ancient writers say agdistis is the same as cybele , and worshiped under that name . in many ancient inscriptions , agdistis is clearly separate from cybele , but in many others she is listed as an epithet of cybele . although primarily an anatolian goddess , the cult of agdistis covered a lot of territory . by 250 bc it had spread to egypt , and later to attica , rhamnus around 80 bc ( where there was a sanctuary of agdistis ) , and later in lesbos and panticapeum .
