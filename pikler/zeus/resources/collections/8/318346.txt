Mucous membrane     the mucous membranes ( or mucosae ; singular mucosa ) are skin-like linings . they are covered in epithelium . they do secretion , and in the alimentary canal they also do absorption . they line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs . at several places they connect up ( are contiguous ) with the skin . for example , at the nostrils , the mouth , the lips , the eyelids , the ears , the genital area , and the anus . unlike skin ( which has hair growing out of it ) , mucous membranes are hairless . the sticky , thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called `` mucous '' . the term `` mucous membrane '' refers to where they are found in the body . however , not every mucous membrane secretes mucous .
