Battersea Bridge     battersea bridge is a cast-iron and granite five-span cantilever bridge crossing the river thames in london , england . it is on a sharp bend in the river , and links battersea south of the river with chelsea to the north . the first battersea bridge was a toll bridge . although a stone bridge was planned , a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead . designed by henry holland , it was opened to pedestrians in november 1771 , and to vehicles in 1772. the bridge was poorly designed . iy was dangerous to its users and to passing shipping . boats often collided with it . to reduce the dangers to shipping , two piers were removed , and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders . although dangerous and unpopular , the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge across the thames in london . it was the subject of paintings by turner , cotman and whistler . in 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership , and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge , designed by joseph bazalgette . it is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the thames in london , and one of london 's least busy thames bridges . the position on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping , and it has been closed many times due to collisions .
