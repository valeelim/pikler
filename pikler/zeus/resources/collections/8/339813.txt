Scientific revolution     the scientific revolution was a time ( 1550-1700 ) following the middle ages and the renaissance when many discoveries were made . during this time , new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought ; they also forced people to think differently , and started what is called science today . this period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century . the era was jump-started by galileo galilei when he disproved aristotle with his new theory of gravity . one of his students said he dropped two balls of iron ( one weighing one pound , the other a hundred ) off the leaning tower of pisa . the objects fell at the same rate which brought about new methods of thinking in that time period . in 1542 , nicolaus copernicus published his work `` on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres '' , in which he said that not the earth , but the sun was at the center of the universe . this theory is known as heliocentrism today . in the same year , andreas vesalius pubilshed his work `` on the structure of the human body '' . this book is about the anatomy of the human body .
