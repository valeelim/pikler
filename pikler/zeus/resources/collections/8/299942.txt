Gene duplication     gene duplication ( or gene amplification ) is any duplication of a region of dna that contains a gene . gene duplication is important in supplying raw genetic material – new genes – to biological evolution . this has been recognized since the 1930s . recent genomic sequence data show that duplicated genes are common in all organisms surveyed . in classical genetics it may occur as an error in crossing-over during meiosis , or the duplication of an entire chromosome . in non-classical genetics it may happen by a retrotransposition event . the second copy of the gene is often relatively free from selective pressure . mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism . thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene , over generations . a duplication is the opposite of a deletion . duplications arise from unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes . the product of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion .
