Ironbridge Gorge     the ironbridge gorge is a deep gorge formed by the river severn in shropshire , england . the area was originally called the severn gorge . the area was made a world heritage site by unesco , because the industrial revolution started round here in the mid-1700s . ironbridge gorge has mines , factories , workers ' housing , and the transport infrastructure that was created in the gorge during the industrial revolution . coke production in the area helped start the industrial revolution . the iron bridge was the world 's first bridge built from iron . the gorge takes its name from its famous `` iron bridge '' , the first iron bridge of its kind in the world . it is a monument to the industry that began there . the bridge was built in 1779 to link the industrial town of broseley with the smaller mining town of madeley and the growing industrial centre of coalbrookdale . the iron bridge was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron . a material which was previously far too expensive to use for large structures . however , a new blast furnace nearby lowered the cost . this encouraged local engineers and architects to solve a long-standing problem of a crossing over the river .
