Sick building syndrome     sick building syndrome ( sbs ) is a combination of illnesses ( a syndrome ) associated with a human 's place of work ( office building ) or dwelling . a 1984 world health organization report into suggested up to 30 % of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of sbs . most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality . sbs can be caused by flaws in the heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems . other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials , volatile organic compounds ( voc ) , molds ( see mold health issues ) , improper exhaust ventilation of ozone ( byproduct of some office machinery ) , using light industrial chemicals in the building , or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration ( see minimum efficiency reporting value ) . people try to fix sbs symptoms by increasing the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange between the building 's air and the outside air . but the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the sbs sources in the first place . janitors should minimize the ongoing use of voc cleaning compounds , and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic , potentially-deadly mold growth .
