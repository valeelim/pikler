Croup     croup ( or laryngotracheobronchitis ) is caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat . this swelling causes problems with normal breathing . people with croup can have a `` barking '' cough , stridor ( a high-pitched wheezing sound ) , and hoarseness . croup symptoms often get worse at night . taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition . sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases . hospitalization is rarely required . doctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities ( for example , an airway foreign body ) . blood tests , x-rays , and cultures are not needed . croup is common . about 15 % of children between 6 months and 5â€“6 years old get croup . teenagers and adults rarely get croup . croup symptoms include a `` barking '' cough , stridor ( a high pitched sound typically when breathing in ) , hoarseness , and difficult breathing that are worse at night . the `` barking '' cough can sound like a seal or sea lion . crying can make the wheezing worse ; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed . as croup gets worse , the wheezing can decrease .
