Telomerase     telomerase is an rna protein which is an enzyme . it adds dna sequence repeats ( `` ttaggg '' in all vertebrates ) to the end of dna strands in the telomere regions . the telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes . they are a region of repeated nucleotides containing noncoding dna . telomeres are destroyed during cell division , and are remade by the enzyme telomerase . the function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important dna from chromosome ends . every time the chromosome is copied 100â€“200 meaningless nucleotides are lost , which causes no damage to the organism 's dna . so , the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle , and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase . telomerases carry their own rna molecule , which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres . the existence of a compensatory mechanism ( a 'fix ' ) for telomere shortening was first predicted by soviet biologist alexey olovnikov in 1973. he also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere 's connections to cancer .
