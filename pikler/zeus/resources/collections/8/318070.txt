Monsanto process     the monsanto process is a way of making acetic acid . it uses a catalyst to add a carbonyl group to methanol . this process operates at a pressure of 30–60 atm and a temperature of 150–200 °c . it gives a selectivity greater than 99 % . it was developed 1960 by german chemists working at basf . chemists at monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966. today , chemists make acetic acid by the cativa process , a similar iridium-based process developed by bp chemicals ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly . so , the monsanto process is not used very much in industry . the process has several steps , which repeat to remake the catalyst : the catalytically active species is the anion cis- [ rh ( co ) i ] ( 1 ) . the catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps , two of which do not involve rhodium : conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid . ( these steps are in the middle of the above diagram . ) the first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to `` cis '' - [ rh ( co ) i ] to form the hexacoordinate species [ ( ch ) rh ( co ) i ] ( 2 ) . this anion rapidly transforms , by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand , affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [ ( chco ) rh ( co ) i ] ( 3 ) . this five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex . ( 4 ) this decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide ( chcoi ) and regenerate the active form of the catalyst . acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid .
