Above mean sea level     the term above mean sea level ( amsl ) is the elevation or altitude of any object , relative to the average sea level . for example , an ocean beach would be at 0 amsl . amsl is used in radio ( both in broadcasting and other telecommunications uses ) by engineers to determine the coverage area a station will be able to reach . it is also used in aviation , where most heights are recorded and reported in amsl ( see flight level ) , and in the atmospheric sciences . a `` mean sea level '' is imaginary . it is not possible to know the average sea level for the entire planet . the sea level also changes over time when measured in the same place . the sea moves , high and low pressure zones affect the height , tides change the sea level , and local difference in gravity all affect the sea level . people can only pick a spot and calculate the mean sea level at that point and use it as a datum . for example , the british ordnance survey uses a datum based on the measurements of mean sea level at a gauge at newlyn , cornwall from 1915 to 1921 for their maps of great britain . this datum is actually about 80 cm different from the mean sea level reading on the other side of the country . an alternative is to base height measurements on an ellipsoid of the entire earth . gps and other satellite systems do this . in aviation , the ellipsoid known as world geodetic system 84 is increasingly used to define mean sea level . another alternative is to use a geoid based datum such as navd88 .
