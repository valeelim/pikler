Gulf of Tonkin resolution     the gulf of tonkin resolution ( august 1964 ) was a joint resolution by the united states congress for the united states to begin the vietnam war . for a decade the cia had been sending in south vietnamese teams on sabotage missions to the north . american ships such as the `` maddox '' went on espionage missions in the north 's coastal waters . u.s. president johnson claimed that the north vietnamese had made two attacks on the `` maddox '' and the `` turner joy '' in the gulf of tonkin . on the 4th of august he asked for congressional support to return the attacks . the government had written up a resolution in june 1964. believing that the lives of american sailors were in danger from the north vietnamese , congress willingly passed the resolution . the resolution gave the president the power to start war in vietnam . as johnson said , it was `` like grandma 's night shirt - it covered everything '' . the resolution would end when the president believed that the situation in southeast asia was safe or when congress decided to terminate it . senator mansfield was unconvinced that the u.s. was acting correctly .
