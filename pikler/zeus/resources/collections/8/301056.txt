Nguni languages     the nguni languages are a group of bantu languages spoken by the nguni people . these languages are spoken in southern africa , mostly in south africa , swaziland , and zimbabwe . nguni languages include xhosa , zulu , swati , hlubi , phuthi and ndebele ( both southern ndebele and northern ndebele ) . the name `` nguni '' comes from the cow breed called `` nguni cattle '' . the word `` nguni '' is sometimes used to mean all speakers of nguni languages as a group . this is an incorrect use of the word , since many different tribes speak these languages . the nguni languages are a sub-group of the southern bantu languages . these languages exist in a relatively small geographic area . the languages are closely related and sound very much alike . many times the different languages are mutually intelligible -- that is , someone who speaks one nguni language can understand someone speaking a different nguni language . linguists and other researchers split the nguni languages into two smaller groups : `` zunda nguni '' and `` tekela nguni '' .
