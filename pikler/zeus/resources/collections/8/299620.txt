Asteridae     asteridae is a linnaean term with the rank of subclass . by definition it always includes the family asteraceae ( compositae ) . however , in the modern apg iii system of classification , asterid and euasterid are names for clades . their member families are similar to those of the asteridae . one of the better-known systems that recognized subclass asteridae was the cronquist system , which included the orders : - gentianales - solanales - lamiales - callitrichales - plantaginales - scrophulariales - campanulales - rubiales - dipsacales - calycerales - asterales most of the above orders as defined by cronquist have been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies .
