Banded iron formation     banded iron formations ( or bifs ) are a distinctive type of rock often found in ( precambrian ) sedimentary rocks . they consist of repeated thin layers of iron oxides , either magnetite ( feo ) or hematite ( feo ) , alternating with bands of iron-poor shale and chert . some of the oldest known rock formations , formed over 3,700 million years ago ( mya ) , include banded iron layers . the banded layers are a common feature in sediments for much of the earth 's early history . the formations are abundant around the time of the great oxygenation event , 2,400 mya . they become less common after 1,800 mya . the total amount of oxygen locked up in the banded iron beds is estimated to be perhaps twenty times the volume of oxygen present in the modern atmosphere of earth . banded iron beds are an important commercial source of iron ore , such as the pilbara region of western australia and the animikie group in minnesota . the conventional concept is that the `` banded iron '' layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria . this combined with dissolved iron in earth 's oceans to form insoluble iron oxides . these precipitated out , forming a thin layer on the substrate , which may have been anoxic mud ( forming shale and chert ) . each band is similar to a varve : the banding is assumed to result from cyclic variations in available oxygen .
