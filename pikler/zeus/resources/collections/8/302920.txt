Shingle beach     a shingle beach is a beach which is formed of pebbles . these beaches strongly resist erosion by waves . this beach landform is quite common in western europe , because the pebbles come from the lines of flint in the chalk . chesil bank is an example . when the chalk erodes , the tough flint stays as pebbles . other examples are found in bahrain , north america and in a number of other world regions . on the east coast of new zealand 's south island , there are mixed shingle and sand fans amongst braided rivers . the ecosystems formed by this mix of pebbles and sand allow colonization by rare and endangered species .
