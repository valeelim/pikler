Myxozoa     the myxozoa are a group of parasitic animals of aquatic environments . over 1300 species have been described and many have a two-host life cycle , involving a fish and an annelid worm or bryozoan . they were once considered as parasitic protozoa , but are now known to be members of the phylum cnidaria . analysis of 50 coding genes from `` buddenbrockia '' showed the myxozoa were severely modified members of the cnidaria . similarities between myxozoan 'polar capsules ' and cnidarian nematocysts ( stinging cells ) had been known for a long time , but previously were thought to be the result of convergent evolution .
