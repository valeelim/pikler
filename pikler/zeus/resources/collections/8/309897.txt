GFCI     a ground fault circuit interrupter ( gfci ) , also called ground fault interrupter ( gfi ) or residual current device ( rcd ) is a device that shuts off an electric power circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path , such as through water or a person . it is used to reduce the risk of electric shock , which can cause the heart to stop or cause burns . they can also prevent some fires , like when a live wire touches a metal conduit . a gfci works by measuring the current leaving one side of a power source ( the so-called `` live '' or `` hot wire '' ) , and comparing it to current returning on the other ( the `` neutral '' side ) . if they are not equal , then some of the current must be leaking in an unwanted way , and the gfci shuts the power off . after the problem is fixed , the device must be reset manually by pushing the reset button ( the red button in the image shown at right ) . if the problem is not fixed , the gfci will keep shutting off . there is also a test button next to the reset button , which shows that the gfci works properly . gfci outlets should be tested at least once a month .
