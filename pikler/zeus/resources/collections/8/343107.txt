Rhetorical question     a rhetorical question is a figure of speech in the form of a question . it is a question that is asked in order to make a point : it does not need a reply . the question is used as a rhetorical device or tool . the question is posed for the sake of persuasion , or to encourage the listener or reader to consider a message or viewpoint . rhetorical questions suggest a dialogue which does not really exist . the speaker both asks and answers the question himself . a rhetorical question is often a statement in the form of a question . for example , in `` ca n't you do `` anything '' right ? `` , the words are not intended to start an investigation or to invite any response at all . what the words actually mean could change according to circumstance . it could be a little joke between friends , or it could be an insulting criticism . generally , it would be taken to mean `` you ca n't seem to do anything right '' . the role of context is always important if someone asks `` what does that mean '' . consider this question : `` do you think this treatment is just ? '' . there is no way of knowing whether this is a genuine question or not , because we do not know what the circumstances are . this is true of many kinds of communication , that what they mean varies according to circumstance .
