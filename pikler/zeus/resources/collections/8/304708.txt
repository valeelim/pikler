Remora     remora sometimes called a suckerfish or sharksucker , is an elongated , brown fish in the order perciformes and family echeneidae . they are small fish that live on and around sharks . they eat stray bits of food left by the shark and tiny shrimp-like parasites that live on the shark 's skin . they have sucker-like disks on their heads with which they attach to the shark . both the shark and the remora benefit from the pairing , but the remore benefits much more ; this is commensalism . remora are also known as sucker fish or shark sucker .
