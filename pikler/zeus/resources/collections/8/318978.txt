Staurikosaurus     staurikosaurus is a genus of upper triassic theropod dinosaurs found in brazil . it was a small , lightly built carnivore . the rarity of `` staurikosaurus '' remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive , or because it lived in an environment such as a forest , where fossils rarely form . at just , 80 centimetres tall ( 31 in ) , and weighing just 30 kilograms ( 66 lb ) , `` staurikosaurus '' was tiny in comparison to later theropods like `` megalosaurus '' . `` staurikosaurus '' and the related `` herrerasaurus '' are definitely theropods and evolved after the sauropod line had split from the theropods . the fossil record of `` staurikosaurus '' is poor , but the skeletal structure of the legs is known . `` staurikosaurus '' was a quick runner for its size . it also had just two vertebrae joining the pelvis to the spine , a distinctly primitive arrangement . the available teeth for staurikosaurus strongly suggest a carnivorous diet . the tail of `` staurikosaurus '' was relatively long ( with more than 40 vertebrae ) compared to the rest of its body and was held straight and off the ground as it ran . the rear part of `` staurikosauruss tail is stiffened by features of the tail vertebrae . ostrom thought this was a dynamic stabilizer to help balance while leaping and running .
