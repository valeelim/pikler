Vestigial organ     vestigial organs are organs of the body which are smaller and simpler than those in related species . they have lost , or almost lost their original function . vestigiality is evidence for evolution , since they only make sense if evolution has occurred . they were one of the puzzles of pre-darwinian natural history . the puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations , in the ancestors of present-day animals . they occur in animals ( and plants ) which have changed their style of life from their ancestors . thus snakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed . but one type of snake – the boas – have vestigial rear legs and pelvis . the human vermiform appendix is another example . that was much larger , and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls . leaves are the main diet of apes , but they are not a main part of man 's diet . cellulose can not be digested by our species . an unused organ usually degenerates , and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether . thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colour . mutations pile up . all structures need energy for their development , maintenance , and weight . this , and the risk of disease in the part ( e.g. , infection , cancer ) , provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organism 's fitness .
