Fermionic condensate     a fermionic condensate , or fermi condensate , is a state of matter ( superfluid phase ) which is very similar to the bose–einstein condensate . superfluids are also bose-einstein condensates . the only difference is that bose-einstein condensates are made up of bosons , and are social with each other ( in groups , or clumps ) . fermi condensates are anti-social ( they do n't attract each other at all ) . this has to be done artificially . this state of matter was made in december 2003 by deborah jin and her group . jin worked for the national institute of standards and technology at the university of colorado . her team created this state of matter by cooling a cloud of potassium-40 atoms to less than a millionth°c over absolute zero ( -273.15°c , this is the hypothetical lowest limit of physical temperatures ) . this is the same temperature required to cool matter to a bose–einstein condensate . the process of cooling a gas into a condensate is called condensation . bosons and fermions are subatomic particles ( bits of matter smaller than an atom ) . the difference between a boson and a fermion is the number of the atom 's electrons , neutrons and/or protons . an atom is composed of bosons if it has an even number of electrons . an atom is composed of fermions if it has an odd number of electrons , neutrons and protons . an example of a boson would be a gluon . an example of a fermion would be potassium-40 , which is what deborah jin used as the gas cloud . bosons are can form clumps and are attracted to each other , whereas fermions do not form clumps . fermions are usually found in straight strings because they repel each other . this is so , because fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle , which states that they can not gather together in the same quantum state .
