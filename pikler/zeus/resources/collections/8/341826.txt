Sphere packing     in geometry , sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange spheres in space . very often , the spheres all have the same size , and the space used is usually three-dimensional euclidean space . the problem is part of packing problems . when it is generalised , not all the spheres need to have the same size , and spaces can be n-dimensional euclidean space , or hyperbolic space . a typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible . the proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement . as the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured , the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density , measured over a large enough volume .
