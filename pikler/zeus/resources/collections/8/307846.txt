Feathered dinosaur     a feathered dinosaur is a dinosaur with feathers . it is now thought that all coelurosaurs , and perhaps all theropods , had feathers . the possibility that dinosaurs are closely related to birds raised the possibility of feathers . fossils of `` archaeopteryx '' include well-preserved feathers , but it was not until the early 1990s that clearly non-bird dinosaur fossils were discovered with preserved feathers . about 40 genera of theropods are now known to be feathered . most of these fossils come from the yixian formation in china . the fossil feathers of one specimen , `` shuvuuia deserti '' , have been tested positive for beta-keratin in immunological tests . this is the main protein in bird feathers . after a century without clear evidence , well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs were discovered during the 1990s , and more continue to be found . the fossils were preserved in a lagerstätte — a sedimentary deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils — in liaoning , china .
