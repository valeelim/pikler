Dynamical systems theory     dynamical systems theory is a field of applied mathematics . it tries to describe complex dynamical systems , often using differential equations and difference equations . when differential equations are used , the theory is called `` continuous '' dynamical systems theory . when difference equations are used , it is called `` discrete '' dynamical systems theory . the theory looks at the long-term behaviour of dynamical systems . it also studies solutions to the equations of motion , mainly for mechanical systems . the study also includes the motion of planets , or electronic circuits . part of it focuses on solving partial differential equations that occur in biology .
