Aerogel     aerogel is a gel in which the liquid part has been replaced with a gas ( usually air ) . it was invented in 1931 by samuel stephens kistler . the most common type of aerogel is silica aerogel , which is made from the same molecule as glass . it is a solid material that is almost as light as air . it is the world 's lightest material . its melting point is 1200 degrees celsius , which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos . aerogel is the best thermal insulator available and can be used in construction in place of fiberglass insulation . it allows better insulation with less material , although it is much more expensive than fiberglass . it is also brittle , making it more difficult to install than fiberglass . most aerogel is not water-resistant , and even small amounts of water can destroy it . it is also safer than fiberglass or asbestos because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs . some aerogel insulation , however , contains fiberglass to increase its flexibility .
