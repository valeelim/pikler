Chelation     chelation refers to the bonding of elemental atoms that can not normally be bonded . for example , sodium is a metal element that can bond with many other elements , like chlorine ( forming common table salt : nacl ) , or hydrogen and oxygen ( sodium hydroxide ) . the reason for this is that the way that atoms bond with each other is similar to a jigsaw puzzle : only the proper shape can fit into the empty space made by the other pieces . however , with atoms , it 's a bit different . for each element , the atom carries a certain number of electrons in orbit around its nucleus . sometimes these orbits are split into levels , and only a certain number of electrons can fill each orbit before moving to a higher orbit . sometimes , an orbit level is not filled all the way and can only be filled with electrons from another element with a smaller number of electrons in a higher level . when the atoms bond together , the electrons are traded between the two equally and create a very strong bond . however , there are a few elements that can not bond with many other elements , because they have orbits that are already filled , or nearly filled , equally . ( like a finished jigsaw puzzle ) these elements can sometimes be poisonous to a human , and can not be removed easily ( for example , mercury . ) chelation enables a non-bonding element to bond , thereby enabling removal .
