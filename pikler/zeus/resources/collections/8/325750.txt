Chromosome inversion     an inversion is a chromosome rearrangement in which a segment of a chromosome is reversed end to end . an inversion is when the chromosome breaks at two points in a chromosome ( or at the end ) and does a 180 degree flip . the genes inside the inversion are in the reverse of the original order . what matters is whether the inversion interferes with crossing-over during meiosis . meiosis is the type of cell division which produces sex cells ( gametes ) . if both chromosomes of a pair have the same inversion , and there is no extra or missing genes , then there is no problem with meiosis . when the homologous chromosomes pair in prophase i of meiosis , the genes on the chromosomes pair up . the only way this can happen after an inversion is if the homologous pairs form a loop . if a cross-over occurs within this inversion loop , it can lead to loss or gain of dna . for this reason , people with inversions in their germ cells often have lower fertility . this is because the gametes are damaged .
