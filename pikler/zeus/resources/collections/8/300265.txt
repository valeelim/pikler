Independent sources     the term `` multiple independent sources '' in journalism , criminal justice , science and general research , are two or more unconnected people , organizations , or objects which provide a given set of information or samples . for example , two separate people who see a traffic accident , at the spot , could be considered independent sources . however , if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it , then they would not be `` independent '' , since one would `` depend '' on the other for their information . also , if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story , then they are also no longer independent . as another example , two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data , unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply ( or similar factors ) . consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception , as any divergences or contradictions between statements , or data samples , would likely indicate one of these .
