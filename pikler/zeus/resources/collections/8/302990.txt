Diene     in organic chemistry , a diene ( ) or diolefin ( ) is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon pi bonds . conjugated dienes are functional groups , with a general formula of ch . dienes and alkynes are functional isomers . dienes occur occasionally in nature but are widely used in the polymer industry . dienes can be divided into three classes , depending on the relative location of the double bonds : 1. cumulated dienes have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called allenes . 1. conjugated dienes have conjugated double bonds separated by one single bond . 1. unconjugated dienes have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds . they are usually less stable than isomeric conjugated dienes . compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes . polyenes and dienes , share many of their properties . an important reaction for conjugated dienes is the diels–alder reaction . many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of natural products , e.g . danishefsky ’ s diene .
