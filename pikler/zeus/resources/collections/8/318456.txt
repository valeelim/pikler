Sikhae     sikhae is a salted fermented food with grains in korean cuisine as one of jeotgal . `` sikhae '' is made with various fish , such as flat fish , shellfish , pollack , squid and fish intestines , and cooked grains , such as rice , glutinous rice , glutinous foxtail millet and nonglutinous millet . `` sikhae '' is less salty than jeotgal because most jeotgal is made with seafood and salt , but `` sikhae '' is made with not only the ingredients of jeotgal but also grains , shredded radish , etc . therefore , `` sikhae '' is stored for short-term , while jeotgal is able to be stored for rather long-term because of the large amount of salt . the types of `` sikhae '' can be different , depending on the main ingredients , regions , what the family and the person like . in past times , because of the limited transportation , regions near the sea had more types of `` sikhae '' compared to the inland areas . koreans usually eat this food as a banchan ( small dishes of food ) . `` sikhae '' was not included in any literature before the early part of the korean joseon dynasty . however , that does n't mean there was not `` sikhae '' and rather it guesses that `` sikhae '' was not written down . after the middle of joseon dynasty , `` sikhae '' have been mentioned in literature .
