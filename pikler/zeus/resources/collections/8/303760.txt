Rotavirus     rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhoea . most of the time only children who are younger than five years old get the disease . the signs of the disease are severe diarrhoea and vomiting , which start suddenly and last for two or three days . rotavirus also causes diarrhoea in animals . a vaccine , which prevents children from getting the disease is available in many countries . like most viruses , rotaviruses are made from rna and protein . the rna carries the genes that are used to make more rotaviruses . they are called rotaviruses because they sometimes look like little wheels and `` rota '' is the latin word for `` wheel '' . rotaviruses get into the body through the mouth and are not present in the air like the viruses that cause colds . the disease is most often spread by dirty hands and things used for cooking , but the viruses can contaminate water . rotaviruses are very small . they are a lot smaller than bacteria and can only be seen using an electron microscope . children who have not been vaccinated usually get infected more than once . but when children are about five years old they are usually immune and can not get it any more . this is because their bodies have become resistant to the viruses .
