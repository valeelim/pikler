Order of succession     the order of succession is an ordered sequence of people and events in order ; and it may mean the passing of royal or other powers . the `` order of succession '' may be used in a historical way , such as a list of former leaders . also , the phrase may mean the pre-planned process through which a leader takes over from another because of death , resignation , or removal succession becomes a chronology which has developed during time which has passed—like a list of popes or list of emperors of japan . succession histories are unique , but not always obvious . for example , charles ix of sweden ( 1604–1611 ) was only the third swedish king named charles . pope francis is the 266th pope of the roman catholic church . saint peter is listed as the first of 266 popes . across the span of centuries , there have been problems with the list and order of succession after st. peter . for example : during the western schism in the 14th century , there was more than one pope at the same time . each had notable international support . only some are included on the chronology of today 's list .
