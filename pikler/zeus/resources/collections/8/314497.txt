Cochlea     the cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear . it is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth , making 2.5 turns around its axis . a core component of the cochlea is the organ of corti , the sensory organ of hearing , which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea . the name is from the greek κοχλίας `` kokhlias '' ( `` snail , screw '' ) , from κόχλος `` kokhlos '' ( `` spiral shell '' ) . this is in reference to its coiled shape : the cochlea is coiled in most mammals , monotremes being the exceptions .
