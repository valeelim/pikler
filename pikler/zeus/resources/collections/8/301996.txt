Antivenom     an antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom . ( a venom is a poison released by a snake or insect . ) frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time . the horse 's body will develop an immunity to the venom , so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day . after the horse is immune , its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune . that part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras . there are antivenoms for the very large and very dangerous funnel-web spiders found in australia , and for the widow spiders ( such as the black widow ) found all around the world .
