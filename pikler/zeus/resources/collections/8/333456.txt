List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska     the u.s. state of alaska is not in counties , as 48 other states are ( louisiana has parishes instead ) . it is in boroughs . many of the more densely populated parts of the state are in alaska 's eighteen organized boroughs , which are somewhat similar to counties in other states . unlike in the other 49 states , the organized boroughs do not cover all land of the state . the area not part of any organized borough is called the `` unorganized borough . '' for the 1970 census , the us and state made the unorganized borough into 11 census areas . each is roughly the same as an election district . however , these areas are solely for statistical analysis and presentation . they have no government of their own . boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the census bureau . some areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the alaska state government , usually law enforcement from the alaska state troopers and educational funding .
