Cheminformatics     cheminformatics ( also known as chemoinformatics and chemical informatics ) is the study of large amounts of chemical information . it is done mostly with the help of computers . these tools are used by pharmaceutical companies to discovery new drugs . cheminformatics uses computer science and information technology to help solve chemistry problems . cheminformatics deals with algorithms , databases and information systems , web technologies , artificial intelligence and soft computing , information and computation theory , software engineering , data mining , image processing , modeling and simulation , signal processing , discrete mathematics , control and system theory , circuit theory , and statistics , for generating new knowledge of chemistry . the term chemoinformatics was defined by f.k . brown in 1998 : cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry and computer science . cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for the paper , pulp and dye industries .
