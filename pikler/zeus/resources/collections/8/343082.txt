Falstaff (opera)    falstaff ( opera ) falstaff is an italian opera in three acts by giuseppe verdi , on a libretto by arrigo boito , based on william shakespeare 's `` the merry wives of windsor '' . it was first performed in milan , on february 9 , 1893. verdi 's last opera and perhaps greatest masterpiece , composed when he was 80 , and only his second comedy since his earlier attempt `` un giorno di regno '' in 1840. when verdi composed `` falstaff '' he was not writing it for a commission . he was just writing it for his own pleasure , without a performance in mind . when he had finished it he felt that it would be his last work and that his life ’ s work had finished . it was almost true . it was indeed his last opera and his last big work . when composers turn plays into operas they usually have to make some changes in the drama to make it suitable to be sung . verdi had already turned two other shakespeare plays into opera : `` otello '' and `` macbeth '' . when he composed these he worked with librettists to create something as close to shakespeare ’ s plays as possible , but when writing `` falstaff '' he took more freedom . the character of falstaff is very close to the way he is shown in shakespeare ’ s `` henry iv '' plays , rather than the falstaff of `` the merry wives of windsor '' .
