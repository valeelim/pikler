Cosmic dust     cosmic dust ( also known as star dust and space dust ) is a type of dust . it is very small crystals sent out from stars . it is formed when a star , such as the sun , sends out atoms . some of the atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons and becoming negatively and positively charged . these oppositely charged ions form an ionic bond , sticking together in tiny crystals , a few thousand nanometres across , to form cosmic dust . cosmic dust is split into further types of dust , based on the dust 's location . these types include intergalactic dust , which can be found between galaxies , interstellar dust , found between stars , circumplanetary dust , which can be found around planets and in planetary rings and interplanetary dust , which can be found between planets . the coming together of large amounts of dust over time leads to the creation of planets , the earth , for example .
