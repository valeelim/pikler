Operant conditioning     operant conditioning is a form of learning . in it , an individual changes its behaviour because of the consequences ( results ) of the behaviour . the person or animal learns its behaviour has a consequence . that consequence may be 1. reinforcement : a positive or rewarding event . this causes the behaviour to occur more often 1. punishment : a negative or punishing event . this causes the behaviour to occur less often 1. extinction : no event follows , so the behaviour has no consequences . when a behaviour has no consequences , it will occur less frequently . there are four different contexts in operant conditioning . here , the terms 'positive ' and 'negative ' are not used in their basic sense ; `` positive '' means that something is added , and negative means something is taken away : 1. positive reinforcement ' ( often just `` reinforcement '' ) occurs when there is a reward for a form of behaviour . this will increase the frequency at which the behaviour occurs . in the skinner box experiment , the reward is in the form of food when the rat presses a lever .
