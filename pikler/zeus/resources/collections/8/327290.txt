Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix     `` mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix '' is a mezzo-soprano aria from camille saint-saëns 's opera `` samson and delilah '' . it is known in english as `` softly awakes my heart '' , or `` my heart opens itself to your voice '' . it is sung by delilah in act 2 as she tries to get samson to reveal the secret of his great strength . in the opera , delilah is responding to samson 's words `` '' dalila ! dalila ! je t'aime ! '' ( delilah ! delilah ! i love you ! ) which he repeats between the first and second verses of her aria . these interjections are omitted in recital performances or sometimes sung to the changed words `` samson ! samson ! je t'aime ! '' '' . samson 's part in the final 22 bars of the stage aria where he joins delilah in a duet is also omitted in a recital , although some performers , notably marilyn horne , have sung samson 's final words – changed as above , rising to a high b-flat . a performance takes between 5 1/2 and 6 1/2 minutes . the aria is written in d-flat major . the verse has a time signatures of 3/4 but the refrain ( `` ah ! réponds '' ) has a time signature of 4/4 . the tempo indication is `` andantino '' ( =66 ) for the verse and `` un poco più lento '' ( a little slower ) for the refrain . the vocal range extends from b-flat to g-flat , with a tessitura from e-flat to e-flat .
