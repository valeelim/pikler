Linear programming     linear programming or linear optimisation is a field of mathematics that deals with finding optimal values or solutions that can be described with linear equations and inequalities . very often this involves finding the minimal or maximal values , given some conditions , or constraints . linear programming is often used for problems where no exact solution is known , for example for planning traffic flows . linear programming is one of the main methods used in operations research . linear optimization is a special case of convex optimization . it forms the basis for several methods of solving problems of integer programming . in many cases , the solutions of linear programs can be mapped to polyhedra , which allows solving and modelling certain problems geometrically . in the case of linear programming , the word `` programming '' should be seen as `` planning '' ; george dantzig coined the term in the 1940s , long before computers were used to solve such problems . looking at the information theory complexity , linear programming problems are simple , and can be solved efficiently using algorithms such as the interior point method . in many cases , the simplex algorithm developed by dantzig has proven to be very fast , even though its complexity is exponential , in the worst case .
