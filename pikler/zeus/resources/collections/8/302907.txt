Diels–Alder reaction     the diels–alder reaction ( da ) is a chemical reaction between organic compounds . the reaction causes the compounds to form a new six-sided compound . this is called a cyclohexene . a conjugated diene joins with an alkene to make the cyclohexene . this compound looks like a ring . this reaction was discovered by otto diels and kurt alder in 1928. in 1950 , they were given the nobel prize in chemistry for their work on this reaction . the da reaction is very useful as it means cyclohexenes can be made with very little energy . cyclohexenes are used to make complex organic molecules . one of the first uses of the da reaction was to make insecticides . the da reaction makes a new hexagonal ring-shaped compound . a compound with two double bonds which are one carbon atom apart from each other is joined to another compound with at least one double bond . a da reaction can also happen if some of the atoms in the newly formed ring are not carbon . some of the da reactions are reversible . the reaction caused during this breaking up of the cyclic system is called the retro-diels–alder . these retro-diels–alder compounds are often seen when they are analyzed by mass spectrometry .
