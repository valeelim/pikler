Optic chiasma     the optic chiasma , or 'optic chiasm ' , is the part of the brain where the optic nerves ( cn ii ) partially cross . the optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus . the images on the nasal ( inner ) sides of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm . the temporal ( outer ) images , on the other hand , stay on the same side . this allows the images from either side of the visual field to go to the appropriate side of the brain , combining the sides together . beyond the optic chiasm , with crossed and uncrossed fibers , optic nerves become optic tracts . this system allows for parts of both eyes that attend to the right visual field to be processed in the left visual system in the brain , and vice versa .
