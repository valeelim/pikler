Garageland     garageland is a song by english punk rock band the clash , featured on their first album , `` the clash '' . upon the clash 's appearance at the sex pistols 'screen on the green ' concert , nme critic charles shaar murray said : `` '' the clash are the kind of garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately , preferably with the engine running , which would undoubtedly be more of a loss to their friends and families than to either rock or roll . '' the clash responded immediately by writing the song 'garageland ' . the opening verses are : `` back in the garage with my bullshit detector '' / `` carbon monoxide makes sure it 's effective '' , followed by the chorus : `` we 're a garage band '' / `` we come from garageland '' , and concluding with `` back in the garage '' . yet , only two years later , murray was describing the band as `` the greatest rock band in the world '' '' in the same paper .
