Alpha cleavage     alpha cleavage , ( α-cleavage ) in organic chemistry , refers to the act of breaking the carbon-carbon bond , next to the carbon bearing a specified functional group . in mass spectrometry , an α-cleavage occurs when molecules break apart within a mass spectrometer . a mass spectrum tells the size and elements found in each molecule fragment . chemists use their understanding of how molecules break apart to guess the structure of the original molecule . many different molecules break apart with α-cleavage inside the mass spectrometer . many times , α-cleavage explains the resulting mass spectra . as an example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage , an electron is knocked off an atom ( usually by electron collision ) to form a radical cation . electrons are most likely to be removed in the following order : 1 ) lone pair electrons , 2 ) pi bond electrons , 3 ) sigma bond electrons . one of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent ( alpha ) bond . the other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom ( not one adjacent to the lone pair atom ) creating a radical . this creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom ( oxygen is a good example ) and breaks ( cleaves ) the bond that lost the two electrons that were removed .
