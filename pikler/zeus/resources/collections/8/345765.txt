Kabaddi     kabaddi ( sometimes kabbadi or kabadi ) is a team sport from south asia . two teams are on opposite halves of a small field . they take turns sending a `` raider '' into the other half . this is to win points by tackling members of the opposing team . then the raider tries to return to his own half . he holds his breath and chants the word `` kabaddi '' during the whole raid . the raider must not cross the lobby unless he touches any of his opponents . if he does not touch anyone then he will be `` out '' . there is also a bonus line . if the raider touches it and returns to his side of the field , he will get extra points . in the international team version of kabaddi there are two teams of seven members . each are on opposite halves of a field of 10 m × 13 m in case of men and 8 m × 12 m in case of women . each has three extra players held in reserve . the game is played with 20-minute halves . there is a five-minute half-time break when the teams change sides . teams take turns sending a `` raider '' to the opposite team 's half . the goal is to tag or wrestle ( `` confine '' ) members of the opposite team . tagged members are `` out '' and temporarily sent off the field .
