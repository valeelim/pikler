Reactivity series     in introductory chemistry , the reactivity series or activity series is an empirical series of metals , in order of `` reactivity '' from highest to lowest . it is used to summarize information about the chemical reactions of metals with acids and water , single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores . the elements at a higher level are more reactive , whereas the elements at a lower level are less reactive . reactivity series of common metals k na ca mg al zn fe ni sn pb cu hg ag au pt
