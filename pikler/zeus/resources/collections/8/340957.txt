Cesarean section     a cesarean section ( often called a c-section ) is a kind of surgery , which is usually done to make childbirth easier . in the past , this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother , or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible . more recently , it has also been done on request , without these reasons . in very rare cases , abortions are performed using this procedure , these are called hysterotomy abortions . the first person to perform a modern cesarean section was ferdinand adolf kehrer , in 1881. in latin , it is called `` sectio caesarea '' , in english , the spelling caesarean section also exists . the rate of babies delivered through cesarean section varies : it is at a record level of 46 % in china ; levels of 25 % and above are common in many asian and european countries , latin america , and the united states . from about the 6th century , there was roman law that stated that a living foetus may not be buried with the mother , the digest notes this to be a `` lex regia '' . if this were the case , it would date from the time around 700 bc , when there were roman kings .
