Information asymmetry     information asymmetry is a theory from economics . it says that in a contract the two parties of the conract do not have the same information . information economics is a field of science that looks at some of the problems that result from this bias . neoclassical economics assumes there is perfect information : all the actors know all the states of their environment ; they can also observe what all the other actors do . information is free -it has no cost in the economic sense . this is also true for the ability to observe the other parties . a model called new institutional economics changes this : information is no longer free , there are costs associated with obtaining information . information asymmetry is concerned with three main asymmetries : - `` hidden characteristics '' : certain features of the products are not known before the contract is made . - `` hidden action '' and `` hidden information '' : after the contract is made , one of the actors ' actions can not be observed ( hidden action ) ; if it can be observed , its qualities can not be determined ( hidden information )
