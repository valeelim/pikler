Yutyrannus     yutyrannus is a tyrannosauroid dinosaur , an early forebear of `` tyrannosaurus rex '' . it lived during the lower cretaceous 124.6 million years ago ( mya ) . it was about 10 meters long and 3 meters tall , and is the largest known dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers . it is forty times heavier than the previous record holder , `` beipiaosaurus '' . the feathers were long , up to , and filamentous . the fossil was found in what is now northeastern china . three fossils of `` y. huali '' , were all found in the rock beds of liaoning province . because of its size , it is certain that `` yutyrannus '' could not fly . the feathers supported other functions , such as temperature regulation and visual signalling . `` yutyrannus '' is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens ( an adult , a subadult and a juvenile ) . they were got from a fossil dealer who claimed all three were found in a single quarry at batuyingzi in liaoning province . they were probably found in a layer of the yixian formation .
