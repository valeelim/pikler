Electrocyclic reaction     in organic chemistry , an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic rearrangement reaction . the reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond . electrocyclic reactions share the following properties : - electrocyclic reactions are driven by light ( photoinduced ) or heat ( thermal ) - the reaction mode is determined by the number of pi electrons in the part with more pi bonds - an electrocyclic reaction can close a ring ( electrocyclization ) or open a ring - the stereospecifity is determined by a conrotatory or a disrotatory transition state formation as predicted by the woodwardâ€“hoffmann rules . the torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituents rotate . for example , the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions . it produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other ( enantiomeric products ) . a reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation ( partially or completely ) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess ( where one stereoisomer is produced much more than the other ) .
