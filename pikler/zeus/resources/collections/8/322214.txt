Combination lock     a combination lock is a lock that is opened with a set of secret numbers instead of a key . mechanical combination locks usually have a dial that is rotated to three different numbers to open the lock . electronic combination locks usually have a keypad where the combination can be entered like a telephone number . the mechanical combination lock usually has three discs inside . the last disc is connected directly to the dial , and a notch on this disc rotates the second disc . a notch on the second disc in turn rotates the first disc . the lock is usually opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first number , counterclockwise past the first number and to the second number , and clockwise to the third number ( some locks may use the reverse directions ) . this type of lock is popular on safes and padlocks . it is available for entry doors , but is not popular due to the amount of time required to enter the combination . the combination is usually set at the factory and can not be changed easily ( if at all ) .
