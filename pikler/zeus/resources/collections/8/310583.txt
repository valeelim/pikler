Large Zenith Telescope     the large zenith telescope ( lzt ) is a 6.0 metre diameter telescope . it is in the university of british columbia 's malcolm knapp research forest , about east of vancouver . it is one of the largest optical telescopes in the world . a zenith telescope is only able to look straight up . this means that it can use a mirror which is a smoothly spinning pan filled with liquid mercury . the lzt uses 28 litres of mercury , spinning once every 8.5 seconds . this type of mirror can be made much larger and cheaper than a conventional mirror , which means it collects much more light . this light is focused into a ccd to make an image . the lzt is used for `` transit imaging '' . this means that earth 's rotation moves stars past the telescope . images can be taken by moving the sensor electronically in step with this movement . the telescope was made in 1994 using parts from the three-metre diameter nasa orbital debris observatory telescope , which was retired a couple years earlier after several years of use .
