Anglo-Saxon Chronicle     the anglo-saxon chronicle is a collection of annals in old english chronicling the history of the anglo-saxons . the annals were initially created late in the 9th century , probably in wessex , during the reign of alfred the great . multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across england and were independently updated . in one case , the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154. nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part , though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version . the oldest seems to have been started towards the end of alfred 's reign , while the most recent was written at peterborough abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. almost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals , by year ; the earliest are dated at 60 bc , and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written , at which point contemporary records begin . these manuscripts collectively are known as the `` anglo-saxon chronicle '' .
