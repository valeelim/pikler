Hallucigenia     hallucigenia is an extinct genus of animal found as fossils in the middle cambrian burgess shale formation of british columbia , canada . another species is found in the lower cambrian maotianshan shale of china . `` hallucigenia '' was thought by stephen jay gould to be unrelated to any living species , but most palaeontologists now believe that the species was a velvet worm , a relative of modern arthropods . unlike its contemporary `` aysheaia '' , `` hallucigenia '' has very little resemblance to modern onychophora . the elongated , and clawed legs bear little resemblance to the paired annulated legs of the onychophora . it is unknown what the spines were made of and how much 'protection ' they offered . it is not easy to explain why 30 or more specimens — each thought to have seven pairs of rather long , flexible legs — do not show even one example of paired legs . but at least this reconstruction of the animal can plausibly walk , and the spines serve a reasonable purpose . a picture of this reconstruction as well as a photograph of an actual fossil can be seen on the geological survey of canada 's website .
