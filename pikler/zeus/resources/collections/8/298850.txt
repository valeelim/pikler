Arithmetic precision     the precision of a numeric value describes the number of digits that are used to show that value . in a scientific setting , this would be the `` total '' number of digits ( sometimes called the `` significant figures '' or `` significant digits '' ) or , less commonly , the number of fractional digits or decimal places ( the number of digits following the decimal point ) . this second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance . in both cases , the term `` precision '' can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded . for example , in floating point arithmetic , a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision , which is the length of the resulting significand . in financial calculations , a number is often rounded to a given number of places ( for example , to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies ) . as an example , the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places . if insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision . the following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round-to-even method .
