Bipod     `` bipod '' comes from the latin and greek words `` bi '' and `` pod '' . `` bi '' means `` two '' and `` pod '' means `` foot '' , or `` feet '' . a bipod is sometimes attached to a firearm to help support it . it also makes it more stable . it gives the best stability along two axes of motion : side-to-side and up-and-down . on firearms , bipods are often used on rifles and shotguns to allow the gun to rest and stop it from moving . they can also be seen on long-barrelled weapons . the bipod allows the gunner to rest the weapon on the ground , a short wall or other object . this allows for more accuracy . different types of bipods are set up in different ways . some bipods are a specific length that can not be changed , but some bipods ' length can be changed . mostly , when bipods are not being used , they are folded forwards , not back towards the gunner . some types of bipod can fold into grips for the gunner to hold to keep the weapon steady . when firing a weapon without a bipod , it is harder to aim and keep the weapon steady .
