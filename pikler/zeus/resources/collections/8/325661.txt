Art critic     an art critic is a person who writes about art . he writes reviews which are published in newspapers , magazines , books and on web sites . he often goes to museums and art exhibitions and then writes about the paintings and sculptures on display . professional art critics should know a lot about art history . people often discuss what the art critic has said or written . it may lead to a lot of discussion among art lovers . when art critics write good things about young artists it may help them to become famous . if they write bad things then it makes it difficult for young artists to have a good career . so , art critics ( just like music critics with music ) have a lot of influence on art culture . critics such as roger fry have helped the public to understand the post-impressionist movement , and lawrence alloway helped to explain pop art . vladimir stasov
