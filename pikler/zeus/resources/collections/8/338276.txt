MD5     md5 is a special algorithm , a mathematical process , used to make computer information secure and safe . it is mainly used for security in database systems . the algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data ( strings , text etc. ) . any change to the data , either deliberate or accidental , will mean the hash code will also change . by comparing the codes , it is easy to see if a change has been made . md5 was invented by ron rivest of the massachusetts institute of technology in 1991. an md5 hash code is usually a 32-digit hexadecimal number . by 1996 , methods were developed to break the security of an md5 algorithm . this was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data . md5 is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data , but it is still considered ok to protect from accidental changes , for example single-bit changes caused by noise on a network connection . an md5 hash could look like : 9c677286866aad38f8e9b660f5411814 . this is the hash of the string `` wikipedia '' .
