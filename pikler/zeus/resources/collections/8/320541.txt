Local ordinance     a local ordinance is a law usually found in a municipal code . in the united states , these laws are enforced locally in addition to state law and federal law . in some states , the state legislature has limited the scope of local ordinances . this approach was made popular by john forrest dillon called the `` dillon rule '' . the law in such states says that local governments could only adopt ordinances when the state gives them authority on particular subjects . states that do not follow the dillon rule believe that local government has inherent ( unstated ) powers of self-government . in those states , local government can make ordinances on any subject not prohibited by the state legislature . in japan , any prefecture or municipality may pass under authority granted by article 94 of the constitution . there must generally be a statutory basis for an ordinance , the ordinance must be in compliance with any overlapping statutes ( although it may impose a stricter standard or penalty ) , and the ordinance must be related to the affairs of the local government in question .
