Field gun     a field gun is an artillery piece . the term was first used to describe smaller guns that could be taken with an army while marching . in battle the field gun could be quickly moved about the battlefield as needed . guns installed in a fort , siege cannon and mortars were too large to be moved quickly , and would be used only in a long siege . napoleon used field guns with very large wheels that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle . by moving the guns from place to place during the battle , formations of enemy soldiers could be broken up to be handled by the infantry wherever they were massing , dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the infantry . as artillery developed technically , almost all guns of any size could be moved at some speed . even the largest siege weapons could be moved by road or rail by the start of world war i. development then turned towards smaller weapons with increased mobility . even the world war ii german super-heavy guns could be moved by rail or by caterpillar-track vehicles .
