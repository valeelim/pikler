Heliport     a heliport is a small airport only for use by helicopters . heliports normally contain one or more helipads and may have limited facilities such as fuel , lighting , a windsock , or even hangars . in larger towns and cities , customs facilities may be available at a heliport . the early supporters of helicopters hoped that heliports would become popular , but they have not been popular in urban areas due to the unpleasant noise caused by helicopter traffic . in a large metropolis , a heliport can serve passengers needing to quickly move within the city or to outlying regions . generally heliports can be situated closer to a town or city centre than an airport for fixed-wing aircraft . the advantage in flying by helicopter to a destination or even to the city 's main airport is that travel can be much faster than driving . as an example , the downtown manhattan heliport in new york city provides scheduled service to john f. kennedy international airport and is used to move wealthy persons and important goods quickly to destinations as far away as maryland .
