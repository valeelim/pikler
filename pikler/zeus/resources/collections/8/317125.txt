Surface area to volume ratio     the surface area to volume ratio of an object is the relationship between two measurements . it is the ratio of surface area to volume . it shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount it can hold inside it . small objects have a large surface area compared to the volume . this gives them a large ratio of surface to volume . larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio . two common ways of writing it are sa/vol or sa : v .
