English poetry     the history of english poetry stretches from the middle of the 7th century to today . over this period , english poets have written some of the longest-surviving poems in western culture . the language and its poetry have spread around the world . the earliest surviving poetry from the area now called england was probably transmitted orally ( or passed from person to person by mouth , without being written down ) . it was then written down in versions that do not now survive . because of this , it is difficult to say which poems were the earliest . there is a lot of controversy over this issue . a number of major national poetries have developed . these include american , australian , new zealand , canadian and indian poetry . it may be controversial to describe irish literature as english or british , even though it is in the english language . other pages . - beowulf - blank verse
