Four temperaments     four temperaments is a theory of psychology about personality . it suggests that four bodily fluids affect human personality traits and behaviour . the temperaments are `` sanguine '' , `` choleric '' , `` melancholy '' , and `` phlegmatic '' . galen , a doctor from the roman empire added characteristics to bodily fluids : - mucus - cold and damp - black bile - cold and dry - yellow bile - warm and dry - blood - warm and damp galen thought that to cure illness you need to rebalance the fluids . if you , for example , have too much blood , you will need a remedy which is the opposite of warm and damp ; something cold and dry . a sanguine person is a cheerful person . they are friendly , talkative , encouraging and creative . they like to be noticed by others and to have fun . but they tend to forget things they are supposed to do and to be late for dates or appointments . if they feel that they are not appreciated , they can become depressed ( sad ) . they tend to lose interest in new hobbies as soon as it is no longer a fun thing to do .
