Voltammetry     voltammetry is the name for a number of methods to analyse a sample , both in terms of quality and quantity . with voltammetry , the composition of a probe can be re-constructed by looking at the way electrical currents flow through it . usually , the electrical current between two or more electrodes is varied . voltammetry is a form of electrolysis .
