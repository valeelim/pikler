Monoculture     monoculture is growing a single crop in a large area . farmers decide what is the best crop , and grow only that . this is very common in modern agriculture , as it simplifies the farm and allows relatively few people to harvest large amounts . monocultures have problems , however : pests and diseases that attack only one kind of plant can spread more easily when they only find that kind . each kind of plant also needs particular nutrients from the soil . fertilizers are used to supply that nutrient . farmers who do n't understand farming may ruin their farm .
