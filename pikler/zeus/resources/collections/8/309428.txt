Chinese musical system     the ancient chinese musical system depends on very ancient mathematics used to determine sound frequencies . the easiest way to explain it is to work through a real example . suppose that somebody wanted to make a musical instrument that could play any song in the ancient chinese system . here are the instructions : make a wooden box 105 cm long and 60 cm wide . put guides for the strings near each end of the box , and fix it so that these two guides are 99 cm apart . multiply 99 cm by 2/3 , which is 66 cm . place a fret all the way across the box on the 66 cm line. < br > multiply 66 cm by 4/3 , which is 88 cm . place a fret along the 88 cm line. < br > multiply 88 cm by 2/3 , which is 58.66 ... 6 cm . place a fret along this line. < br > multiply 58.66 ... 6 cm by 4/3 , which is 78.22 ... 2 cm . place a fret along this line . < br > multiply 78.22 ... 2 cm by 2/3 , which is 54.148148 ... 148 cm . place a fret along this line. < br > multiply 54.148148 ... 148 cm by 4/3 , which is 69.531 cm . place a fret along this line. < br >
