Jumping spider     jumping spiders belong to the family `` salticidae '' . these spiders catch their prey by jumping on them . species live in many habitats , from leaves lying on the ground , to the tops of trees in the forest , and even way up on mt . everest . they are found on every continent in the world except for antarctica . at present , 5026 species in 530 genera have been found . they are actually the largest family of spiders , with about 13 % of all species . they are easy to identify because their eye pattern is distinctive . they have eight eyes , two of which are very large , and because their faces form a flat surface , facing where they are going . they often hunt high up in bushes , or on vertical walls . to save themselves from falling they do something very much like what climbers do to protect themselves in the mountains . humans tie a rope to the mountain and attach the other end to the harness they wear . jumping spiders attach silk from their spinnerets to the thing on which they are standing and then they jump . while they are moving through the air they make silk so that there is always a safety rope trailing out behind them .
