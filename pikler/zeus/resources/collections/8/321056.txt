Spaceflight     spaceflight is when a thing made by man flies into outer space . a spaceflight can happen with or without humans on board . the russian soyuz program , the us space shuttle and the international space station are examples of manned ( with humans ) missions for spaceflight . space probes and satellites ( which orbit the earth ) , are examples of unmanned ( without humans ) spaceflights . these operate either by radio control or are fully independent . spaceflight is used for space exploration such as manned missions to the earth 's moon or unmanned missions to other planets in the solar system . spaceflight can also be used for tourism and satellite telecommunications . a spaceflight begins with a rocket launch , which provides enough energy to get out of earth 's atmosphere and to orbit the earth . once the rocket is in space , the activity of the rocket is watched and studied by scientists back on earth . some rockets may remain in space forever , some break apart when they reenter earth 's atmosphere , while others may impact other planets .
