Zero-knowledge proof     a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a protocol used in cryptography . in such a protocol , two parties are communicating . the task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret , but without revealing the secret . there is a well-known story showing some of the ideas of zero-knowledge proofs . usually , the two parties in a zero-knowledge proof are called peggy ( the prover of the statement ) and victor ( the verifier of the statement ) . in this story , peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave . the cave is shaped like a circle , with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side . victor says he 'll pay her for the secret , but not until he 's sure that she really knows it . peggy says she 'll tell him the secret , but not until she receives the money . they devise a scheme by which peggy can prove that she knows the word without telling it to victor . first , victor waits outside the cave as peggy goes in . they label the left and right paths from the entrance a and b. peggy randomly takes either path a or b. then , victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return , either a or b , chosen at random . providing she really does know the magic word , this is easy : she opens the door , if necessary , and returns along the desired path . note that victor does not know which path she has gone down .
