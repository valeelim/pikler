Wolfgang Köhler     wolfgang köhler ( 21 january 1887 – 11 june 1967 ) was a german psychologist who , like max wertheimer and kurt koffka , helped create gestalt psychology . he was the first to show that apes could solve problems by thinking . in 1910–13 , he worked with fellow psychologists max wertheimer and kurt koffka . he and koffka were subjects for wertheimer ’ s studies , which led them to conclusions about the inherent nature of vision . they collaborated on the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called gestalt theory , from the german word for “ whole '' . this was influenced by some earlier work of stumpf ( köhler ’ s teacher ) and christian von ehrenfels . wertheimer had attended ehrenfels ' lectures at the university of prague . köhler ’ s famous quote , “ the whole is different from the sum of its parts ” is usually quoted differently . though perhaps a simple error made in translation , many lectures in textbooks of modern-day psychology quote gestalt theory by saying “ the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ” . it is difficult to imagine that a translation error occurred here , especially when considering that ‘ greater ’ is ‘ größer ’ and ‘ different ’ is ‘ unterschiedlich ’ in german , respectively .
