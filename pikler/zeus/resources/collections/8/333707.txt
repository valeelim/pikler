Cable-stayed bridge     a cable-stayed bridge is a bridge that has one or more columns ( called `` towers '' or `` pylons '' ) , with cables supporting the bridge deck . there are two main types of cable-stayed bridges . in the `` harp '' design , the cables are nearly parallel . this is done by attaching them to various points on the tower ( s ) . the height of attachment of each cable on the tower is similar to the distance from the tower along the roadway to its lower attachment . in a `` fan '' design , the cables all connect to or pass over the top of the tower ( s ) . compared to other bridge types , the cable-stayed is best for longer spans than used for cantilever bridges , and shorter than those needing a suspension bridge . cantilever spans become too heavy if they were made longer . a cable-stay bridge is cheaper to build than a suspension bridge over a short distance . disadvantages of a cable stayed bridge -sways in the wind -its support is in water rather than sides advantages of a cable stayed bridge -good stiffness
