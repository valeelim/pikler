Shuttle     a shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store weft yarn while weaving . shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed , between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft . the simplest shuttles , known as `` stick shuttles '' , are made from a flat , narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn . more complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns . shuttles are often made of wood from the flowering dogwood , because it is so hard , resists splintering , and can be polished to a very smooth finish . originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand . however , `` john kay '' invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a `` flying shuttle '' . this shuttle could be thrown through the warp , which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler and easier to use . references . - chandler , deborah ( 1995 ) . `` learning to weave '' , loveland , colorado : interweave press llc . isbn 1-883010-03-9
