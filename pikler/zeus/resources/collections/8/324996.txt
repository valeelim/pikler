Underclocking     underclocking is the process of configuring a computer processor or other electronic circuit to operate at a lower speed than usual . this will reduce the speed of the computer , but it will usually make the battery last longer and the computer will produce less heat . some computers automatically underclock themselves when the system is not doing a lot of work . for even further battery and heat savings a computer can be undervolted , where the processor is operated at a lower voltage than usual . other devices such as video cards and smartphones can also be underclocked . the opposite of underclocking is called overclocking , and it is used to increase the speed of the computer but at the cost of battery life ( if there is a battery ) and heat output .
