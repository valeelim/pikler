Shilling     the shilling is a unit of currency used in some current and former british commonwealth countries . the word `` shilling '' comes from `` scilling '' , an accounting term that dates back to anglo-saxon times where it was said to be the value of a cow in kent or a sheep elsewhere . the word is thought to derive from the base `` skell- '' , `` to ring/resound '' and the diminutive suffix `` -ling '' . the slang term for a shilling as a currency unit was a `` bob '' . the abbreviation for shilling is s , from the latin `` solidus '' , the name of a roman coin . often it was informally represented by a slash , standing for a long s : `` e.g. , '' `` 1/6 '' would be 1 shilling and sixpence , often pronounced `` one and six '' ( and equivalent to 18d ; the shilling itself was valued at 12d ) . a price with no pence would be written with a slash and a dash , `` e.g. , '' `` 11/- '' . quite often a triangle or ( serif ) apostrophe would be used to give a neater appearance , `` e.g. , '' `` 1'6 '' and `` 11'- '' . in africa it is often abbreviated sh . during the great recoinage of 1816 , the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound ( weighing 5760 grains ) of standard ( 0.925 fine ) silver into 66 shillings , or its equivalent in other denominations . this effectively set the weight of the shilling , and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin , at 87.2727 grains or 5.655 grams from 1816 to 1990 , when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced .
