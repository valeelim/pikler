Shoulder     the human shoulder is made up of three bones : the clavicle ( collarbone ) , the scapula ( shoulder blade ) , and the humerus ( upper arm bone ) as well as muscles , ligaments and tendons . the articulations ( surfaces ) between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints . the shoulder joint is the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula , the head sitting in the glenoid fossa . the shoulder as a whole is the complete group of structures in the region of the joint . there are two kinds of cartilage in the joint . the first type is the white cartilage on the ends of the bones ( called articular cartilage ) which allows the bones to glide and move on each other . when this type of cartilage starts to wear out ( a process called arthritis ) , the joint becomes painful and stiff . the labrum is a second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage . this cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket . also , this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached .
