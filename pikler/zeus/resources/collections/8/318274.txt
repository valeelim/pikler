Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search     the sagittarius window eclipsing extrasolar planet search , or sweeps , was an astronomical survey . it was carried out in 2006. sweeps used the hubble space telescope to look at 180,000 stars for seven days to find extrasolar planets . the stars that sweeps monitored were all in the sagittarius-i window . this is a rare transparent look at the huge group of closely packed stars at the milky way 's centre ( central bulge ) , in the sagittarius constellation . our view to most of the stars in the centre of the galaxy is blocked by lanes of dust . these stars are about 27,000 light years from earth . sixteen planets were discovered by sweeps . they took from 0.6 to 4.2 days to go around the sun . planets which took less than 1.2 days to go around the sun have not been detected yet ; these have been called `` ultra-short period planets '' ( uspps ) by the search team . uspps were discovered only around stars with a low mass . this means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely , or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars .
