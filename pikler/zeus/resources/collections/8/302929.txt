Injective function     in mathematics , a injective function is a function `` f '' : '' a '' â†’ `` b '' with the following property . for every element `` b '' in the codomain `` b '' there is maximum one element `` a '' in the domain `` a '' such that `` f '' ( `` a '' ) = '' b '' . the term `` injection '' and the related terms `` surjection '' and `` bijection '' were introduced by nicholas bourbaki . in the 1930s , he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics . an injective function is often called a 1-1 function . however , a 1-1 correspondence is a bijective function ( both injective and surjective ) . this is confusing , so be careful . formally : the element formula_5 is called a pre-image of the element formula_6 if formula_7 . injections have one or none pre-images for every element `` b '' in `` b '' . cardinality is the `` number '' of elements in a set . the cardinality of `` a '' = { x , y , z , w } is 4. we write # '' a '' =4 . - if the cardinality of the codomain is less than the cardinality of the domain , the function can not be an injection . ( for example , there is no way to map 6 elements to 5 elements without a duplicate . )
