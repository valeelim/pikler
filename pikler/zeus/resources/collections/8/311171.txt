Reel-to-reel tape recorders     reel-to-reel tape recorders ( often called r2r , open reel decks , etc . ) were used during the 20th century , mostly in professional studios from the 1940 ’ s and quickly spread into people ’ s homes in the 1950s and 1960s . the biggest popularity was in the 1970s , probably because people needed higher quality recordings . this technology was like a revolution , because everyone could record any kind of sound ( vinyl records , radio broadcast , voice and music ) , then play it many times without the quality getting worse , and they could overwrite it many times . this technology has some weak points though : size of reels , sensibility , durability ; but still , it has certain advantages over today ’ s “ digital media formats. ” also , some famous bands and artists used reel to reel technology as a musical instrument or even as a separate band . these reel to reel decks are usually analogue sound devices using a magnetic tape of ¼ inch ( i.e . 6.25 cm ) width . this plastic tape is covered by a special magnetic substance which is being made into magnetic domains when it is being recorded . the tape recorder must have a record , playback and an erase head which transfer the signal onto the tape . the more expensive tape decks have three or six separate heads . tape recorders combine knowledge both on mechanics and electronics . there must be very precise motors and moving parts , but also a complicated circuit board . it has to contain transistors , amplifiers etc .
