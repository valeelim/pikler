Squad automatic weapon     a squad automatic weapon ( saw , also known as section automatic weapon or light support weapon ) is a weapon used to give infantry squads or sections automatic firepower that can easily be moved around . weapons used for this are selective fire rifles . they usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns . saws usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section . this makes logistics easier because only one type of ammunition needs to be given to a unit . saws are light enough to be used by one man . however , heavy machine guns such as the browning m2 are more powerful but need a crew to be as effective as they can be . many saws ( such as the rpk and l86 ) are just assault rifles or battle rifles that have been changed . they may be able to carry more ammunition and will almost always have a bipod . in the case of some assault rifles , such as the h & k g36 or steyr aug , the saw is simply the usual rifle with a few parts changed . however , the austrian army , who uses the most steyr augs , does n't use the hbar ( heavy barrel ) version of the assault rifle . instead , they use the mg 74 , which is a gun which was made from the design of the german ww2-machine gun mg 42. one of the first weapons designed for this role was the m1918 browning automatic rifle . even though it could not carry many bullets in its magazine , it was still better than the usual infantry rifle .
