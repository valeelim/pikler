Musk ox     the musk ox ( `` ovibos moschatus '' , muskox ) is a large arctic mammal of the bovidae family . it has a thick coat , and was common in the northern hemisphere during the pleistocene ice age . the males give off a strong odour , hence its name . this musky odour is used to attract females during mating season . muskoxen travel in herds of females and their young led by one or two strong males . male oxen fight over who will be leader by butting their thick heads and horns against each other . the musk oxen 's long , curved horns keep away predators . when a herd smells nearby wolves , all the musk oxen form a circle and face out . they lower their heads to show off their horns . muskoxen live in arctic north america and greenland , with small introduced populations in sweden , siberia and norway . muskoxen are herbivores which graze on grasses , leaves , and some arctic flowers . they are ruminants ; they swallow their food without chewing it . later , they regurgitate the food ( called a cud ) and chew it . muskoxen , like other ruminants , have a stomach with four sections .
