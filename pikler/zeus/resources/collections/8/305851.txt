Shatranj     chatrang , or shatranj , was the name given to the early game of chess when it travelled to persia and then to the arab world . in sassanid persia around 600 the name became chatrang and the rules were developed further , and players started calling `` shāh ! '' ( persian for 'king ' ) when threatening the opponent 's king , and `` shāh māt ! '' ( persian for 'the king is finished ' ) when the king could not escape from attack . these exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands . the game was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia , with the pieces largely retaining their persian names ; in arabic `` māt '' or `` māta '' مَاتَ means `` died '' , `` is dead '' . in arabic , the game became shatranj . in all other languages , the name of the game is derived either from `` shatranj '' or from `` shah '' . one interesting fact is that the arabs divided their game into the same three stages which we do today : opening , middlegame and endgame . at the start of a game , the arabic masters took a number of moves before the pieces were in contact with the other side .
