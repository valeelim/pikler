Darwinopterus     darwinopterus ( meaning `` darwin 's wing '' ) is a genus of pterosaur , discovered in china and named after charles darwin . it is the first known pterosaur to display features of both long-tailed ( rhamphorhynchoid ) and short-tailed ( pterodactyloid ) pterosaurs . `` darwinopterus '' is a transitional fossil between the two groups . between 30 and 40 fossil specimens have been found , all collected from the tiaojishan formation , which dates to the middle jurassic , 160 million years ago ( mya ) . the type species , `` d. modularis '' , was described in february 2010. two additional species , `` d. linglongtaensis '' and `` d. robustodens '' , were described from the same fossil beds in december 2010 and june 2011 , respectively . the specimens showed sexual dimorphism : the males had crests on their heads , and narrower hips than the females . this genus , and its near relatives , show a combination of 'primitive ' ( basal ) and 'advanced ' ( derived ) pterosaurian features . this is characteristic of transitional fossils ( 'missing links ' ) , and is called modular evolution or mosaic evolution .
