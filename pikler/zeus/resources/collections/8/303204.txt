Samaritan Pentateuch     the samaritan pentateuch or samaritan torah is a special version of the torah used by the samaritans . this version was created at the latest 127 bc , when the temple in jerusalem was destroyed , and the samaritans split from the other group in the temple . as the name says , this version contains the first five books of moses , or the torah . scholars use the samaritan pentateuch when they want to find the meaning of words in the original pentateuch or if they want to learn about the history of the different versions of the bible . some scrolls among the dead sea scrolls look like samaritan pentateuch . samaritan practices are based on their version of the five books of moses , which is slightly different from the masoretic text or the greek septuagint texts . some differences are small , such as the ages of different people mentioned in genealogy , while others are major , such as the commandment to only have one wife which appears in the samaritan text but not in the other versions .
