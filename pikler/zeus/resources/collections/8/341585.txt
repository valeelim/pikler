Hilbert's problems    hilbert 's problems in 1900 , the mathematician david hilbert published a list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems . the list of problems turned out to be very influential . after hilbert 's death , another problem was found in his writings ; this is sometimes known as hilbert 's 24th problem today . this problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible . of the 23 problems , three were unresolved in 2012 , three were too vague to be resolved , and six could be partially solved . given the influence of the problems , the clay mathematics institute formulated a similar list , called the millennium prize problems in 2000. the formulation of certain problems is better than that of others . of the cleanly-formulated hilbert problems , problems 3 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 19 , 20 , and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus . on the other hand , problems 1 , 2 , 5 , 9 , 15 , 18 , and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance , but there exists some controversy as to whether it resolves the problem .
