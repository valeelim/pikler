Impression management     impression management is an idea spoken about in the discipline of sociology . it is about the experience in everyday life where people control the way that they appear to others . people do this by selecting certain gestures , speech patterns , feminine or masculine expressions , as well as certain expressions of class and cultural interest . this so that people can give a particular image to others about who they want to be and how they want to be seen . when gesturing a person might use reserved and minimal movements in a professional setting , whilst they may smile widely and wave about when with friends . a person might also change their speech pattern in a professional setting in order to sound more educated or refined , and may speak more casually or use swear words when in a casual setting . males and females also often control how they are perceived in terms of masculinity or femininity . boys and men might sometimes make their voices sound deeper or speak in short sentences to reflect an old stereotype that males are unfeeling and unconcerned with self-expression . females on the other hand might feel the need to speak in line with the speech patterns of their peers , and this may include tacking on culturally specific phrases like `` or whatever '' and `` that 's hot/cute '' to indicate they identify with the female gender and traditional interests . these of course are very simple ideas about what it means to be a man or woman . in contemporary life the border between male and female is sometimes becoming less strict . in western societies psychologists support that people who show alternative gender expression are still medically normal .
