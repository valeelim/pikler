Folie à deux     folie à deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis . if more than two people share the symptoms or delusions , people speak about `` folie à trois '' ( 3 ) , `` folie à quatre '' ( 4 ) , `` folie à plusieurs '' , or `` folie en famille '' . officially , the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today , but many publications still use the original terms , which were developed in france in the 19th century . today , there are two main forms of the condition : - `` folie imposée '' : a person forms a delusion , and passes it on to other people . if the people get separated , the delusions in those people who did not develop them first will usually disappear quickly . - `` folie simultanée '' : two people suffering from delusions influence each other so that their delusions become very similar . newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie à deux ' . there may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above . also , in many cases , separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them . also , the person described as `` sane '' before developing the folie à deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness , or may develop one .
