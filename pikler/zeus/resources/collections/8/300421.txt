Secret sharing     secret sharing is used as a term to refer to ways of sharing a secret among many people . each person knows part of the secret that is shared , but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret . the knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret . adi shamir and george blakley developed the method independently of each other , in 1979. one example where secret sharing is used is the rsa cryptosystem . it uses a `` secret key '' . if this key is distributed among many people , no single person can make a signature . even if the part of one person is revealed or lost , a number of them can still make a signature . this is often used is areas where security is very important , such as banks , or the military . the dealer hands each player their part of the secret . in an easier setup , the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret , but with each part there is extra information . say that a secret needs five parts , and three parts are known . in this setup , guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known . the other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory , because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret .
