OPERA experiment     the oscillation project with emulsion-tracking apparatus ( opera ) is a scientific experiment for detecting tau neutrinos from muon neutrino oscillations . the experiment is a joint effort between the european centre for nuclear research ( cern ) and the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) . in september 2011 , opera scientists said that they had seen neutrinos appear to travel faster than the speed of light . however , the scientists later found problems in their equipment which had caused the anomaly . the neutrino time of flight was consistent with the speed of light . other pages . - opera neutrino anomaly
