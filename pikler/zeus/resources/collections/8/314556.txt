Undergraduate education     undergraduate education is a level of education wherein a student completes their first degree . the first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor 's degree . therefore , for many subjects in many systems of education , undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor 's degree . this education usually takes place in a university . in the united states , a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students . in some other educational systems and subjects , undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master 's degree , for example in some science and engineering courses in britain and some medicine courses in europe . in brazil , it normally takes four or five years to complete an `` undergraduate '' degree . students need to choose their main subjects before they join the university by taking a test named a `` vestibular '' . undergraduate degrees are not like in the united states where students have general studies during the first years and only specialize in a `` major '' during the last years of college . european students enroll in a specific course of studies they want to do from the start . they are expected to have received a good general education already in the secondary level in a school ( like a gymnasium or lyc√©e ) . in many countries they go to university at 18 or 17. the degree normally takes four or five years . after completing the first degree students can move on to doctoral studies . in many countries , the english distinction between a bachelor 's and master 's degree is only now being introduced by the bologna process . this means that the old first degree would be approximately equal to a master 's degree in the us or the uk .
