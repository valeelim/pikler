Mastère Spécialisé     a mastère spécialisé ( ms ) also called specialized master or advanced master is the french degree ( created in 1986 ) that a person gets after he completes his master 's degree and continues to study in a grande école in some specific field . in other words , a person must first get his master 's degree before he can get a mastère spécialisé . these people are considered to possess more advanced knowledge of the field that they had studied , as compared to those who only get a master 's degree . the course has a duration of one year including at least four months of internship . the history of the mastère spécialisé starts in 1986. during the end of the 1980s , the `` commission des titres d'ingénieur '' required that a student spend two years in a school to graduate with the french master 's degree . but a lot of foreign students sometimes came one entirely year in the french schools and came back to their own country without a degree . also , the european credit transfer and accumulation system was not yet adopted by all the schools .
