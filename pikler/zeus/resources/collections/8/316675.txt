Sacagawea     sacagawea ( c. 1788 â€“ probably december 20 , 1812 ; was a lemhi shoshone woman , who went along with the lewis and clark expedition as an interpreter and guide . lewis and clark explored the western united states with her , travelling thousands of miles from north dakota to the pacific ocean between 1804 and 1806. sacagawea is well remembered today . when many people think about lewis and clark today , they also think about sacagawea . in 2000 , the united states mint issued the sacagawea dollar coin in her honor , showing sacagawea and her son , jean baptiste charbonneau . the face on the coin was made to look like a modern shoshone-bannock woman named randy'l he-dow teton . this was because nobody knows exactly what sacagawea looked like . in 2001 , she was given the title of honorary sergeant , regular army , by president bill clinton . not much is known for sure about sacagawea . at about thirteen years of age , sacagawea was taken as a wife by toussaint charbonneau , a quebecer trapper living in the village . he had also taken another young shoshone named otter woman as a wife .
