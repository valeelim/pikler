FG 42     the fg 42 ( german : `` fallschirmjägergewehr '' 42 or `` paratrooper rifle 42 '' ) was a battle rifle . it was made in nazi germany during world war ii . the weapon was made for use by fallschirmjäger airborne infantry in 1942. it was used in small amounts until the war ended . the fg 42 had the power of a light machine gun . it was light and was no larger than the kar 98k bolt-action rifle . the fg 42 is thought to be one of the most advanced weapons of world war ii . it helped shape the modern assault rifle idea . at the time of the battle of crete ( operation mercury ) , german `` fallschirmjäger '' had the same weapons as the regular army . when they jumped from aircraft , they only had pistols and hand grenades . submachine guns , rifles and other heavier weapons were dropped in crates . the design of the german parachutes meant that it was not safe to carry heavier weapons like rifles on jumps . at crete , commonwealth defenders killed or injured many german soldiers . this is because the german paratroopers had to go and collect their weapons from containers . these could be all over the battlefield . this showed that the weapons the regular army used were not good for air operations .
