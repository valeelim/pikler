Torquoselectivity     in organic chemistry , torquoselectivity describes electrocyclic reactions that produce one isomer more than the other . an official definition is `` the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituents in conrotatory or disrotatory electrocyclic reactions . '' in other words , a chemical reaction is torquoselective if the groups of atoms that hang from a ring of atoms are more likely to have rotated in a particular direction during the reaction ( instead of being equally likely to rotate in both possible directions . ) torquoselectivity is different from the normal diastereoselectivity of pericyclic reactions . instead it is more selectivity beyond the woodwardâ€“hoffmann rules . the name comes from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate during the reaction . the reaction produces a single product because only one direction of rotation was allowed ( that is , the direction of rotation on the substituents was favored ) . the concept was originally developed by kendall n. houk .
