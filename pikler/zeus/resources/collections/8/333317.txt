Alveolar trill     the alveolar trill is a type of consonant . it is found in some spoken languages . it is usually called the rolled r , rolling r , or trilled r. the sound of this consonant is formed by placing the tip of your tongue against the ridge just behind the top row of your teeth . this is what is meant by `` alveolar '' . the sound is then made by vibrating your tongue against that ridge . this makes it a trill consonant . the international phonetic alphabet represents dental , alveolar and postalveolar trills with the symbol ⟨⟩ . the x-sampa symbol of it is r. quite often , we use ⟨⟩ in phonemic transcriptions ( especially those found in dictionaries ) of languages like english and german . they have rhotic consonants that are not an alveolar trill . this is because typing the r will be easier in the orthographies of these languages . in many indo-european languages , this sound is at least occasionally allophonic with an alveolar tap , particularly in unstressed positions . exceptions to this include catalan , spanish , albanian and some portuguese dialects , which treat them as separate phonemes .
