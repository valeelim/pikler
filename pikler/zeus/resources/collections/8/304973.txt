Northern corroboree frog     there are two species of corroboree frog , the northern corroboree frog , `` pseudophryne pengilleyi '' and the southern corroboree frog , `` pseudophryne corroboree '' . the two frogs were believed to be the same , but in 1996 they were recognised as two different species . the northern corroboree frog is a very small black frog with either light green or yellow stripes . unlike the southern species , these stripes are sometimes broken . it lives in the subalpine areas of south eastern australia , an area of about including the kosciusko national park , namadgi national park , the brindabella mountains and the fiery ranges . the northern corroboree frog has not suffered as badly as the southern as it has a much larger habitat . it lives above above sea level and with higher population numbers at the lower level . it has recently been downgraded from critical to an endangered species by the international union for the conservation of nature ( iucn ) .
