Gradualism     gradualism is a process of change by gradual , slow stages . in politics , it is the opposite of revolutions and rapid change . `` gradualism is ... sometimes associated with social democracy '' . in geology it is in tune with uniformitarianism , and against catastrophism . in biology it is in tune with darwinian ideas of slowly changing species as opposed to big , rapid changes gradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism . it is against abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings . instead , change ought to be brought about in small , discrete steps . martin luther king , jr. was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating segregation . the government wanted to try to integrate african-americans and european-americans slowly into the same society , but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation : this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism . now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.â€” martin luther king jr. 's `` i have a dream '' speech , delivered august 28 , 1963 at the lincoln memorial in washington dc
