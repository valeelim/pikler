Wet chemistry     wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase . it is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench . wet chemistry uses laboratory glassware , such as beakers and flasks , without quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation . many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods . before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry , it was the main form of scientific discovery in the chemical field . so , some people call wet chemistry classic chemistry or classical chemistry . today 's society and quality control requirements need a high volume of wet chemistry . so , many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for faster analysis . wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements , such as changes in color ( colorimetry ) , but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements , using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry . some uses for wet chemistry include tests for :
