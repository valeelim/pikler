Pastygate     pastygate is the name given to a political scandal in the united kingdom in march 2012. the government had said that it was going to place a 20 % vat charge on hot pasties . a labour member of parliament asked the chancellor of the exchequer , conservative mp george osborne , about when he last ate a cornish pasty . osborne answered that he had no idea when he had last eaten one . this answer has been used to show how out of touch with ordinary people the conservative party had become . the prime minister david cameron later said that he had recently eaten a cornish pasty at leeds railway station `` and that it was very good '' . however , the sun newspaper then reported that there was no place to buy cornish pasties at leeds railway station at the time david cameron claimed to have eaten one there . the issue , which at first appeared to be unimportant , was then taken up by several other newspapers and political commentators . they pointed out that the conservatives seemed not to know that the pasty was a basic food eaten by many ordinary people in the country . the vat rise on the pasty would affect both these customers and the pasty industry itself . these newspapers and commentators made fun of david cameron 's attempt to show himself as a regular pasty eater ( i.e . as one of the people ) and that george osborne 's did not know what a pasty was .
