Charnia     charnia is the genus name of a frond-like ediacaran lifeform . it has segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a midline . the genus `` charnia '' was named after charnwood forest in leicestershire , england , where the first fossilised specimen was found . `` charnia '' is a highly significant fossil for several reasons . it is the first fossil ever described from undoubted precambrian rocks . until then the precambrian was thought to have no fossils . similar fossils found in the 1930s ( namibia ) and the 1940s ( australia ) but were thought to be of cambrian age . secondly , `` charnia '' has become an enduring image of precambrian animals . originally interpreted as an alga ( ford ) , it was recast as a sea pen , a sister group to the modern soft corals , from 1966 onwards ( glaessner ) . the sea pen interpretation has recently been discredited . the current `` state of the art '' is something of a `` statement of ignorance '' . little is known of the ecology of `` charnia '' . it was benthic , anchored to the sea floor . it probably lived in deep waters , below the waves ( perhaps a great deal below the wave base ) . this means it did not photosynthesise . further , it has no obvious feeding apparatus ( mouth , gut , etc . ) and so its lifestyle is somewhat of an enigma . some think it survived by filter feeding or directly absorbing nutrients .
