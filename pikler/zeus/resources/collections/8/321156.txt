Atmospheric chemistry     atmospheric chemistry is a branch of science in which the chemistry of the earth 's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied . it is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry , physics , meteorology , computer modeling , oceanography , geology and volcanology and other disciplines . research is connected with other areas of study such as climatology . studying the atmosphere includes studying the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms . the composition of the earth 's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as volcano emissions , lightning and bombardment by solar particles from the sun 's corona . it has also been changed by human activity . some of these changes are harmful to human health , crops and ecosystems . examples of problems include acid rain , ozone depletion , photochemical smog , greenhouse gases and global warming . atmospheric chemists study the causes of these problems . atmospheric chemists offer theories about these problems , then test the theories and possible solutions . atmospheric chemists also note the effects of changes in government policy .
