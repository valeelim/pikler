International Direct Dialing     international direct dialing ( idd ) is an international telephone call dialed by the caller rather than going via an operator . since late in the twentieth century , most international calls are direct dialed . international calls are made by dialing the international call prefix for the country one is in , followed by the country calling code for the country one wishes to call , then the phone number within that country . when phone numbers are published for use abroad , they include the country calling code , but replace the international call prefix with `` + '' to signify that the caller should use the prefix appropriate for their country .
