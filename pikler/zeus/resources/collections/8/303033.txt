Ozone depletion     ozone is a gas that is present in the ozone layer in the stratosphere of the earth . there , it will absorb almost all ultraviolet light which is harmful to many organisms . the term ozone depletion can refer to a number of distinct , but related phenomena : - since about the 1970s , there has been a decrease in total volume of the ozone in the ozone layer , of about 4 % , per decade . - there are seasonal variations in the ozone layers ; in springtime , there is less ozone in the ozone layer over the polar regions , esp . the south pole . this is generally known as ozone hole . - in addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena , there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events . the details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning , but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens . the main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants ( cfcs , freons , halons . ) these compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface .
