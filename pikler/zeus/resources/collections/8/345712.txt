Ectopic pregnancy     an ectopic pregnancy is a when an embryo implants itself ( sticks to somewhere ) outside the uterus . in a normal pregnancy , the embryo implants ( sticks ) itself into the wall of the uterus . the uterus is the only place in the body where an embryo can grow into a fetus . most ectopic pregnancies happen in a fallopian tube ( one of the two tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus ) . for this reason , ectopic pregnancies are often called tubal pregnancies . rarely , ectopic pregnancies can happen in an ovary or in the cervix . ectopic pregnancies can not become normal pregnancies , and will not result in a baby . they can also cause serious health problems for the mother . risk factors ( things that make a woman more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy ) include : - having an ectopic pregnancy before - pelvic inflammatory disease ( pid ) - damage to the fallopian tubes caused by surgery - fallopian tubes that are not a normal shape - getting pregnant after having a tubal ligation or while an iud is in place .
