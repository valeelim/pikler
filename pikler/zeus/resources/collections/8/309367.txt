Orthonectida     orthonectida is a small phylum of poorly-known parasites of marine invertebrates . they are among the simplest of multi-cellular organisms . the adults are microscopic wormlike animals . they have a single layer of outer cells surrounding a mass of sex cells . they swim freely within the bodies of their hosts , which include flatworms , polychaete worms , bivalve molluscs , and echinoderms . they have separate male and female individuals . when they are ready to reproduce , the adults are released from the host , and sperm from the males penetrates the bodies of the females to achieve fertilisation . the resulting zygote develops into a ciliated larva that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts . once it finds a host , the larva loses its cilia and develops into a syncytial plasmodium larva . this , in turn , breaks up into numerous individual cells that become the next generation of adults . the resulting zygote develops into a ciliated larva that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts . once it finds a host , the larva loses its cilia and develops into a syncytial plasmodium larva .
