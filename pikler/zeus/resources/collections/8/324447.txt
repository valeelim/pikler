Neuroethology     neuroethology is the study of animal behavior and its control by the nervous system . neuroethology explores how the brain links stimuli ( e.g . sights , sounds , or smells ) to behavior . for example , many bats have a special ability called echolocation . bats use echolocation to find prey and to navigate . researchers study the auditory system of bats to show how sounds can be changed into a neural representation of sound . neuroethologists are scientists who study neuroethology . they try to discover how the nervous system works . they often use animals with special behaviors in their research . the word neuroethology combines ideas from two fields : neurobiology ( the study of the nervous system ) and ethology ( the study of behavior in nature ) . neuroethology focusses on natural behavior . natural behaviors of animals were created by natural selection ( e.g. , finding mates , moving , avoiding enemies ) . neuroethology avoids artificial behaviors like those in lab experiments .
