Dicraeosaurus     dicraeosaurus was a small sauropod that had some physical differences from the rest of the family . it was named for the spines on the back of the neck . in general , sauropods had long necks and tails , skinny bodies and limbs , and tiny brains and heads . they were light in comparison with the brachiosaurs , because their vertebrae were a lattice of bony struts , used to reduce weight and take maximum stress . the family `` dicraeosaurus '' was in had shorter tails , larger heads and longer neural spines along their neck and back . fossils of `` dicraeosaurus '' have been found in the rocks of tendaguru hill in tanzania . the rocks also yield fossils of `` giraffatitan '' and `` kentrosaurus '' . as there was a distinct difference in size between these animals , they would probably have browsed for vegetation at different levels , allowing them to co-exist without significant competition . the first fossil of `` dicraeosaurus '' was discovered in 1914 .
