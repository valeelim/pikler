Entity-relationship model     in software engineering , an entity-relationship model is a conceptual model of data . very often , the term is shortened to er model . er models are used to create relational databases . they show how the different parts of a data model interact with each other . peter chen proposed to use this modelling approach in an article he wrote in 1976. chen was not the first to have this idea . after the publication of the article , the idea was modified as well . in an er model , there are three different types of objects : - an entity exists in the real world ; for example : an employee called smith , or a project with number 1234 . - a `` relationship '' shows how two entities relate to each other - both entities and relationships can have `` attributes '' . anything that is useful to know about an entity or a relationship is an `` attribute '' . since the database must be able to find an entity or a relationship , it must be able to identify it with a set of attributes that is unique . this set of attributes is usually called `` primary key '' .
