Wiggler (synchrotron)    wiggler ( synchrotron ) a wiggler is an insertion device in a synchrotron . it is a series of magnets designed to repeatedly laterally deflect ( 'wiggle ' ) a beam of charged particles inside a storage ring of a synchrotron . these deflections release synchrotron radiation . although synchrotrons give off such radiation anyway as magnets work to bend the particles on a circle-like path , a wiggler release more intense radiation than the bending magnets . a wiggler has a broader spectrum of radiation than an undulator . in a wiggler , the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons . so , every electron in the electron bunch radiates independently . this makes a broad radiation spectrum . a wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets stuck together , and its radiation intensity goes up as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler goes up . typically the magnets in a wiggler are arranged in a halbach array . the design shown above is usually known as a halbach wiggler .
