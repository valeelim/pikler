Releaser     a releaser is a stimulus from one animal to another , which causes a particular response . the releaser , or sign stimulus triggers an innate releasing mechanism in the receiver . the receiver then does its response , the fixed action pattern ( fap ) . this kind of system is inherited by both animals . example : a fledgling bird does its releaser , say it squawks and opens its beak wide , showing bright red inside throat . this triggers the adult to cough up food stored in its gullet . both 'partners ' are behaving instinctually with inherited behaviours : these are not learnt during life . a fap can truly be said to be 'hard-wired ' : a specific stimulus nearly always results in the same behavioral response . another behavious system is the 'dances ' of water birds such as the great crested grebe . they pair for life , and 'dance ' whenever a pair meet up after an absence , and on other occasions . the dances are quite complex , and were first described fully by julian huxley . here the meeting is the releaser , and both partners do the fixed action pattern . the function of the system is a little unclear , but it has something to do with reinforcing the pair 's bond .
