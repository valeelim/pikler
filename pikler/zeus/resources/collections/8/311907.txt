Equivalence relation     the equivalence relation is a mathematical relation that is symmetric , transitive and reflexive . using this relation , it is possible to partition a set into ( non-empty ) subsets , which are called `` equivalence classes '' . as an example , look at the animals on a farm : we now define a relation : we say that two animals are related , if they belong to the same species . that way , a cow is related to an ox , but not to a chicken . the relation we just defined is an equivalence relation : - it is `` reflexive '' : each animal is of the same species as itself - it is `` symmetric '' : if the cow is the same species than the ox , then the ox is also the same species as the cow . - it is `` transitive '' : if a cow and a bull , and a bull and an ox are of the same species , they are all of the same species of cattle in this example , all cattle form an equivalence class .
