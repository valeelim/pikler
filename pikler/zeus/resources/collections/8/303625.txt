Plover     plovers are water birds birds belonging to the subfamily charadriinae . there are about 40 species , most of them called 'plover ' or 'dotterel ' . the closely related lapwing subfamily , vanellinae , has another 20-odd species . plovers are found throughout the world , and have short bills . they wade in the water , and hunt by sight , rather than by feel as longer-billed waders like snipe do . they feed mainly on insects , worms or other invertebrates . they use a run-and-pause technique , rather than the steady probing of some other waders . the plover group of birds has a defence against predators called `` false brooding '' . they sit on an imaginary nest site , changing position sometimes as if real eggs were under them . the plover has been known to attack when the young are threatened . the birds secrete an acidic compound from a gland located in their mouth . on contact with skin causes a burning sensation .
