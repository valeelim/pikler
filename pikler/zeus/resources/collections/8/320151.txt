Surface integral     in mathematics , a surface integral is a definite integral taken over a surface ( which may be a curve set in space ) . just as a line integral handles one dimension or one variable , a surface integral can be thought of being double integral along two dimensions . given a surface , one may integrate over its scalar fields ( that is , functions which return numbers as values ) , and vector fields ( that is , functions which return vectors as values ) . surface integrals have applications in physics , particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism . consider a surface `` s '' on which a scalar field `` f '' is defined . if one thinks of `` s '' as made of some material , and for each x in `` s '' the number `` f '' ( x ) is the density of material at x , then the surface integral of `` f '' over `` s '' is the mass per unit thickness of `` s '' . ( this is only true if the surface is an infinitesimally thin shell . ) one approach to calculating the surface integral is then to split the surface in many very small pieces , assume that on each piece the density is approximately constant , find the mass per unit thickness of each piece by multiplying the density of the piece by its area , and then sum up the resulting numbers to find the total mass per unit thickness of `` s '' .
