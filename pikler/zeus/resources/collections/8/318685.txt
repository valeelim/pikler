Fuse     a fuse is a device that shuts off the power to an electrical circuit when too much electric current flows through it . this usually happens when too many appliances are plugged in or when there is a short circuit . a fuse is made as an intentional weak spot in a circuit that will melt ( or `` blow '' ) when too much current is flowing through it , shutting off the power to the rest of the circuit . this protects the rest of the circuit . after the fuse blows , the problem that caused it to blow must be corrected and the fuse must be replaced to restore power to the circuit . a circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse , but it can be reset without replacing anything . other websites . - fuse_ ( electrical ) -citizendium
