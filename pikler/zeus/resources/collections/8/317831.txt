Differential geometry     differential geometry is a field of mathematics . it uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geometry . the theory of the plane , as well as curves and surfaces in euclidean space are the basis of this study . big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century . in geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees . carl friedrich gauß wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees ; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry . a long time ago , differential geometry was used for map projections . today , it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory , or satellite navigation . grigori perelman 's proof of the poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry .
