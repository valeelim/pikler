Felsic     the word `` felsic '' is a term used in geology to refer to silicate minerals , magma , and igneous rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon , oxygen , aluminium , sodium , and potassium . they are usually light in colour and have specific gravities less than 3. the most common felsic rock is granite , but others include quartz , muscovite , orthoclase , and the sodium-rich plagioclase feldspars . in terms of chemistry , felsic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the mafic rocks . in order for a rock to be classified as felsic , it generally needs to contain more than 75 % felsic minerals ; namely quartz , orthoclase and plagioclase . rocks with greater than 90 % felsic minerals can also be called `` leucocratic '' , meaning 'light-coloured ' . the rock texture thus determines the basic name of a felsic rock . references . - le maitre l.e .
