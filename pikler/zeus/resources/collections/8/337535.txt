Biological species concept     the biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form ( speciation ) . a biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together ( panmixia ) . however , they can not breed with other groups . in other words , the group is reproductively isolated from other groups . according to ernst mayr , a new species forms when an existing species splits . a similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by moritz wagner . dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species . once a species lives in two different areas , the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop . each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well . eventually , each group becomes a 'good ' biological species , because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together . this is still considered the most common reason for species splitting , and has the technical name of allopatric speciation . it is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area .
