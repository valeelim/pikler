Division by two     in mathematics , division by two is when a number is divided by two . some cultures , like the ancient egyptians , thought this was a different operation than division . some mathematicians up until the 16th century ( 1500-1599 ) thought this too . today division by two is handled specially in modern computer programming . division by two is also called halving , mediation , and dimidiation . in a binary number system , there are only two digits : 0 and 1. all other numbers are represented with those two digits . for example , `` one '' is 1 , `` two '' is 10 , `` three '' is 11 , `` four '' is 100 , and so on . most of the time people use a number system with ten digits ( the numbers 0 through 9 . ) this is called the decimal number system . division by two in binary is very easy . it is done by dropping the last digit on the right of the number . this is called a `` bit shift operation . '' for example , if we performed a bit shift operation on the binary number 100 , we 'd get 10. since binary 100 is decimal 4 , and binary 10 is decimal 2 , this makes sense .
