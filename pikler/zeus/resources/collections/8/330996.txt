French Suites     the french suites are six suites composed by johann sebastian bach between 1722 and 1725. they were written to be played on the harpsichord or clavichord . a suite is a group of dances . bach did not call them `` french suites '' . that title was given to the group by someone else . they were called the `` french suites '' to distinguish them from another group of suites by bach called the `` english suites '' . the `` french suites '' are largely based on italian models , and are written in the keys of d minor , c minor , b minor , e-flat major , g major , and e major . all six suites open with an allemagne and are followed by a courante and a sarabande . all six suites end with a gigue ( jig ) . between the sarabande and the gigue are found a variety of dances that include minuets , bourr√©es , gavottes , and others . there is no definitive manuscript . the ornamentation varies from one manuscript to another . two other suites one in a minor and the other in e-flat major sometimes appear in the manuscripts . bach 's `` french overture '' is also a suite but is not connected to the `` french suites '' .
