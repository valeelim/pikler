Pauropod     pauropods are a type of myriapod . they form the only order in the class pauropoda . about 500 species in four families are found worldwide , living in soil and leaf mold . pauropoda are tiny soil myriapods , 0.5-1.5mm in length , with 8-11 body segments . the body appears to have fewer segments when viewed from above , because the dorsal shields ( tergites ) are fused in pairs . the true segments can be seen from the ventral side , each segment bearing a single pair of walking legs . a characteristic feature of pauropods is their branched antennae .
