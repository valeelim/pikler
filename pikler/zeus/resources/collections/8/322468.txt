Relativism     relativism is the idea that points of view have no absolute truth or validity . they only have relative , subjective value according to viewpoint and circumstances . common statements that might be considered relativistic include : - `` that 's true for you but not for me . '' - `` beauty is in the eye of the beholder . '' - `` you ca n't judge other cultures by the standards of your own . '' there are many forms of relativism . the term often refers to `` truth relativism '' , which is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths , i.e. , that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference , such as a language or a culture ( cultural relativism ) . as `` moral relativism '' , moral principles apply only in a limited context . in context , principles and ethics do hold ; out of context they do not . there are similar ideas in nihilism , scepticism and amoralism . people who agreed with the idea of relativism include paul feyerabend , isaiah berlin and richard rorty . the roman catholic church , especially under john paul ii and pope benedict xvi , has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today .
