Decompression chamber     a decompression chamber is a large container that divers can enter after they have surfaced to help their bodies return to normal atmospheric pressure . it is also called a `` recompression chamber '' or `` hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber '' . when a diver returns to the surface too quickly , he can suffer from decompression sickness ( also know as `` the bends '' . ) to prevent this divers would stop at various points as they returned toward the surface to allow their bodies to adjust to the pressure change . if a driver uses a chamber , the diver will adjust in the chamber rather than stop at various depths underwater . this eliminates many of the risks of long decompressions underwater , in cold or dangerous conditions .
