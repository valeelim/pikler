Magnetic monopole     a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle in particle physics that is a magnet with only one magnetic pole ( a north pole without a south pole or the other way around ) . scientists are interested in this , as they are predicted in several particle theories , such as grand unified and superstring . magnetism in normal bar magnets and electromagnets does not come from magnetic monopoles . there is not enough evidence to even be sure that magnetic monopoles exist in this universe .
