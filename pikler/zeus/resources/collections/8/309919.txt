Allotropes of carbon     graphite is one of the most common allotropes of carbon . unlike diamond , graphite is a conductor , a semimetal ( an element that is partially a metal and a nonmetal , such as black phosphorus and grey selenium ) . it can be used , for instance , as the material in the electrodes of an electrical arc lamp . graphite is the most stable form of solid carbon ever discovered . allotropes are different forms of the same chemical element . all elements are made up uniquely of their own atoms . any physical differences are because of how the atoms are joined together . many elements show allotropy because there are a number of ways in which the atoms can be linked together . also there are different ways in how the molecules can be arranged to make larger structures . diamond is one of the best known allotropes of carbon . its hardness and high dispersion of light make it good for use in jewellery . it is also has industrial uses . diamond is the hardest known natural mineral . this makes it an excellent abrasive . a diamond also holds its luster well . both diamond and graphite have extremely high melting point , which is unusual for nonmetallic element .
