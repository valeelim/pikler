Band gap     a band gap , also called a bandgap or energy gap , is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist . the term is used in solid-state physics and chemistry . band gaps can be found in insulators and semiconductors . in graphs of the electronic band structure of solids , the band gap is the energy difference ( in electron volts ) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band . this is the same as the energy needed to free an outer shell electron from its orbit about the nucleus to become a mobile charge carrier . the free electron is able to move freely within the solid material . so the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid . substances with large band gaps are generally insulators , those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors . conductors either have very small band gaps or no band gap if the energy levels of valence and conduction bands overlap . scientist use the band gap to predict if a solid will conduct electricity . most electrons ( called valance electrons ) are attracted to the nucleus of just one atom . but if an electron has enough energy to fly away from its nearest nucleus , it can join in the flow of electric current across the many atoms that make up the solid . the electrons that are not tightly attached to just one nucleus are called the conduction band .
