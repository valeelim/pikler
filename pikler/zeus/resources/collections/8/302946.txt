HOMO/LUMO     homo stands for highest occupied molecular orbital . lumo stands for lowest unoccupied molecular orbital . the energy difference between the homo and lumo is termed the homo-lumo gap . homo and lumo are sometimes referred to as frontier orbitals . each molecular orbital has a calculated energy level . chemists sort the molecular orbitals ( mos ) by energy levels . chemists assume that the electrons will occupy the lowest energy level mos first . for example , if a molecule has enough electrons to fill 15 mos , the 15 mos with the lowest energy levels will be occupied . the 15th mo on the list would be called the `` highest occupied molecular orbital '' ( homo ) and the 16th mo on the list would be the `` lowest unoccupied molecular orbital '' ( lumo ) . the difference in the homo 's energy level and the lumo 's energy level is called the band gap . the band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule : the smaller the energy , the more easily a molecule 's electrons will be excited . for example , this can help predict whether a substance will have luminescence .
