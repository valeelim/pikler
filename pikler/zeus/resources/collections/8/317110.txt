Mid-Atlantic Ridge     the mid-atlantic ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the atlantic ocean . it is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges . these ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world , all underwater except for short stretches like iceland . on iceland , the mid-atlantic ridge reaches the surface . the ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates , and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year . the mid-atlantic ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length . at the rift , the boundary between tectonic plates , magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor . new magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis . the crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro . the ridge was discovered during the expedition of hms `` challenger '' in 1872. a team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the atlantic . they were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable . the existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925
