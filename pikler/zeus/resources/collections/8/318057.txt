Mountain pygmy possum     the mountain pygmy possum ( `` burramys parvus '' ) is a small , mouse-sized ( weighs 45 g ) nocturnal marsupial of australia . it is found high up ( 1300 to 2230 metres ) in rock screes and boulder fields of southern victoria and in kosciuszko national park , new south wales . this possum is a lazarus taxon , and the only living species in the burramys genus . it is also the only australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat . its prehensile tail , at ~14 cm , is longer than its 11 cm head and body length . its diet consists of insects , fleshy fruits , nuts , nectar and seeds . the mountain pygmy possum was first described as a pleistocene fossil by robert broom in 1896. it was thought to be extinct until 1966 , when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on mount hotham . three geographically isolated populations are known to exist . these populations have been shown to be genetically distinct . for most of the year , males and females live apart from each other . the females live on the better part of the rocky slopes , while the males live on the margins , usually lower on the mountain . in order to breed , the males migrate to the females ' habitat . during the ski season on mount higginbotham , the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy . a `` tunnel of love '' was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers .
