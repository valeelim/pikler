Radiator     a radiator is a device used to move heat from one location to another location . some radiators are used to cool things , such as a car engine . some radiators are used to heat things , such as a house . most cars use a radiator to cool the engine . to produce power , engines must burn a fuel . this creates a lot of heat . if the heat is not removed , the engine will overheat and stop running . the radiator is connected to the engine with hoses . a liquid flows into the engine . heat is moved from the engine to the liquid . the heat moves because of newton 's law of cooling . this law says that heat will move from something hot to something cooler . the liquid then moved into the radiator . the radiator has many small tubes for the liquid to flow through . air moves around to the tubes to cool them . this cools the liquid . the liquid then return to the engine . this is a closed loop . many houses are located in areas that get cold . heat needs to be added to the house so the people are comfortable . a radiator is placed in a room to add heat to the room . the heat is created by a furnace . a heating radiator works just like a cooling radiator . the heat from the furnace moves to the radiator . the room is cooler than the radiator . the heat moves from the radiator into the room to warm the room .
