Brazilian wandering spider     phoneutria is a genus of spiders which are all dangerous to human beings . their venom is more powerful , drop for drop , than other venoms , and , since they are large spiders , they have much of it . they are called `` armed spiders '' in portuguese because their venom is a powerful weapon . their body length goes from 17 to 48 mm ( 0.7â€“1.9 in ) . these spiders live in central america and south america . they hide in the daytime and walk around looking for food at night . so their english name is `` wandering spider . '' there are several species , and only `` phoneutria fera '' can kill healthy adult humans . fortunately , the phoneutria spiders usually do not inject venom when they bite humans , or , if they do inject venom , they do not use much . phoneutria fera spiders are found in the amazon rainforest , so they seldom encounter humans . people who get bitten by phoneutria spiders can be given an antivenom , so those people who come out of the jungle with a bite will be treated and will not die , and those people who die in the jungle may not be reported to the government .
