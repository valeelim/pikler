Colossus computer     colossus was the world 's first programmable electronic digital computer . british codebreakers used colossus to help to read german coded radio messages during world war ii . these messages were sent between the german high command , and adolf hitler 's top army commanders . reading these messages helped the allies to win the war . codebreaker max newman worked at the government code and cypher school ( gc & cs ) at bletchley park . his problem was how to get a machine that would help turn german coded radio teleprinter messages into ordinary language . a group of post office telephone engineers led by tommy flowers worked out how to do this . their design , which was called `` colossus '' used many vacuum tubes ( valves ) . the first machine , mark 1 , worked in december 1943. it solved its first problem at bletchley park on 5 february 1944. colossus mark 2 was even better . it first worked on 1 june 1944 , just before the normandy landings on d-day . ten colossus computers were in use at the end of the war .
