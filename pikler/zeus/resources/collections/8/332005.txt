Joint (geology)    joint ( geology ) in geology , a joint is a fracture dividing rock into two sections that have not moved away from each other . a joint sees little or no displacement . in other kinds of fracturing , like in a fault , the rock is parted by a visible crack that forms a gap in the rock . joints push out in various directions , usually vertically . they can have smooth , clean surfaces , or they can be scarred from sliding against another joint . joints usually occur as sets , with each set made up of joints that are parallel to each other . joints become more and more obvious when the rock is weathered ( eroded by the elements ) . when water gets into the joints , this can lead to the formation of big caves and underground rivers .
