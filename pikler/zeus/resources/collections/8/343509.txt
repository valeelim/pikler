Eastern world     the term eastern world means very broadly the various cultures or social structures and philosophical systems of eastern asia or geographically the eastern culture . this includes the indian subcontinent ( which is bangladesh , bhutan , india , myanmar , pakistan , sri lanka , the maldives , nepal and sometimes afghanistan ) , the far east ( which is china , taiwan , vietnam , cambodia , malaysia , mongolia , indonesia , japan , north korea , south korea ) , australasia ( australia , new zealand ) . the middle east/near east and central asia are , as their names imply , often considered 'east ' in terms of europe the division between `` east '' and `` west '' is from european cultural history . there is a difference between european christendom and the alien cultures beyond it to the east . with the european colonization of the americas the east/west distinction became global . the idea of an eastern , `` indian '' ( indies ) or `` oriental '' sphere was made stronger by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences . such differences were shown by westerners in the scholarly tradition known as orientalism and indology . people from the east are known by certain regions in the west as `` oriental '' . during the cold war , the term `` eastern world '' was sometimes used to mean the eastern bloc , which was the soviet union , china and their communist allies . the term `` western world '' often meant the united states and its nato allies such as the united kingdom . the idea is often another term for the far eastâ€”a region that bears considerable cultural and religious sameness . eastern philosophy , art , literature , and other traditions , are often found throughout the region in places of high importance , such as popular culture , architecture and traditional literature . the spread of buddhism and hindu yoga is partly responsible for this .
