Black powder rocket motor     a black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder . black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal , sulphur , and potassium nitrate . the amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns . the black powder burns very fast . the hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket . this pushes the rocket forward . black powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the chinese . they were first written about in the early 13th century . the rocket motors have gotten better over the years . they have several uses . some can be used as weapons . some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information . some are also used just for fun . black powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes . if they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding . they also do not perform as well if they are bigger . they are made in different sizes called classes . the classes are 1/4 a through e. if the motor needs to be bigger than this , a different type of fuel is used . this is called a composite fuel . some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate .
