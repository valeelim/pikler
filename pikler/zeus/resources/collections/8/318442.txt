Mesosaurus     mesosaurus is an extinct marine reptile from the early permian of southern africa and south america . it was one of the first known marine reptiles , and had many adaptations to a fully aquatic lifestyle . it is usually considered to have been anapsid , although friedrich von huene considered that it was synapsid , and this hypothesis has been revived recently . `` mesosaurus '' was one of the first reptiles to return to the water after early tetrapods came to land in the later devonian . it was around in length , with webbed feet , a streamlined body , and a long tail that may have supported a fin . it probably propelled itself through the water with its long hind legs and flexible tail . its body was also flexible and could easily move sideways , but it had heavily thickened ribs , which would have prevented it from twisting its body . `` mesosaurus '' had a small skull with long jaws . the nostrils were located at the top , allowing the creature to breathe with only the upper side of its head breaking the surface . its teeth were suitable for catching small nektonic prey such as crustaceans .
