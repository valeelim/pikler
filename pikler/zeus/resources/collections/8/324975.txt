Animal colour     animal colour ( or coloration ) is produced by light reflecting from an animal 's surface . the ways animals produce colours include pigments , chromatophores and other structures , and bioluminescence . since sight is usually so important to animals , and is so often used by predators as a long-range way to find prey , an animal 's colour must serve one or more functions . these functions , such as finding prey , or evading capture , or finding a mate , are absolutely essential for life and survival . therefore , animal colour is determined by natural selection because it affects the survival of animals and their offspring . some of the most obvious functions of colour are : 1. camouflage : enabling an animal to remain hidden from view 1. signalling to other animals 1. warning colouration : signalling to other animals not to attack 1. mimicry : taking advantage of another species ' warning coloration 1. sexual selection : finding a mate 1. other kinds of signalling 1. diversion 1. startle defence : unexpected flashes of colour or eyespots
