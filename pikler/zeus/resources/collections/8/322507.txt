Battle of Plassey     the battle of plassey was a major battle that took place on 23 june 1757 at palashi , bengal . it was an important british east india company victory over the nawab of bengal and his french allies . it let the british east india company take control of this part of the indian subcontinent . their area of control grew over a large part of the indies in the next hundred years . the battle took place at palashi , bengal on the river banks of the bhagirathi river . the fighting took place about north of calcutta . this was near murshidabad which was the capital of bengal at the time . plassey is the anglicised version of palashi . the battle was between siraj ud-daulah , the last independent nawab of bengal , and the british east india company . the battle took place after the attack and plunder of calcutta by siraj-ud-daulah and the black hole tragedy ( sir william meredith , during the parliamentary inquiry into robert clive 's actions in india , vindicated siraj ud-daulah of any charges surrounding the black hole incident ) . the troubles between siraj-ud-daulah and the british led to the battle of plassey . the `` trouble '' was that the british strengthened the fortification around the fort william without any intimation and approval ; secondly , they grossly abused the trade privileges granted to them by the mughal rulers , which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government ; and thirdly , that they gave shelter to some of his officers , for example krishnadas , son of rajballav , who fled dhaka after misappropriating government funds . hence , when the east india company started further enhancement of military preparedness at fort william in calcutta , siraj asked them to stop . the company did not heed his directives , so siraj-ud daulah retaliated and captured kolkata ( shortly renamed as alinagar ) from the british in june 1756.the nawab gathered his forces together and took fort william .
