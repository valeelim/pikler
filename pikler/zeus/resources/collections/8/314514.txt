Non-Newtonian fluid     a non-newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the forces on it change . other flow properties may also be affected . most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history . examples of such fluids are blood , quicksand and certain components of cement . many lubricants , ketchup , certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property . the other kind of fluids that do not show this behavior are called newtonian fluids . it is very simple to make your own non-newtonian fluid at home . all you need is water and cornstarch . mix these two ingredients together at a rate of one part cornstarch and one and a half parts water , and then you will have your own non-newtonian fluid . related pages . - mudslide - avalanche
