Woolly rhinoceros     the woolly rhinoceros ( `` coelodonta antiquitatis '' ) was a large mammal species of rhinoceros , now extinct . it was widespread throughout the tundra of northern eurasia during the pleistocene epoch , about 1.8 million years ago until about 10,000 years ago ( the end of the last ice age ) . recently , the earliest known woolly rhino fossil was discovered from 3.6 million years in the himalayas on the cold tibetan plateau . it lived there during a period of general climate warmth around the earth . it is believed that they migrated from there to other parts when the ice age developed . it was well adapted to the cold ; it had thick , shaggy fur , small ears , short legs , and a massive body ( all to lessen heat loss ) . fossils of this early rhino have been found , in addition to well-preserved corpses , which were found in frozen gravel in siberia . stone age humans hunted woolly rhinos ; they drew pictures of the rhinos on cave walls 30,000 years ago , giving us even more information about these large mammals .
