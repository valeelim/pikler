Organometallic chemistry     organometallic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal . it combines aspects of inorganic chemistry ( the study of non-carbon bonds ) and organic chemistry ( the study of carbon bonds ) . examples of organometallic compounds are tetraethyllead ; it was used as a fuel ( leaded gasoline ) additive in the past . also methylcobalamin ( vitamin b ) is a common organometallic compound . organometallic compounds are compounds that have chemical bonds between an one or more metal atoms and one or more carbon atoms of an organyl group ( an organic ligand ) . they have the prefix `` organo- '' ( for example , organopalladium compounds ) . organometallic compounds include subgroups like the metalloproteins such as haemoglobin . the term `` metalorganics '' usually refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands which bind them to an organic compound . metal beta-diketonates , alkoxides , and dialkylamides are members of this class .
