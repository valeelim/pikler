Norm (mathematics)    norm ( mathematics ) in mathematics , the norm of a vector is its length . for the real numbers the only norm is the absolute value . for spaces with more dimensions the norm can be any function formula_1 with 1. scales for real numbers formula_2 , that is formula_3 1. function of sum is less than sum of functions , that is formula_4 or the triangle inequality 1. formula_5 if and only if formula_6 . examples . 1. the one-norm is the sum of absolute values : formula_7 this is like finding the distance from one place on a grid to another by summing together the distances in all directions the grid goes ; see manhattan distance 1. euclidean norm is the sum of the squares of the values : formula_8 1. maximum norm is the maximum absolute value : formula_9
