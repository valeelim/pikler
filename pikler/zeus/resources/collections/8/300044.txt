Heat index     the `` heat index '' ( hi , also `` humiture '' ) is a measurement which combines air temperature and relative humidity as being the human-perceived equivalent temperature â€” how hot it feels . the result is also known as the `` felt air temperature '' or `` apparent temperature '' . for example , when the temperature is with very high humidity , the heat index can be about . the human body normally cools itself by perspiration , or sweating , which evaporates and carries heat away from the body . however , when the relative humidity is high , then the evaporation rate is reduced , so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate , causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air . measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity , allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination , to another , at a higher temperature in drier air . the heat index was developed in 1978 by george winterling as the `` humiture '' and was adopted by the national weather service a year later . it is derived from work carried out by robert g. steadman . like the wind chill index , the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height , clothing , amount of physical activity , thickness of blood , sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure , and the wind speed . large deviations from the typical values will result in heat-index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature .
