Tiberius Gracchus     tiberius sempronius gracchus ( 163/162 bc- 133 bc ) was an important roman tribune of the plebs . he proposed a reform called the `` lex sempronia agraria '' . this was meant to reduce the number of poor and homeless people by allowing the rich to have only a certain amount of land . the rest of the land would be given to homeless veterans of the roman military . but the roman senate did not like his plan . they convinced another tribune , named marcus octavius , to oppose tiberius gracchus . eventually , enough tension built up that some of the senators beat tiberius to death with their chairs and threw his dead body into the tiber . tiberius ' death is seen as the first death caused by political problems in the roman government . tiberius ' brother , gaius gracchus , also tried to reform the roman government and was also killed . together , the two are called the gracchi . their attempts at reform had a lasting effect on rome , because later on the senate used some of the ideas from their reforms in their own laws .
