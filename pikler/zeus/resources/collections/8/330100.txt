Marot jar     a marot jar is a special kind of syphon or siphon device invented some time during the 1700s . the device is filled up water and lets it out in a special way so that the speed and amount of water that comes out is always the same , even if the jar is completely full or almost empty . in the diagram ( see right ) , an air-tight jar contains some water ( blue ) and some air ( yellow ) . the green pipe is started as a siphon so that water starts flowing out of the pipe . because the pipe lets out water , the pressure on the inside of the jar is less than the pressure outside , so it causes air to be sucked in through the orange pipe . because the pressure is going to tend to being the same inside and outside of the jar , the water is going to flow out of the pipe at the same speed and amount .
