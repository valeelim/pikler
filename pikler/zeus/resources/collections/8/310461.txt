Neurospora     neurospora is a genus of ascomycete fungi . the best known species in this genus is neurospora crassa , a common model organism in genetics and molecular biology . the first published account of this fungus was from an infestation of french bakeries in 1843 . `` n. crassa '' is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring . analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in `` neurospora '' ascospores . its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced . `` neurospora '' was used by edward tatum and george wells beadle in their experiments for which they won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1958. beadle and tatum exposed `` n. crassa '' to x-rays , causing mutations . they then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes . this led them to propose the `` one gene , one enzyme '' hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins . their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by norman horowitz , also working on `` neurospora '' .
