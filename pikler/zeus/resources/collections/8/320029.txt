Undulator     an undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation , a synchrotron storage ring . it consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets . a static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1 . electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations . so the electrons give off energy as electronmagnetic radiation . the radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum . the light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons . this radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas . the important dimensionless parameter formula_2 where `` e '' is the particle charge , `` b '' is the magnetic field , `` formula_3 '' , `` formula_4 '' is the electron rest mass and `` c '' is the speed of light , characterizes the nature of the electron motion . for formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands . if formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently , leading to a broad energy spectrum . when k is much bigger than 1 , the device is no longer called an `` undulator '' ; it is called a wiggler .
