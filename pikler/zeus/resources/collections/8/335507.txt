Orion (mythology)    orion ( mythology ) in greek mythology , orion is a giant hunter . when he goes hunting , his dogs sirius and procycon accompany him . he lived in boeotia and crete . people do not agree about his parents : sometimes he is said to be the son of poseidon and the gorgon euryale , at other times , he is said to have three fathers , poseidon , zeus and either hermes or ares . all three mixed their perm in a bag of animal hide . zeus gave him his craving for erotic adventures , from poseidon , he got the ability to walk on water . he is married to side , but hera cast his wife into the tartaros , because side was too proud of her own beauty . in greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in homer 's epic the `` odyssey '' , where odysseus sees his shade in the underworld . the bare bones of his story are told by the hellenistic and roman collectors of myths , but there is no literary version of his adventures . other heroes ' stories are told , for example jason in apollonius of rhodes ' `` argonautica '' or euripides ' `` medea '' . the entry in ovid 's `` fasti '' for may 11 is a poem on the birth of orion , but that is one version of a single story . the surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about greek prehistory and myth .
