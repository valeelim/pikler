Siméon Denis Poisson     siméon denis poisson ( 21 june 1781 in pithiviers - 25 april 1840 in sceaux , near paris ) was a french mathematician and physicist . from 1798 he studied mathematics at the école polytechnique , where he met pierre-simon laplace and joseph-louis lagrange . in 1802 he became professor , in 1806 he took the position jean baptiste joseph fourier had before him . napoleon sent fourier to grenoble . poisson was a disciple of laplace . poisson worked on the mathematical bases of wave theory , acoustics , elasticity , electricity and heat . he was also interested in the electric properties of solids . in 1812 , he published his extension of laplace 's equation , which allowed its use for electric charge at the surface of solids . in the year 1818 , he predicted the existence of a phenomenon called the poisson spot , in the case that light should have the character of a wave . poisson thought that was not the case and that it had the character of particles . he had long discussions with augustin-jean fresnel , who thought that light was indeed a wave . this discussion only ended when fresnel could show the existence of the spot poisson had predicted in an experiment . in 1838 , poisson published his ideas on probability theory , which also included what is now known as poisson distribution . this distribution was already known to abraham de moivre .
