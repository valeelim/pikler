Calico cat     calico cat is an american name for cats with three colors . outside of north america they are usually called tortoiseshell cats or 'tortie-and-white ' . a calico cat has a coat of orange or brown and black spots on a white background . it is not a breed of cat . nearly all calico cats are female . there are male calico cats , but they are very rare . a single x chromosome can have either a black allele of the coloration gene or an orange version , but not both . however , a female cat has two x chromosomes , so it can have both versions , black on one chromosome and orange on the other , making the cat a calico . a male cat usually has one x chromosome and one y chromosome . a y chromosome does not have a color gene , so the cat can have either an orange or a black gene , but not both . calico cats are often used as an example in biology classes when discussing sex chromosomes . during the early stages of development , when the cat is still an embryo , in each cell one of the x chromosomes ( either the black one or the orange one ) deactivates . it is called x-inactivation . all cells that were copied from a cell with a deactivated x chromosome will also have the same x chromosome deactivated . this is what leads to formation of the spots . the earlier in development the x chromosomes deactivate , the larger the spots will be . deactivation of one of the x chromosomes happens in all female mammals . the white coloring on a calico is from a separate gene unrelated to the orange or black genes . whether or not a cat is a calico is determined by genetics , but the actual layout of the spots is not . the layout of the spots is almost random . it is not possible to selectively breed or clone calico cats : an attempt to clone a calico cat will produce a black and white cat or orange and white tabby cat . the tortoiseshell cat is similar , although on a tortoiseshell cat the spots are usually smaller and closer together and there is less or no white .
