Bullet-proof glass     bullet-proof glass , or bullet-resistant glass , is a type of strong , clear material that resists bullets . complete protection against all weapons is not possible . it is usually made from two or more types of material , one hard and one soft . the softer layer makes the glass more elastic , so it can flex ( bend ) instead of shatter . there must be a clear view through the glass . bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches . a popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass . this 'security laminate ' bonds to the glass with an adhesive . this gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass . transparency is better , tint-free ; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70 % . the laminate can be stuck on to existing windows ; this a called a 'retrofit ' . the plastic provides little bullet-resistance . glass , much harder than plastic , flattens the bullet . the plastic deforms , absorbing energy and ( perhaps ) stopping the bullet . the ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness . bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick .
