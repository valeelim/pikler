Dendritic cell     dendritic cells ( dcs ) are white blood cells forming part of the mammalian immune system . they process antigen material from pathogens and put it on their surface . there it touches other cells of the immune system . so , dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells . they act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems . dendritic cells are present in tissues in contact with the external environment . these tissues are the skin , and the inner lining of the nose , lungs , stomach and intestines . they can also be found in an immature state in the blood . dedritic cells develop from monocytes , white blood cells which circulate in the body . depending on the signal , monocytes turn into either dendritic cells or macrophages . the monocytes are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow . immature dendritic cells constantly sample their surrounds for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria . this is done through pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) such as the toll-like receptors ( tlrs ) .
