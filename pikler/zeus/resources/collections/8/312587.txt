Quill     a quill pen is a tool used for writing , made from a flight feather of a large bird . quills were used for writing with ink before other pens were invented . they are still used in calligraphy sometimes . today , most paper is made from wood plulp . such papers use the quill rather rapidly . the hollow shaft of the feather ( the `` calamus '' ) acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip by capillary action .
