PPSh-41     the ppsh-41 ( `` pistolet-pulemyot shpagina '' ; ; `` shpagin machine pistol '' ) is a soviet submachine gun . it was designed by georgi shpagin . the ppsh-41 was supposed to be a cheaper , simpler gun to use than the ppd-40 . the ppd-40 was in soviet service at that time . the ppsh-41 officially replaced the ppd-40 in 1941. the ppsh-41 was supposed to be used by conscripted soldiers with very little training . the ppsh-41 got its ammunition from a magazine . it was also a selective fire submachine gun . it was made mostly of stamped steel . it fired the 7.62Ã—25mm pistol round . the ppsh-41 was used a lot during world war ii and the korean war , as it was the most produced smg throughout the wars . it was still in use in vietnam with the viet cong as late as 1970 as the chinese type 50 ( a copy ) . there were even some ppsh-41 's captured by us soldiers as late as the iraq war . the idea for the development of the ppsh-41 came partly from the winter war against finland . it was found in this war that submachine guns were good weapons for close-quarters combat . the ppsh-41 was developed in mid-1941 . it was made in many factories in moscow . local party members were made responsible for making sure enough ppsh-41s were made .
