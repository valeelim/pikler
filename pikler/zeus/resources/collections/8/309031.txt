Platyzoa     the platyzoa ( `` flat animals '' ) are a group of protostomes proposed by thomas cavalier-smith in 1998. this is a taxon above the level of phylum , and is not part of the usual system of classification . cavalier-smith included here the platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , and a new phylum acanthognatha , into which he gathered several previously described phyla of microscopic animals . subsequent studies have supported platyzoa as a viable clade , while differing on the phyla included and on relationships within platyzoa .
