Terrazzo     terrazzo is a building material that has the cross-section of polished rock chips decorating its appearance . it is a composite material made up of chips surrounded by a binder . it is poured in place or precast . it is used for floors or walls . it consists of marble , quartz , granite , glass or other suitable chips , sprinkled or unsprinkled , and poured with a binder that is cement-like , chemical or a combination of both . terrazzo is cured , ground and polished to a smooth surface . sometimes , it is finished to produce a uniformly textured surface that is not flat . terrazzo artisans create walkways , floors , patios , and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin . much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons . marble-chip , cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials . first , cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid , level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches ( 7.6 cm to 10 cm ) deep . after the forms are removed from the foundation , workers add a 1-inch ( 2.54 cm ) layer of sandy concrete . before this layer sets , terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo . for the final layer , terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented . while the mixture is still wet , workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a lightweight roller over the entire surface .
