Riversleigh     riversleigh in north west queensland , australia , is one of the australian fossil mammal sites listed by unesco as a world heritage site . the other is the naracoorte caves national park in south australia . the riversleigh site is part of the boodjamulla national park . the fossil site covers an area of about 100 kmÂ² . the fossils that have been found are the remains of ancient mammals , birds and reptiles of oligocene and miocene epochs . the site was listed as a world heritage site in 1994. the fossils at riversleigh are rare because they are found in soft freshwater limestone which has not been compressed . this means the animal remains retain their three dimensional shape . fossils at riversleigh are found in limestone by lime-rich freshwater pools , and in caves . they are from when the ecosystem was evolving from rich rainforest to semi-arid grassland . thirty-five fossil bat species have been found at the site , which is the richest in the world . a skull , complete with all its teeth , of a 15 million-year-old monotreme , `` obdurodon dicksoni '' , shows how this australia group of animals evolved . fossil ancestors of the extinct thylacine , `` thylacinus cynocephalus '' , have also been found at riversleigh . in 1993 , `` nimbadon '' skulls were found in newly discovered cave . scientists think this prehistoric marsupial first appeared about 15 million years ago and died out about 12 million years ago , perhaps from the effects of climate change . other fossils have shown how the koala has changed in response to australia 's change from rainforest to drier eucalypt forests .
