Chondroitin sulfate     chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan ( gag ) . it is a chain of alternating sugars ( n-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid ) . it is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan . a chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars , each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities . chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its resistance to compression . along with glucosamine , chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis . it is commonly extracted from shark cartilage . chondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before chemists learned its structure . so , its name changed over time . early researchers identified different types of the substance with letters . `` chondroitin sulfate b '' is an old name for dermatan sulfate , and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate . `` chondroitin '' , without the `` sulfate '' , has been used to describe a type with little or no sulfation . however , this distinction is not used by all .
