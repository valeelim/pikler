Molecular symmetry     molecular symmetry is a basic idea in chemistry . it is about the symmetry of molecules . it puts molecules into groups according to their symmetry . it can predict or explain many of a molecule 's chemical properties . chemists study symmetry to explain how crystals are made up and how chemicals react . the molecular symmetry of the reactants help predict how the product of the reaction is made up and the energy needed for the reaction . molecular symmetry can be studied several different ways . group theory is the most popular idea . group theory is also useful in studying the symmetry of molecular orbitals . this is used in the hückel method , ligand field theory , and the woodward–hoffmann rules . another idea on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials . scientists find molecular symmetry by using x-ray crystallography and other forms of spectroscopy . spectroscopic notation is based on facts taken from molecular symmetry .
