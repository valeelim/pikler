Inflow     an inflow is a river that leads to a lake or some other body of water . the inflow gives the lake a supply of water . if lakes have no way of getting water added to them , they will eventually dry up through evaporation . some lakes are big enough that they can stay full through rain instead of inflows . an example of such a lake is the great salt lake in utah .
