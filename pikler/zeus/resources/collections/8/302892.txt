Dyotropic reaction     a dyotropic reaction is a type of chemical reaction . it is when an organic compound changes its structure . two substituents jump from one place on the molecule to another . it is a pericyclic valence isomerization when two sigma bonds move at the same time to a new place on the same molecule . dyotropic reactions are important in organic chemistry . they can explain how certain reactions work . dyotropic reactions can be a useful step in making large and complicated molecules . dyotropic reactions were first described by manfred t. reetz in 1971. the name `` dyotropic reaction '' comes from the greek word `` dyo '' meaning `` two . '' `` rearrangement '' means that the reaction changes the bonds between atoms on a single molecule . in a type i reaction , two migrating groups trade their relative positions . a type ii reaction involves migration to new bonding sites without positional interchange . in type i rearrangements ( y-a-b-x conversion to x-a-b-y ) , the two migrating groups are oriented trans to each other . the reaction leaves both groups on the opposite sides . the first example of a dyotropic rearrangement involving a carbon-carbon bond was reported by cyril a. grob and saul winstein . they saw the exchange of two bromine atoms in a certain steroid .
