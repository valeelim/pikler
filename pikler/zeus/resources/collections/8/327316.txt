Magnetic pendulum     a magnetic pendulum is an experiment where a metal ball on a thread ( a pendulum ) can be influenced by a number of magnets on the ground . the length of the rope is such that the ball can not touch the magnets , but is still influenced by them . if the ball is moved , its movement will be influenced by both gravitation and the fields the magnets generate . if the movement is so large that the ball can get outside the influence of the magnets , the resulting movement will look irregular . while it is deterministic , it will depend on the starting conditionsâ€”that is the position of the ball at the start . this has been called deterministic chaos .
