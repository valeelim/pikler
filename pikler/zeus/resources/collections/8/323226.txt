Grammatical person     in grammar , a person is the way of referring to someone taking part in an event , such as the person talking , the person being talked to , the person being talked about . grammatican persons are accomplished by pronouns , words used to take the place of a noun , in order to make speech easier . the first person is the speaker referring to himself or herself . the second person is the person whom someone is speaking to or writing to . very few nouns are second-person nouns because people do not usually talk directly to things like tables . in fact , in english , just about the only kind of nouns that are second-person is a small group of pronouns that can be seen in the table below . sometimes , a person 's name is used in the second person , but that 's usually just with a baby . for example , instead of saying `` you sit here '' , one could say `` charlie sits here '' . in english grammar , people do not usually have to do anything special to the verb if they use a second-person noun as a subject . in fact , the verb `` be '' is the only verb that has a special form for the second person : `` are '' . in other languages such as french though , verbs change in different ways to match the subject . in this table , `` tu '' and `` vous '' are the second-person pronouns . we can see how the verb `` parler '' ( talk ) changes when people use them .
