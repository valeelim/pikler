Reference ellipsoid     a reference ellipsoid is an ellipsoid which is used as a frame of reference for geodetic calculations . it is a figure like the shape of the earth . it is easier to work with than the geoid , which is another shape like that of the earth . it is relatively easy to describe the reference ellipsoid using mathematical formulae . describing the geoid is much more complex , as it results from precise measurements . the first such models were spheres , used since ancient greece . in the 17th century , there were doubts that the earth was a sphere . in 1688 , isaac newton solved a controversy with giovanni domenico cassini by demonstrating mathematically that the rotation of the earth would lead to a flattening around the area of the poles , and not at the equator . in practice this was shown by pierre bouguer and alexis-claude clairaut half a century later . the two had done an expedition to peru and lapland ( 1735-1741 ) . their measurement of the meridian arc lead to the definition of the metre . this was the ten-millionth part of the idealized distance between the pole and the equator , 1791. because of different errors in measurement , it turned out to be 0.022 % too short , and was redefined twice , in 1793 , and 1799. the value of 1799 is still the official definition but it is about 0.197â€° too short .
