Functional magnetic resonance imaging     functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) is a special type of mri that makes it possible to watch different areas of a person 's brain while they do different tasks . a functional mri shows the use of oxygen in different brain areas . the deoxyhemoglobin in blood absorbs a radiowave signal and later emits it ( sends it back out ) . oxyhemoglobin does not . when an area of the brain is active , the blood flow to that area increases and more oxyhemoglobin is delivered to supply the active cells with oxygen . this means less of the signal is absorbed . an active area of the brain absorbs and emits less energy than a less active area . this can be seen live as it is happening when different areas of the brain 'light up ' on the images as they become less active . related pages . - medical test - radiography other websites . - columbia university - about fmri ( general ) - oxford centre for functional mri of the brain
