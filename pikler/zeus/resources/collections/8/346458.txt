Gaussian elimination     in mathematics , gaussian elimination ( also called row reduction ) is a method used to solve systems of linear equations . it is named after carl friedrich gauss , a famous german mathematician who wrote about this method , but did not invent it . to perform gaussian elimination , the coefficients of the terms in the system of linear equations are used to create a type of matrix called an augmented matrix . then , elementary row operations are used to simplify the matrix . the three types of row operations used are : the goal of gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in `` row-echelon form '' . if a matrix is in row-echelon form , that means that reading from left to right , each row will start with at least one more zero term than the row above it . some definitions of gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in `` reduced row-echelon form '' . that means that the matrix is in row-echelon form and the only non-zero term in each row is 1. gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called gauss-jordan elimination .
