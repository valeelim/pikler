Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit     daniel gabriel fahrenheit ( 1686-1736 ) was a german physicist . he became known for the precise instruments he made . the degree fahrenheit is named after him . he was the first to be able to determine the temperature with precision . his thermometers used ethyl alcohol at first , but he later switched to using mercury . when he read an article by guillaume amontons about using mercury in barometers , he got the idea of using that substance for his thermometers . he calinbrated them to a temperature he could produce easily , -17.8 c. in the year 1721 he discovered that water can be cooled below its freezing point without actually turning into ice . fahrenheit also developed a hydrometer , a pycnometer and a hypsobarometer
