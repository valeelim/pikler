Adhesion     adhesion is the process in which dissimilar particles stick together . in the case of similar particles , this effect is called cohesion . adhesion results from the physical properties of the interface between two phases . the forces that result in adhesion are not fully known , there are different explanations . five different types of adhesion have been proposed : - mechanical adhesion : adhesive materials fill the voids or pores , and interlock - chemical adhesion : where they join , two materials form a chemical compound . - dispersive adhesion : two materials are held together by van der waals forces - electrostatic adhesion : two materials are held together by electrostatic charge - diffusive adhesion : two materials are held together with atomic diffusion
