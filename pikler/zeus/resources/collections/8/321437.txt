Magnetic moment     the magnetic moment of a magnet is a quantity that determines the force that the magnet can exert on electric currents and the torque that a magnetic field will exert on it . a loop of electric current , a bar magnet , an electron , a molecule , and a planet all have magnetic moments . both the magnetic moment and magnetic field may be considered to be vectors having a magnitude and direction . the direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of a magnet . the magnetic field produced by a magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment as well . more precisely , the term `` magnetic moment '' normally refers to a system 's magnetic dipole moment , which produces the first term in the multipole expansion of a general magnetic field . the dipole component of an object 's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment , and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object . in text books , two complementary approaches are used to define magnetic moments . in pre-1930 's textbooks , they were defined using magnetic poles . most recent textbooks define it in terms of amp√®rian currents .
