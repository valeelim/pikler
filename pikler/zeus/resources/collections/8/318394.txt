Short circuit     a short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch . a short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit . this high current can destroy components , melt insulation and start a fire . if there is enough voltage , it can also cause an explosion called arc flash . circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and ( usually ) shut the power off before any damage can be done . a `` short circuit '' also happens when there is a bypass of electrical current . as electricity is `` lazy '' , when there is a bypass without a `` load '' ( e.g.bulb ) , it prefers to travel that route .
