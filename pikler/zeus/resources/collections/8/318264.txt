V-1 flying bomb     the v-1 flying bomb ( also called the buzz bomb or doodlebug ) was a world war ii weapon . it was a flying bomb that used a jet engine to make it travel at 350 mph ( 600 kmph ) . the luftwaffe people who controlled it pointed it at london , uk and antwerp in belgium . v-1s destroyed nearly as many houses as the blitz did but killed fewer : 22,892 people died after being attacked by them . the allies tried to stop these attacks by bombing their launching places , by shooting at them in the air , and by flying fast planes close to them and nudging them off course using their wings . they had a fairly crude guidance system . overall , only about 25 per cent of v-1s hit their targets . most were lost lost by defensive measures , mechanical unreliability or guidance errors . related pages . - v-2 rocket
