Acoelomorpha     the acoelomorpha are a group of animals with features that were once put in the phylum platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) . in 2004 molecular studies showed that this was wrong . now it is clear that their closest relatives are the xenoturbellida , and the two groups make up the proposed new phylum , the xenacoelomorpha . most researchers believe them to be basal among the bilateria , slightly more derived than the cnidaria . recent results suggest that they ( along with `` xenoturbella '' ) may lie near the base of the deuterostomes . an ongoing collaborative research project has `` the researchers ... confident that they can reach an agreement about where acoels fit in evolutionary history '' . acoels are almost entirely marine , living between grains of sediment , swimming as plankton , or crawling on algae . acoels have a statocyst , which presumably helps them orient to gravity . their soft bodies make them difficult to classify .
