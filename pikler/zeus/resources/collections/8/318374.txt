Knob and tube wiring     knob and tube wiring ( abbreviated k & t ) was an early type of electrical wiring . it was commonly used from the 1880s to the early 1940s , and is occasionally , but very rarely , still used today . in knob and tube wiring , wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic `` knobs '' , and were protected by ceramic `` tubes '' when they went through a piece of wood . wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire . a material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box , which usually contained an outlet , switch , or light fixture . splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape . the insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt . to prevent short circuits , the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart . this is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits . knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets . most electrical codes allow the use of a gfci to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire .
