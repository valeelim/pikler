Greenstone belt     greenstone belts are large regions of very ancient metamorphosed volcanic rocks . the name comes from the green colour of the minerals in the rocks . chlorite , actinolite and other green amphiboles are the typical green minerals . greenstone belts were originally formed of igneous rocks , such as basalt . the belts formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and in volcanic island arcs . they may be several thousand kilometres long . later , they were metamophosed , with minor sedimentary rocks in-between the volcanic formations . those greenstone belts which formed in ancient oceans are now found on land in archaean and proterozoic cratons between granite and gneiss bodies . the rocks are mafic , meaning they are high in magnesium and silica .
