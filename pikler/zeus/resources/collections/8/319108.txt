Battle of Messines     the battle of messines was a battle which happened in the western front of the first world war . it began on 7 june 1917 when the british second army , which was commanded by general herbert plumer , attacked near the village of mesen ( messines ) in west flanders , belgium . the attack was meant to capture a ridge which ran north from messines village , past wytschaete village . this ridge was a natural place where you could keep safe southeast of ypres . one thing which happened during the battle which was unusual was that 19 mines were set off just before the infantry attack . this was a tactic which made german defences disorganised . this allowed the troops to do what they were supposed to do very quickly . the attack also came before the much larger battle , the third battle of ypres , usually known as passchendaele , which began on 31 july 1917 .
