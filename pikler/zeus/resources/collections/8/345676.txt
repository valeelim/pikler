Scientific model     a scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality . scientific models are used as a basis for scientific work . they can be used to explain , predict , and test , or to develop computer programs or mathematical equations . an example of a complex model is the software used for weather forecasts . the program is based on equations for the variables which affect weather . meteorological data is fed in , and the program produces predictions ( graphs and data ) of future weather patterns . a scientific model represents complex objects , events , and physical processes in a logical way . - they are an image of an original , which can be a model itself . - scientific models only have those details of the object or image modeled that are relevant . - there is no strict mapping between a model , and the original object it models . models may be valid only for a given time interval , for a given object , or for a given purpose . for instance , models of our universe are part of astrophysics - the biggest things in nature - and physics - the smallest . this is not usually what we mean by nature , however . we mean the models studied in biology , ecology , economics , environmental health and healing . most models of nature are of things that humans really affect directly , and which affect humans back :
