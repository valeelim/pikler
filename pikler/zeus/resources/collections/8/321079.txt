Microbial cyst     a microbial cyst is a resting or dormant stage of a microorganism , usually a bacterium or a protist or rarely an invertebrate animal , that helps the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions . it can be thought of as a state of suspended animation in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed down and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion . `` encystment '' also helps the microbe to spread easily , from one host to another or to a better environment . when the encysted microbe reaches an environment good for its growth and survival , the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as `` excystation '' . unfavorable environmental conditions trigger the making of a cyst . these include the lack of nutrients or oxygen , extreme temperatures , lack of moisture and presence of toxic chemicals , which are not good for the growth of the microbe . different organisms have cyst walls made of different things . the cyst walls of bacteria are formed by the thickening of the normal cell wall with added peptidoglycan layers . the walls of protozoan cysts are made of chitin , a type of glycoprotein . nematode cyst walls are made of chitin reinforced by collagen .
