Disc-detainer lock     a disc-detainer lock , also called a disc-tumbler , abloy lock , or simply disc lock is a high-security keyed lock that uses a set of discs similar to those used in a combination lock . the difference is that the discs are rotated by a key instead of a dial . when the key is put into the lock , it rotates a set of discs with notches on them to different positions depending on the depth of the cuts in the key . the right key will line up a set of notches in a straight line , allowing a bar to fall into the notches , opening the lock . the wrong key will not put the notches in a straight line , and the bar will not fall , preventing the lock from opening . on high-end disc-detainer locks ( such as abloy ) , there are usually `` false '' notches on the disc as well . these feel like the real notch to someone trying to pick the lock , but do not allow the bar to fall . this makes it nearly impossible to pick the lock . it is possible to pick some lower-end disc-detainer locks . the disc-detainer mechanism usually does not contain any springs . this reduces the amount of wear on the cylinder .
