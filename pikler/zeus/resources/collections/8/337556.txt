Sibling species     sibling species are species which look alike , but can not breed with each other . the classic case is `` drosophila pseudoobscura '' and `` d. persimilis '' . they are almost identical , but if flies from one species are put with flies from the other species , they do not interbreed . another example was the european mosquito known as `` anopheles maculipennis '' . this turned out to be a cluster of six different species , some of which transmit malaria , and some do not .
