Cycloaddition     a cycloaddition is a chemical reaction between reactants with double bonds that get replaced by a ring structure . it is a pericyclic chemical reaction where `` two or more unsaturated molecules ( or parts of the same molecule ) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity . '' it is a cyclization reaction : it makes new ring of atoms . cycloadditions are named by the basic size of the molecules that are being brought together . this would make the diels–alder reaction a [ 4 + 2 ] cycloaddition , and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition . this type of reaction is a non-polar addition reaction . heat can cause the double bonds to form a ring . thermal cycloadditions usually have ( 4n + 2 ) π electrons participating in the starting material , for some whole number `` n '' . because of orbital symmetry , most cycloadditions are suprafacial-suprafacial . rarely , they are antarafacial-antarafacial . there are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n π electrons ( for example the [ 2 + 2 ] cycloaddition ) . these proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense . for example , the dimerisation of ketene has a orthogonal set of p orbitals . those p orbitals allow the reaction to proceed using a crossed transition state .
