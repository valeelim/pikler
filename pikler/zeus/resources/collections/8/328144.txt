LGBT rights in Palestine     in the palestinian territories , there are no laws that specifically protect lgbt people . no laws protect lgbt people from discrimination ( not being treated equally because they are lgbt ) or harassment . however , the basic law of the palestinian constitution does give all palestinians certain freedoms . for example , it covers freedom of belief , freedom of expression , and freedom of bodily integrity . it also gives palestinians freedom from discrimination `` because of race , sex , color , religion , political views , or disability '' . the basic law also protects people 's human rights . in other countries , people have used these types of laws and freedoms to argue that lgbt rights should exist . however , hundreds of gay palestinians have left and moved to israel because they did not feel welcome or safe in palestinian-ruled areas . homosexuality has not been decriminalized in all of palestine . ( this means that homosexuality is still illegal in parts of palestine . ) in 1951 , same-sex acts were decriminalized in the west bank , which was ruled by jordan . same-sex acts are still decriminalized there today . on the other hand , in the gaza strip , same-sex acts between men were made illegal in 1936 , by the british mandate criminal code ordinance , no . 74. this law is still in place , so same-sex acts between men are still illegal there . lesbian women are not covered by this law .
