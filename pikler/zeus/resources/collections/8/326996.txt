Greek chorus     the greek chorus was part of ancient greek theatre . it was a group of masked performers who looked alike , and spoke all at the same time . all the chorus wore identical masks , because they represented the same character or group of characters . worn by the chorus , the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity , a kind of single organism . the style was to comment on what was happening in the play , and help the audience know what a character was thinking . the chorus offered background information , summaries and comments . in many of these plays , the chorus told the audience what the main characters could not say , such as their hidden fears or secrets . bear in mind that faces could not be seen , as performers wore masks , and the audience was at a distance . the chorus usually sang , or spoke . it made up for the fact that there were only one , two or three actors , who played several parts each ( changing masks ) . before the introduction of several actors by aeschylus , the greek chorus was the main performer opposite a solitary actor . the importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century bc , when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action . later dramatists depended less on the chorus .
