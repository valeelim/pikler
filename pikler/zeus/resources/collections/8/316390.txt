Contemporary art     contemporary art means modern art done after 1945. another term , which really means the same thing , is postmodern art . yet another term , which goes wider than art , is postmodernism . this problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern ' in art was used for some art from the mid-victorian period through the whole 20th century . it covers a wide range of styles and movements . so when art critics wanted to describe post-wwii art they had to use a different word . thus , in art , 'contemporary ' ( which really means 'at the same time as ' ) comes to mean 'modern ' , and modern comes to mean 'earlier ' .
