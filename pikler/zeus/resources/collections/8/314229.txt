Lacewing     lacewings , or 'green lacewings ' , are insects in the large family chrysopidae of the order neuroptera . there are about 85 genera and ( differing between sources ) 1,300â€“2,000 species in this widespread group . however , in america and europe , the two genera `` chrysopa '' and `` chrysoperla '' are very common . most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators , and are often used for biological control . many adults of `` chrysopa '' can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax . they have 'ears ' at the base of their front wings . when they hear bat echolocation sounds , they close their wings and drop down . they can escape spider webs , because , being so light , they do not create much vibration to alert the spider . instead of struggling like most insects , the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae . when it is stuck only by its wings , it become completely immobile . slowly , the lacewing slides downwards out of the web . tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings ' surface .
