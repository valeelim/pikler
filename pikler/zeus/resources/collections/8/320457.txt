Weber (unit)    weber ( unit ) in physics , the weber ( symbol : wb ; , , or ) is the si unit of magnetic flux . a `` flux density '' of one wb/m ( one weber per square meter ) is one tesla . the weber is named for the german physicist wilhelm eduard weber ( 1804–1891 ) . the weber may be defined in terms of faraday 's law , which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop . a change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt ( produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open-circuited terminals ) . officially , weber ( unit of magnetic flux ) — the weber is the magnetic flux which , linking a circuit of one turn , would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second . in si base units , the dimensions of the weber are ( kg·m ) / ( s·a ) . many times , the weber is expressed in terms of other derived units as the tesla-square meter ( t·m ) , volt-seconds ( v·s ) , or joules per ampere ( j/a ) .
