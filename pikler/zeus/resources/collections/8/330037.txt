Aṉangu     anangu , aṉaŋu or arnangu ( pronounced with the stress on the first syllable : ) , is a word used to refer to aboriginal people in australia . it is found in some dialects of the western desert language ( wdl ) of western and central australia . before european people arrived in central australia , the word probably meant 'human being ' , or 'person ' . but now it is used to mean 'aboriginal person ' only . because other aboriginal languages have their own words for ' ( aboriginal ) person ' the word `` anangu '' is mostly used in english to refer to the wdl-speaking people . used in this way , it is not used to refer to any traditional grouping ( or tribe ) , but to the wdl people as a whole . the correct term for `` black person '' in pitjantjatjara is `` '' , literally `` dark/black person '' . other western desert language dialects have different words with a similar meaning and many uses . in the far west of the wdl ( i.e . amongst manyjilyjarra , kartujarra , putijarra and warnman ) the word `` martu '' is used , and in the central western desert ( i.e . amongst the western pintupi ) the word `` purntu '' , although this seems to be rarely used now .
