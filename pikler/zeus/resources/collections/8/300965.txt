Boomerang (roller coaster)    boomerang ( roller coaster ) boomerang is a coaster type made by vekoma , named after the original boomerang . the first boomerang began operation in 1984 at rafaela padilla in puebla , méxico ( which has since been moved to six flags méxico ) , and it has become one of the most repeated roller coaster designs in the world , with 41 boomerangs operating as of 2011 , another two `` standing but not operating '' or in storage , and one currently under construction . the boomerang operates with one train with 7 cars , each capable of carrying 4 people ( 28 people per train ) . the ride starts with the train being pulled backwards out of the station , up a lift hill by a catch-car . when the catch-car reaches the end of the lift hill , it releases the train , which rolls down through the station , then into a cobra roll . after the cobra roll , it goes through a loop after which it clicks onto a chain on the second lift hill . when the train reaches the end of the second lift hill , the chain is moved down , which causes the train to roll down ( as it is not attached to the chain anymore ) and do the same track backwards .
