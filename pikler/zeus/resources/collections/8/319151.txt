WYSIWYM     wysiwym is an acronym that stands for what you see is what you mean . this was positioned to not be confused with wysiwyg ( what you see is what you get ) . the idea behind wysiwyg is to display text on screen in much the same way as they will appear when printed on paper . wysiwym is different from this : the content is structured . when the content is entered , this meaning is added to the text . this will mean that presentation is separated from the content . the content is translated before it is rendered . this also means that it can be translated differently , the same content can lead to different output formats . more importantly though , the person editing the document can focus on the content , and is not easily distracted by what the content looks like . one of the drawbacks of the method is that the user is forced to think ahead . latex is an example of a document processing system that uses wysiwym .
