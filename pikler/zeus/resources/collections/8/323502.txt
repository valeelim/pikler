Airport terminal     an airport terminal is a building at an airport . it is where passengers are able to get on and off aircraft . inside the terminal , passengers can buy tickets , leave or pick up their luggage , and be checked by security staff . the buildings that provide access to the airplanes through gates are usually called concourses . however , the words `` terminal '' and `` concourse '' are sometimes used to mean the same thing . small airports have only one terminal , while large airports can have several terminals and/or concourses . at small airports , the single terminal building usually has all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse . some larger airports have one terminal that is joined to multiple concourses via walkways , sky-bridges , or underground tunnels ( such as denver international airport ) . some larger airports have more than one terminal , each with one or more concourses ( such as new york 's la guardia airport ) . still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which includes the functions of a concourse ( such as dallas/fort worth international airport ) .
