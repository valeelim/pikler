Theoretical chemistry     theoretical chemistry tries to explain data from chemistry experiments . it uses mathematics and computers . theoretical chemistry predicts what happens when atoms combine to form molecules . it also predicts chemical properties ( characteristics ) of molecules . an important part of theoretical chemistry is quantum chemistry . this is using quantum mechanics to understand valency ( the number of bonds formed by an atom of an element ) . other important parts include molecular dynamics , statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions , reaction networks , polymerization and catalysis . theoretical chemists use a wide range of tools . these tools include analytical models ( for example , lcao-mos to approximate the behaviors of electrons in molecules ) and computational and numerical simulations . theorists in chemistry create theoretical models . then , they find things that experimental chemists can measure from those models . this helps chemists to look for data that can prove a model not true . the data helps to chose between several different or opposite models .
