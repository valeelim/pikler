Geocaching     geocaching is an outdoor sport activity based on gps ( global positioning system ) . players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers , called `` geocaches '' or `` caches '' . one of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting , but not often visited by tourists . in the listing of the cache , information about the places is given . after 13 years of activity there are over 2,000,000 active geocaches . there are over 5 million geocachers worldwide . geocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from gps on may 2 , 2000. accuracy of the gps before this date was about 100m , after this date is less than 3m . improved accuracy allowed geocachers to specify where caches are located . the first cache was placed on may 3 , 2000 , by dave ulmer in beavercreek . it was found by mike teague of vancouver on may 6 , 2000. the original name of the game is `` gps stash hunt '' , but it was changed on may 30 , 2000 after the discussion of several players to `` geocaching '' .
