Standing wave     in physics , a standing wave – also called a stationary wave – is a wave that oscillates in one constant position . the word oscillate simply describes the vibrating movement of particles in a medium when acted upon by a wave , or the regular `` up and down '' motion shown in the animation . oppositely to a progressive ( moving ) wave , stationary waves do not transfer energy in a given direction when they oscillate . when a guitar string is plucked , for example , a stationary wave is formed . this happens because on releasing the string , two progressive waves move down the string in opposite directions . when they reach the point where the string is tied down , they can not move beyond this boundary . at the boundary , the wave is reflected and travels back in the opposite direction . the two reflected waves meet and interfere with one another . superposition occurs , the opposing directions of the reflected waves cancel out resulting in one `` stationary '' wave .
