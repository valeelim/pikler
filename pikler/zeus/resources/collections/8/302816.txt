Cheletropic reaction     cheletropic reactions are a type of pericyclic reaction where one atom on one of the reagents gets two new bonds . a pericyclic reaction is one that involves a transition state with a cyclic array of atoms and an associated cyclic array of interacting orbitals . a reorganization of σ and π bonds occurs in this cyclic array . cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions . what sets cheletropic reactions apart is that on one of the reagents , both new bonds are being made to the same atom . a few examples are shown to the right in figure 1. in the first case , the single atom is the carbon atom in the carbonyl group . that carbon atom ends up in carbon monoxide . the end result is making two new bonds to one atom . the first two examples are known as `` cheletropic extrusions '' because a small stable molecule is given off in the reaction . the driving force for these reactions is often the entropic benefit of releasing a gas ( e.g . co or n ) . because of the geometry of the molecules involved in cheletropic reactions , they confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists . cheletropic reactions confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry .
