Battle of Plataea     the battle of plataea was the final land battle during the second persian invasion of greece . it was a decisive victory for the greeks as it ended that war . the battle was in 479 bc near the city of plataea in boeotia . it was fought between the greek allies ( the city-states , of sparta , athens , corinth and megara ) , and the persian empire of xerxes i. the previous year , the persian invasion force , led by the xerxes in person , won the battles of thermopylae and artemisium , and conquered thessaly , boeotia and attica . however , at the last-ditch naval battle of salamis , the allied greek navy had won a surprise victory , and that stopped the conquest of the whole peloponnesus . xerxes then returned home with some of his army , leaving his general mardonius to finish off the greeks the next year . in the summer of 479 bc , the greeks got together a huge army by the standards of the day , and marched out of the peloponnesus . the persians retreated to boeotia , and built a fortified camp near plataea . the greeks refused to be drawn into the open cavalry ground near the persian camp , and this led to a stalemate which lasted eleven days . when their supply lines were disrupted , the greeks retreated a distance , and their battle-line fragmented . mardoniu thought the greeks were in full retreat , and ordered his men to pursue them . the greeks ( particularly the spartans , tegeans and athenians ) turned and gave battle , routing the lightly armed persian infantry and killing mardonius .
