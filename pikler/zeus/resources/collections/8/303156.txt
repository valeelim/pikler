Xiaotingia     xiaotingia is an extinct genus of `` archaeopteryx '' -like theropod dinosaur from early upper jurassic deposits of western liaoning , china . the chinese team claims the fossils dated to 155 million years ago ( mya ) , whereas the solnhofen limestone where `` archaeopteyx '' was found is 144 mya in age . the new fossil `` xiaotingia '' can not be dated so accurately , as they were originally been purchased from a dealer . prof xu first saw the specimen at the shandong tianyu museum . the other question to be asked of all early dinobirds is : could they fly ? a cladistic analysis by xu and his team showed that `` xiaotingia '' formed a clade with `` archaeopteryx '' , the dromaeosauridae and the troodontidae . this clade excludes other birds . they therefore ( re ) defined the concepts of deinonychosauria and avialae so `` archaeopteryx '' and `` xiaotingia '' belonged to the deinonychosauria and `` archaeopteryx '' no longer was an avian ( bird ) . this led to popular reports that `` '' archaeopteryx '' is no longer a bird '' . however , the team explicitly allowed for a traditional aves with `` archaeopteryx '' as a specifier . such a clade would in their opinion include the deinonychosauria .
