Video High Density     video high density ( vhd ) was a videodisc format which was marketed predominantly in japan by jvc . there was also an audio-only variant , audio high density ( ahd ) . vhd discs are 25 cm ( 9 5/6 inches ) in diameter , and store up to 60 minutes of video per side . each disc is stored in a plastic case , similar to a ced 's case , so that the user could not touch the disc itself . the entire case was put into the player , which would take out the disc , and then the now empty case could be taken back out . after one side has finished playing , the disc would have to be taken out , flipped , and put back in to continue playing . similar to the rca 's ced , the signal on the vhd is recorded by varying capacitance on the disc . however , unlike the ced , the vhd does not contain any groves and the needle is made of diamond instead of titanium . instead of having grooves , the needle is kept on track electronically so the needle does not have to actually touch the disc therefor resulting in less wear on the disc and on the needle . in one rotation of the disc , 2 frames of picture and audio were read .
