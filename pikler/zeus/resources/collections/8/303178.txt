Double bond     a double bond in chemistry is when two chemical elements are joined together in a chemical bond and share four bonding electrons instead of the usual two . the most common double bond is between two carbon atoms , and can be found in alkenes . there are many types of double bonds , such as in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom . other common double bonds are found in azo compounds ( n=n ) , imines ( c=n ) and sulfoxides ( s=o ) . in skeletal formula the double bond is shown as two parallel lines ( = ) between the two joined atoms . when this formula is printed , the equals sign is used . double bonds are stronger than single bonds and double bonds are also shorter . the bond order is two . double bonds are also electron-rich , which makes them more reactive . the two pairs of electrons involved in the bond do not behave in exactly the same way . one pair of electrons forms a stronger `` sigma '' bond , noted by σ and drawn as a straight line between the nuclei of the bonding atoms . while the other pair form a pi bond , π , drawn as two cloud-like areas where the electrons exist , as `` orbitals '' .
