Dry cleaning     dry cleaning ( or dry-cleaning ) is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent ( a chemical that can dissolve certain compounds ) rather than water . the solvent used is usually tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) . the solvent is called `` perc '' in the industry and `` dry-cleaning fluid '' by the public . it is often used instead of hand washing delicate fabrics . people use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing . the ancient romans used a chemical called ammonia ( derived from urine ) and fuller 's earth ( a clay that can absorb grease and oil . ) to clean their woolen togas . `` fullonicae '' were very famous , with at least one in every town of any notability , and frequently the largest employer in a district . these laundries got their urine from farm animals , or from special pots situated at public bathrooms . the workforce made so much money that fuller 's guilds ( a group that works in solely one job , in this case , making fuller 's earth , this special clay . ) were an important political force . also , the government taxed the collection of urine .
