Ground state     ground state is the lowest level of energy in a particle , atom or molecule . if energy is added from outside , then the level of energy is increased , and the ground state is changed . changing ground state is the process of excitement of electrons to higher levels . any other state is called an `` excited state . '' in ground state , an atom is stable , and does not give out electromagnetic radiation . when an electron drops down from an excited state to the ground state , electromagnetic radiation is released .
