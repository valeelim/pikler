Waziristan     waziristan ( / , `` land of the wazir '' ) is a mountainous region of northwest pakistan , bordering afghanistan and covering about . it is part of the federally administered tribal areas , which is not part of any of the country 's four provinces . though declared by the rebels as a `` state '' or `` emirate '' , there are questions whether the region being should be called such . those who support that the region is a state point to the facts that the federal government has little to no power in the region and that the area is ruled mostly by tribal elders . the taliban are reported to control most of the region with its own style of sharia rule , which the pakistan government has been unable to stop . such bold show of autonomy has led one writer in the `` wall street journal '' to remark that waziristan was a `` state within a state .
