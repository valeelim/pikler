Magnetic reluctance     magnetic reluctance , or magnetic resistance , is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuits . it is like resistance in an electrical circuit , but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy . as an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance , a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance . it is a scalar , extensive quantity , like electrical resistance . reluctance is usually represented by a curly capital r. the term was coined in may 1888 by oliver heaviside . the notion of “ magnetic resistance ” was first mentioned by james joule and the term `` magnetomotive force ” ( mmf ) was first named by bosanquet . the idea for a magnetic flux law , similar to ohm 's law for closed electric circuits , is attributed to h. rowland . the total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the `` magnetomotive force ” ( mmf ) in a passive magnetic circuit to the magnetic flux in this circuit . in an ac field , the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal mmf and magnetic flux .
