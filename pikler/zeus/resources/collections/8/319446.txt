Synchrotron light source     a synchrotron light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation produced by a synchrotron . the radiation can be artificially produced for scientific and technical purposes by specialized particle accelerators , typically by accelerating electrons . once the high-energy electron beam has been generated , it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices ( undulators or wigglers ) in storage rings and free-electron lasers . these supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high-energy electron energy into light or some other form of electronmagnetic radiation . synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance in particle physics experiments , or on purpose for many laboratory uses . electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that can be in the gev range . in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate in the vacuum field , making photoelectrons . the photoelectrons then make secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x10 . each proton may lose 6.7kev per turn due to this phenomenon . so , both electron synchrotrons and proton synchrotrons can be a light source .
