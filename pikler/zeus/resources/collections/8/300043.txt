Humidex     the humidex ( `` hyu-mah-deks '' ) is a temperature index used by canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to a person , by adding the effect of heat and humidity . for example , if the temperature is and the calculated humidex is 40 , then that means the humid heat feels like a dry temperature of . the index is widely used in canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level . according to the meteorological service of canada , a humidex of at least 30 causes `` some discomfort '' , at least 40 causes `` great discomfort '' and above 45 is `` dangerous '' . when the humidex hits 54 , then heat stroke is very near . the current formula for getting the humidex ( see below : humidex formula ) was developed by j.m . masterton and f.a . richardson of canada 's atmospheric environment service in 1979. the humidex differs from the heat index used in the united states , in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity . the record highest humidex in canada occurred on july 25 , 2007 , when carman , manitoba hit 53.0. that number broke the previous record of 52.1 set during 1953 in windsor , ontario ( the residents of windsor would not have known it at the time , since the humidex had yet to be invented ) .
