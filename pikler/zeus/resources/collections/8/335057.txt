Phototropism     phototropism is growth in the direction of light . phototropism is common in plants , but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi . the cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a plant growth hormone called auxin , which causes phototropism to occur . it causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . growth towards a light source is a `` positive phototropism '' , while growth away from light is called `` negative phototropism '' . most plant shoots have positive phototropism . roots usually have negative phototropism , though gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth . some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism , which allows them to grow towards dark , solid objects and climb them . auxin collects mainly on the darker side of the stem and stimulates cell elongation . thus , the cells on the side not directly exposed to light will grow faster than the opposing side , and the stem will curve towards the light source .
