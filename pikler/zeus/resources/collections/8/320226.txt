Scute     a scute is a bony external plate or scale , as on the shell of a turtle , the skin of crocodiles or the feet of some birds . scutes are similar to scales and serve the same function . unlike the scales of fish and snakes , which are formed from the epidermis , scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface . forming in the living dermis , the scutes produce a horny outer layer , that is superficially similar to that of scales . the dermal base may contain bone and produce dermal armour . scutes with a bony base are properly called osteoderms . dermal scutes are also found in the feet of birds and tails of some mammals , and are believed to be the primitive form of dermal armour in reptiles . the term is also used to describe the heavy armour of the armadillo and the extinct glyptodon , and is occasionally used as an alternative to scales in describing snakes or certain fish , such as sturgeon .
