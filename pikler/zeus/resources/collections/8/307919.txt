Central limit theorem     the central limit theorems are theorems for probability theory . they say that given a large number of independent random variables , their sum will follow a stable distribution . if the variance of the random variables is finite , a gaussian distribution will result . this is one of the reasons why this distribution is also known as `` normal '' distribution . the best known and most important of these is known as `` the central limit theorem '' . it is about large numbers of random variables with the same distribution , and with a finite variance and expected value . there are different generalisations of this theorem . some of these generalisations no longer require an identical distribution of all random variables . in these generalisations , another precondition makes sure that no single random variable has a bigger influence on the outcome than the others . examples are the lindeberg and lyapunov conditions . the name of the theorem is based on a paper george p√≥lya wrote in 1920 , `` about the central limit theorem in probability theory and the moment problem '' .
