Halkett boat     a halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat . the boat was first created by ( 1820â€“1885 ) during the 1840s . halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the canadian arctic . he wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain , but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions . halkett 's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber . this boat could be filled with air ( inflated ) to float on water or the air could be removed ( deflated ) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry . when deflated , the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak . the oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella . next , he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack . when it was deflated , it could be used as a waterproof blanket . many people who explored canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people . he tried to show the royal navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed . he also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck . they were commercially unsuccessful . only two halkett boats are still known to exist . one belonged to orcadian explorer john rae . the other is in the hudson 's bay company museum collection at the manitoba museum .
