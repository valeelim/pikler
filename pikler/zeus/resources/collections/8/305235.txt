Margot Fonteyn     dame margot fonteyn dbe ( born peggy hookham , reigate , surrey , 18 may 1919 â€“ panama city , 21 february 1991 ) was an english ballerina . she is widely regarded as one of the greatest classical ballet dancers of all time . she spent her entire career as a dancer with the royal ballet , eventually being appointed `` prima ballerina assoluta '' of the company by queen elizabeth ii . this is an honour rarely given to a dancer . the highest rank in the royal ballet today is `` principal dancer '' . fonteyn 's appointment as a dame commander of the british empire is the female equivalent to a knighthood . fonteyn danced until 1979 , when she was nearly 60. this is unusual for any dancer , male or female . her career was expected to end round about 1960 , but it was reborn by a new partnership with a russian dancer who had escaped from the soviet union . he was rudolph nureyev , one of the three greatest male ballet dancers of the twentieth century . though he was 19 years younger than her , the partnership flourished , and was called `` the most famous partnership in ballet history '' .
