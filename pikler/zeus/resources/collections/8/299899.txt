Proportions     in mathematics , the word `` proportions '' means 2 ratios put into an equation . some examples of proportions are : in algebra , proportions can be used to solve many common problems about changing numbers . as an example , for the increase in a $ 40 purchase of gasoline ( petrol ) , if the price rose 35 cents , from $ 3.50 to $ 3.85 , the proportion would be : the solution is simply : many other common calculations can be solved by using proportions to show the relationships between the numbers . a proportionality constant is a number that is used to convert a measurement in one system to the equivalent measurement in another system . for instance , people who are familiar with the traditional system of units used in the united states , pounds , feet , inches , etc. , may need to find out the metric equivalent for these measures in grams and meters . to make these calculations they would need some proportionality constants . one way to write a formula showing how to use a proportionality constant ( let us call it `` k '' ) is :
