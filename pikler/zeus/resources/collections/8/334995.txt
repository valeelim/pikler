Eggshell     an eggshell is the outer covering of a hard-shelled egg and of some forms of eggs with soft outer coats . it is a main character of the cleidoic egg , which allows amniotes to breed on land . amniotes developed the cleidoic egg early in the carboniferous period , and this meant they could live and reproduce on dry land . these early land animals evolved into the reptiles , birds and mammals of today . in contrast , the amphibia are land animals who must lay their eggs in water , because the eggs are not protected by a shell . the structure and composition of the eggshell protects the egg against damage , microbial contamination , and desiccation ( drying out ) . small molecules can pass through it , so the shell allows gas exchange for the growing embryo . it also provides calcium for the embryo 's skeleton . while many reptiles lay eggs with flexible , calcified , eggshells , there are some that lay hard eggs . eggs laid by snakes generally have leathery shells which often adhere to one another . depending on the species , turtles and tortoises lay hard or soft eggs . several species lay eggs which are nearly the same as bird eggs .
