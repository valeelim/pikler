Harold Camping     harold egbert camping ( july 19 , 1921 â€“ december 15 , 2013 ) was an american christian radio broadcaster . his parents were dutch immigrants . he served as president of family radio , a california-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the united states , since 1958. in 2011 he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke , but maintained a role at family radio until his death . camping is notable for applying numerology to his interpretations of bible passages in an attempt to predict dates for the end times . his 2011 end times prediction was that on may 21 , 2011 jesus christ would return to earth , the righteous would fly up to heaven , and that there would follow five months of fire , brimstone and plagues on earth , with millions of people dying each day , culminating on october 21 , 2011 with the end of the world . he had previously predicted judgment days on may 21 , 1988 , and september 6 , 1994. his prediction for may 21 , 2011 was widely reported , in part because of a massive publicity campaign by family radio , and it prompted responses from both atheist and christian organizations . after may 21 passed without the predicted incidents , camping said he believed that a `` spiritual '' judgment had occurred on that date , and that the physical rapture would occur on october 21 , 2011 , simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by god . except for one press appearance on may 23 , 2011 , camping largely avoided press interviews after may 21 , particularly after he suffered a stroke in june . october 21 , 2011 , passed without the predicted apocalypse , leading the international business times to proclaim camping a `` false prophet .
