Neutrophil     neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell , often called neutrophil granulocytes . they destroy bacteria ( and other parasites like fungi ) during an infection . they get to the site of an injury within minutes . they have tiny granules full of enzymes and peptides which chop up the bacteria after they have taken them in . the process of taking in bacteria is called phagocytosis . the bacteria end up in a vacuole inside the neutrophil . the enzymes then get to work on the bacteria . neutrophils are an important part of the body 's immune system . they are a kind of granulocyte , and have a short life-span of a couple of days .
