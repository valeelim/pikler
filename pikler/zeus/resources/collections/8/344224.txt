Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain     the hawaiian–emperor seamount chain is the hawaiian islands and the emperor seamounts : together they form a vast underwater mountain region of islands seamounts , atolls , shallows , banks and reefs . the line goes southeast to northwest beneath the northern pacific ocean ; and many of the underwater mountains are guyots . the seamount chain , with over 80 identified undersea volcanoes , stretches over from the aleutian trench in the far northwest pacific to the loʻihi seamount , the youngest volcano in the chain , which lies about southeast of the island of hawaiʻi . the oldest age for the emperor seamounts is 81 million years , and comes from detroit seamount . however , meiji guyot , located to the north of detroit seamount , is likely somewhat older . in 1963 , geologist john tuzo wilson explained that the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain was created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that stood as the pacific tectonic plate moved over it . this left a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts . a `` bend '' or `` v '' in the chain marks a shift in the movement of the pacific plate some 47 million years ago , from a northward to a more northwesterly direction . the bend shows how a tectonic plate can shift direction suddenly . a look at the usgs map on the origin of the hawaiian islands clearly shows this `` spearpoint '' .
