Zipf's law    zipf 's law zipf 's law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics . the law is named after the linguist george kingsley zipf , who first proposed it . zipf 's law states that given a large sample of words used , the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table . so word number n has a frequency of 1/n . thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word , three times as often as the third most frequent word , etc . for example , in one sample of words , the most frequently occurring word accounts for nearly 7 % of all the words ( 69,971 out of slightly over 1 million ) . true to zipf 's law , the second-place word `` of '' accounts for slightly over 3.5 % of words ( 36,411 occurrences ) , followed by `` and '' ( 28,852 ) . only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the sample of words . the same relationship occurs in many other rankings , unrelated to language , such as the population ranks of cities in various countries , corporation sizes , income rankings , etc . the appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by felix auerbach in 1913 .
