Derivative (finance)    derivative ( finance ) in finance , a derivative is a special type of contract . in it , the two parties agree to sell ( or to buy ) certain goods , at a given price , on a given date . derivatives can be used in two ways . the first is called speculation : one party hopes that the `` market price '' differs from the `` price agreed upon in the contract '' , so that he can make the difference between the two . the second is called hedging : one party wants to make sure that the market price does n't go in a direction that would hurt his profits , so he make sure that the price is agreed upon a long time before the transaction takes place . for a seller , hedging means that he can be certain to receive the agreed upon price , and for the buyer hedging means that he can be certain not to pay more than the agreed upon price . one of the oldest derivatives is rice futures , which have been traded on the dojima rice exchange since the eighteenth century .
