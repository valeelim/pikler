Compensation (psychology)    compensation ( psychology ) in psychology , compensation is a way people hide something that they can not do well , by doing something else really well . they may not even be aware that they are doing it . compensation can hide real or imagined problems and personal or physical inferiority . however it does not really solve the cause of the problem . positive compensations may help a person overcome difficulties . but negative compensations do not , and can even make the problems worse . there are two kinds of negative compensation : - overcompensation , where a person has a goal to gain superiority . this leads to wanting power , dominance , self-esteem and self-devaluation . - under compensation which includes a demand for help , leads to a lack of courage and a fear for life . a well-known example of failing overcompensation , can be seen in people going through a midlife-crisis . approaching midlife many people ( especially men ) lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses , including their compensatory acts .
