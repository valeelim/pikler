Barbiturate     barbiturates are a group of drugs that are derivates of barbituric acid . adolf von baeyer was the first to produce barbituric acid , in 1863. for many years , barbiturates were used as sedatives . today , their use is very limited in many countries , mainly because they cause addiction and people soon develop a tolerance . people with a drug tolerance will need a higher dosage of the drug to get the same effect as before . after a while , the drug becomes useless for such people . barbiturates were once used as a primary treatment for epilepsy ; this is especially true for the substance called phenobarbitol or phenobarbitone . the sedative side effect of the drug made it increasingly unpopular , and it is now prescribed less for epilepsy , in favor of other drugs that do not have sedative effects . benzodiazepines are another group of drugs , which have sedative properties : they make people sleepy , and help them sleep . in contrast , barbiturates force people to sleep . in the case of severe sleeping problems which can not be controlled by other drugs , barbiturates are sometimes used as off-label drugs .
