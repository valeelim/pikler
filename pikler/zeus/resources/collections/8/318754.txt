Western Interior Seaway     the western interior seaway was a huge inland sea . it split north america into two halves for most of the mid- and late-cretaceous period . it was up to deep , wide and over long . sea level was high in the cretaceous , and the middle part of north america sank down . a shallowly-subducting plate pulled on the bottom of the lithosphere , causing it to move down . the sea entered both north and south , and came and went during the course of the cretaceous . widespread carbonate deposition suggests that the seaway was warm and tropical , with abundant calcareous algae . the shrunken , regressive phase of the western interior seaway is sometimes called the pierre seaway . the western interior seaway was a shallow sea filled with abundant marine life . this included predatory marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs , and mosasaurs that grew up to 18 meters long . other marine life included sharks such as `` squalicorax '' and the giant shellfish-eating `` ptychodus mortoni '' ( believed to be 10 meters long ) . there were advanced bony fish such as the massive 5-meter long `` xiphactinus '' â€“ a fish larger than any modern bony fish . other sea life included invertebrates such as molluscs , ammonites , squid-like belemnites , and plankton including coccolithophores that secreted the chalky platelets that give the cretaceous its name , foraminiferans and radiolarians .
