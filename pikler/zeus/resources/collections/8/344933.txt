Xenon difluoride     xenon difluoride is a chemical compound with the formula xef . this noble gas compound can be used as a good fluorinating agent . xenon diflouride is the most stable compound of all xenon compounds . the compound shows a trigonal bipyramidal pseudostructure or a linear real structure in vsepr theory . xenon diflouride is solid in state of matter . it is achromatic ( without color ) and in crystal form . under high pressure and temperature , the compound can be produced from xenon and flourine directly . xenon diflouride is used in organic syntheses as flourinating agent . xenon diflouride can be destroyed by heating . it then results in the pure substances flourine and xenon . this reactions happens explosively , even though that the enthalpy of reaction is negative ( formula_2 ) . that is because the reaction changes the state of matter from solid to gas . the gas needs more space in room . further readings . - synthesis , properties and chemistry of xenon ( ii ) fluoride
