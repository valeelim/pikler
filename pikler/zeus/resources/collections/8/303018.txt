Shoaling and schooling     schooling and shoaling is a kind of collective animal behaviour by fish . any group of fish that stay together for social reasons is said to be shoaling , and if the shoal is swimming in the same direction together , it is schooling . about one quarter of fish shoal all their lives , and about one half of fish shoal for part of their lives . fish get many benefits from shoaling . these include defence against predators : if fish swim in schools , it is less likely any one of them will be eaten . also , it may help a fish find food , and a mate . the school may even swim faster than a lone fish . fish generally prefer larger shoals , shoalmates of their own species , shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves , healthy fish , and kin ( when recognized ) . any shoal member which stands out in appearance may be targeted by predators . this may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble themselves . this is called the oddity effect . some fish spend most of their time schooling . tuna , herring and anchovy , spend all of their time shoaling or schooling , and become agitated if separated from the group . others , such as atlantic cod , school only some of the time .
