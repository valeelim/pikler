Coligny calendar     the coligny calendar is a celtic calendar from roman times . it was found near lyon in 1897. it was made of bronze , but today , only fragments remain . studies found that these fragments made up a gallic calendar , which had been created for a period of five years . the calendar indicates both the time of the solar year and the phase of the moon , which is generally called a lunisolar calendar . it was engraved on a bronze tablet , preserved in 73 fragments , that originally was 1.48 m wide and 0.9 m high ( lambert p. 111 ) or approximately wide by 3½ feet in height . based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects , it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century ad . it is written in latin inscriptional capitals and is in the gaulish language ( duval & pinault ) . the restored tablet contains sixteen vertical columns , with 62 months distributed over five years . the french archaeologist , j. monard , speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the julian calendar was being imposed throughout the roman empire . however , the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars ( or `` parapegmata '' ) found throughout the greek and roman world ( lehoux pp . 63–65 ) .
