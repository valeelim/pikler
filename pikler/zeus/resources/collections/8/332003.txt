Fracture (geology)    fracture ( geology ) in geology , a fracture is any kind of separation or break in a rock formation . examples are joints or faults . these divides the rock into two or more pieces . a fracture can sometimes form a deep , wide crack in the rock . they are usually caused when the rock is not strong enough to hold up under too much stress . this makes the rock crack along its weakest point . fractures can provide access for fluids , like water or hydrocarbons , to move into the rock .
