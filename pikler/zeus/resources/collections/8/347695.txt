Supervolcano     a supervolcano is a volcano that can make a volcanic eruption where the things being thrown out of the volcano have a volume bigger than . this is thousands of times bigger than most volcanic eruptions which happened a long time . supervolcanoes can occur when magma in the earth rises into the crust from a hotspot , but can not break through the crust . more and more pressure builds up in a large and growing magma pool until the crust can no longer take the pressure . although there are not many quaternary supervolcanoes , supervolcanic eruptions usually cover very big areas with lava and volcanic ash . they can also cause a long-lasting change to weather ( such as the triggering of a small ice age ) , enough to possibly make species extinct . the term `` supervolcano '' was first used in the bbc popular science television program `` horizon '' in 2000 to mean eruptions of this type . volcanologists and geologists do not say `` supervolcanoes '' in their scientific work . this is because the word can mean many different geothermal conditions . since 2003 , however , the term has been used by professionals when showing things to the public . the term `` megacaldera '' is sometimes used for calderas which are quite similar to supervolcanoes , such as the blake river megacaldera complex in the abitibi greenstone belt of ontario and quebec , canada .
