Fermilab     fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fermilab ) , just outside batavia , illinois , near chicago , is a us department of energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics . as of january 1 , 2007 , fermilab is operated by the fermi research alliance , a joint venture of the university of chicago , illinois institute of technology and the universities research association ( ura ) . fermilab is a part of the illinois technology and research corridor . fermilab 's tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator ; at in circumference , it was the world 's second largest energy particle accelerator ( cern 's large hadron collider is 27 km in circumference ) , until being shut down on september 30 , 2011. in 1995 , two teams at fermilab ( cdf and d√∏ , detectors which utilize the tevatron ) announced the discovery of the top quark . in addition to high energy collider physics , fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed-target and neutrino experiments , such as miniboone ( mini booster neutrino experiment ) , sciboone ( scibar booster neutrino experiment ) and minos ( main injector neutrino oscillation search ) . the miniboone detector is a diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors . an estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year . sciboone is the newest neutrino experiment at fermilab ; it sits in the same neutrino beam as miniboone but has fine-grained tracking capabilities . the minos experiment uses fermilab 's numi ( neutrinos at the main injector ) beam , which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the earth to the soudan mine in minnesota .
