Carsonella ruddii     candidatus carsonella ruddii is an endosymbiotic gamma proteobacterium . it has the smallest known genome of any bacterium . the species is an endosymbiont that is present in all species of phloem sap-feeding insects known as psyllids . the endosymbionts occurs in a specialised structure known as the bacteriome . in 2006 the genome of one strain of `` ca . '' c. ruddi was sequenced at riken in japan and the university of arizona . the genome is a circular chromosome of 159,662 base pairs and has a high coding density ( 97 % ) with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length . the number of predicted genes was 182 , also the lowest on record ( ncbi-genome ) . numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing , suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle-like status . in comparison , `` mycoplasma genitalium '' , which has the smallest genome of any free-living organism , has a genome of 521 genes . other websites . - scientific american â€“ tiny genome may reflect organelle in the making
