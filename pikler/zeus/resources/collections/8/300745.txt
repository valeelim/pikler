Atlantic Wall     the atlantic wall ( german : `` atlantikwall '' ) was an extensive system of coastal fortifications built by nazi germany between 1942 and 1944 along the western coast of europe as a defense against an anticipated allied invasion of the mainland continent from great britain . on march 23 , 1942 f√ºhrer directive number 40 called for the official creation of the atlantic wall . after the st. nazaire raid , on april 13 , 1942 adolf hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended . fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas . organisation todt , which had designed the siegfried line ( `` westwall '' ) along the franco-german border , was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall 's major fortifications . thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the dutch , belgian and french coasts facing the english channel . early in 1944 , field marshal erwin rommel was assigned to improve the wall 's defences . rommel believed the existing coastal fortifications were entirely inadequate and he immediately began strengthening them . he knew that the beaches between were barely defended , and the allies could land there and capture the ports from the land . under his direction , a string of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built along the beaches , or sometimes slightly inland , to house machine guns , anti-tank guns , and light artillery . mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves , and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore . the intent was to destroy the allied landing craft before they could unload .
