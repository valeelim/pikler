Carbocation     a carbocation ( ) is an ion with a positively-charged carbon atom . the charged carbon atom in a carbocation is a `` sextet '' ( that is , it has only six electrons in its outer valence shell instead of eight valence electrons . ) carbon atoms with eight valence elections have the maximum stability ( octet rule ) . therefore , carbocations are often reactive , seeking to fill the octet of valence electrons as well as regain a neutral charge . logic would say that carbocation have sp hybridization with an empty sp orbital giving positive charge . however , the reactivity of a carbocation more closely resembles sp hybridization with a trigonal planar molecular geometry . a carbocation was previously often called a `` carbonium ion '' but chemists questions the exact meaning . in present-day chemistry , a carbocation is any positively charged carbon atom . two special types have been suggested : carbenium ions are trivalent and carbonium ions are pentavalent or hexavalent . university level textbooks only discuss carbocations as if they are carbenium ions , or discuss carbocations with a fleeting reference to the older phrase of carbonium ion or carbenium and carbonium ions . one textbook to this day stays with the older name of carbonium ion for carbenium ion and reserves the phrase `` hypervalent carbenium ion '' for ch .
