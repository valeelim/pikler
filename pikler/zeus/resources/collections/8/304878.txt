JIT     jit , just-in-time compilation is a way to translate bytecode instructions to instructions the processor understands . bytecode is a set of computer instructions for a processor that only exists on paper . the alternative to a jit is an interpreter that looks at each bytecode instruction individually and then decides what to with it . when you run over the same part of the program again , an interpreter has to make the decisions again . while a jit makes the decisions on how to handle the bytecode once , and then stores it as native processor instructions ( this takes memory ) . properly deciding how to translate bytecode take some time , so you have some minor slowdown in startup speed . a proper modern jit first runs a regular interpreter , and then does the jit step once it knows something is used frequently . related pages . - java virtual machine
