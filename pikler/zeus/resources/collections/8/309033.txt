French cuisine     french cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout europe , and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world . the roots of modern `` haute cuisine '' lie in chefs like la varenne ( 1615–1678 ) and the notable chef of napoleon , marie-antoine carême ( 1784–1833 ) . these chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the middle ages . they used fewer spices , and more herbs and creamy ingredients . typical ingredients like roux and fish stock , and techniques such as marinading , and dishes such as ragout , were invented . carême was an expert pâtissier ( pastry-maker ) , and this is still a mark of french cooking . he developed basic sauces , his 'mother sauces ' ; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire , based on the half-dozen mother sauces . french cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by georges auguste escoffier ( 1846–1935 ) . he was a genius at organisation . he worked out how to run large restaurants , as in a big hotel or a palace : how the staff should be organised ; how the menu was prepared . he had methods for everything . escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the savoy hotel and carlton hotel in london , the hôtel ritz paris , and some of the greatest cruise ships of the day .
