Thermochemistry     thermochemistry is the study of the energy and heat to do with chemical reactions and physical transformations ( physical changes ) . physical transformations are when a state of matter ( a solid or liquid , for example ) changes to another state . examples of transformations include melting ( when a solid becomes a liquid ) and boiling ( when a liquid becomes a gas ) . a reaction gives out or takes in energy . a physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy . thermochemistry looks at these energy changes , particularly on a system 's energy exchange with its surroundings . thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction . thermochemists do this by using data , including entropy determinations . thermochemists will tell if a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous , favorable or unfavorable . endothermic reactions take in heat . exothermic reactions give out heat . thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bonds . it includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity , heat of combustion , heat of formation , enthalpy , entropy , free energy , and calories .
