Basal     'basal ' is a term in biology for 'primitive ' or 'ancestral ' . basal is preferred because it is neutral and non-judgmental . this terminology came into use with cladistics . the term is used in evolution and classification to mean the group which gave rise to later forms . it is a term which works at any level : a basal species gives rise to derived species , and a basal group gives rise to derived groups . 'derived ' is the correct term in biology for `` specialised '' or `` advanced '' . it is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group . a derived trait is a trait that is present in an organism , but was absent in the last common ancestor of the group being considered . simplicity is often secondarily derived . for example , the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist `` entamoeba histolytica '' is a result of their secondary loss . - general view – - basal group - derived group - derived group - derived group - example – - early primates - monkeys - apes - `` homo '' in the last example , note that apes are `` derived '' from monkeys but `` basal '' with respect to our own genus . the status of being basal or derived is relative , though living species can only be derived . in any basal-derived pair , the basal member must have evolved before the derived member , with evidence that some of its species gave rise to ( evolved into ) the derived member .
