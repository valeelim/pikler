Superbase     in chemistry , a superbase is an extremely strong base . it is a compound that has a high affinity for protons . hydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water ( aqueous ) solutions , but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases . such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are fundamental to physical organic chemistry . superbases have been described and used since the 1850s . reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water , carbon dioxide , and oxygen in the air . inert atmosphere techniques and low temperatures minimize these side reactions . iupac defines superbases simply as a `` compound having a very high basicity , such as lithium diisopropylamide '' . other pages . - superacid
