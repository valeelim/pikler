Totemism     totemism is a belief about the relationship between people and nature . the term totem comes from an ojibwe word meaning “ a relative of mine ” . it was first written about in 1791 by a trader , james long . it has been recorded across native tribes of america , africa and australia . it has been the subject of much research into ethnic groups . usually , totems of a kinship group will be animals or plants . they will be represented in sacred objects and will belong exclusively to them . totemism was considered a primitive religion by many european thinkers in the 1800s . it was thought to be related to beliefs about food and incest taboos . in 1869 , john ferguson mclennan said that `` there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief '' . early thinkers had the idea that beliefs in totemism came from indiginous clans being uneducated about the difference between humans and animals . this is not still talked about as true in modern discussions on totemism .
