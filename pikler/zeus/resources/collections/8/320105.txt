Sex linkage     sex linkage is a term in genetics . it applies to alleles ( forms of a gene ) on the x chromosome . in mammals , which have an xx/xy system of sex determination , the x chromosome has many more genes than the y chromosome . this explains the inheritance of such conditions as colour blindness and haemophilia . they are caused by recessive alleles , and usually do not show the condition in females . this is because those females carrying the mutant are most likely to be heterozygous for the allele . however , if the mutant allele is carried by a male , the condition will develop , because his x chromosome has the mutant allele , but his y chromosome has no allele at that locus . sex-linked characters controlled by genes on sex chromosomes are not the only kind of sex-related characters . sex-influenced or sex-conditioned traits are phenotypes affected by whether they appear in a male or female body . even in a homozygous female the condition may not be expressed fully . example : baldness in humans .
