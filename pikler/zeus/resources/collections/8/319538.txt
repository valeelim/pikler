Ecological succession     ecological succession , is the process by which a specific ecology has more or less orderly and predictably changed after a disturbance like a fire . in long-term studies , there is a species succession process in the way forests develop . several scientists are prominent in the history of this process theory : - adolphe dureau de la malle was the first to use of the word `` succession '' . he described the process of re-growth after trees in a forest had been cut down . - henry david thoreau described succession in an oak-pine forest in `` the succession of forest trees '' in 1859 . - henry chandler cowles developed a formal concept of plant growth succession . his work was based on studies of sand dunes in danish by eugen warming . cowles proposed the term sere . this is a repeatable sequence of changes which are identified in specific environmental circumstances . - frederic clements proposed a theory that seres were highly predictable . - henry gleason proposed that chance factors were very important , even in highly predicable sere settings .
