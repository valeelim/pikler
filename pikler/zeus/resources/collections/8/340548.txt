Island of stability     the chemical elements beyond lead are radioactive , and they do not have stable isotopes . this means that they will decay into other elements . except for plutonium , their half life is in the order of several minutes , to seconds . there is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives , there will be others with longer half lives . these are generally known as islands of stability . these elements are expected to have isotopes with half lives in the range of several minutes . the hypothesis is that the atomic nucleus is built up in `` shells '' in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms . in both cases , shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other . energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap . so when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus , the per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells .
