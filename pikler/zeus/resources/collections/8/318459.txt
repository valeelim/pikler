Boltzmann constant     the boltzmann constant ( `` k '' or `` k '' ) is a physical constant . it relates the average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas with the temperature of the gas . it is the gas constant `` r '' divided by the avogadro constant `` n '' : the boltzmann constant has si units of jâ‹…k , the same as entropy . it is named after the austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann .
