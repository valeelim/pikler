Major histocompatibility complex     a major histocompatibility complex , or mhc , is a molecule on the outside of immune cells such as white blood cells . it is coded for by a large gene family in all vertebrates . the function of is mhc molecules to sense foreign antigens , and hence the presence of 'foreign ' proteins . they bind peptide fragments from pathogens onto their cell surface . once there , the fragments are recognized by t-cells . adaptive immunity depends on this reaction . two properties of mhc molecules make it difficult for pathogens to dodge the immune response . 1. mhc is polygenic . there are several different genes , so that each person or animal has a set of mhc molecules which bind somewhat different ranges of peptides . 2. the mhc genes are highly polymorphic . this means there are multiple variants alleles of each gene in the population . the polymorphism is so high that in a mixed population there are no two individuals with exactly the same set of mhc genes and molecules , with the exception of identical twins .
