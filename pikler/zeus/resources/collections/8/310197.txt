Mencius     mèng kē ( ) , who is usually known as meng zi ( ) ，which means `` master meng , '' or mencius ( which is the latin form of meng zi ) , was not in the generation of students who worked directly with confucius , but in the second generation after it . he lived from about 371 b.c . to about 289 b.c . mencius regarded confucius as the greatest teacher , and he wrote a book in which he tried to explain the full picture behind what confucius taught . the book is just called by his name , so in english it is called the `` mencius . '' in his book , mencius taught that humans are born with four gifts : the first is the natural ability to feel what other people feel and to want to help and protect them . the second is to recognize when you are not doing your share of the job of maintaining a good society . the third is to recognize conflict situations before they grow big and to defuse them . the fourth is to recognize when some other people are hurting other people and want to obtain justice for those being hurt . mencius believed that just as the people owed things to the ruler , the ruler also owed things to the people . so if a man held the position of ruler but did not do the things for the people that a ruler should do , then it was acceptable for the people to get rid of the ruler , and even to kill him .
