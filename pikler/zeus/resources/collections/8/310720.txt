Magellanic Clouds     the magellanic clouds are two irregular , dwarf galaxies . they do not have a regular shape , and only have a few billion stars . the magellanic clouds can only be seen from the southern hemisphere . they orbit the milky way galaxy . they are part of a group of over 50 galaxies ( including the milky way ) and are in the local group of galaxies . the two clouds are known as the : - large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) - small magellanic cloud ( smc ) the first written record of the magellanic clouds was by the persian astronomer al sufi . in 964 he wrote the `` book of fixed stars '' . he called the large magellanic cloud `` al-bakr '' ( the sheep ) `` of the southern arabs '' . he wrote that the cloud could not be seen from northern arabia and baghdad , but could be seen at the strait of bab el mandeb ( 12Â°15 ' n ) . this is the southernmost point of arabia . the first europeans to see the clouds were italian explorers peter martyr d'anghiera and andrea corsali at the end of the 15th century . antonio pigafetta also saw them , when he went with ferdinand magellan on his circumnavigation of the world in 1519-1522. however , naming the clouds after magellan did not become widespread until much later . in bayer 's 1661 book , `` uranometria '' , they are called `` nubecula major '' and `` nubecula minor '' . in the 1756 star map by french astronomer lacaille , they are called `` le grand nuage '' and `` le petit nuage '' ( `` the large cloud '' and `` the small cloud '' ) .
