CfA2 Great Wall     the great wall is one of the largest known super-structures in the universe . it is a huge group of galaxies about 200 million light-years away . the great wall is like a long filament : it is over 500 million light-years long , 300 million light-years wide , but only 15 million light-years thick . it was discovered in 1989 by margaret geller and john huchra from redshift survey data . we do not know how much farther the wall extends . our view is blocked by the galactic plane of the milky way . the gas and dust from the milky way ( known as the zone of avoidance ) obscures the view of astronomers . this makes it impossible to find out if the wall ends or continues on further . in the standard model of the evolution of the universe , such structures as the great wall form along and follow web-like strings of dark matter . it is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the universe on the grandest of scales . dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter , and it is this 'normal ' matter that astronomers see forming long , thin walls of super-galactic clusters .
