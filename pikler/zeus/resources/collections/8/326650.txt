Burke and Hare murders     the burke and hare murders ( or west port murders ) were serial murders in edinburgh , scotland , from november 1827 to 31 october 1828. the murders were done by irish immigrants william burke and william hare . they sold the corpses of their 17 victims to dr robert knox . knox was a fellow of the royal society , and the conservator of the museum of comparative anatomy in edinburgh . he was a teacher of human anatomy to edinburgh medical students , so needed bodies for his students to dissect . the murderer 's accomplices included burke 's mistress , helen mcdougal , and hare 's wife , margaret laird . from their method of killing their victims has come the word `` burking '' , meaning to purposefully smother and , more generally , to quietly suppress . from 1826 to 1840 knox ran barclay 's anatomy school in surgeon 's square , edinburgh . he was the most popular lecturer on anatomy in scotland , but his class were always short of bodies to dissect . before the anatomy act of 1832 widened the supply , the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the uk were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts . this led to a shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection . the shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew , and the number of executions fell .
