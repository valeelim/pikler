Graphics Interchange Format     the graphics interchange format ( often shortened to gif ) is a file format for images . it is a raster graphics format ; that is the image has a fixed size . compuserve developed and introduced the format in 1987. today , it is widely used on the world wide web.the format supports up to 8 bits per pixel , or 256 colors . it also supports animations . each frame of an animation can have its own set of 256 colors . gif is not used to show photographs very much , because having only 256 colors is limiting for such a task . to reduce their size , images are compressed using lempel–ziv–welch compression . lempel-ziv-welch , or lzw is a lossless compression . no information is lost when compressing or uncompressing . there were some problems with the patent of the lzw compression . that patent was not held by compuserve , but by unisys . these issues led to the development of another format , called png . this is no longer a problem , because the patents have expired .
