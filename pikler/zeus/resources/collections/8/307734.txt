Trill consonant     a trill consonant is a consonant that is made by vibrating an articulator , or hitting it many times against something else . for example , the < rr > in the spanish word `` perro '' is an alveolar trill , where the tongue is hit many times against the alveolar ridge , or the place just behind the teeth . this vibration is caused by a flow of air . there are three trill consonants in the international phonetic alphabet . these are : - - alveolar trill - - bilabial trill , where the lips are trilled . - - uvular trill , where the uvula is trilled .
