Imprinting     imprinting is a term used in ethology and psychology to describe a special type of automatic learning . it usually occurs early in life , during a critical period . the animal fixes on a particular signal ( sound or sight ) , which is said to be 'imprinted ' onto the subject . the process of imprinting is caused by an inherited instinct . the best-known form of imprinting is the imprinting of the newly-hatched ( or born ) on one or both parent . its function is to keep the young near their parent ( s ) during the early learning period . it is most obvious in birds , such as ducks and geese , after the fledglings have left the nest . they imprint on their parents and then follow them around , often in a long line , on land and on water . it was first reported in domestic chickens , by the 19th-century amateur biologist douglas spalding . it was rediscovered by the early ethologist oskar heinroth , and studied extensively and popularised by his disciple konrad lorenz , and by niko tinbergen . lorenz showed how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what a 'critical period ' of 13â€“16 hours after hatching . for example , the goslings would imprint on lorenz himself ( to be more specific , on his wading boots ) . he is often shown in photographs being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him .
