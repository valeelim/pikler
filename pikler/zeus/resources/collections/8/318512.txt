Weapons of World War I     major advances were made to weapon technology during world war i. there were better grenades , flame throwers , poison gas , and artillery . the submarine , warplane and the tank were new weapons . both sides used a much better heavy machine gun than they had used before in europe . four to six people worked one . they fired 400 to 600 bullets per minute . the machine guns got too hot and needed water on them . this kind of machine gun was invented in 1884 by hiram maxim . the german version was the mg08 . the british used the vickers machine gun , which was very safe and easy to use . the machine guns changed how war went ; and killed many soldiers . because they sometimes got too hot , they could be slow . in case that one of the crew of the machine gun were shot , the whole squad were trained to fill their spot . as the war progressed machine guns got better , and were used in more defensive positions , making them the most deadly weapon on the battle field . the normal british army rifle was the lee enfield 0.303. this was made in 1907 by james lee . the lee enfield could fire twelve bullets per minute . the germans used the mauser rifle made in 1898 by paul mauser . this was an excellent rifle , but it only held five bullets .
