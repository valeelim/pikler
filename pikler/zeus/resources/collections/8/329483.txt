Synapomorphy     a synapomorphy is a common character . it is a term in cladistics , meaning a trait which is present in two or more species by common descent . it is a type of homologous character or homology . more precisely , it is shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor , whose own ancestor in turn does not possess the trait . thus , it is not just an ancestral trait , but a recently evolved distinguishing trait . it helps to distinguish between two trees of descent which would otherwise be equally likely .
