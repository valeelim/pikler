Algebraic solution     an algebraic solution is an algebraic expression which is the solution of an algebraic equation in terms of the coefficients of the variables . it is found only by addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , and the extraction of roots ( square roots , cube roots , etc. ) . the most well-known example is the solution of the general quadratic equation . ( where `` a '' ≠ 0 ) . there is a more complicated solution for the general cubic equation and quartic equation . the abel-ruffini theorem states that the general quintic equation does not have an algebraic solution . this means that the general polynomial equation of degree `` n '' , for `` n '' ≥ 5 , can not be solved by using algebra . however , under certain conditions , we can get algebraic solutions ; for example , the equation formula_3 can be solved as formula_4
