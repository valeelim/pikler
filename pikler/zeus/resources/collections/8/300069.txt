Great White Spot     the great white spot , also known as great white oval , on saturn , is a name given to storms that are large enough to be seen by telescope from earth . the spots appear to be white , and the name was based on jupiter 's great red spot . the spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide . currently , a large band of white clouds called the northern electrostatic disturbance ( because of an increase in radio and plasma interference ) has covered saturn since 2010 , and the cassini orbiter is tracking the storm . cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds , an increase of phosphine , and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm . in april 2011 , the storm had a second eruption . scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planet 's clouds . the spots happen every 28.5 earth years . this is the solstice when saturn 's northern hemisphere tilts most toward the sun . the following is a list of recorded sightings ; years with spots that are part of the cycle are 1876 , 1903 , 1933 , 1960 , and 1990 .
