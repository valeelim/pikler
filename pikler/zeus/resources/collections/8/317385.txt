Ballistic coefficient     in ballistics , the ballistic coefficient ( bc ) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight . a high bc means the object will slow down less . it will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target . bc depends on mass , diameter , and drag coefficient . ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in² or kg/m² . bcs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in² by their manufacturers without referring to this unit . the values for bc can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets . a bullet with a high bc will travel farther than one with a low bc since it will keep its speed better , resist the wind better , and “ shoot flatter ” ( see external ballistics ) . when hunting with a rifle , a higher bc is good for several reasons . a higher bc results in a flatter flight . the effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher bc . this is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal . if the target animal is closer than estimated , then the bullet will hit higher than expected . on the other hand , if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected . such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal .
