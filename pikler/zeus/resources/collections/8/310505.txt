Spectrograph     a spectrograph is an instrument that breaks up a wave into a frequency spectrum . these could be sound , light or radio waves . for example the frequency spectrum of light is the brightness ( intensity ) and the amount of each colour . there are several kinds of machines called `` spectrographs '' , used to look at different waves . the term was first used in 1884. a spectrograph is closely related to a polychromator . in astronomy , the first spectrographs used photographic paper as the detector . the star spectral classification and discovery of the main sequence , hubble 's law and the hubble sequence were all made using photographic paper . the plant pigment phytochrome was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector . new spectrographs use electronic detectors , such as ccds which can be used for both visible and uv light . the type of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded . an echelle spectrograph is a special machine which is able to break up light waves , with a high resolution and little interference . it does this by using very narrow slits which breaks light into beams , and then breaking up those beams again .
