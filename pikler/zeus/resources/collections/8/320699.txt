Kennelly-Heaviside layer     the kennelly–heaviside layer , also known as the e-region , is part of the ionosphere . it is a region which is between 90 km and 150 km from the earth ’ s surface . it is named after the american engineer arthur edwin kennelly and the british scientist oliver heaviside . these two scientists both predicted that this area existed , although it was not until some years later that it was proved . in the kennelly-heaviside layer neutral molecules are split into electrons and positively charged molecules . radio waves can be bounced off the this region so that long-distance radio messages can be sent over long distances around the curved surface of the earth . this was why marconi had been able to send radio messages across the atlantic in 1902 , although it was not understood at the time . references . - the new encyclopædia britannica vol 4 , 15th edition , 1986 , isbn 0-85229-4434-4
