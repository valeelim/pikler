Chemical species     chemical species are atoms , molecules , molecular fragments , ions , etc. , being subjected to a chemical process or to a measurement . generally , a chemical species can be defined as an ensemble of chemically identical molecular entities that can explore the same set of molecular energy levels on a defined time scale . chemists also use chemical species to mean a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array . for example , when molecules of nacl dissolve in water we do n't really have any nacl as such in the solution . we have na and cl ions because nacl dissociates . we say the species present in solution are na ( aq ) and cl ( aq ) . in this case , the species present in solution are the ions . in other cases , where the molecules do n't dissolve in water , we would have molecular species in solution rather than ionic species . in supramolecular chemistry , chemical species are those supramolecular structures whose interactions and associations are brought about by forming or breaking intermolecular bonds . studying these actions is the main topic of supramolecular chemistry .
