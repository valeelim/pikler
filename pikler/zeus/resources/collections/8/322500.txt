Permineralization     permineralization is a process of fossilization in which mineral deposits form internal casts of organisms . minerals in water fill the spaces inside organic tissue . the process gives a record of soft tissue as well as hard tissues . fossils with permineralization are useful in studying internal structures , especially of plants . water from the ground , lakes , or oceans seeps into the pores of organic tissue and forms a crystal cast with deposited minerals . crystals begin to form in the porous cell walls . this process continues on the inner surface of the walls until the central cavity of the cell , the lumen , is completely filled . the cell walls themselves remain intact surrounding the crystals . permineralization is different from petrification in that the organic material is only filled with minerals and not completely replaced . permineralization can occur in several ways : silicification is the most common type of permineralization . carbonate mineralization occurs as coal balls . coal balls are fossilizations of plants and their tissues , usually made when there is seawater or acidic peat . this type of fossilization gives information about plant life in the upper carboniferous ( 325 to 280 million years ago ) .
