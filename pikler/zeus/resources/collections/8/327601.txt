Grimms' Fairy Tales    grimms ' fairy tales children 's and household tales ( ) , commonly known as grimms ' fairy tales ( ) , is a collection of german fairy tales published by jacob and wilhelm grimm , the brothers grimm . on december 20 , 1812 , the grimms published the first volume of the first edition . it contained 86 stories . the second volume of 70 stories was published in 1814. for the second edition , two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822 , totalling 170 tales . the third edition appeared in 1837 ; fourth edition , 1840 ; fifth edition , 1843 ; sixth edition , 1850 ; seventh edition , 1857. stories were added , and also deleted , from one edition to the next , until the seventh held 211 tales . all editions were extensively illustrated , first by philipp grot johann and , after his death in 1892 , by robert leinweber . the first volumes were much criticized because they were considered unsuitable for children , both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter . many changes through the editions – such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in `` snow white '' and `` hansel and gretel '' to a stepmother , were probably made with an eye to such criticism . they removed sexual references—such as rapunzel 's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly , and thus naïvely revealing her pregnancy and the prince 's visits to her stepmother—but , in many respects , violence , particularly when punishing villains , was increased . in 1825 , the grimms published their `` kleine ausgabe '' or `` small edition , '' a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers . this children 's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858 .
