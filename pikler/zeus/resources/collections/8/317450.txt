Foam     a foam is a substance that is formed by trapping gas in bubbles . gas is present in large amounts so it will be divided in gas bubbles separated by liquid regions which may form films , thinner and thinner when the liquid phase is drained out of the system . when the scale is small , e.g . for fine foam , this dispersed medium can be considered as a type of colloid .
