Equilibrium constant     for a general chemical equilibrium the equilibrium constant can be defined by where { a } is the activity of the chemical species a , etc . ( activity is a dimensionless quantity ) . it is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator . for equilibria in solution , activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient . most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength . in high strength solutions , the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little . so , the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient : however , the value of k will depend on the ionic strength . ( the square brackets mean the concentration of a , b and so on . ) this is a simple idea . in an equilibrium , atoms can combine or break apart because the reaction can work in both directions . for the reaction to work , all of the parts must be present to combine . this is more likely to happen if the reactants have a higher concentration . so , the concentrations of all the necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place for the reaction . ( if the reaction requires two molecules of a particular compound , then the concentration of that compound is squared . ) going the other way , all of the concentrations of those necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place to react in the opposite direction . the ratio between those two numbers represents how popular each side of the reaction will be when equilibrium is reached . an equilibrium constant of 1 means that both sides are equally popular . chemists perform experiments to measure the equilibrium constant of various reactions .
