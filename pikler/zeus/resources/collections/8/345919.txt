Natural law     natural law is the idea that there are forms of law that exist by themselves . unlike other forms of law ( called `` positive laws '' ) that have been agreed on by society , such laws would be given to all , and would not be possible to do without . such rights are called natural . in modern times , human rights are often seen as coming from natural law , but the idea goes back to ancient greece . natural law is often founded on the following : - god , who created natural law with creating the world - logos , an idea from philosophy ; this is interpreted to be divine law - part of natural law inside human beings ( called self-knowledge , sometimes conscience ) - certain laws that can be deduced from the natural sciences - nature itself - reason important philosophers who developed natural law include aristotle , plato , seneca the younger , thomas aquinas , and immanuel kant . people who critizised this approach include jeremy bentham and hans kelsen . other pages . - constitution - jurisprudence
