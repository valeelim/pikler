Denying the correlative     denying the correlative is a mistake in logic where a person tries to create a third possibility where there are only two . it is based on the concept of correlative conjunctions , pairs of statements where one statement must be true and the other must be false . for example 1. ginger is a cat . 2. ginger is not a cat . if a person claims that ginger is something else than a cat or not a cat , then he is making a logically impossible claim , and denying the correlative . it is the opposite of the false dilemma , which tries to reduce options to only two . another is if a person were asked if he killed someone and said , `` i fought with him '' . that does not answer the question .
