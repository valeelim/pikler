Toxicity     toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism . it is the subject-matter of toxicology . a central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess . effects are dose-dependent : even water can lead to 'water intoxication ' when taken in too much . for even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect . toxicity is species-specific . a dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another . acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure , or from many exposures in a short amount of time ( usually less than 24 hours ) . to be known as `` acute '' toxicity , the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something . acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity . chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures , often at lower levels , to a substance over a longer amount of time ( months or years ) .
