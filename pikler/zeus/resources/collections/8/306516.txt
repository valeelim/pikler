Yield (chemistry)    yield ( chemistry ) in chemistry , yield ( also called chemical yield or reaction yield ) is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction . the `` absolute yield '' gives the weight in grams , and the `` molar yield '' gives the number of moles . the `` fractional yield '' , `` relative yield '' , or `` percentage yield '' shows how completely a synthetic procedure worked . it is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the `` theoretical yield '' ( the unit of measurement for both must be the same ) : formula_1 to get the `` percentage yield '' , one must multiply the fractional yield by 100 % ( e.g. , 0.673 Ã— 100 % = 67.3 % ) . the ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100 % , but it can not be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate . yields around 100 % are `` quantitative '' , yields above 90 % are `` excellent '' , yields above 80 % are `` very good '' , yields above 70 % are `` good '' , yields below 50 % are `` fair '' , however yields below 40 % are `` poor '' .
