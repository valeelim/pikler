Thermosetting polymer     a thermosetting plastic , also known as a thermoset , is polymer material that irreversibly cures . the curing may be done by : thermoset materials are usually liquid or malleable before curing , so they can be molded into their final form . others are used as adhesives . others are solids . some solid thermosetting polymers are used as molding compound in semiconductors and integrated circuits ( ic ) . once hardened a thermoset resin can not be reheated and melted back to a liquid form . the curing process transforms the resin into a plastic or rubber by a cross-linking process . energy and/or catalysts are added that cause the molecular chains to react at chemically active sites ( unsaturated or epoxy sites , for example ) , linking into a rigid , 3-d structure . the cross-linking forms a molecule with a larger molecular weight , resulting in a material with a higher melting point . during the reaction , the polymer 's molecular weight increases to the point that its melting point is higher than the surrounding ambient temperature . so , the material forms into a solid material .
