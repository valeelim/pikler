Loyalist (American Revolution)    loyalist ( american revolution ) loyalists were people in the thirteen colonies who opposed the american revolutionary war . they were also called tories . they fought with the british against the continental army and continental congress that they felt was oppressing them . in many areas , loyalists were treated very roughly by revolutionaries ( who often called themselves `` patriots '' ) . tory lands and other properties were taken away , and sometimes they were put into jail or even killed . some formed militias , fighting along with the british army against the rebels . after the war , many loyalists sought asylum in canada to escape the new united states and to stay loyal to king george and the british empire . loyalists came from all walks of life . the majority were small farmers , artisans and shopkeepers . not surprisingly , most british officials remained loyal to the crown . wealthy merchants tended to remain loyal , as did anglican ministers , especially in puritan new england . loyalists also included some blacks ( to whom the british promised freedom ) , indians , indentured servants and some german immigrants , who supported the crown mainly because george iii was of german origin .
