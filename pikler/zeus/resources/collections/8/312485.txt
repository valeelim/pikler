Ocean acidification     ocean acidification is the decrease in the ph ( scale of acidity and alkalinity ) and increase in acidity of the earth 's oceans . it is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) that humans have put into the atmosphere . more than 30 % of the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the oceans . therefore , when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases , the carbon dioxide in the ocean increases , too . when carbon dioxide enters the oceans , it makes it more acidic . the skeletons and shells of many sea animals need what is known as calcium carbonate minerals . due to ocean acidification , there are fewer of these minerals and there are species that could no longer produce or keep their shells . with more carbon dioxide in the ocean , this problem becomes worse and many species will be at risk . as a result , if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , ocean life will be in severe danger . also , coral is at risk , as it is being eroded by the acid in the ocean . between 1751 ce and 1994 ce the ocean 's ph on the surface went from 8.25 to 8.1 .
