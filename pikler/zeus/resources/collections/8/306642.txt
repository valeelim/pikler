Sorption     when two chemical substances come in contact with each other , through what is called a phase , they will interact with each other in that phase . they may also have an interface . if a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption , if the same process happens on the interface , it is called adsorption . in the year 1909 , james william mcbain introduced the word sorption to describe such a process , in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and absorption . examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment ; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air ( called aerosols ) , or in the soil ( where they bind to colloids ) . sorption makes these bindings possible . in much the same way , polluants can be transported over long distances . machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning .
