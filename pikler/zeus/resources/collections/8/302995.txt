Woodward's rules    woodward 's rules woodward 's rules are a set of rules about how organic chemical compounds absorb ultraviolet light . they give information about the wavelength of the absorption maximum ( symbol Î» ) in an ultraviolet-visible ( uv ) spectrum of a compound . the rules are named after robert burns woodward . he was a harvard university professor who won the 1965 nobel prize in chemistry . the rules are sometimes called the woodward-fieser rules , to also honor louis fieser . the rules build the prediction on the type of chromophores present , the substituents on the chromophores , and changes due to the solvent . examples are conjugated carbonyl compounds , conjugated dienes , and polyenes . one set of woodward-fieser rules for dienes is shown in table one . a diene is either homoannular with both double bonds contained in one ring or heteroannular with two double bonds distributed between two rings . these rules predict the uv absorption maximum of compounds . here are two examples : in the compound on the left the base value is 214 nm ( a heteroannular diene ) . this diene group has 4 alkyl substituents ( labeled 1,2,3,4 ) and the double bond in one ring is exocyclic to the other ( adding 5 nm for an exocyclic double bond ) . in the compound on the right , the diene is homoannular with 4 alkyl substituents . both double bonds in the central b ring are exocyclic with respect to rings a and c .
