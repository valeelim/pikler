Army of Northern Virginia     the army of northern virginia was the most successful of any confederate army during the american civil war . it was the main confederate fighting force in the eastern theater of the american civil war . the army often fought against the union army of the potomac . the army was led by several generals during its early history , but was best known for its final leader , general robert e. lee , who took over in june of 1862. for that reason it was often called `` lee 's army '' . the army , when first organized was called the ( confederate ) army of the potomac . it was formed october 22 , 1861. confederate general p. g. t. beauregard was first given command of what was called the `` alexandria line '' on may 31 , 1861. he joined his troops near manassas , virginia on june 2. he planned an attack on washington , d.c. which first required pushing the union army back behind bull run . he called for additional support from joseph e. johnston 's army in the shenandoah valley . on the morning of july 21 , 1861 , beauregard planned a surprise attack on the union forces that failed . he was driven back until the afternoon , when johnston 's troops arrived by train . the confederates were then able to push the union forces back and created a victory out of a near-disaster . both beauregard and johnston were full generals . but johnson took over command of the two armies which were now merged into one . confederate president jefferson davis did not like or agree with beauregard . there was a series of verbal disputes with beauregard following johnston taking command . possibly as a result , beauregard was sent west in january 1862 to serve as second in command in the army of mississippi .
