Mesoproterozoic     the mesoproterozoic is a geologic era which lasted from 1,600 million years ago ( mya ) to 1,000 mya . the major events of this era are : - the breakup of the columbia supercontinent ~1,500 mya ; - the assembly of the rodinia supercontinent ~1,100 mya ; - the evolution of sexual reproduction . evidence of a eukaryotic red algae , `` bangiomorpha pubescens '' , has been identified from ~1200 mya old rocks in the hunting formation ( somerset island , canada ) . this is the oldest known sexually reproducing organism and therefore the earliest known complex multicellular organism .
