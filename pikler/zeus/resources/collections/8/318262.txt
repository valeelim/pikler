Cosmic distance ladder     the cosmic distance ladder ( also known as the extragalactic distance scale ) is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space . no one method works for all objects and distances , so astronomers use a number of methods . a real `` direct '' distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to earth ( within about a thousand parsecs ) . it is the larger distances which are the problem . several methods rely on a standard candle , which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity . the ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy . instead , one method can be used to measure nearby distances , a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances , and so on . each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung . the astronomical unit is the mean ( average ) distance of the earth from the sun . this we know quite accurately . radar bounce off artificial satellites and inner planets provide the data , then the result is worked out by computer .
