Biological control     biological control , or biological pest control , is the reduction of pest populations by using natural enemies . it is important because crop pests become resistant to chemical pesticides . natural enemies of insect pests include predators , parasitoids , and pathogens . biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens . predators , such as birds , lady beetles and lacewings , are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime . parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host , ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host . most have a very narrow host range . many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids . pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria , fungi , and viruses . they kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific . there are three basic types of biological control strategies ; conservation , classical biological control , and augmentation . - conservation : avoid using pesticides , which kill the natural enemies of the pests . encourage the growth of those things which attack the pests . use companion planting where possible . in china , the mosquito fern has been used for at least a thousand years , as a companion plant for rice crops . it hosts a special cyanobacteria that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere , and also blocks out light from competing plants ( but not the rice , which grows taller ) .
