Collimated light     collimated light is light whose rays are parallel , and therefore will spread slowly as it propagates . the word is related to `` collinear '' with all rays lining up . in theory , collimated light does not disperse with distance . really , collimated light will disperse a little as it travels over distance . diffraction prevents scientists from creating a perfectly collimated beam with no divergence . light can be roughly collimated by using a `` collimator '' a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves . the word `` collimate '' comes from the latin verb `` collimare '' , which originated in a misreading of `` collineare '' , `` to direct in a straight line '' . laser light from crystal and some gas lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an optical cavity between two parallel mirrors , in addition to being coherent . the divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian , and can be much less for large-diameter beams . laser diodes emit less collimated light due to their short cavity , and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens .
