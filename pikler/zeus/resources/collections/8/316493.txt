Brick Lane     brick lane is a street in the london borough of tower hamlets , in the east end of london . it is part of an old area which includes bethnal green , whitechapel , spitalfields and petticoat lane . today , it is the heart of the city 's british bangladeshi community and is known to some as `` banglatown '' . it is famous for its many curry houses . it has a most interesting history . brick lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture , using the local brick earth deposits , that began in the 15th century . successive waves of immigration began with huguenot refugees spreading from spitalfields , where the master weavers were based , in the 17th century . this started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries . the huguenots were followed by irish , ashkenazi jews and , in the last century , bangladeshis . the area became a centre for weaving , tailoring and the clothing industry , due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour . brewing came to brick lane before 1680 , with water drawn from deep wells . one brewer was joseph truman , first recorded in 1683. his family went on to establish the sizable black eagle brewery on brick lane .
