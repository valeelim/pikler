Pyramid scheme     a pyramid scheme is a way of making money that can not continue very long . it involves promising people payment , services or ideals , primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part . it does not supply any real investment or sale of products or services to the public . pyramid schemes are a form of fraud . for this reason , pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries . this type of scheme has existed for at least a century ( 100 years ) . the way the scheme is described is sometimes changed to hide what it is doing . many people believe that multilevel marketing ( mlm ) is also a pyramid scheme . a successful pyramid scheme combines a business that seems real with a simple-to-understand money-making description which is used for profit . the idea is that the first person , mr. x , makes a payment . to get money , mr. x has to recruit others like him who will also make a payment . mr. x gets paid out of money received from those new people ( recruits ) . the recruits go on to involve others . as each new recruit makes a payment , mr. x gets a part . he is promised always increasing benefits as the `` business '' expands .
