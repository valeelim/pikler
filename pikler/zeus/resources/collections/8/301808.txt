Polymerase chain reaction     polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is a way to make many copies of a sequence of dna . this is done in a lab , using an enzyme called dna polymerase . it is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle . this allows exponential growth to happen . pcr has many uses in a biological or biochemical setting . because dna is unique for every living thing , experimenters can often extract only small amounts of the dna they are interested in from a specimen . these amounts are usually too little to be useful , and so a scientist will use pcr to make enough copies to start experimenting with . for this reason , it is one of the most common techniques used in genetics labs around the world , making it useful in experiments on many things , including gene therapy , infectious diseases , and even forensics . this process was developed in 1983 by kary mullis . he was not the first person to develop the pcr process , but he was the first to make the process usable . he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry along with michael smith for their work in the pcr process .
