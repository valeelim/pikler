Euston Arch     the euston arch was an archway built at the front of euston railway station in london . it was built in 1837 by the london and birmingham railway . the people in charge of the new and modern railway wanted passengers to have a good feeling about the station . they built the large arch as a gate in front of the station to attract attention . four columns supported the arch . the outside two columns were plain and square . the inside two were circular and decorated in the doric style . this doric style gave the arch its common name of `` the doric arch '' . originally , the words `` london and birmingham railway '' marked the top of the gate . in 1870 , the letters euston in gold were carved into the beam across the tops of the four columns . this railway company had joined other companies to form the london and north western railway . this new company did not want passengers to use the old name . it changed the name of the arch from the company name to the station name . in 1960s , britain was modernising the railways . diesel locomotives were replacing of steam locomotives . overhead electric wires were added to the important line from euston station in london to the north west of england . the old euston station was also to replaced . the railway added more platforms and more space at the front of the station for cars . by 1961 the arch had been removed .
