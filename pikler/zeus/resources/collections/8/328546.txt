Homologous chromosome     homologous chromosomes are the pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism . they are the chromosomes which pair during meiosis . with the exception of the sex chromosomes , each pair has the gene loci in the same positions on each chromosome , and the centromere in the same position . they are not genetically identical because they will usually have different alleles ( versions of a gene ) at some of the loci . the most important fact is that homologous chromosomes physically pair for meiosis , the cell division which produces the gametes . during this pairing , crossing over takes place between chromatids of each pair . this exchange of alleles means the offspring are not identical to each other , or to either parent . in other words , the process increases the genetic variation in the population . sex chromosomes only pair along those parts where there is similar genetic material ( loci ) on both members of the pair .
