Approximant consonant     an approximant consonant is a consonant that sounds in some ways like a vowel . for example , lateral approximants like the sound for `` l '' in the english word `` like '' , the sound for `` r '' in the english word `` right '' , and semivowels like the sound for `` y '' in `` yes '' and the sound for `` w '' in `` wet '' are all approximants . these sounds are pronounced by bringing two parts of the mouth , for example the tongue and the roof of the mouth , close to each other . however , it is not close enough to cause the air to be blocked , like in a fricative consonant . also , the parts are not far apart enough to become a vowel . semivowels are a type of approximant consonant , which sound like vowels if you pronounced them alone . however , many languages use them as consonants . here are the common semivowels in the international phonetic alphabet . central approximants . - bilabial approximant ( usually transcribed ) - labiodental approximant - dental approximant ( usually transcribed ) - alveolar approximant
