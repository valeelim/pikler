Thermal expansion     in physics , thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature . when a substance is heated , its constituent particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average . materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon ; this effect is limited in size , and only occurs within limited temperature ranges . the degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material 's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature . thermometers are an example of using thermal expansion . they contain a liquid which can only move in one direction ( along the tube ) when volume changes along with temperature .
