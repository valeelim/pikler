Heterochromia     heterochromia means `` different colours '' , and is most used for the description of different coloured eyes . some people , and animals , have differences between the irises of their eyes . there are many different causes for this condition . genetic causes for heterochromia include genetic mosaicism , where changes may take place in the dividing cells leading up to iris formation in the embryo . or , environmental damage may occur to the eyes . or , various diseases and medical conditions may result in changes in eye colour . similar events may happen in other tissues , and sometimes result in visible tissue differences . however , the condition is most easily seen in the iris of the eye . the terms `` hetrochromia iridis '' ( = different colour of the iris ) , `` heterochromia iridum '' ( plural form ) and `` heterochromia iridium '' ( a mistake in latin grammar ) are variously used when it is the eye colour which is specifically mentioned .
