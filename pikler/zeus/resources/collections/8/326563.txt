Poaching     poaching is the illegal hunting , killing or capturing of animals . people poach because animal products , such as hide , ivory , horn , teeth and bone , are sold to dealers who make clothes , jewelry and other materials from them . the poaching causes various effects , its most direct impact is extinction , either globally or within a given locality . poachers catch indian tigers with steel traps . this is against the law . after trapping a tiger , they kill it and sell the body parts for money . like the rhino , the tiger is a very endangered species . if the killing does not end , they both face extinction ( all of that type of animal dies ) . extinction means that someday there may be no indian tigers or rhinos left on earth .
