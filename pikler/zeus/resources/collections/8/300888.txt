Xpress     xpress is a steel launched roller coaster at walibi holland in the netherlands . it opened in 2000 under the name `` superman the ride '' . however , six flags was planning to open it under the name `` riddlers revenge '' and the ride was painted green at the factory . shortly before the coaster was built , the name was changed to `` superman the ride '' and was painted red and blue . since 2005 the coaster is called `` xpress '' . it is the first lsm coaster in europe . the coaster had been standing but not operating for the whole season in 2011. the reason for this was because important parts of the launch mechanism were broken , which can cause that the train does not have enough speed at the end of the launch , or does n't launch at all . these parts are ordered and are only made on request , as there are only 3 coasters of this type worldwide ( 2 of which are in disney parks ) . therefore , walibi holland decided to paint the track . as of 2012 , the coaster operates again .
