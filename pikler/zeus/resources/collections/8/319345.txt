Synchrotron     a synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator where particles travel around many times in a circle . it uses a magnetic field to turn the particles in the circle and the electric field to accelerate the particles . the components are carefully synchronized with the travelling particle beam . mark oliphant invented the proton synchrotron . vladimir veksler was the first to publish the idea . edwin mcmillan constructed the first electron synchrotron . the synchrotron is an improvement over the cyclotron where the particles travel in a spiral pattern . a cyclotron uses a constant magnetic field and a constant-frequency applied electric field . ( one of these is varied in the synchrocyclotron ) . both of these fields are varied in the synchrotron to change the path from a spiral to a circle . by increasing these parameters appropriately as the particles gain energy , the diameters of the path can be held constant as the machine accelerates the particles . this allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin circular pipe torus . it is easier to use some straight sections between the bending magnets and some bent sections within the magnets giving the torus the shape of a round-cornered polygon . a path of large effective radius can be constructed using simple straight and curved pipe segments , unlike the disc-shaped chamber of the cyclotron type devices . the shape also requires the use of multiple magnets to bend the particle beams . straight sections are required at spacings around a ring for both radiofrequency cavities , and in third generation setups space is allowed for insertion of energy extraction devices such as wigglers and undulators . most synchrotrons use two types of magnets : dipole magnets to bend the particle beam and quadrupole magnets to focus the beam .
