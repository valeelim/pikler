Black hole information paradox     the black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics . it is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together . this phenomenon states that the information a physical system has can be lost when it enters a black hole . the object that falls into a black hole , only keeps information about its spin , mass and charge . however , the quantum mechanics says that information can not be lost . this makes it a paradox .
