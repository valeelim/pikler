Inland sea     inland seas , also called epeiric or epicontinental seas , are shallow seas over part of a continent . they usually happen with marine transgressions , when the sea overtops the land . they are caused by either global high ( 'eustatic ' ) sea level or the formation of large geologic basins which eventually connect to the ocean . there have been , at some periods , shallow seas `` inside '' continents . much of present-day north america was covered by an epicontinental sea called the sundance sea during the jurassic period . in the cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the western interior seaway . a modern example is the baltic sea . the north sea is not an inland sea , but it does sit on continental shelf , and so is epeiric ( that is what the word means ) . the hudson bay is often considered an epeiric sea because its depth averages 100ft ( 30 m ) whereas , for example , the bay of bengal is 2,600 metres deep . so epeiric seas are on the continental plate , as are inland seas . the inland seas , however , are more enclosed .
