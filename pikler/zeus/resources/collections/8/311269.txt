Royal Standard of Scotland     the royal standard of scotland , ( ) , also known as the banner of the king of scots , or more commonly the lion rampant of scotland , is the scottish royal banner of arms . used historically by the king of scots , the royal standard of scotland differs from scotland 's national flag , the saltire , in that its correct use is restricted by an act of the parliament of scotland to only a few great officers of state who officially represent the sovereign in scotland . it is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in scotland when the sovereign is not present . the earliest recorded use of the lion rampant as a royal emblem in scotland was by alexander ii in 1222 ; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of alexander iii ( 1249â€“1286 ) . this emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient kingdom of scotland which , together with a royal banner displaying the same , was used by the king of scots until the union of the crowns in 1603 , when james vi acceded to the thrones of the kingdom of england and kingdom of ireland . since 1603 , the lion rampant of scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive scottish then british monarchs in order to symbolise scotland ; as can be seen today in the royal standard of the united kingdom . although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the sovereign and at royal residences , the royal standard of scotland continues to be one of scotland 's most recognisable symbols .
