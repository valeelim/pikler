Linear Pottery culture     the linear pottery culture was an important culture in the neolithic ( later stone age ) of europe . it was from 5500â€“4500 bc . it is abbreviated as lbk and is also known as the linear band ware , linear ware , linear ceramics or incised ware culture . the most evidence for the culture is in central europe . it is important evidence for early farming in europe . the pottery after which it was named has simple cups , bowls , vases and jugs , without handles . they were made as kitchen dishes , or for carrying food and drink . the pots had line patterns on them . the lbk people lived over a period of 1000 years , long before the bronze age and farmed crops like wheat , lentils and peas . they also kept cows and dogs , and sometimes hunted in the forests around them for other animals , like deer . their diet probably did n't contain enough energy for them , as they often did not grow as tall as the people who came before them , or as people do now . this might have also been because of disease , which can spread more easily in a village than it can when people are moving about a lot and not seeing many other people , as people did before the neolithic . people in the lbk culture probably died quite young , in their twenties or thirties , and many of their children would die before they grew up .
