Right- and left-hand traffic     the driving side of a road is the side on which traffic flows . each country says whether traffic will keep on the right-hand or left-hand side of the road . this is sometimes called the rule of the road . this basic rule makes traffic move easier . it also reduces the risk of head-on collisions . today about 66.1 % of the world 's people live in countries who drive on the right-hand . 33.9 % live in countries that drive on the left-hand . while most countries who drive on the left-hand are former british colonies , there are some that were not that still chose the the right-hand side of the road , including japan , thailand , nepal , bhutan , mozambique , suriname , east timor , and indonesia . today , only four european countries still drive on the right-hand , the united kingdom , ireland , malta , and cyprus , all of which are islands . there are several countries where their territories that exist outside the mainland drive on a different side from the mainland , one well-known example being china driving on the left-hand , except for its special administrative regions hong kong and macau , which drive on the right-hand .
