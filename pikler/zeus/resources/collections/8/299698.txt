Antlers     antlers are usually large , branching structures , made of bone , which grow on the heads of deer and similar animals . with deer , only males have antlers . only reindeer ( caribou ) have antlers on the females , and these are normally smaller than those of the males . while an antler is growing , it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet , which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone . antlers are one of the most striking cases of male secondary sex characteristics in the animal kingdom . they grow faster than any other mammal bones . growth occurs at the tip , and is initially cartilage , which is mineralized to become bone . once the antler has achieved its full size , the velvet is lost and the antler 's bone dies . this dead bone structure is the mature antler . the antlers fall off at some point . to re-grow antlers each year uses up nutrition , so they are honest signals of food gathering capability . the principle means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection , which operates by two mechanisms : maleâ€“male competition ( behaviorally , physiologically ) and female mate choice .
