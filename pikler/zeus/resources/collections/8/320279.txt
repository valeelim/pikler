Insertion device     in physics , an insertion device is a group of magnets that can be placed on a straight segment of a particle accelerator to be a synchrotron light source . they are called an `` insertion devices '' because they replace pipe that otherwise would hold the vacuum needed to maintain the particle beam path . many times , insertion devices are used on the circular path of a synchrotron or a storage ring . there are two types of insertion devices . undulators make electromagnetic radiation that is tuned to a narrow frequency range . wigglers make a wide range of electromagnetic radiation frequencies .
