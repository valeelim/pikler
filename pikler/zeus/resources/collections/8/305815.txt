Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty     an area of outstanding natural beauty ( aonb ) is an area of countryside considered to have significant landscape value in england , wales or northern ireland . natural england designates them on behalf of the united kingdom government . the countryside council for wales designates them on behalf of the welsh government . the northern ireland environment agency designates them on behalf of the northern ireland executive . the chief purpose of the aonb designation is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape , with two secondary aims : meeting the need for quiet enjoyment of the countryside and having regard for the interests of those who live and work there . to achieve these aims , aonbs rely on planning controls and practical countryside management . as they have the same landscape quality , aonbs may be compared to the national parks of england and wales . aonbs are created under the same legislation as the national parks , the national parks and access to the countryside act 1949. unlike aonbs , national parks have their own authorities , have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development , and are well known to many inhabitants of england , wales and northern ireland .
