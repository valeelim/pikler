Aromatic hydrocarbon     an aromatic hydrocarbon , or arene , is a hydrocarbon ring compound . it has alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings . many of the compounds have a sweet scent , hence the term 'aromatic ' . the ring of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring , after the simplest possible hydrocarbon ring , benzene . aromatic hydrocarbons can be `` monocyclic '' ( mah ) or `` polycyclic '' ( pah ) . some non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes , which follow hückel 's rule , are also aromatic compounds . in these compounds , at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of oxygen , nitrogen , or sulfur . benzene , ch , is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon , with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by kekulé in the 19th century . each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share . one goes to the hydrogen atom , and one each to the two neighboring carbons . this leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms , which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon .
