Karl Pearson     karl pearson frs ( 27 march 1857 – 27 april 1936 ) was an influential english mathematician . he helped establish the discipline of mathematical statistics . `` carl pearson '' became `` karl pearson '' by accident when he enrolled at the university of heidelberg in 1879. they changed the spelling . he used both versions of his name until 1884 when he finally adopted karl . eventually he became known as `` kp '' . in 1911 he founded the world 's first university statistics department at university college london . he was a proponent of eugenics , and a protégé and biographer of sir francis galton . a conference was held in london on 23 march 2007 , to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth . pearson met charles darwin 's cousin francis galton , who was interested in heredity and eugenics . pearson became galton 's protégé , at times close to hero worship . after galton 's death in 1911 , pearson started on a massive three-volume biography of galton . the biography was done `` to satisfy myself and without regard to ... the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public '' . it celebrated galton 's life , work , and talent . he predicted ( wrongly ) that galton , rather than charles darwin , would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of erasmus darwin .
