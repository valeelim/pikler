Lime (material)    lime ( material ) lime is a general term for various naturally occurring minerals and materials derived from them in which carbonates , oxides and hydroxides of calcium predominate . these materials are used in large quantities as building and engineering materials ( including limestone products , concrete , and mortar ) , and as chemical feedstocks , among other uses . the rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived , primarily limestone and chalk , are composed primarily of calcium carbonate . `` burning '' ( calcination ) converts them into the highly caustic material `` quicklime '' ( calcium oxide ) , and , through the addition of water , into the less caustic , but still strongly alkaline `` slaked lime '' ( calcium hydroxide ) . in general writing when the term is used in an agricultural context it probably refers to agricultural lime . otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime , as the more dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or `` burnt lime '' .
