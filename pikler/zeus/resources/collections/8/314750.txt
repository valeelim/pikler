Orbital forcing     orbital forcing is the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the earth 's axis and shape of the orbit ( see milankovitch cycles ) . these orbital changes alter the amount of sunlight reaching the earth by up to 25 % at mid-latitudes . in this context , the term `` forcing '' is a physical process that affects the earth 's climate . this mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles . the timing of past glacial periods coincides very well with the predictions of the milankovitch theory , and these effects can be calculated into the future . note in the graphic the strong 100,000 year periodicity of the cycles , and the striking asymmetry of the curves . ice ages deepen by progressive steps , but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step .
