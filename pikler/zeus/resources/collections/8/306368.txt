Computational chemistry     computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer science to help solve chemical problems . these programs calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids . computational chemistry normally complements the information obtained by chemical experiments . it can predict chemical phenomena that have not yet been observed . it is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials . computational chemistry can predict structure ( that is , the expected positions of the molecule 's atoms ) , absolute and relative ( interaction ) energies , electronic charge distributions , dipoles and higher multipole moments , vibrational frequencies , reactivity or other spectroscopic quantities , and cross sections for collision with other particles . computational chemistry looks at both static and dynamic systems . in all cases , as the size of the system being studied grows , the computer time and other resources ( such as memory and disk space ) used also grows . that system can be a single molecule , a group of molecules , or a solid . computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate . highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems .
