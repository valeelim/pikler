Paul Flory     paul john flory ( june 19 , 1910 â€“ september 9 , 1985 ) was an american chemist and nobel laureate . he worked in the field of polymers , or macromolecules . he was a leading pioneer in understanding how polymers dissolve in solutions . he won the nobel prize in chemistry in 1974 `` for his fundamental achievements , both theoretical and experimental , in the physical chemistry of macromolecules . '' he graduated from elgin high school in elgin , illinois in 1927. flory received a bachelor 's degree from manchester college ( indiana ) in 1931 and a ph.d. from the ohio state university in 1934. his first position was at dupont with wallace carothers . flory 's earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the dupont experimental station . most chemists studying condensation polymerization believed that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew . flory argued that the reactivity was independent of the polymer 's size . he showed that the number of polymer chains present decreased with size exponentially .
