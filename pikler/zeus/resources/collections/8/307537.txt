Habituation     habituation is a basic activity whereby an animal responds less to repeated stimuli . it is a primitive kind of learning . the learning that underlies habituation is a basic process of biological systems . animals do not need conscious motivation or awareness for it to occur . habituation enables organisms to distinguish meaningful information from background stimuli . habituation occurs in all animals , as well as in the large protozoan `` stentor coeruleus '' . the decrease in responding is specific to the habituated stimulus . for example , if one was habituated to the taste of lemon , their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime . two factors that can influence habituation include the time between each stimulus , and the length of time the stimulus is presented . shorter intervals and longer durations increase habituation , and `` vice versa '' . habituation need not be conscious . for example , a short time after a person dresses , the stimulus clothing creates disappears from our nervous systems and we become unaware of it . in this way , habituation is used to ignore any continual stimulus . this sort of habituation can occur through changes in sensory nerves themselves , and through negative feedback from the brain to peripheral sensory organs .
