Xenoturbella     xenoturbella is a genus of bilaterian animals ; it contains two marine worm-like species . the first known species was discovered in 1915 but was only described in 1949. a 2003 dna study has shown it is a primitive deuterostome phylum . the genus was the first member of its subphylum ( the xenoturbellida ) to be discovered . this phylum is basal within the deuterostomes . it is related to the acoelomorpha , forming a sister clade to the echinoderms and hemichordates . other members of this phylum are now known . `` xenoturbella '' has a very simple body plan : it has no brain , no through gut , no excretory system , no organized gonads ( but does have gametes ) , or any other organs except for a statocyst containing flagellated cells . it has cilia and a diffuse nervous system . the animal is up to long , and has been found off the coasts of sweden , scotland and iceland . the association of specimens of `` xenoturbella '' with mollusc larva has led many to suggest that they are molluscivores . however , another idea is that the `` xenoturbella '' larval stage develops as an internal parasite of certain molluscs .
