Neognathae     neognaths are birds in the subclass neornithes . the neognathae include almost all living birds : their sister taxon palaeognathae has just the tinamou and the flightless ratites . there are nearly 10,000 species of neognaths . since the cretaceous they have undergone an adaptive radiation . this has produced the variety of form , function , and behavior which we see today . the passeriformes ( perching birds ) are the largest order of land vertebrates . they are some 60 % of living birds . the neognaths have fused hand bones , an elongate third finger , and 13 or fewer vertebrae . they differ from the palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones . `` neognathae '' means `` new jaws '' but , ironically , paleognath jaws are one of the few derived ) features of that group .
