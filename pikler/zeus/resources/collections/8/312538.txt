Tetration     tetration is the hyperoperation which comes after exponentiation . formula_1 means y exponentiated by itself , ( x-1 ) times . list of first 4 natural number hyperoperations : 1. addition - formula_2 - `` a '' succeeded `` n '' times . 1. multiplication - formula_3 - `` a '' added to itself , `` n '' times . 1. exponentiation - formula_4 - `` a '' multiplied by itself , `` n '' times . 1. tetration - formula_5 - note ( operator associativity ) : formula_6 - `` a '' exponentiated by itself , `` n-1 '' times . the above example is read as `` the nth tetration of a '' . for the example , addition is assumed . - formula_7 - formula_8 - formula_9 - formula_10 - formula_11 - formula_12 - formula_13
