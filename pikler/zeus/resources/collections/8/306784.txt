Amu Darya     the amu darya ( , `` āmūdaryā '' ; , `` jihôn '' or `` jayhoun '' ; , `` gozan '' ) , also called oxus and amu river , is a major river in central asia . it is formed by the junction of the vakhsh and panj . in ancient times , the river was regarded as the boundary between iran and tūrān . in antiquity , the river was known as `` vaksu '' to indo-aryans . in ancient afghanistan , the river was also called `` gozan '' , descriptions of which can be found in the book `` the kingdom of afghanistan : a historical sketch by george passman tate '' . in classical antiquity , the river was known as the `` ōxus '' in latin and ὦξος `` oxos '' in greek . the name `` amu '' is said to have come from the medieval city of `` āmul '' , ( later , chahar joy/charjunow , and now known as `` türkmenabat '' ) , in modern turkmenistan . `` darya '' is the persian word for `` river '' . amu darya is a river almost in reverse . it gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the pamir knot at the eastern end of afghanistan 's `` wakhan corridor '' , and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of turkmenistan 's '' kyzyl kum '' desert instead of the inland aral sea as it did in former times .
