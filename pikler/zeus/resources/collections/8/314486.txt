Parietal lobe     the parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe . the parietal lobe brings together information from different senses , particularly spatial sense and navigation . for example , it uses input about touch , balance and the visual system . this enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body ( into 'body coordinate positions ' ) . this makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects . the name derives from the overlying parietal bone , which is named from the latin `` pariet- '' , = 'wall ' .
