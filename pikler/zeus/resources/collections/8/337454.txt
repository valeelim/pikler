Galli     the galli ( singular : gallus ) were eunuch priests of the goddess cybele or agdistis . they were temple attendants sometimes wandering the streets begging for charity , and in return they told people 's fortunes . the galli wore feminine clothing and grew their hair long , wearing earrings , necklaces , and heavy make-up . at festivals to cybele and attis they danced around wildly to loud music and whipped themselves until they bled . the newcomers to the priesthood would voluntarily castrate themselves . in rome , the head of the galli was known as the archigallus . a number of archaeological finds depict the archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes . the archigallus was always a roman citizen chosen by rome 's college of priests , and the term of service lasted for life . along with the institution of the archigallus came the phrygianum sanctuary and the rite of the taurobolium , two aspects of the cybele cult which the archigallus had responsibility , as well as presiding over the galli priests .
