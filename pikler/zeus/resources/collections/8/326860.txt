Leptin     leptin is a hormone made by cells in fat tissue that reduces hunger . that helps the energy balance in the body . leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin , the `` hunger hormone '' . both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus . they adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis . in obesity , a decreased sensitivity to leptin occurs . this leads to a feeling of hunger , despite high energy stores . although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin , it also plays a role in other physiological processes . these additional functions are still being studied . leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by jeffrey m. friedman and colleagues at rockefeller university . its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society . the importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory . scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and did n't need to eat as much . leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep .
