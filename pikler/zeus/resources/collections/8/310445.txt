Desktop publishing     desktop publishing ( also known as dtp ) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal computer . the term has been used for publishing at all levels , from small-circulation documents such as local newsletters to books , magazines and newspapers . however the term implies a more professional-looking end result , with a more complex layout , than word processing , and so when introduced in the 1980s was often used in connection with homes and small organisations who could not previously produce publication-quality documents themselves . desktop publishing began in 1985 with the introduction of macpublisher , the first wysiwyg layout program , which ran on the original 128k macintosh computer . the dtp market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in january of the apple laserwriter printer , and later in july with the introduction of pagemaker software from aldus which rapidly became the dtp industry standard software . before the advent of desktop publishing , the only option available to most persons for producing typed ( as opposed to handwritten ) documents was a typewriter , which offered only a handful of typefaces ( usually fixed-width ) and one or two font sizes . indeed , one popular desktop publishing book was actually titled `` the mac is not a typewriter '' . the ability to create wysiwyg page layouts on screen and then print pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 dpi resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry . newspapers and other print publications made the move to dtp-based programs from older layout systems in the 1980s .
