One-party dominant state     the one-party dominant state is a system of majority rule where one political party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party , which does not have to form coalitions ( alliances ) with other smaller political parties as a result . the one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state , because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed , but have no real chance of gaining power . many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control , but some one-party dominant states are real democracies , where there are no limits by law against other parties . a case of this was mexico , where presidential candidates ( person running for this governmental office ) of the institutional revolutionary party were popularly elected for more than 70 years .
