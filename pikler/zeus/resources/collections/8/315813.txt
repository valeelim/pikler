Samuel Morse     samuel finley breese morse ( april 27 , 1791 â€“ april 2 , 1872 ) was an american inventor . he was the first person to create a telegraph with only one wire , and also helped come up with the brilliant idea of morse code . since the 1700s , there were different types of telegraphs being made , but they were hard to use because they had several wires . ( the first telegraph ever built had 26 wires , which made it almost impossible to use . ) morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire , and managed to do it in 1836. morse and his assistant made a code with `` dots and `` dashes '' , which were two different types of `` clicks '' on the telegraph . morse 's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away , and many telegraph lines were built . a telegraph line using his invention was built between washington , d.c. and baltimore in 1844. by the 1860s , there were telegraph lines all around north america , and in 1866 , a telegraph line was built across the atlantic ocean . samuel f. b. morse was born in charlestown , massachusetts
