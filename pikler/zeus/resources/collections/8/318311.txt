Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry     inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp-ms ) is a type of mass spectrometry that is highly sensitive . it can see a range of metals and several non-metals at concentrations below one part in 10 ( part per trillion ) . it is based on hooking together an inductively coupled plasma as a method of producing ions ( ionization ) with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions . many chemists use argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma . the machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones . the cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer . in trace elemental analysis , the method has advantages of high speed , precision and sensitivity compared to atomic absorption techniques . analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used . some analytes can not work with icp-ms. verification of analysis results requires additional work .
