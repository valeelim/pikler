Reactivity (chemistry)    reactivity ( chemistry ) reactivity is a measure of how much a substance tends to react with other things . some substances are more reactive , and others are less reactive . reactivity is set by several factors : - the range of circumstances ( conditions that include temperature , pressure , or presence of catalysts ) in which the substance reacts , - the range of substances that will react with it , - the equilibrium point of the reaction ( that is , the extent to which all of it reacts ) , or - the speed of the reaction . reactivity involves both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the particular chemical reaction . a reaction will be more reactive if the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactants . a reaction will be more reactive if the energy of its transition is low . lithium reacts with water and air . gold does not react with water or air . gold is unreactive , thus low on the reactivity series . lithium is reactive . there are several ways to measure reactivity . some are reducing agents , and others can be oxidizing agents . some absorb water easily . some break down easily .
