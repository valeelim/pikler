Wallace Line     the wallace line ( or 'wallace 's line ' ) is a boundary that separates the ecozone of asia and the australasian ecozone . the transitional zone is sometimes called `` wallacea '' . plants and animals related to asian species are found to the north-west . australasian species are found mainly to the south-east , with some asian species . the line is named after alfred russel wallace , who noticed this clear dividing line during his travels through the east indies in the 19th century . the line runs through indonesia , between borneo and sulawesi ( celebes ) ; and through the lombok strait between bali ( in the west ) and lombok ( in the east ) . the distance between bali and lombok is only about 35 kilometers . surprisingly , the distributions of many bird species observe the line , because many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water . some bats have distributions that cross the wallace line , but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other ; an exception is the crab-eating macaque . other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns , but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent .
