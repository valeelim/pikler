Fermi paradox     enrico fermi 's paradox wonders why , given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years , we have not detected any other alien civilizations . there have been attempts to resolve the fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations , along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing . the physicist enrico fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. a paper by michael h. hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail . this is why some people call it the fermiâ€“hart paradox . other common names for the same phenomenon are `` fermi 's question '' ( `` where are they ? `` ) , the `` fermi problem '' , the `` great silence '' , and `` silentium universi '' ( latin for `` the silence of the universe '' ; the misspelling `` silencium universi '' is also common ) . related pages . - carl sagan - drake equation
