Normativity     normativity is a concept . being normative is not about how 'normal ' you are , not even in terms of 'normal ' as defined by mainstream society . that is because it is not about a description of a person . being normative is about presenting mainstream/dominant ideas about what is normal , acceptable and desirable as being true for everyone , not just for the dominant group in question .
