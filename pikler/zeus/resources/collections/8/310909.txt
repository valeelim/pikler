Cockle     cockles are a group of ( mostly ) small , edible , saltwater clams . they are marine bivalve molluscs in the family cardiidae . they are very common on sandy sheltered beaches throughout the world . the distinctive rounded shells of cockles are symmetrical , and are heart-shaped when viewed from the end . in most genera there are numerous radial ribs ( ridges on the shell ) . the genus `` laevicardium '' , the egg cockles , have very smooth shells . the mantle has three openings ( inhalant , exhalant , and pedal ) for siphoning water and for the foot to stick out . cockles are capable of 'jumping ' by bending and straightening the foot . cockles burrow using the foot , and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water . some species reach maturity quickly . confusingly , the common name `` cockle '' is also given ( by seafood sellers ) to a number of other small edible bivalves which have a somewhat similar shape , however these bivalves are in other families such as the veneridae ( venus clams ) and the arcidae ( ark clams ) . cockles in the family cardiidae are sometimes known as `` true cockles '' in order to distinguish them from these other species .
