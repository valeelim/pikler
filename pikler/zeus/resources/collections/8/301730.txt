Kusunoki Masashige     kusunoki was a brilliant tactician and strategist . he defended two key loyalist fortresses at akasaka and chihaya . this helped go-daigo to briefly return to power . however , one of the loyalist generals , ashikaga takauji , betrayed go-daigo . ashikaga led an army against kusunoki and the remaining loyalists . kusunoki suggested to the emperor that they hide on sacred mount hiei and allow takauji to take kyoto . later , they could move quickly down from the mountain to trap ashikaga and destroy him . go-daigo would not leave the capital . he insisted that kusunoki meet ashikaga 's larger army forces in the field in a direct battle . kusunoki obediently accepted his emperor 's foolish command . this became a great example of loyalty . he left his death poem with his young son masatsura and knowingly marched his army into almost certain death . the battle took place at minatogawa in modern-day chūō-ku , kobe . it was a tactical disaster . kusunoki had only 73 of the original 700 horsemen left and was surrounded . he committed suicide along with his brother masasue , 11 close clan members , and 60 others . according to legend , his brother 's last words were `` shichisei hōkoku ! '' ( 七生報國 ; `` would that i had seven lives to give for my country ! '' ) and kusunoki masashige agreed .
