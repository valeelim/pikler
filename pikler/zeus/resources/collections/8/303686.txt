Zone of Avoidance     the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) is the area of the night sky that is obscured by our own galaxy , the milky way . dust and stars in the plane of the milky way ( the galactic plane ) block our view of about 20 % of the sky at visible wavelengths . as a result , optical galaxy catalogues are usually very incomplete close to the galactic plane . in more recent years , many projects have attempted to bridge the gap in our knowledge caused by the zone of avoidance . however , the effects of the zone drops at longer wavelengths , such as the infrared , and the milky way is effectively transparent at radio wavelengths . surveys in the infrared have given us a more complete picture of the extragalactic sky . indeed , two very large nearby galaxies , maffei 1 and maffei 2 , were discovered in the zone of avoidance by paolo maffei by their infrared emission in 1968. even so , about 10 % of the sky remains difficult to survey because extragalactic objects ( for example , distant galaxies ) can be confused with stars in the milky way .
