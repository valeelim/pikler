Ragtime     ragtime ( or rag-time ) is a musical genre which enjoyed its peak popularity between 1897 and 1918. its main characteristic trait is its syncopated , or 'ragged ' , rhythm . it began as dance music in the red-light districts of american cities such as st. louis and new orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano . ragtime was a modification of the march made popular by john philip sousa , with additional polyrhythms typical of african music . the ragtime composer scott joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the `` maple leaf rag '' and a string of ragtime hits that followed . for at least 12 years after its publication , the `` maple leaf rag '' heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines , harmonic progressions or metric patterns . ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public 's imagination after 1917 , but there have been numerous revivals since . first , in the early 1940s many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records . a more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records , and new rags were composed , published , and recorded .
