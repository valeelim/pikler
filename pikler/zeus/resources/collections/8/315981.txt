Semi-trailer truck     a semi-trailer truck , also known as a semi , tractor-trailer , big rig , eighteen-wheeler , or ( in the united kingdom and ireland ) articulated truck or articulated lorry , is a vehicle that has a towing tractor and a semi-trailer that carries the freight . they use diesel fuel . a semi-tractor has no body and does not carry any cargo on it . the front of a semi-trailer is put on it . only the rear of the trailers have wheels , so the tractor pulls the trailer and carries the front part of the trailer 's weight . the tractor and driver cost as much as a truck , but the trailers do n't cost very much . you can have more trailers than tractors and the tractors can change trailers easily . you can park a trailer to be loaded or unloaded and take a different trailer away . the truck and driver do not have to wait to be loaded or unloaded , they can work most of the time . they can also pull different kinds of trailers , any type that is needed at the time . a problem with semi 's is that they often do not turn as sharp as a truck and full trailer that will carry the same load . this can be very important in the united kingdom and europe , but not in larger countries with wider roads .
