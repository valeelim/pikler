Ostreidae     ostreidae are the true oysters . the family includes most species eaten under the name `` oyster '' . pearl oysters are not true oysters because they belong to a different order , the pterioida . like scallops , true oysters have a central adductor muscle . this causes a scar in the middle of the shell . it is the point of attachment . the shell is often irregular because oysters attach to substrates .
