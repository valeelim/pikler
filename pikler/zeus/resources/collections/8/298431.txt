Christmas Raid     the christmas raid or `` magazine fort raid '' happened on the 23 december 1939. the irish republican army ( ira ) stole a lot of weapons and ammunitions ( `` bullets '' ) from the irish army . although the theft from the magazine fort building in phoenix park was successful , most of what was stolen was recovered by the irish army a few days later . several ira volunteers were arrested . the reason for the raid was that the ira had many thompson submachine guns . they found it hard to get the .45 acp bullets used in these guns in europe . because the irish army also used the thompson and had large supplies of bullets , the ira decided to steal some . around 2030 the gate bell rang , and the military police officer on guard opened the gate a little for a civilian who said he had a parcel to deliver to the officer-in-charge . the unidentified man told the mp to open the gate fully and put his hands up . at this point the ira team appeared from both inside and outside the fort , confiscating the weapons of the sentry and mp .
