Wounded Knee Massacre     the wounded knee massacre was a brief fight between the native american lakota people and the us army . it took place at wounded knee creek in south dakota on december 29 , 1890. about 300 lakota and 25 soldiers were killed . the lakota were part of the sioux nation . the army had been sent into the area to take the guns owned by the lakota . during the 1890 's , a native american shaman , named wovoka , began teaching people about his visions for the future . he said the living would join with the dead , and the prairies would be covered in new soil . this would bury the european settlers , and life would return to the way it had been with lots of bison and other animals to hunt . to make this happen , he told people they would have to perform the ghost dance . the dancers wore brightly colored shirts with pictures of bison and eagles . they believed the shirts had magic powers which would protect them from bullets . the ghost dance caused a lot of excitement in the sioux camps . european settlers were worried by these beliefs and the sight of wild and crazy people dancing in the snow . they demanded protection from the army .
