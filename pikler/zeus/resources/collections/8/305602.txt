Transitional fossil     transitional fossils ( or missing links ) are the fossilised remains of lifeforms that show features typical of two distinct groups . it may be a rare fossil , such as `` archaeopteryx '' , which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread . the rarity of transitional forms is interesting . it suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time , and their populations are relatively small . it follows that their fossils would be scarce . in the solnhofen limestone where `` archaeopteryx '' was found , there are more examples of pterosaurs of several genera than there are of the proto-bird . in the jurassic , the pterosaurs were dominant in the air . but in the lower cretaceous the situation is reversed . the pterosaurs are in decline , and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous chinese lagerstatten deposits such as the jehol biota . the lower cretaceous birds are clearly more bird-like , and the features they developed evidently evidently enabled them to invade habitat niches which had been the preserve of pterosaurs , or maybe were not previously exploited at all .
