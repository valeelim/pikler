Molecular orbital     in chemistry , a molecular orbital ( or mo ) explains what happens to electrons when atoms join together in a molecule . a mo is a mathematical function which describes the wave-like behaviour of an electron in a molecule . chemists use such functions to predict or explain chemical and physical properties . for example , the functions can tell the probability of finding an electron in any specific region . chemists usually build mathematical models of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals . hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule , or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used . computers can work on these functions . molecular orbitals allow chemists to apply quantum mechanics to study molecules . mos answer questions about how the atoms in molecules stick together . the various rounded shapes in an orbital diagram indicate where electrons would most likely be found in an atom . the word `` orbital '' was first used in english by robert s. mulliken . the german physicist erwin schrödinger wrote about mos earlier . schrödinger called them `` eigenfunktion '' .
