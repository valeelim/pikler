Australian Aboriginal mythology     australian aboriginal myths , also known as dreamtime stories and songlines , are the stories traditionally performed and told by the indigenous people of australia . each of the language groups across australia has its own stories . all the myths explain important features and meanings within each aboriginal group 's local landscape . they give cultural meaning to the australian physical landscape . people who know these stories have access to the wisdom and knowledge of australian aboriginal ancestors back beyond the reach of memory . david horton wrote in the `` encyclopaedia of aboriginal australia '' that : `` a mythic map of australia would show thousands of characters , varying in their importance , but all in some way connected with the land . some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity . others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else . '' `` many were shape changing , transformed from or into human beings or natural species , or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories .
