Aerostatics     aerostatics is the study of gases that are not in motion . the study of gases in motion is called aerodynamics . it is a part of fluid statics . an aerostat is a lighter than air craft , such as an airship or balloon , which uses the principles of aerostatics to float . fields of study . - atmospheric pressure fluctuation - composition of mountain air - cross-section of the atmosphere - gas density - gas diffusion in soil - gas pressure - kinetic theory of gases - partial pressures in gas mixtures - pressure measurement
