China at the Olympics     the people 's republic of china ( prc ) was first at the 1952 summer olympics . that year , the international olympic committee ( ioc ) let both the prc and the republic of china ( which recently moved to taiwan after the chinese civil war ) compete . the republic of china withdrew in protest . because of the political status of china , the prc was not in the olympics again until 1980. the chinese olympic committee was formed in 1910 and recognized in 1979. before the chinese civil war , athletes competed as the republic of china ( roc ) at the olympics . in 1979 , the international olympic committee passed a resolution for the roc team to be called `` chinese taipei '' , and this opened the door for the prc to finally join the olympic movement . hong kong has had a distinct national olympic committee since 1950 and has been at the games since 1952. after the territory returned to the prc this has continued , with hong kong separate from the rest of the nation under the name `` hong kong , china '' .
