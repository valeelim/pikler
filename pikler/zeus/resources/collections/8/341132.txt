Drosophila simulans     drosophila simulans is a species of fruit fly closely related to `` d. melanogaster '' it was discovered by the fly geneticist alfred sturtevant in 1919 , when he noticed that the flies used in thomas hunt morgan 's laboratory at the columbia university were actually two distinct species : `` d. melanogaster '' and `` d. simulans '' . males differ in the external genitalia , while trained observers can separate females using colour characteristics . `` d. melanogaster '' females crossed to `` d. simulans '' males produce sterile f1 females and no f1 males . the reciprocal cross produces sterile f1 males and no female progeny . `` d. simulans '' was found later to be closely related to two island endemics , `` drosophila sechellia '' and `` drosophila mauritiana '' . `` d. simulans '' will mate with these sister species to form fertile females and sterile males , a fact that has made `` d. simulans '' an important model organism for research into speciation . references . - sturtevant a.h. 1919. a new species closely resembling `` drosophila melanogaster '' . `` psyche '' 26 : 153â€“155 .
