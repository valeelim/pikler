Cy Twombly     edwin parker `` cy '' twombly , jr. ( april 25 , 1928 – july 5 , 2011 ) was an american artist . he used the nickname `` cy '' , after his father and the star baseball pitcher cy young . twombly was known for his large-scale , freely scribbled , calligraphic-style graffiti paintings , on solid fields of mostly gray , tan , or off-white colors . he exhibited his paintings worldwide . twombly 's paintings blur the line between drawing and painting . many of his best-known paintings of the late 1960s are reminiscent of a school blackboard on which someone has practiced cursive `` e '' s. twombly had at this point discarded painting figurative , representational subject-matter , citing the line or smudge – each mark with its own history – as its proper subject . later , many of his paintings and works on paper moved into `` romantic symbolism '' , and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words . twombly often quoted the poet stéphane mallarmé , as well as many classical myths and allegories in his works . examples of this are his `` apollo and the artist '' and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word `` virgil '' . in a 1994 retrospective , curator kirk varnedoe described twombly 's work as “ influential among artists , discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public , but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well '' . after acquiring twombly 's `` three studies from the temeraire '' ( 1998–99 ) , the director of the art gallery of new south wales said `` sometimes people need a little bit of help in recognising a great work of art that might be a bit unfamiliar '' . he is said to have influenced younger artists such as anselm kiefer , francesco clemente , and julian schnabel .
