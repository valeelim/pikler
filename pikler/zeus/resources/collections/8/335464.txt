Neurolinguistic programming     neurolinguistic programming is a way of communicating , created in the 1970s . it is often shortened to `` nlp '' . the discipline assumes there is a link between neurological processes , language and behavior . according to nlp , it is possible to achieve certain goals in life by changing one 's behaviour . certain neuroscientists psychologists and linguists , believe that nlp is unsupported by current scientific evidence and that it uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts . nlp was invented by richard bandler and john grinder . according to these people , nlp can help solve problems such as phobias , depression , habit disorder , psychosomatic illnesses , and learning disorders . reviews of empirical research on nlp show that nlp contains many factual errors . it did not produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by nlp ’ developers and proponents . according to devilly , nlp is no longer as common as it was in the 1970s and 1980s . criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness ; critics say that nlp has pseudoscientific characteristics , title , concepts and terminology . one example where nlp is used as pseudoscience is to make the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level easier . nlp also appears on peer reviewed expert-consensus based lists of discredited interventions . in research designed to identify the “ quack factor ” in modern mental health practice , norcross `` et al . '' ( 2006 ) list nlp as possibly or probably discredited , and in papers reviewing discredited interventions for substance and alcohol abuse , norcross `` et al . '' ( 2010 ) list nlp in the top ten most discredited , and glasner-edwards and rawson ( 2010 ) list nlp as “ certainly discredited ” .
