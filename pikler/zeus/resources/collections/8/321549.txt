Software testing     software testing takes place during software engineering . it is done before the release to the final audience . software testing is meant to see how the software works under different conditions . these conditions might be different depending on what the audience is . testing is done to understand if it will work correctly , partially fail to work properly , or totally fail to work properly . each test may be used to see how one , or many , parts of the software work at a point in its development . proper performance may be based on specific ( written ) requirements or standards ( which might , for example , be usability ) . bad performance , or poor quality , might cause an unhappy audience . this could cause more work needing to be done on the software and higher costs . a review of the results of tests may show that some parts of the software system may need to be done again , or may work well . some bad performances or software bugs may need to be fixed . after more work on the software , testing may be done again .
