Chinese folk religion     chinese folk religion is a religion that has been practiced in china , and in areas inhabited by chinese people . it is difficult to make a clear distinction between chinese folk religion and other beliefs , because chinese folk religion has elements of veneration of the dead , local spirits , clan spirits and traditional eastern religions , such as taoism , confucianism , but also superstition , geomancy and feng shui . there is no standarized mythology or clergy : rites are often performed by the father of a family . since the 1950s , the term shenism is sometimes used to refer to chinese folk religion . ( pinyin : `` shénjiào '' , 神教 ) , in this context , shen refers to a spirit or a deity . the term shenism was first used by a. j. a elliot in 1955. the term chinese folk religion is not used inside china . sometimes it is classified with taoism : over the centuries , taoism became institutionalised . during that time it tried to use local customs , and to become similar to local religions and beliefs . it would however be more accurate to say that taoism developed from shenism , since shenism was there before . taoism also developed from chinese philosophy . with around 454 million adherents , or about 6.6 % of the world population , chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world . in china more than 30 % of the population adheres to shenism or taoism .
