Exothermic reactions     an exothermic reaction is a reaction where the substances react chemically to release energy in the form of heat . an example of this is combustion ( burning ) . exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings . the energy is usually transferred as heat energy , causing the reaction mixture and its surroundings to become hotter . the temperature increase can be detected using a thermometer . some examples of exothermic reactions are : - burning - neutralisation reactions between acids and alkalis - the reaction between water and calcium oxide the chemical reaction that does the complete opposite , and absorbs heat , is an endothermic reaction .
