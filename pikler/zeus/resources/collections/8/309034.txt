Rock pool     rock pools ( or 'tide pools ' ) are rocky pools by the sea . they are in the intertidal zone . they are filled with seawater during high tide , and exist as separate pools at low tide . tide pools are habitats of uniquely adaptable animals that have engaged the special attention of naturalists and marine biologists . tide pools are a home for hardy organisms such as sea stars , mussels and clams . they must be able to cope with a constantly changing environment â€” fluctuations in water temperature , salinity , and oxygen content . huge waves , strong currents , exposure to midday sun and predators are only a few of the hazards that rock pool animals must endure to survive . waves can dislodge mussels and draw them out to sea . gulls pick up and drop sea urchins to break them open . starfish prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves . even black bears sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide . although tide pool organisms must avoid getting washed away into the ocean , drying up in the sun , or getting eaten , they depend on the tide pool 's constant changes for food .
