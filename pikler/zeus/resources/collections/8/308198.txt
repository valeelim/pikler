Simplified molecular input line entry specification     the simplified molecular input line entry specification or smiles is a line notation for the chemical structure of molecules . it uses a short series ascii characters to represent structures . most molecule editor computer programs can draw a two-dimensional diagram or a three-dimensional model of a molecule based on its smiles code . arthur weininger and david weininger wrote the original smiles specification in the late 1980s . it has since been modified and extended by others , including by daylight chemical information systems inc. in 2007 , the blue obelisk open-source chemistry community developed an open standard called `` opensmiles '' . in july 2006 , the iupac introduced the inchi as a standard line notation for representing chemical structures . people think that it is easier for humans to understand smiles than inchi . some chemists argue that smiles is better than inchi because many different software programs support it . smiles also has theoretical ( for example , graph theory ) backing .
