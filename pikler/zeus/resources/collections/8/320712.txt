Bone fracture     bone fractures happen when a bone is damaged by stress . the bone can be fractured in many different ways . most human bones are strong and do not break when hit by strong impacts or forces . however , if that force is too powerful , or there is something wrong with the bone , it can fracture . there are many different types of bone fractures . fractures are often separated into categories . in an `` open '' fracture ( also called a `` compound '' fracture ) , the broken bone breaks through the skin . this can cause infection , since the skin usually protects the body from germs . if the skin is broken , germs can get into the body . open fractures can also damage muscles , tendons and ligaments if the sharp ends of the broken bone go through them . in a `` closed '' fracture , the broken bone does not break through the skin . in a `` simple '' fracture , the broken bone is the only thing that is damaged . in a `` complex '' fracture , the sharp ends of the broken bone damage the soft tissue around the bone . in a `` complete '' fracture , the bone is broken all the way through . the broken bone is in two separate pieces .
