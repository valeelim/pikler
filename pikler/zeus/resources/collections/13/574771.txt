Canadian Pacific Railway     the canadian pacific railway ( cpr ) , also known as cp rail ( cp ) is a railway in north america with track in both canada and the united states . it was built between eastern canada and british columbia between 1881 and 1885. although it used to go all the way to atlantic canada , it does not do so anymore . when british columbia became part of canada in 1871 , one of the promises the federal government made was to link it to the rest of canada by rail . most of the trains that use the cpr carry freight , and the cpr used to run passenger train services until they were taken over by via rail in 1978. for many years , until the airplane was invented , the railway was the only way to move people across the country . because of this , it had a big role in the settlement and development of western canada . the company that owns the cpr , canadian pacific railway limited , was once one of the largest and most powerful companies in canada . it owns about of track from montreal in the east to vancouver in the west and edmonton to the north . cp also has track in minneapolis-saint paul , milwaukee , detroit , chicago , and new york city in the united states .
