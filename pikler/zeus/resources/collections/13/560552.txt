Human skeleton     the human skeleton is the internal framework of the body . it is made up of about 300 bones at birth . as some bones join together , there are 206 bones in adulthood . the bones are at their strongest around age 20. the human skeleton can be divided into the `` axial skeleton '' and the `` appendicular skeleton '' . the axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column , the rib cage , the skull and other associated bones . the appendicular skeleton , which is attached to the axial skeleton , is formed by the shoulder girdle , the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs . the human skeleton performs six major functions . these are : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals , and endocrine regulation . the male and female skeletons are not so different as those of many other primates . there are subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , teeth , long bones , and pelvis . in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements .
