Hayflick limit     the hayflick limit ( or hayflick phenomenon ) is a phenomenon of cell division in tissue culture . it is the number of times a normal human cell population divides until cell division stops . we now know that the telomeres associated with each cell 's chromosomes will get slightly shorter with each new cell division until they shorten to a critical length . the idea of the hayflick limit was suggested by american anatomist leonard hayflick in 1961 , at the wistar institute in philadelphia , pennsylvania . hayflick showed that a population of normal human fetal cells in a cell culture will divide between 40 to 60 times . the population then goes into senescence . this refutes the idea of nobel laureate alexis carrel that normal cells are immortal . each mitosis slightly shortens each of the telomeres on the dna of the cells . telomere shortening in humans eventually makes cell division impossible , and this aging of the cell population appears to correlate with the overall physical aging of the human body .
