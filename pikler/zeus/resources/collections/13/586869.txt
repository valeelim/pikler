Micro black hole     micro black holes are very small black holes . because they are small , they may shrink and disappear due to hawking radiation . they may exist in nature as primordial black holes . if a micro black hole decays , it would create particles that we could see . the fermi gamma-ray space telescope is looking for gamma rays that might come from micro black holes in outer space . if two particles with enough energy collide , they may create a black hole . some scientists think the lhc can create one . if the lhc did create a micro black hole , it would disappear immediately , and would not be dangerous . cosmic rays hitting the earth 's atmosphere may already create these . if dangerous micro black holes are created by cosmic rays , then the earth would already be damaged . because the earth is not damaged by black holes , scientists think they are not dangerous . this thought is like the anthropic principle .
