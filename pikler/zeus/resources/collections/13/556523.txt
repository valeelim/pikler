Quantum tunnelling     quantum tunnelling is a part of the theoretical branch of physics known as quantum mechanics . it states that electrons can behave like both particles and waves , and can cancel the effects of an energy barrier if the energy barrier is thin enough , due to quantum mechanics being dependent on probability . in other words , particles can travel through walls , doors , etc . if the door or wall is thin enough . the particle—usually a subatomic or quark particle such as an electron or photon—can become a wave to focus a great deal of energy on the barrier , ultimately negating it . there is also a non-zero chance that it could be found `` inside '' the barrier . however , this only noticeably works for subatomic particles , as the chance for macroscopic objects to do this is very , very low , small enough to not be thought about much .
