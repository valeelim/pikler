Molecular machine     a molecular machine , or nanomachine , is any set of molecules which produce mechanical movements ( output ) in response to specific stimuli ( input ) . the term is common in nanotechnology where a number of complex molecular machines have been proposed which might be a way of making a `` molecular assembler '' . molecular machines can be divided into two broad categories : synthetic and biological . the 2016 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to jean-pierre sauvage , fraser stoddart and ben feringa for the design and synthesis of molecular machines . the most complex molecular machines are made of proteins , and found in cells . these include 'motor proteins ' . examples are : myosin , ( which does muscle contraction ) , kinesin ( which moves molecules from the nucleus along microtubules ) , and dynein ( which produces the beating of motile cilia and flagella ) . these proteins are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been made by mankind . probably the most significant biological machine known is the ribosome . other important examples include motile cilia : `` in effect , the [ motile cilium ] is a nanomachine [ of ] over 600 proteins in molecular complexes , many of which also function independently as nanomachines '' .
