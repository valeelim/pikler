Limited war     a limited war is a war carried out by a state that uses less than its total resources and has a goal of less than total defeat of the enemy . very often it is the high cost of war that makes limited war more practical than total war . in a limited war a state 's total survival does not depend on the outcome of the war . for example , when augustus sent his roman legions to conquer germania , the fate of the roman republic was not at stake . since 1945 and the advent of nuclear weapons , limited war has become the normal type of warfare . following world war ii , because of its world position , the united states has found itself involved in a number of limited wars . the korean , vietnam , persian gulf and iraq wars were all examples of limited wars . the goal of at least one of the parties in a limited war is to maintain its freedom and preserve itself . often the strategy used , especially against a much stronger enemy , is to draw out the fighting until the other side gets tired and finally decides to quit . this worked for george washington in the american revolutionary war . although the british army was the strongest army in the world at the time , the war dragged out until the british got tired of the war draining its resources . today the taliban and other islamist groups keep their wars going trying to wear out their western world enemies .
