American Civil War Corps Badges     corps badges in the american civil war were originally worn by soldiers of the union army on the top of their army forage cap , left side of the hat , or over their left chest pocket . the idea was suggested by major geneneral philip kearny . during a battle he reprimanded officers that turned out to not be under his command . to prevent that from happening again , he ordered the men in his division to sew a square of red cloth on their hats . this idea was adopted by major general joseph hooker after he assumed command of the army of the potomac . this was so any soldier could be identified at a distance . maj. gen. daniel butterfield , hooker 's chief of staff , was assigned the task of designing a distinctive shape for each corps badge . butterfield also decided that each division in the corps should have a variation of the corps badge in a different color . division badges were colored as follows : 1. red — first division of corps 1. white — second division of corps
