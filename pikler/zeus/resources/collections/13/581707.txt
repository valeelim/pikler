Ramjet     a ramjet is a type of engine which uses the properties of air to create thrust . ramjets are most often attached to aircraft , and require that the aircraft is moving above the speed of sound , also called mach 1. they are different from `` normal '' aircraft engines because they do not have any moving parts which compress the air . instead , they use shock waves to compress the air . ramjets are made up of 4 main sections , the first of which is called the inlet . the purpose of the inlet is to capture air and compress it . compression is required in order to burn the fuel correctly . the compression comes from a process called a shock wave . shock waves only occur when the aircraft is moving at or above mach 1. for this reason , ramjets are more efficient if moving around mach 2 or 3. the second part of the ramjet is called the diffuser . air that comes through the inlet is moving very fast , which makes it very hard to burn fuel . the job of the diffuser is to slow the flow down in an efficient way . by the time the air has passed all the way through the inlet , it is traveling slower than mach 1. this is important for the diffuser to work properly . the diffuser is essentially just a pipe that increases in area as you move along it . because the flow moving slower than mach 1 , the increasing area causes the air to slow down .
