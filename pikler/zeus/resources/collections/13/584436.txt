HeLa     the hela cell line is the oldest human cell line used in molecular biology research . every cell in a cell line has the same genes . since their discovery , scientists have been using hela cells to study cancer , radiation poisoning , and infectious disease . like most cancer cells , hela cells have more dna than normal cells . hela cells can also divide forever without the help of scientists . in contrast , normal , non-cancerous cells can only divide a for a little while before their telomeres shorten too much and the cell can not divide any longer . hela cells have a special type of active telomerase that extends telomeres during regular division . in 1951 , these cells were found in a cervical tumor of 30 year old henrietta lacks . a sample of the tumor was taken during lacks ' stay at johns hopkins hospital by a doctor named george gey . he did this without telling her . lacks died later that year , but her neither her nor her family were ever told about the cells until many years later . one of the most famous uses for hela cells came when jonas salk used these cells to test his vaccine , which now protects a lot of people against polio . some of the more recent uses for hela cells are a human papillomavirus vaccine made by harold zur hausen . this vaccine won him a nobel prize in 2008. another use for hela cells is telomerase research , which won elizabeth blackburn a 2009 nobel prize . hela cells have also been used for the development of new chemotherapy techniques and to test how and where nuclear radiation mutates cells .
