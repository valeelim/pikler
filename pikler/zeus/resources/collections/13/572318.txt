Aoi festival     the aoi festival or aoi matsuri ( 葵祭 ) is one of kyoto 's three most famous festivals ( along with the gion festival and jidai matsuri ) and takes place every may 15. the festival 's main attraction is a large parade in kyoto , in which over 500 people dressed in the aristocratic style of the heian period ( 794-1185 ) walk from the imperial palace to the kamo shrines . aoi is japanese for hollyhock , and the festival is named after the hollyhock leaves that are worn by the members of the procession . predating kyoto 's establishment as the national capital in 794 , the aoi matsuri began in the 7th century , although its precise origins are uncertain . there were most likely natural disasters occurring that were believed to be caused by the deities of the kamo shrines . after the emperor made offerings to the gods , the disasters subsided and a tradition was begun . the festival 's official name remains kamo matsuri , because of its association with the shrines . the festival grew in prominence so that during the heian period the word festival became synonymous with the aoi matsuri . nowadays , the massive procession illustrates the high regard in which the festival would have been held . there are men on horseback , giant bouquets of flowers , ornately decorated ox drawn carts , and a large retinue of women in kimono accompanying the year 's saio .
