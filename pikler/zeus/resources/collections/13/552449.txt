Homologous series     in chemistry , a homologous series is a series of chemical compounds with the same general formula . usually these compounds vary by a single parameter such as the length of a carbon chain . examples of such series are the straight-chained alkanes ( paraffins ) , and some of their derivatives ( such as the primary alcohols , aldehydes , and ( mono ) carboxylic acids ) . compounds within a homologous series typically have a fixed set of functional groups that gives them similar chemical and physical properties . for example , the series of primary straight-chained alcohols has an hydroxyl at the end of the carbon chain . these properties typically change gradually along the series , and the changes can often be explained by small differences in molecular size and mass .
