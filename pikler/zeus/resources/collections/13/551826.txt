Appeal to tradition     appeal to tradition ( also known as `` argumentum ad antiquitatem '' , appeal to antiquity , or appeal to common practice ) is a common fallacy . in this fallacy , an idea is claimed to be right because it is the way it was done in the past . the appeal takes the form of `` this is right because we 've always done it this way '' . an appeal to tradition essentially makes two mistakes : - the tradition might be entirely based on incorrect grounds . - the circumstances may have changed ; so past justifications for the tradition may be invalid . the opposite of an appeal to tradition is an appeal to novelty , claiming something is good because it is `` new '' .
