Subsidiary     a subsidiary is a company that is controlled by its parent company . even though a subsidiary works on its own , and its purposes are `` different '' from that of its parent company , the parent company is in control of its subsidiary . a company 's subsidiary is different from a company 's division because a division works `` together '' with its parent company . a division 's goal is usually similar to that of its parent company , and the division has to use its parent company 's name . a subsidiary can use a name different from that of its parent company . for example , youtube is a `` subsidiary '' of google , because google is a search engine , while youtube is a video sharing website . google videos is a `` division '' of google , because google videos is a search engine that searches videos on the internet . this is to match its parent company google as a search engine . also , youtube has an entirely different name and logo from google 's , while google videos , as a division , must use google 's name and logo .
