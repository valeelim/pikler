Electric iron     a clothes iron is a small hand-held appliance with a handle holding a flat , roughly triangular surface that , when heated , is used to press clothes to remove creases . it is named for the metal of which the device was historically commonly made , and the use of it is generally called ironing . ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in polymer fiber materials . with the heat and the weight of the ironing plate , the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool . some materials , such as cotton , require the use of water to loosen the inter-molecular bonds . many materials developed in the twentieth century are advertised as needing little or no ironing . before the introduction of electricity irons were heated by combustion , either in a fire or with some internal arrangement . an `` electric flatiron '' was invented by us inventor henry w. seeley and patented on june 6 , 1882. it weighed almost 15 pounds and took a long time to heat . the uk electricity association is reported to have said that an electric iron with a carbon arc appeared in france in 1880 , but this is considered doubtful .
