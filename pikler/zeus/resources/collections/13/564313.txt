Extermination through labor     extermination through labour is a way of torturing and killing prisoners . in a system of extermination by labour , prisoners are forced to do very heavy work without enough food or medical care . eventually , prisoners die from malnutrition , illness , or injury . nazi germany and the soviet union both had systems of extermination through labor . some people describe north korea 's prison system as a system of extermination through labor . the term `` extermination through labor '' was first used during world war ii . most of the nazi ss did not use the term ( `` vernichtung durch arbeit '' in german ) . however , albert bormann , joseph goebels , otto georg thierack , and heinrich himmler used the term during the fall of 1942 , while talking about moving prisoners to concentration camps . thierack and goebbels specifically used the term . the phrase was used again during the nuremberg trials after world war ii ended . in the 1980s and 1990s , historians have argued over whether this term is appropriate . for example , falk pingel believed the phrase should not be applied to all nazi prisoners . on the other hand , hermann kaienburg and miroslav kárný believed `` extermination through labour '' was one of the ss 's specific goals . more recently , jens-christian wagner has also argued that not all nazi prisoners were targeted with death , so `` extermination through labor '' might not be the best way to describe the nazis ' goals for those prisoners .
