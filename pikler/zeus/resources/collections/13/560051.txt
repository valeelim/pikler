Secession in the United States     secession in the united states refers mainly to state secession . it applies to the outbreak of the american civil war when on december 20 , 1860 , south carolina officially declared their secession from the united states . it was followed four months later by the states of georgia , florida , alabama , mississippi , texas and louisiana . these initial seven seceding states formed the confederate states of america based in montgomery , alabama . then , on april 12 , 1861 , hostilities began at fort sumter in charleston , south carolina . after this , the states of virginia ( except the northwestern counties ) , arkansas , tennessee , and north carolina joined the confederacy . the capital was then moved richmond , virginia . the northern and border states remained with the union . in 1860 , secession was not a new threat . it had been discussed as early as 1776 when the continental congress wanted to tax all of the colonies based on a population count that included slaves . south carolina threatened to separate themselves from the other 12 colonies over the issue . from then until the outbreak of the american civil war , anytime a minority sectional dispute came up ( often over slavery ) the threat of secession would be used . it was a matter of concern when the constitutional convention met in 1787 in philadelphia . secession was closely tied to the thinking of members of the whig party . their thinking was that rebellion ( such as in 1776 ) was a right of a state against any form of despotic government .
