Ventilation     a ventilation system is a structure that controls airflow inside buildings . its main function is to constantly supply fresh air , usually from the outside , while sending stale air back out . fans and pumps , vent grates and air flow tunnels are common in these structures . the simplest systems are called “ natural ventilation , ” which usually means that they get their airflow through vents opening to the outside . mechanical systems are more popular for industry . mechanical systems are able to regulate other things , including temperature , relative humidity , and oxygen levels . fresh air prevents issues like mold and bacteria growth , as well as the spread of disease . it helps eliminate dust , which can lead to cleaner living standards . single rooms can sometimes be ventilated by opening a window or door , but this isn ’ t as successful for larger structures . ventilation usually collaborates with heating and cooling systems , but not always and they aren ’ t only limited to buildings . vehicles frequently have ventilation systems that control air circulation and air quality .
