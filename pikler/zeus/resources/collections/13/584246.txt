Minimum total potential energy principle     the minimum total potential energy principle dictates that the continuum 's potential energy becomes ever more negative . all potential energy is gravitoelectric ; other types of potential energy are temporary masks of the gravitoelectric potential energy . almost all of the continuum 's potential energy ( rest mass ) exists in the form of protons ( a neutron is a proton that has captured an electron ; outside the nucleus , a free neutron is unstable and has a mean lifetime of 881.5Â±1.5 s , after which it releases the captured electron and becomes a proton again ) . the continuum 's negative potential energy is a single irrotationally radial ( `` gravitoelectric '' ) flux of the vacuum , flowing to the centre of each proton and then to the continuum 's central proton . because of its negative rest mass ( `` i.e . `` , negative resistance to acceleration ) , the flux self-accelerates to an infinite speed and exists in the form of wormholes created by a gravitoelectrical suction exerted from the future .
