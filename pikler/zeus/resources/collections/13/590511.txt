Manyogana     man'yōgana is the oldest known sound-based writing system used for the japanese language . when kanji , or chinese characters used to write japanese , first came to japan in around the 4th century ad through the korean peninsula , it was only used to write the chinese language . even though chinese was not native to the japanese people , classical chinese writings were nonetheless studied heavily by upper-class japanese . some time later , although the exact time is unknown , chinese characters , which came be known as kanji in japan , was being used to write the japanese language for the first time in roughly the 6th century ad , although it had a heavy chinese influence . figuring out how to write the chinese character system to correctly fit the japanese language was a rather difficult task , since there were such big differences between chinese and japanese . for example , chinese has an svo ( subject-object-verb ) word order ( i.e . i eat sushi ) , while japanese has an sov word order ( i.e . i sushi eat ) . also , while chinese morphemes , or the smallest meaningful part of a word , are usually monosyllabic , or having just one syllable , japanese words often were polysyllabic , or having two or more syllables . examples of this include 山 , 魚 , 中 , 国 , 人 , 多 , 速 and 見. in mandarin chinese , the most spoken chinese dialect in the world , these morphemes are pronounced `` shān , yú , zhōng , '' `` guó , rén , duō , sù '' and `` kàn '' in that order , all of which are just one syllable . in the native japanese pronunciation , however , these morphemes are pronounced `` yama , sakana , naka , kuni , hito , oo , haya '' and `` mi ( ru ) '' . what makes all this more complicated is that the last three kanji are almost never written by themselves in japanese , if at all , since they are usually used in adjectives , verbs , and adverbs .
