Lagerordnung     the lagerordnung ( the `` disciplinary and penal code '' ) was a set of rules for punishing prisoners at dachau concentration camp in nazi germany . on january 1 , 1934 , the lagerordnung became the official rules of every concentration camp in nazi germany . also known as the `` strafkatalog '' ( punishment catalogue ) , it set out the rules the prisoners had to follow . ss guards were told to report to the camp commandant when a prisoner broke a rule . the concentration camps inspectorate was in charge of carrying out punishment . they did this without making sure the prisoner had actually broken the rule . once they were accused , prisoners had no way of proving themselves innocent . at first , the nazis had built temporary concentration camps , like kemna concentration camp . these earlier camps did not have common , agreed-upon rules . instead , they took the `` lagerordnung '' from rules that were often used in police departments and prisons at the time . there was not much difference between the rules at the early concentration camps . some did not allow smoking ; others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members . the rules were still based on existing laws , and the camps were patterned after ordinary prisons . the early camps had penalties like having privileges taken away , or for more severe cases , solitary confinement , a hard bed , not being given food , or being left in solitary confinement in a darkened cell . however , there was no corporal punishment . the early camps were primarily controlled by the sa or the gestapo .
