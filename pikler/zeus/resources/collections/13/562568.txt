Military glider     military gliders ( a variation of the common glider ) have been used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment into a war zone . they were used mainly during the second world war . these aircraft with no engines were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes . one of the most popular tow aircraft was the c-47 skytrain or dakota . they could also be towed by bombers . military gliders do not soar . once released from the tow craft near the front lines , they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to their target . they tried to landed with as little damage as possible to the cargo and crew as possible . but most landing zones ( lz ) were far from ideal . the one-way nature of the missions meant that military gliders were treated as being disposable . this is why they were made from common and inexpensive materials such as wood . they were unarmored , fragile , aircraft with crude steering and no brakes . this is why a large number of them crashed on landing . troops landing by glider were referred to as airborne infantry . pilots called themselves `` tow targets '' while the soldiers referred to the gliders as `` flying coffins . '' casualties for some missions ran as high as 40 % .
