Coverture     coverture is a long-standing legal practice in the united states that comes from the english common law . coverture holds that a man and a woman are a single legal entityâ€”that of the husband . a married woman loses her own legal obligations and rights , and becomes `` covered '' by her husband . traditionally a woman took her husband 's last name as a symbol of this identity . a female child was covered by her father 's identity . when she married that coverage transferred to her husband . under this system a woman did not legally exist and did not own anything . in the mid-19th century , with the rise of feminism , coverture began to be criticized as being unfair to women . various laws began to be weakened and eventually done away with . but parts of coverture laws , mainly having to do with the husband being responsible for his wife 's debts , lasted into the 1960s in some parts of the u.s .
