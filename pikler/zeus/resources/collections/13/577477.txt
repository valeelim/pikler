Gas operation (firearms)    gas operation ( firearms ) gas-operation is a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms . in gas operation , a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to extract the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber . energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle . this high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a piston head to provide motion for unlocking of the action , extraction of the spent case , ejection , cocking of the hammer or striker , chambering of a fresh cartridge , and locking of the action . direct impingement is a form of gas operation that does away with the piston completely . the bolt is designed in such a way so that the gas acts directly upon the bolt ( hence the name ) to cycle the action .
