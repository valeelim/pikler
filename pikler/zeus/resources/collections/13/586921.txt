Inversion (linguistics)    inversion ( linguistics ) in linguistics , inversion is when the words in a sentence are in a different order than normal . the most common kind of inversion in english is subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion , which happens when an auxiliary verb ( like `` do '' ) changes places with its subject . it usually happens in questions like `` are you coming ? '' . in this example , the subject `` you '' is switched with the verb `` are '' . in many other languages , like languages with a freer word order than english , inversion can also happen with more verbs ( not just auxiliaries ) and other kinds of words .
