P53     p53 ( or `` tp53 '' ) is a gene vital to many forms of life , including humans . it codes for a protein which suppresses cancer . it has been called `` the guardian of the genome '' . the `` p53 '' gene is the most frequently mutated gene ( > 50 % ) in human cancer . its protein product binds to dna and regulates gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome . `` p53 '' protein ( tp53 ) is at low levels in human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) . this allows the most important cell division to proceed rapidly .
