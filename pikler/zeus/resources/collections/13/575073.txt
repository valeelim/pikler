Collect call     a collect call , also called a `` reverse charge call '' , is a type of telephone call . usually , when a telephone call is made , the person who makes the call pays for the call , rather than the person who receives the call at the other end . in a collect call , though , the person making the call wants the person they are calling to pay for the call instead . in the past , these kinds of calls could only be done with a operator , who would need to ask the person receiving the call if they want to be charged for it . if the person receiving it does not want to be charged , the call can not go through . today , computers have made it possible to make or receive collect calls without talking to a person . collect calls used to be made a lot using payphones , but they are becoming less used since mobile phones and voip technology has come around and made long-distance calls cheaper to make . it has been found out that the day of the year in which the most collect calls are made is father 's day , even though the day when the most phone calls are made altogether is mother 's day .
