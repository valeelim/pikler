Djoser     djoser ( other names include netjerikhet , tosorthos , and sesorthos ) was the first pharaoh , or king of the third dynasty of egypt , c. 2670 bce . he is known for the building of the first pyramid built in egypt , the step pyramid at saqqara . the third dynasty , based in memphis , was the beginning of the old kingdom , a period of stability , achievement and unity . there have been claims that he was not the first king , as the abydos king list and the turin king list give a king by the name of sanakht . there is no archaeological evidence to support this , and most experts agree that djoser was the first . he ruled for at least 20 years , but he had so many temples , tombs and monuments built that some experts say he may have ruled for up to 30 years . there is a painted limestone statue of djoser , which is the oldest discovered life sized egyptian statue . it was found in saqqara during archaeological digging in 1924-1925. the statue is now in the egyptian museum in cairo . the building of the step pyramid was quite an achievement . it is the first massive monument built in stone , about 62 meters in height . it is surrounded by a 10 meter high wall , which encloses an area of about 16 hectares . it shows that the kingdom must have been stable and wealthy to have spent so much time and money to build it . the man who designed it and supervised the building was imhotep , the oldest named architect known to us . thousands of years later , djoser was known to egyptians as the `` opener of stone '' , recognising his legacy of using stone for buildings .
