Oblique order     the oblique order , also called the oblique attack is a military tactic to bring a larger force against one of the enemy 's flanks . at the same time the remainder of the force is used to distract and keep the enemy line in place . this is a good tactic if the attacking force is larger in size . frederick the great is credited with inventing the oblique order . he would use a large number of troops on one of the flanks to destroy that section , then drive into the enemy from two directions . the word oblique comes from the middle english word `` oblike '' , which comes from the latin word `` oblÄ«quus '' meaning `` slanted '' . in military usage , oblique usually means at an angle , often 45 degrees . frederick the great was not the first battlefield commander to put more forces on one side of his battle lines . but in the past the maneuver had to be done at night or out of sight of the enemy . if a commander put more troops on one flank ( or `` wing '' ) , the opposing commander seeing this , would simply move his forces to counter the move . shifting forces during a battle took time . there was also the risk of the enemy attacking while forces were being moved around . frederic overcame these problems . the most important thing he did was train his soldiers to march quickly . when his prussian army reached the battlefield , they would form the standard ( for the time ) two lines parallel to the enemy 's two lines . but frederick 's army had been trained to `` quarter-wheel '' ( turn at an angle ) by sections , then in a fluid movement , quickly form into columns . each unit of the prussian army did this at the same moment which allowed his entire force to perform such a movement in under two minutes .
