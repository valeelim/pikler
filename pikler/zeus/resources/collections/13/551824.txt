Appeal to emotion     appeal to emotion is a logical fallacy . it happens when the argument is designed to trigger an emotional response instead of giving reasons . an example of this would be `` we have to donate to charity x ; think of the children ! `` , where instead of giving a reason why we should donate to charity , an emotive trigger is used instead- `` think of the children '' . it is also called `` argumentum ad passiones '' or appeal to feeling . aristotle recognised that if you triggered someone 's emotions , they were easier to persuade . he said this in his book , rhetoric .
