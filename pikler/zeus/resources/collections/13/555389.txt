Prerogative     a prerogative is an exclusive power or privilege possessed by an official of a government or state as a part of his or her office . under english law it is right of a sovereign , which in theory , has no restrictions . for example , the british monarch holds royal prerogatives which have never been fully listed . in practice , they are usually used by ministers on behalf of the monarch . in the united states , the constitution is written in such a way to allow executive prerogatives . presidents use these powers to manage crises or to resolve disputes . although nothing in the constitution specifically gave him the power to do it , george washington used executive prerogative to declare neutrality in the 1790s dispute between great britain and france . thomas jefferson used it to make the louisiana purchase . abraham lincoln used it many times during the american civil war .
