Mauisaurus     mauisaurus ( `` maui reptile '' ) is a genus of plesiosaur that lived during the upper cretaceous about 80 to 69 million years ago . it was the largest plesiosaur , and perhaps the largest marine reptile in new zealand waters at the time . `` mauisaurus haasti '' is the only known species of the genus . a handful of specimens have been found , although only a few are well preserved and mostly complete . with 68 cervical vertebrae , `` mauisaurus '' had one of the longest necks of any plesiosaur . it was large , over in length . like other plesiosaurs , it had a long slender body , with numerous vertebrae , allowing flexible movement . on its underside , `` mauisaurus '' had two sets of large flippers . these aided in swimming at high speeds , but may have also allowed the plesiosaur to venture onto shorelines for short amounts of time . `` mauisaurus '' was a carnivore , with sharp jagged teeth that would have been used to grip fish or squid .
