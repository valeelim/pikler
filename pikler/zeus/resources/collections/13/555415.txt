T2 phage     t2 phage is more properly called enterobacteria phage t2 . it is a virulent bacteriophage which infects `` escherichia coli '' bacteria . it contains linear double-stranded dna , and is covered by a protective protein coat . t2 is a 'tailed phage ' , one of a group known as the 't4-like viruses ' . the dna of the phage is injected into `` e. coli '' cells . it quickly turns the `` e. coli '' cell into a t2-producing factory . new phages are released when the cell ruptures . the hersheyâ€“chase experiments , done by alfred hershey and martha chase , showed how the dna of viruses is injected into the bacterial cells , while most of the viral proteins stay outside . the injected dna molecules cause the bacterial cells to produce more viral dna and proteins . these discoveries showed that dna , rather than proteins , is the hereditary material .
