Religious Zionism     religious zionism ( hebrew : ציונות דתית - `` tziyonut datit '' ) is a branch of zionism . it is a combination of zionism and judaism . religious zionists are in favour of a state of israel , that is mainly populated by jews and dominated by judaism . in their view the state of israel should encompass the entire land of israel ( `` eretz yisrael '' ) . this includes the so-called palestinian territories ( west bank , gaza strip ) and also the golan heights . religious zionism dominates modern orthodox judaism in israel . politically religious zionists can especially be found in habayit hayehudi ( the jewish home ) but also in halikud .
