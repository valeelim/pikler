Automation     in the context of engineering , automation is when a device or a machine is changed in such a way that it can fulfill the task it was designed for without the need of human . very often , this means that the machine is fitted with an additional system which takes control of its functions . benefits of automation are that the output of the machine or device are more uniform , and that product quality is improved . before a system is fully auotmated , it means that human interaction is needed : many of the tasks involved are repetitive and boring . in general , machines are also designed in such a way that humans no longer need to lift heavy weights or perform tasks that can put them in danger . with automation , human intervention is limited or absent .
