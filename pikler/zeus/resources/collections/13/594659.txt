Varna     people became divided into four classes depending on the type of the work . brahmins were priests and teachers . kshatriyas were the warriors . vaishyas did agriculture , trading and commerce . the shudras were the general working class . a common misconception is that the vaishyas and shudras were generally looked down upon , and treated badly by brahmins and kshatriyas , which was true for the later part of the vedic age . but was untrue for the earlier part . this type of social division is called the varna system in hinduism .
