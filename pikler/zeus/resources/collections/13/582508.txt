Young kings of England     since the reign of the first kings of england the question of who should rule next has been hard to answer . examples of this are when edward the elder died leaving two sons aelfward and athelstan , but aelfward died 28 days after edward leaving the throne to athelstan . but when a king picked his successor in the 1100 's it was known as the young king . the next king , the prince of wales usually got to reign as the young king of england before his ascension but both of the young/junior/titular kings never ascended to the throne . the young kings of england in order of reign were : - eustace iv , son of stephen ( 1152-1153 ) as titular king - henry the young , son of henry ii ( 1170-1183 ) as young king ever since henry the young the next in line has never been crowned as young king and just simply prince of wales or just titled as `` the rightful heir to the english throne '' . for kings of england , see list of english monarchs .
