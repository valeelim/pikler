Post hoc ergo propter hoc     post hoc ergo propter hoc is a latin phrase that literally translated , means `` after this , therefore because of this '' . it is also called the `` post hoc '' fallacy . it is a logical fallacy that happens when someone says `` event b happened after event a so event a must have caused event b '' . it is different from the idea that correlation does not imply causation , as in `` post hoc '' , the assumption is made `` solely '' on the order of events , rather than taking into account other factors that might rule out the connection . an example is : - the rooster crows immediately before sunrise . - therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise . the phrase is used by the character sheldon cooper in the third season of the big bang theory . sheldon mentions the logical fallacy in disputing his mother 's claim that her prayer group did ensure his safety during his north pole expedition .
