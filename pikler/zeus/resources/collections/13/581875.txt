Specific heat     specific heat ( `` s '' ) is a particular type of heat capacity . specific heat is the thermodynamic property , which states the amount of heat required for a single unit of mass of a substance to be raised by one degree of temperature . varying ranges of specific heat values are seen for substances depending on the extent to which they absorb heat . the term heat capacity can be misleading since heat `` q '' is the term given to the addition or removal of energy , across a barrier to a substance or system , as a result of increasing or decreasing the temperature respectively . temperature changes are really changes in energy . therefore , specific heat and other forms of heat capacity are more accurately measures of the capacity of a substance to absorb energy as the temperature of the substance increases . units are very important for expressing any thermodynamic property ; the same is true for specific heat . energy in the form of heat is expressed in joules ( j ) or kilojoules ( kj ) which are the most common units associated with energy . one unit of mass is measured in grams or kilograms with regard to specific heat . per one gram is the standard form used in tables of specific heat values , but references using one kilogram are sometimes seen . one degree of temperature is measured on either the celsius or kelvin scale , but usually celsius . the most commonly associated units then for specific heat are j/ ( g•°c ) .
