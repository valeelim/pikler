Bloomery     a bloomery is a type of furnace that was once widely used for smelting oxides . bloomeries were the first smelters able to smelt iron . the result of using a bloomery is a mass of iron and slag called a bloom . this is called sponge iron , because it is porous like a sponge . sponge iron is usually refined into wrought iron . bloomeries are no longer used in smelting , because blast furnaces are better . a bloomery consists of a chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth , clay , or stone . near the bottom , pipes ( made of clay or metal ) enter through the side walls . the pipes allow air to enter . to use a bloomery , charcoal is inserted into the chimney , then heated . then roughly the same volume of iron is inserted . a common product of this process is fayalite , which occurs when iron mixes with slag . iron began to be used around 1200 bc . china appeared to not use bloomeries , seemingly skipping to blast furnaces . however , bloomeries have been found in china , though these were likely only brought from other locations , and not built in china .
