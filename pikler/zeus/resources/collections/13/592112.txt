Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese     some chinese characters for non-chinese people were racist insults where the words themselves were n't the insults , but the characters chosen to write them were . these characters chosen to racially insult people are called graphic pejoratives . an example of this is the name of the yao people . the name of the yao people , who are native to southwest china and vietnam , used to be written as 猺 ( `` yáo '' ) , which means `` jackal '' . however , when china made language reforms in the 20th century , the name of the yao people was changed to 瑶 , which has the exact same pronunciation , but the character means `` jade '' . another example is japan 's original name . before japan chose its own name , the chinese called the japanese 倭 ( `` wō '' ) , which is pronounced `` wa '' in japanese and it means `` dwarf ; subservience '' . however , the japanese thought the name the chinese gave them was insulting , so the japanese changed the chinese exonym to 和 , which has the same pronunciation as 倭 in japanese but means `` harmony '' , and the japanese chose to call their own country 日本 , which is pronounced `` nippon '' or `` nihon '' in japanese and it means `` origin of the sun '' .
