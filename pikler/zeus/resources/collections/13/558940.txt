Milky Wayâ€“Andromeda collision     the collision between the milky way and andromeda will happen in the future . it will not happen for about four billion years . the andromeda galaxy is approaching the milky way at about as shown by its blueshift . until 2012 , it was not known whether the possible collision was definitely going to happen or not . in 2012 , researchers concluded that the collision is sure to happen . they used the hubble space telescope to track the motion of stars in andromeda between 2002 and 2010 with great accuracy . andromeda 's tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the milky way was much smaller than the speed of approach . therefore , it is expected that it will collide with the milky way in around 4 billion years . such collisions are relatively common . andromeda , for example , has collided with at least one other galaxy in the past . several dwarf galaxies such as sagdeg are already colliding with the milky way and being merged into it . other websites . - the merger of the milky way and andromeda galaxies
