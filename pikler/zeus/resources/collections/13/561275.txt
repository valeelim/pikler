Fugitive slave laws     the fugitive slave acts were two federal laws that concerned runaway slaves in the united states . the two acts were passed in 1793 and in 1850. they required federal involvement in catching runaway slaves in northern states . the laws were designed to protect southern slave owners . they required those states and jurisdictions to help in the capture and delivery of fugitive slaves . the laws were very unpopular in the north . they caused a great deal of resentment in the years leading up to the american civil war . slavery in america began in the english colony of jamestown in 1619. it started with the purchase of 20 africans from an english warship named the `` white lyon . '' the colonists in the virginia colony bought the contracts of the africans as indentured servants . not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies . during the 17th and 18th centuries , slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops . after the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 , cotton became the most important crop . at this point slavery became a critical part of the south 's economy .
