Machine learning     machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed ( arthur samuel , 1959 ) . it is a subfield of computer science . the idea came from work in artificial intelligence . machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data . such algorithms follow programmed instructions , but can also make predictions or decisions based on data . they build a model from sample inputs . machine learning is done where designing and programming explicit algorithms can not be done . examples include spam filtering , detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach , optical character recognition ( ocr ) , search engines and computer vision .
