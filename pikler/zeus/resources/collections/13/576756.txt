Ultraviolet catastrophe     the ultraviolet catastrophe is the name given to a conflict between theory and the observation in classical physics . an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium emits radiation in all frequency ranges . it emits more energy as the frequency increases . by calculating the total amount of radiated energy , it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy . this contradicted the principles of conservation of energy and showed a new model was needed for the behaviour of blackbodies . this happened around the end of the nineteenth century . it was one of the things that led to the invention of quantum mechanics . it led theorists like max planck to come up with quantum theory in which energy leaves the body in distinct packet called quanta rather than in continuous waves . the quantum theory accurately predicted the energy of the radiation that is observed .
