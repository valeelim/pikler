Noise-induced hearing loss     noise induced hearing loss ( nhl ) is hearing loss caused by sounds that are too loud ( high decibel level ) and damage hearing cells in the ear . this can make noises sound quieter as well as make noise less clear , it can also cause other hearing related symptoms such as tinnitus . nhl is permanent and can not usually be restored . most of the time , nhl happens after being around a lot of noise for long periods of time . listening to loud music , city traffic or even things like a hair dryer for can damage hearing after a while . but nhl can also happen suddenly when close to an extremely loud sound . this can come from things like being close to an airplane or a gunshot . hearing is a very important sense . it can be hard to notice hearing loss , especially if it happens over time instead of suddenly . even if it is hard for a person experiencing it to notice , it will still have a large effect on their life . not being able to hear a conversation when there is a lot of noise around is usually a good sign of hearing loss . other people may sound like they are speaking softly or their speech may not be clear . both of these can be signs of nhl . similarly , having to ask people to repeat themselves and having to try very hard to hear people speak are also signs .
