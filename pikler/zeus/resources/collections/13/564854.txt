Reinforcement Learning     reinforcement learning is teaching a `` software agent '' how to behave in an environment by telling it how good it 's doing . it is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology . reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning because the correct inputs and outputs are never shown . also , reinforcement learning usually learns as it goes ( online learning ) unlike supervised learning . this means an agent has to choose between exploring and sticking with what it knows best . a reinforcement learning system is made of a `` policy '' ( formula_1 ) , a `` reward function '' ( formula_2 ) , a `` value function '' ( formula_3 ) , and an optional `` model '' of the environment . a `` policy '' tells the agent what to do in a certain situation . it can be a simple table of rules , or a complicated search for the correct action . policies can even be stochastic , which means instead of rules the policy assigns `` probabilities '' to each action . a policy by itself can make an agent do things , but it ca n't learn on its own .
