United States Revenue Cutter Service     the united states revenue cutter service ( usrcs ) was set up in 1790 when president george washington signed an act allowing the building of 10 boats . they were designed to collect customs duties and taxes and to protect against smuggling . they were also tasked with making sure shipments of goods from the united states were getting through to markets in other countries . in 1915 , president woodrow wilson signed the `` act to create the coast guard '' . this designated the united states coast guard as a branch of the us military . it was formed by merging the revenue cutter service with the united states life-saving service . alexander hamilton , the first secretary of the treasury suggested the creation of the revenue cutter service in a letter dated october 2 , 1989. after being approved by congress , the service started with 10 boats called cutters . at the time a cutter was a small fast sailing vessel described as `` a small , decked ship with one mast and bowsprit , with a gaff mainsail on a boom , a square yard and topsail , and two jibs or a jib and a staysail . '' before the revenue cutter service began , the continental navy had been disbanded . until the united states navy was formed in 1794 , the revenue cutter service was the nation 's only naval force .
