Pennsylvania Station (New York City)    pennsylvania station ( new york city ) pennsylvania station ( also called penn station ) is a large train station in new york city . it is the busiest train station in the united states with over 600 thousand people using it every day , many of which are commuters travelling to and from work or school . the station is in midtown manhattan and is underneath madison square garden , between seventh avenue and eighth avenue and between 31st street and 34th street . the station was built by the pennsylvania railroad and is one of several stations in the u.s. with this name . until the beginning of the 20th century , there were no trains that went directly into new york city from the west , because of the hudson river in the way . people had to get off trains in jersey city , new jersey and take a ferry to cross the river and reach new york city . this all changed when the pennsylvania railroad dug two tunnels under the hudson river , and four under the east river to queens . the tunnels and the new station in the heart of new york city were completed in 1910 at a cost of $ 114 million ( which is about $ 2.7 billion today ) , and the first train ran in november of that year .
