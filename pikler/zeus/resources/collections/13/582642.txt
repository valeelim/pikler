Pinch hitter     in baseball , a pinch hitter is a batter in place of another batter . batters can be substituted at any time while there is not an active play . the manager may use any player who has not entered the game . unlike basketball , american football , or ice hockey , baseball does not have a `` free substitution rule '' . the player replaced by the pinch hitter is never allowed back into that game . the pinch hitter takes the spot in the batting order of the player that he replaces . the player chosen to be a pinch hitter is often a backup infielder or outfielder . catchers are not usually pinch hitters because most teams only have two catchers . pitchers are also not used very often as pinch hitters because they are not very good hitters . the american league of major league baseball , the pacific league in japan , the kbo league in korea , and other leagues use the designated hitter rule . the designated hitter bats for the pitcher but does not play defense .
