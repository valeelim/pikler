Tacking (sailing)    tacking ( sailing ) tacking or coming about is a term in sailing that means the boat is changing directions by turning the bow of the vessel in relationship to the wind . it also means the course you are on relative to the direction of the oncoming wind . a tack with the wind blowing over the port ( left ) side of the boat is called a `` port tack '' . a tack with the wind coming over the starboard side of the boat is called a `` starboard tack '' . the sailboat 's helmsman is responsible for communicating with the rest of the crew when making a tacking maneuver . when making a tack the helmsman calls out `` ready about ! '' when the crew is ready they call out `` ready '' , and the maneuver is started . the opposite of a tack ( into the wind ) is a jibe ( changing direction while moving with the wind ) . in order to tack a boat moving into the wind , some speed is necessary . if too much time is taken in completing the tack , the forward momentum will be lost and the boat may move backwards . if a sailboat is caught going directly into the wind , it is called `` in irons . '' this stops all forward motion of the boat . a tacking maneuver is a basic skill that is learned with practice . the maneuver also is different in a single person small sailboat than in a 40 or 50 foot racing sailboat .
