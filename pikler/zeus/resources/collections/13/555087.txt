Whitechapel     whitechapel is a district in the east end of london , in the london borough of tower hamlets . it is 3.4 miles ( 5.5 km ) east of charing cross and roughly bounded by petticoat lane and mansell street to the west , fashion street to the north , cambridge heath road and sidney street to the east and the highway to the south . because the area is close to the london docklands and east of the city , it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class . the area was the centre of the london jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century . it is where the infamous whitechapel murders by jack the ripper took place in 1888. in the latter half of the 20th century , tower hamlets ( including whitechapel ) became the largest settlement for the british bangladeshi community , particularly on and around whitechapel road and brick lane .
