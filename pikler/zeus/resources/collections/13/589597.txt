Palazzo 23     palazzo 23 called also palazzo d'este , is a residential building in milan , located in beatrice d'este avenue on the corner with via luigi anelli , a symbol of the milanese environment of the 1950s . it was the work of the architect gualtiero galmanini , a prestigious designer of the architectural current called `` modern movement '' in italy , a period between the two world wars , aimed at the renewal of the characters , the design and principles of architecture , urban planning and of design . a very special building showing the interest for architectural details , simple yet sophisticated elegance , consists of a body with two external facades and two interiors . the facade is characterized by a mosaic tiled brick wall covering with chamfered creases that create white and gray light games . we notice a wide use of classical elements , whose rigidity and symmetry , however , is dissolved in the arrangement of the windows on via anelli and d'este and other typically asymmetrical elements . also note the technical accuracy and attention to the particular construction , which will be typical of galmanini .
