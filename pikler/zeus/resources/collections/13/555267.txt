Exposure action value     exposure action value is a limit on the level of noise that workers can be exposed to . the level of noise is measured in decibels and after this level , the workplace needs to make sure that workers are protected from the noise . safety plans need to be made to stop or lower the risk of hearing health problems for workers . it is the job of the employer to make sure that workers are safe at work by creating a program that will reduce the risk of any problems . in order to control the level of noise in the workplace , a noise dosimeter which is a device that is used to measure the amount of noise in a workplace over time is used . these devices can be worn on the body of a worker to record the level of sound they hear throughout their whole work day as they move to different areas of the workplace . they can also be used to measure the level of noise in a large specific area of the workplace . how the device is used depends on the work environment . some workers will be walking to different areas of a workplace throughout the whole day and hear different levels of sound but some will only be staying in one area . if the noise dosimeter shows that the level of noise reaches the exposure action value , the employer needs to start using the program they have created to stop any future damage to their worker 's hearing health .
