Battle of Thebes     thebes had been under macedonian occupation since the battle of chaeronea , which had resulted in the defeat and deposition of thebes as the pre-eminent city-state of southern greece . the thebans had reluctantly accepted this , as well as their compulsory membership in the league of corinth , which had been previously imposed by phillip ii of macedon , alexander 's father . the expedition against persia had been long in the works , and alexander did not make it a secret that he planned to avenge the attacks on greece by persia a century and a half before , despite that at the time his kingdom had been a persian vassal state . it was as a result of this planned expedition that king darius iii started to distribute money to the greek city-states with the hope that they would rise against their new hegemon . in addition to this , he had sent his most able general memnon of rhodes against the macedonian troops that were already stationed in ionia at this time . in addition to this , news of alexander had not reached the southern greek city states for some time . he had been busy with the siege of pelium and a rumour had reached them that he had died during the course of this siege . demosthenes - a prominent athenian politician - produced a man who claimed to have been present at the siege and claimed that alexander was dead . alexander had , indeed , been injured during this siege , so it was not a totally implausible claim to make .
