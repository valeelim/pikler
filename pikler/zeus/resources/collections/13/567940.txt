Brachistochrone curve     the essence of the brachistochrone curve , is that , given two points in space , this curve will transport a object with mass from the first point to the second along a frictionless ramp given no friction , in the shortest amount of time . the problem can be solved with the tools from the calculus of variations and optimal control . other websites . - the straight line , the catenary , the brachistochrone , the circle , and fermat unified approach to some geodesics ( from 2014 )
