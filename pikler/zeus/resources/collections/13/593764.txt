United States Army trucks     in 1915 the us army started testing trucks that were made to go off-road . could they replace horses ? trucks could carry bigger loads and were easier to take care of . a truck can run as long as it has fuel and a good truck should not break . a horse has to be fed , rested , and can get sick . the tests showed the trucks were better than horses . the army started replacing all horses and mules with trucks . one of the testers , lieutenant dwight d. eisenhower , later became the president of the united states and started the interstate highway system . army trucks are measured by how many tons ( 907 kg ) a cargo model can carry ( the same truck can have different bodies ) . they also measure the number of wheels that drive . off-road trucks have all the wheels driving . 2 axles are 4x4 , 3 axles are 6x6 , and 4 axles are 8x8 . ( dual tires are counted as one wheel ) . until the 1990s most army trucks had the engine in front of the cab . in the us this is called `` convential '' . in great britain this is called `` bonneted '' . in the 1990s the army changed to new types . most new types can have an armored cab . medium and large trucks have the cab over the engine ( `` coe '' ) . the front of the cab looks flat . most trucks in great britain and europe are coe . a new large size truck has the cab in front of the engine ( `` forward control '' ) . there are two axles under the engine . both axles steer .
