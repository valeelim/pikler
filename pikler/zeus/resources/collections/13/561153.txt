Enantiornithes     enantiornithes is a group of extinct avialans ( `` birds '' in the broad sense ) . they are the most abundant and diverse group known from the mesozoic era . most had teeth and clawed fingers on each wing , but otherwise looked much like modern birds . over 80 species of enantiornitheans have been named , but some names represent only single bones , so probably not all are valid species . enantiornitheans became extinct at the cretaceous–paleogene boundary , as did the hesperornithids and all other non-avian dinosaurs . the enantiornithes are thought to have left no living descendants . the name `` enantiornithes '' means `` opposite birds '' , from ancient greek `` enantios '' ( `` ἐνάντιος '' ) `` opposite '' + `` ornithes '' ( `` όρνιθες '' ) `` birds '' . the name was coined by cyril alexander walker in a landmark paper which established the group . in his paper , walker explained what he meant by `` opposite '' : this refers to an anatomical feature . the articulation of the shoulder bones has a concave-convex socket joint which is the reverse of the joint in modern birds .
