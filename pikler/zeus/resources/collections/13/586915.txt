Fixed-point theorem     in mathematics , a fixed-point theorem is a theorem that a mathematical function has a fixed point . at that fixed point , the function 's input and output are equal . this concept is not one theorem itself ; it is a way to describe many other theorems . list of fixed-point theorems . - atiyah–bott fixed-point theorem - banach fixed-point theorem - borel fixed-point theorem - browder fixed-point theorem - brouwer fixed-point theorem - caristi fixed-point theorem - diagonal lemma , also called the fixed-point lemma , for making logical sentences that describe themselves . - fixed-point lemma for normal functions - fixed-point property - injective metric space - kakutani fixed-point theorem - kleene fixpoint theorem - knaster–tarski theorem - lefschetz fixed-point theorem - nielsen fixed-point theorem - poincaré–birkhoff theorem proves that a function has two fixed points - ryll-nardzewski fixed-point theorem - schauder fixed-point theorem - topological degree theory - tychonoff fixed-point theorem
