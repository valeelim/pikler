Lateen     a lateen ( from french `` latine '' , meaning `` latin '' ) or latin-rig is a triangular sail set on a long yard mounted at an angle on the mast . it runs in a fore-and-aft direction . a square sail is a very simple device . it catches a following wind and pushes the vessel forward . the lateen sail is more complex . it is set at an angle to the wind . it works be creating a difference in air pressure between the two sides ( concave and convex ) of the sail . this is the same way a fore-and-aft sail works . this is why the lateen sail is considered the ancestor of the fore-and-aft sail . the advantages of the lateen sail is that it is effective in lighter winds . it causes less drag and so is more efficient . it allows the vessel to sail much `` closer to the wind '' ( meaning it can sail at up to about 45 degrees into the wind ) . this made the lateen sail a very important invention . the lateen sail did not directly come from the square sail . there was an intermediate sail type called the lug sail . it was one of the earliest fore-and-aft rigs . it was developed for use on the indian ocean . sailors knew that the wind does not always come from behind the vessel . they learned that the square sail could be made more efficient by turning it on the mast so it remained at a right angle to the wind . when used with a keel and some form of steering , it provided more options . instead of simply sailing downwind , the vessel could move in different directions relative to the direction of the wind . if the wind came from the beam ( side of the ship ) , rotating the sail became less effective . but , if the luff ( edge of the sail ) was pointed into the wind and kept taut , the sail would provide forward movement . they may not have understood the reasons why it worked only that it worked . this could be made more effective if the yard ( or spar ) holding the sail is sloped downward into the wind . from this discovery came the lug , then the lateen .
