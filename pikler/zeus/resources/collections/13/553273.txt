American Civil War casualties     american civil war casualties are those soldiers , both union and confederate , who died , were wounded , went missing or were captured . the american civil war was the nation 's bloodiest war . the violence in battles such as shiloh , antietam , stones river and gettysburg shocked everyone in the country , both north and south . it also shocked international observers . of those who died , by far the leading cause of death was disease . the exact number of dead will never be known with any certainty . all civil war casualty numbers are estimates , no matter what the source . for over a hundred years the total number of dead has been accepted by most historians as 618,222 , generally rounded off to 620,000. newer estimates have put the number at about 750,000 or about 20 % higher than previously approximated . unfortunately , the numbers are based on inaccurate records and missing documents . in 1860 , no one expected any armed conflict would come from the southern states secession from the union . or , if it did , it would be brief and mostly for show purposes . southerners did not believe the north would mobilize an army against them . the u.s. senator from south carolina made the statement he would drink all the blood shed over the south declaring their independence from the union . then , as it became apparent that it would become a military confrontation , both sides believed it would not last very long . in 1861 , when the union army entered the first battle of bull run , they thought a quick victory would bring an end to the war . after the union loss at bull run , the confederates thought the union would simply give up the idea re-uniting the north and south . both were wrong .
