Non-separable wavelets     non-separable wavelets are multi-dimensional wavelets that are not implemented using one-dimensional operations . they are studied since 1992. in contrast to separable wavelets , the non-separable wavelets have several advantages . for example , the non-separable filters imply more parameters in design . this consequently leads to better filters . examples . - red-black wavelets - contourlets - shearlets - directionlets - steerable pyramids - non-separable schemes for tensor-product wavelets
