Qin Shi Huang     qin shi huang ( ; 18 february 259 b.c . – 10 september 210 b.c . ) was the founder of the qin dynasty and was the first emperor of a unified china . he was born ying zheng ( ) or zhao zheng ( ) , a prince of the state of qin . he became the king zheng of qin ( ) when he was thirteen , then china 's first emperor when he was 38 after the qin had ruled all of the other warring states and unified all of china in 221 bc . the first emperor 's father yiren was the grandson ( son of the son ) of ze , the ruler of qin . the rulers of qin and zhao were from the same family , but the two lands fought against one another frequently . they wanted to make peace . king ze gave his grandson yiren to the leaders of zhao so that , if qin started to fight zhao , the ruler of zhao would kill yiren and his family . because king ze would not want that , the ruler of zhao was able to have less fear that qin would fight him . ( he also sent people from his family as prisoners to qin so that things were even . ) while yiren was a prisoner in zhao , he met a trader named lü buwei . lü knew that , when king ze went to death , yiren 's father lord anguo would be the leader of qin . lü also knew that yiren had many brothers but yiren 's father loved a woman who had no son . lü worked hard to make that woman adopt yiren ( take him up as her son ) ; yiren even changed his name to zichu ( `` son of chu '' ) because his new `` mother '' was from a land named chu . lü 's design turned out well : he and zichu secretly went out from zhao and , when ze and lord anguo died , zichu got to be the ruler of qin .
