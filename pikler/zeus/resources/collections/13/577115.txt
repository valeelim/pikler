English claims to the French throne     from 1340-1800 many english and later british monarchs claimed the throne of france . the origin of the claims come from edward iii 's territorial claims of france which he claimed gave him the right to be king , he tried to take the throne of france and started the war of the roses . the first english monarch to completely rule france for majority of his reign . henry vi was made to be successor of french king charles vi and on october 21st 1422 took up the position of the french king . he was said to rule the whole of france but in reality only ruled small parts of the north . charles vii was later crowned as king of france , son of charles vi starting a small line of disputed monarchs and the english , later british monarch claiming the throne of france for another 350 years . edward iv also claimed the throne of france during edward vi 's absence from the english throne and his claims happened in between henry 's so reign of the monarch may not be in perfect order for this list . the claim was of france but really monarchs only ruled calais due to the terrible general skills of the duke of somerset , a close friend of margaret of anjou and henry vi .
