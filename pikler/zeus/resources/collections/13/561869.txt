Weather vane     a weather vane is a device with a freely rotating pointer used to indicate the direction of the wind . weather vanes served as simple devices for showing the direction of the wind and its speed for centuries . they were a critical tool for agriculture , travel and shipping . they serve a largely decorative function today . they have been replaced by specialized weather instruments . to work correctly a weather vane should be at the highest point of a building . it needs to be as far away as possible from other things that might interrupt the wind . the simplest form is a horizontal arrow or other form freely rotating on a vertical rod . when the wind blows , the arrow shows the direction and speed . the earliest known weather was made by the astronomer andronicus in 48 bc . it sat on top of the tower of the winds in athens . it was between and long and was the shape of a head and torso of a man with the tail of a fish . the word 'vane ' comes from the old english `` fana banner '' . this is related to the old high german `` fano '' ( cloth ) ; from the latin `` pannus '' ( cloth or rag ) .
