Sphygmomanometer     a sphygmomanometer ( ( , ; also called a blood pressure meter , blood pressure monitor , or blood pressure gauge ) is a device used to measure blood pressure in humans . it was first invented by an austrian physician in 1881. they now come in different shapes and sizes . they can be found in many places . the sphygmomanometer works by wrapping a tube of fabric ( called a `` cuff '' ) around the arm or other body part . the cuff is filled up with air . that stops the flow of blood in the arm . the air is then released slowly until the blood flows again . the whole process , from start to finish , only takes about a minute . many sphygmomanometers are inflated by squeezing a bulb . a gauge shows how much the cuff is inflated . the gauge can be mechanical or hydraulic ( filled with mercury ) . it is important that the cuff is not inflated too much , so whoever is using the device has to use a stethoscope . some sphygmomanometers , especially those that people use at home , are automatic . they inflate using an electric pump . they show the blood pressure on a screen . they are meant to be very easy to use .
