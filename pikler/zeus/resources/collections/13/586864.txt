Gravitational time dilation     gravitational time dilation is a physics concept about changes in the passage of time , caused by general relativity . a clock in outer space moves more quickly than a clock on earth . heavy things like planets create a gravitational field that slows down time nearby . this means that a clock on a spaceship far away from any planet would move faster than a clock near earth . this is different from time dilation explained by special relativity , which says that fast objects move more slowly through time . close satellites like the international space station move very quickly to orbit the earth , so they are slowed down . because the iss is in low earth orbit ( leo ) , time dilation due to gravity is not as strong as time dilation due to its speed , so a clock on it is slowed down more than it is sped up . an object in geostationary orbit moves less quickly and is farther away from earth , so gravitational time dilation is stronger , and clocks move more quickly than in leo . this means that engineers need to pick different clocks for different orbits . gps satellites work because they know about both kinds of time dilation .
