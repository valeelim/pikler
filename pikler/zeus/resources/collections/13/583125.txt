Bus network     a bus network is an arrangement in a local area network ( lan ) in which each node ( workstation or other device ) is connected to a main cable or link called the bus . the illustration shows a bus network with five nodes . each node is shown as a sphere , the bus appears as a heavy horizontal line , and connections to the bus appear as vertical lines . a bus network is simple and reliable . if one node fails to operate , all the rest can still communicate with each other . for a major disruption to take place , the bus itself must be broken somewhere . bus networks are easy to expand . additional nodes can be added anywhere along the bus . there are several limitations to the bus network topology . the length of the bus is limited by cable loss . a bus network may not work well if the nodes are located at scattered points that do not lie near a common .
