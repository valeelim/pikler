Mbah Gotho     saparman sodimejo , known more commonly as mbah gotho ( born , reportedly , 31 december 1870 â€“ 30 april 2017 ) was an indonesian man who unverifiably claimed to be the oldest person ever recorded . in may 2010 , `` solopos '' reported that the 1870 census had recorded his age next birthday as 142 , which would make him 19 years older than the official oldest recorded person , jeanne calment , who died in 1997. the `` liputan 6 '' website reported that mbah gotho 's estimated age was 140 , that he could not remember his date of birth but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in sragen in 1880. in august 2016 , after a television report on `` liputan 6 '' , numerous international media outlets reported gotho 's claim , including photographs of his id card ( issued in 2014 ) , which displays his claimed birth date . although indonesian officials at the local record office confirm the birth date there is no independent , third-party verification of his claimed age , which is required for the longevity claim to be recognized by record authorities such as guinness world records .
