Slave Power     slave power , also called the slave power conspiracy and slaveocracy , was a term first coined by abolitionists in 1839 and was in common use by the 1850s . it referred to the economic , social and political influence held by slaveholders in the south . southern slaveholders had a great deal power in congress and many other federal offices up to and including the presidency . this is in spite of the fact they made up only a small minority of the population of the nation . these few very powerful men used their influence to maintain the institution of slavery . the fear in the north was that the slave power conspiracy intended to not only to spread slavery to the western territories but to all the states in the north . slavery in america began in the english colony of jamestown in 1619. it started with the purchase of 20 africans from an english warship named the `` white lyon . '' the colonists in the virginia colony bought the contracts of the africans as indentured servants . not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies . during the 17th and 18th centuries , slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops . after the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 , cotton became the most important crop . at this point slavery became a critical part of the south 's economy .
