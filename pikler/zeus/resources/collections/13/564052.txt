Virtual reality     virtual reality ( often just called vr ) is the name for computer technology that makes a person feel like they are somewhere else . it uses software to produce images , sounds and other sensations to create a different place , so that a user feels like he or she is really part of this other place . that other place can be a real place ( to take a tour in another country , for instance ) or imaginary ( playing a game ) . the technology to do this needs special display screens or projectors and other devices . often the picture will change when the user moves their head , they may be able to `` walk '' through this virtual space , and to see things in that space from different directions , and maybe move things in that space . haptic feedback might also be used to help make it seem more real - haptic feedback uses special gloves that make it feel like you touched something in real life . virtual reality is different than augmented reality , which shows the real place that a person is in , but changes or adds to it . pok√©mon go is an example of augmented reality .
