Courtship     a courtship is a time in the relationship of a couple . during a courtship , a couple gets to know one another . they later decide if they will get engaged , married or other such agreement . a courtship may be a private and informal matter between two people . on the other hand , it may be public . or it could be a formal arrangement with the approval of a family . there is a great difference between couples . the average extent of a courtship differs quite a bit across the world . courtship may be entirely omitted , as in some cases of arranged marriage . in the united kingdom , there was a poll of over 3,000 engaged or married couples . the average time between first meeting and an accepted marriage proposal was two years and eleven months . the women felt ready to accept at an average of two years and seven months . in the earlier 1800s , young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner , not social reasons . in the more traditional forms of christianity , this concept of courtship has been kept .
