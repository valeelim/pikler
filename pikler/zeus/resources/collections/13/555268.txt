Nazi salute     the nazi salute or hitler salute is a gesture that was used as a greeting in nazi germany . the salute is performed by extending the right arm in the air with a straightened hand . usually , the person offering the salute would say `` '' heil hitler ! '' ( hail hitler ! ) , `` heil , mein f√ºhrer ! '' ( hail , my leader ! ) , or `` sieg heil ! '' '' ( hail victory ! ) . it was adopted in the 1930s by the nazi party to show obedience to the party 's leader , adolf hitler . it also gave honour to the german nation ( and later the german war effort ) . the salute was required for all civilians . it was mostly optional for military personnel who retained the traditional salute until shortly after the failed assassination attempt on hitler on july 20 , 1944. use of this salute is currently a criminal offense in germany , italy , japan , the czech republic , slovakia , and austria . in switzerland , france , canada , the netherlands and sweden , the salute is illegal hate speech if used for promoting nazi ideology .
