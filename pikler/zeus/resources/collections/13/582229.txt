Casimir effect     the casimir effect ( predicted by hendrik casimir in 1948 ) is the attraction of two metal plates in a vacuum . this effect occurs because of a side effect of the quantum uncertainty principle , where 'virtual ' particles cause the plates to be slightly pushed towards each other . the quantum uncertainty principle says that particles , fields , etc . have two values , and that the more accurately you measure one , the less accurately you can measure the other . since 'empty ' space ( which is a field ) would be completely empty , then we would know both the field 's magnitude ( which is zero ) and its rate of change ( also zero ) . therefore , there must be tiny fluctuations in 'empty ' space , so that the uncertainty principle is n't violated . these take the form of virtual particles , which we would n't be able to detect directly . however , we can see the effects they have on real particles . some of these particles are virtual photons , which can also be considered as waves . now , between the reflective metal plates , there is a certain distance . certain virtual photons , specifically ones where the distance divided by the wavelength is a whole number , are the only ones that can fit in here ; if it is n't a whole number , eventually the peaks and troughs of the waves will coincide , and cancel it out .
