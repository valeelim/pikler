Virtual DOS machine     a virtual dos machine ( vdm ) permits the users of computers to run 16-bit or 32-bit dos and 16-bit windows programs on 32-bit computers when there already is a different operating system using the hardware . virtual dos machines normally use the virtual 8086 mode of the intel 80386 ( or later ) processor , allowing many 8086 applications to function by translating operating system commands to make applications think that they are running on an 8086. the operating system can then emulate the dos software . vdms like windows 3.x 386 enhanced mode can add support for using 16-/32-bit protected mode software if they use the dos protected mode interface ( dpmi ) . if a dos program in a vdm needs to use a peripheral , windows will give the dos program a virtual device driver ( vdd ) which emulates the hardware using commands that the operating system it is running on can understand . dos vdms appeared on windows/386 2.01 in 1987 and were also in windows 3.x , if you were using 386 enhanced mode as well as in 95 , 98 , 98 se and me .
