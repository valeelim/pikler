Generative adversarial networks     generative adversarial networks ( gans ) are neural network artificial intelligences that work together to give better answers . one neural net is the tricky net , and the other one is the useful net . the tricky net will try to give an input to the useful net that will cause the useful net to give a bad answer . the useful net will then learn not to give a bad answer , and the tricky net will try to trick the useful net again . as this continues , the useful net will get better and not become tricked as often , and the useful net will be able to be used to make good predictions .
