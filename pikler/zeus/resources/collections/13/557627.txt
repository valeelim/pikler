Stove fan     stove fans are used to distribute the warm air generated by ( usually ) a wood burning stove to the surrounding area . 2 main types are available , one uses the seedbeck effect to generate a small electric current to drive a small electric fan . the other type uses a simple stirling type engine to provide the mechanical power to drive the fan . they are usually located on the top surface of the stove and direct their air stream into the general area of the room . for the electric type , a thermoelectric power generator ( teg ) module is located on a hot part of the stove ( the top ) and it generates an electric current that is used to drive the motor . the teg uses a set of doped semiconductor elements ( p tye & n type ) to produce the current when a temperature difference exists between the hot and cold sides of the module . this is then fed to the low torque fan motor . it is important that a temperature difference exists across the teg for it to work properly , tooo low a difference results in minimal power output . the `` cool '' side of the teg is often arranged to be cooled by the fan usually utlising a heat sink to improve the cooling .
