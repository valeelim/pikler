Nematocera     the nematocera are a large suborder of flies which include the mosquitoes and midges . they usually have long thin bodies , with segmented antennae . usually their larvae are aquatic , but there are many exceptions to this . examples of the nematocera include the mosquitoes ( culicidae ) , crane flies ( tipulidae ) and black flies ( simuliidae ) . many of the other families are called gnats , and others are called midges . many species form mating swarms of males , and in some of these , competition for females is extreme . although many species ( as larvae ) have a strong association with water , even within a single family there may be a trend toward semiaquatic and terrestrial habitats .
