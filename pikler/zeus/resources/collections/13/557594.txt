Māori religion     traditional māori religion , that is , the pre-european belief system of the māori , was little modified from that of their tropical eastern polynesian homeland ( hawaiki nui ) , conceiving of everything , including natural elements and all living things as connected by common descent through whakapapa or genealogy . accordingly , all things were thought of as possessing a life force or mauri . illustrating this concept of connectedness through genealogy are the major personifications of pre-contact times : tangaroa was the personification of the ocean and the ancestor or origin of all fish ; tāne was the personification of the forest and the origin of all birds ; and rongo was the personification of peaceful activities and agriculture and the ancestor of cultivated plants . ( according to some , the supreme personification of the māori was io ; however this idea is controversial . ) .
