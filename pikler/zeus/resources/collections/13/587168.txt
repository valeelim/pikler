ShahmukhÄ«     shahmukhi is used to write the punjabi language by punjabi speakers in pakistan . it is written from right to left . the shahmukhi script is based on the perso-arabic script which is used to write urdu . shahmukhi can not be called an alphabet ; it is really an abjad . an abjad is a script that has letters to represent consonants but not vowels . of course , shahmukhi , and other scripts relating to it , are impure abjads . this means that there are ways to represent vowels in the writing but they are used in a very bare method . there are 38 letters in the shahmukhi abjad . this may seem like a lot to learn , but the letters are really not too difficult to remember .
