Germania     germania was a roman name originally given to tribe of people who lived along the rhine river . they were a teutonic people , who were first mentioned in the 4th century bc . the gauls changed it from a name for a people to the name for the territory . this was a vast forested wilderness to the north that rome knew very little about . it ran from the west on the river `` rhenus '' ( rhine ) to the east and the carpathian mountains and the river vistula . on the north it was bounded by the north sea and on the south by the river hister ( danube ) . germania was home to a very large number of germanic and a few celtic tribes . the northern provinces of germania were called `` germania inferior '' . some of the tribes known to live here were the menapii , batavi , condrusi , atuataci and eburones . close to the roman fortifications on the east side of the rhine lived the frisii , chauci , istavones , sicambri , marsii , cattii , and ubii tribes . the ubii were friendly with the romans and provided cavalry as well as guarded the border for the romans .
