Dunn index     the dunn index ( di ) is a metric for judging a clustering algorithm . a higher di implies better clustering . it assumes that better clustering means that clusters are compact and well-separated from other clusters . there are many ways to define the ( 1 ) size of a cluster and ( 2 ) distance between clusters . the di is equal to the minimum inter-cluster distance divided by the maximum cluster size . note that larger inter-cluster distances ( better separation ) and smaller cluster sizes ( more compact clusters ) lead to a higher di value . in mathematical terms : let the size of cluster c be denoted by : formula_1 let the distance between clusters i and j be denoted by : formula_2 formula_3
