Three letter rule     in english , the three letter rule ( or short word rule ) is the observation that content words are three letters long at least . one- and two-letter words are mostly function words . examples : `` i '' , `` at '' , `` he '' , `` if '' , `` of '' , `` or '' , etc . therefore , content words almost all have at least three letters . notice that content words with fewer than three phonemes get an extra letter or letters which are `` phonetically redundant '' : the extra letters do not change the sound . examples are such as `` ebb , `` add , `` egg , `` inn , `` bee , `` awe , `` buy '' , `` owe '' , etc .
