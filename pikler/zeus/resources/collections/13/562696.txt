Roman dictator     a dictator was the senior magistrate of the roman republic . they were regularly appointed from the earliest period of the republic down to the second punic war . dictators had the full authority of the state to deal with a military emergency or to undertake a specific duty . the right of the tribune of the plebs to veto his actions was extremely limited . however , to prevent the dictatorship from threatening the state itself , limitations were placed on his powers . a dictator had a clear sphere of authority . he had to resign once his task was done , or after six months . after the second punic war , no dictators were appointed for over a century . then the idea was revived by sulla , and later by caesar . sulla was a tyrant , and caesar was murdered soon after becoing dictator . the office was formally abolished after the death of caesar , and not revived under the empire .
