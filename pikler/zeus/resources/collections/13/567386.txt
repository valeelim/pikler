Euroscepticism     euroscepticism is the criticism of the european union ( eu ) . some observers also say that the total rejection of the eu is euroscepticism . euroscepticism should not be confused with anti-europeanism , which is the dislike or fear of european culture and/or people . eurosceptics says that the european union weakens the nation state . they also say that the european union is too bureaucratic ( meaning that important decisions are made by officials who are n't elected ) . in 2016 , the countries with the most unfavourable view of the eu were greece , france , spain and the united kingdom . the rise of right-wing populist parties in europe have been contributed to their eurosceptic views . on 23 june 2016 , the united kingdom voted to leave the european union with 52 % voting to leave . in november 2015 , a poll showed that those with a positive image of the eu went down from 52 % in 2007 to 37 % . distrust of the eu was highest in greece ( 81 % ) , cyprus ( 72 % ) , austria ( 65 % ) , france ( 65 % ) germany ( 63 % ) , the united kingdom ( 63 % ) and the czech republic ( 63 % ) .
