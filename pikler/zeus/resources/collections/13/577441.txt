Ontological argument     the ontological argument is the name of an idea in religious philosophy . there are different versions , but they all seem to use a form of argument , such as : because we can imagine a perfect being , therefore there must be a god . the earliest objection was that one could use that sort of reasoning to prove anything . other versions start with a notion of the universe , and from that argue that there must be a god . technically , the argument is a kind of `` a priori '' reasoning . that means deductions from reasoning without any actual investigations . david hume was the enemy of that kind of thinking . he believed that knowledge was got from experience , and the rest is `` nothing but sophistry and illusion '' .
