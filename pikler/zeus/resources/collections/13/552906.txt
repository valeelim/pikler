Heart block     heart block is a type of heart disease . the human heart uses electrical signals to make the heart beat . electricity travels down pathways in the heart to make each part of the heart beat at the right time . when a person has a heart block , there is a “ block ” in one of these electrical pathways . this blocks electricity from travelling normally through the heart . this makes the heart beat more slowly . in the most serious cases , the heart ’ s electrical pathways are blocked so badly that electricity can not travel through the heart . this means the heart ’ s electrical signals can not control how the heart beats , or can not make the heart beat at all . many people with heart block have no symptoms at all . other people only have symptoms every once in a while . sometimes , their heart might skip a beat . this can make the person feel dizzy ; faint ; or have palpitations ( feel their heart pounding ) . in the most serious cases of heart block , a person 's heart can not control their heart beats . these cases can be treated with an artificial pacemaker . this is a medical device that is placed into the heart . it sends electrical signals to make the heart beat regularly .
