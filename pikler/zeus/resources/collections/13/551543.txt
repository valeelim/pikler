Intersectionality     intersectionality or intersectional theory studies the relation between the many different ways that people are kept in a lower social position , controlled , and left out of important parts of society because of their differences . kimberl√© williams crenshaw gave the name `` intersectionality '' to this concept in 1989. sometimes a society decides that a group of people are different from themselves . when they do this , they `` other '' that group , or marginalize them . intersectionality points out that people are often othered for more than one reason . these reasons might be gender , race , class , ability , sexual orientation , religion , caste , age , nationality , language , or other parts of identity . because of this , it suggests that these types of othering can not be looked at by themselves . they must be looked at together . for example , a person can be othered because they are a woman , a person of color , a poor person , and a disabled person at the same time . these different forms of othering make each other worse , shape each other , and prop each other up . this means that the experience of being othered for all of these reasons is different from what would happen if you added them all up . because of this , fighting each one alone would not help the people who experience many of them at the same time .
