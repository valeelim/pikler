Color rendering index     color rendering index ( cri ) is a number rating given to light bulbs or lamps for how `` right '' they make colors look . this number is usually written on the side of light bulb 's box . the cri number can be as high as 100 , or as low as zero ; and sometimes it can go under zero . high cri number is good ; it means colors will look right and real . low cri number is bad ; it means colors will look wrong and weird . however , there is a limit of what a cri number can tell . good cri number can guarantee correct colors only when the light itself is white . this is because of limits on how science people test them . candles and incandescent light bulbs have cri 100 but they are not white , so we can not rely on them to make stuffs show real colors . the cri number of daylight at noon is 100 , because this is the natural way people see colors . good fluorescent tubes or led lamps have a cri 80 or more . anything white with a cri 80 or more are good enough for homes . the orange sodium vapor lamp has cri lower than 0 , so they are only used as streetlamps .
