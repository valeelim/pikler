Hair clipper     hair clippers are tools used to cut hair close to the head . similar tools are used to cut wool from sheep . hair clippers have a pair of sharpened comb-like blades in close contact one above the other and the side which slide sideways relative to each other . the clipper is moved so that hair is positioned between the teeth of the comb , and cut with a scissor action when one blade slides sideways relative to the other . manual clippers were invented between 1850 and 1890 by nikola bizumic , a serbian barber , and the hairstyles became popular amongst boys and men in school , prison and the military . leo j. wahl invented the first electric hair clipper . he first designed a hand-held massager for his uncle , dr. frank wahl . frank wahl opened a manufacturing plant in sterling , illinois to produce and sell leo â€™ s massager . during this time , leo would sell massagers to various barbers and noticed an opportunity to improve upon the tools barbers were using at the time .
