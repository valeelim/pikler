Appeal to nature     an appeal to nature is an argument that says a thing is good `` because '' it is 'natural ' , or bad `` because '' it is 'unnatural ' . it can be a bad argument for two reasons . first , not everyone agrees on what is `` natural '' or `` unnatural '' . for example , eating meat is natural to some people and unnatural to others . second , even if something is clearly natural or unnatural , that alone does not mean that the thing is good or bad . for example , many `` natural '' plants and animals are poisonous , but unnatural things like medicine and vaccines can be helpful against diseases . some popular examples of the appeal to nature can be found on labels and advertisements for food , clothing , and health products . labels may use the phrase `` all-natural '' , to suggest that products are environmentally friendly and/or safe . however , a `` natural '' product may not be safe , environmentally friendly , or effective .
