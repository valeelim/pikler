Confederate States Marine Corps     the confederate states marine corps ( csmc ) was a branch of the confederate states armed forces during the american civil war . it was established on march 16 , 1861. the csmc 's manpower was initially authorized to include one major , one quartermaster sergeant , and 600 men divided into six companies of 100 marines each . this was increased on may 20 , 1861 raising the rank of officers and adding more men . the organization of the corps began at montgomery , alabama . it was completed at richmond , virginia , when the capital of the confederate states of america was moved there . the csmc headquarters and main training facilities remained in richmond , virginia throughout the war . it was located at camp beall on drewry 's bluff and at the gosport shipyard in portsmouth , virginia . the last csmc unit surrendered on april 9 , 1865 , with the confederacy itself surrendering a month later . the corps was established by an act passed by the congress of the confederate states on march 16 , 1881. it was modeled after the united states marine corps . many of its officers were u.s. marines who joined the confederacy after the war started . the strength of the corps were authorized for 46 officers and 944 enlisted men . but it always had fewer marines than it was authorized to have . one of the reasons was that marines were paid $ 3 a month less than other confederate enlisted men . late in the war they drew men from confederate army conscripts and were finally given bounties . both of these helped to fill out their ranks . lloyd j. beall served as a colonel and as commandant of the corps . he had no marine experience and was a former united states army paymaster .
