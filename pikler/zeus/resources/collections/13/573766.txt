Cherry picking     cherry picking is when someone chooses some data or information from a larger amount to give evidence for their own argument , when all the information taken together would not have done so , or would not have done so so strongly . for example , if twenty scientific studies have been done on a new medicine and 19 say it works , but one says it does not work , a person could `` cherry pick '' by only using the one study in which the drug did not work and use that to `` prove '' the point that the medicine is useless , even though most of the evidence suggests otherwise . it is a type of confirmation bias , where a person sees evidence for what they want or expect to see , and ignores evidence which goes against their belief . the term cherry picking comes from when people harvest cherries from a tree - the cherry picker only takes the reddest , ripest fruits . if someone looked at all the fruit the person had picked , they might think that all the cherries were red , until they went to the tree and saw lots of pale , unripe cherries still on it .
