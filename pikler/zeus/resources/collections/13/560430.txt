Scripting language     a scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts . scripts are usually short computer programs that do steps that could be done one at a time by a person . this automates a job to make it easier and more reliable . a scripting language is often a simpler language , and easier to learn than other languages , but still can do many things . scripts may run inside of another program , like in a web browser or microsoft excel . they may also be a `` shell '' that runs from a command line interface and makes calls to the operating system ( os ) . the shell is considered `` interactive '' - the user can choose what to type , and the shell responds to the command . these can be used to control jobs on mainframes and servers . some people say a scripting language must be tied to a specific use . others use a wider definition and include general-purpose programming languages that are interpreted , not compiled . `` general-purpose '' means it can be used in many ways for different things . some general-purpose languages ( such as java ) have variations that can be scripted ( javascript ) . there is no specific rule on what is , or is not , a scripting language .
