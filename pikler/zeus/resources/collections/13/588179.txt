Polyisocyanurate     polyisocyanurate , also referred to as pir , polyiso , or iso , is a thermoset plastic typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation . its chemistry is similar to polyurethane ( pur ) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate ( mdi ) is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol . catalysts and additives used in pir formulations also differ from those used in pur . pir is typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation . its thermal conductivity has a typical value of 0.16 btu*in/hr*ft*°f ( 0.023 w/ ( m·k ) ) depending on the perimeter : area ratio . pir foam panels laminated with pure embossed aluminium foil are used for fabrication of pre-insulated duct that is used for heating , ventilation and air conditioning systems . prefabricated pir sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion-protected , corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of pir foam and used extensively as roofing insulation and vertical walls ( e.g . for warehousing , factories , office buildings etc. ) . other typical uses for pir foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation , and carving/machining media ( competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams ) .
