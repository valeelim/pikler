Jib     a jib is a triangular sail that sets ahead of the foremast of a sailing vessel . its tack ( lower leading edge ) is attached to the bowsprit , to the bow , or to the deck between the bowsprit and the foremost mast . jibs and spinnakers are the two main types of headsails on a modern boat . schooners typically have up to three jibs . the foremost one sets on the topmast forestay and is generally called the `` jib topsail '' . a second jib on the main forestay is called `` the jib '' . the innermost jib is called `` the staysail '' . actually , all three sails are both jibs and staysails , in a general sense . a large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs , but could have as many as six . from forward ( fore ) to the back of the boat ( aft ) , these sails are called : - jib of jibs - spindle jib - flying jib - outer jib - inner jib - fore ( topmast ) staysail . the first two were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds . a storm jib was a small jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather .
