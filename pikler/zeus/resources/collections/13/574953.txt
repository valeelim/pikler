Toll-free telephone number     a toll-free telephone number is a telephone number in which the person who owns that telephone number is charged for calls that come to them , rather than the person making the call to that number being charged . these numbers usually begin with `` 1-800 '' in north america ( 800 being the area code under the north american numbering plan ) , but are different around the rest of the world . they are not to be confused with `` collect calls '' , which are made when the person making the call does not want to have to pay their telephone company to make it . in this case , the person receiving the call has to agree to be charged for that call , while those owning toll-free numbers already agree to being charged for incoming calls .
