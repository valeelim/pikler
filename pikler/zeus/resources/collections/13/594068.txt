Tibetan spaniel     the tibetan spaniel is a breed ( type ) of small , intelligent dogs . they were first bred more than 2,500 years ago in the himalayan mountains of tibet . they share genetic history with many other small dogs from asia , like the pekingese , japanese chin , shih tzu , lhasa apso , tibetan terrier and pug . even though they are called a tibetan spaniel , this dog is not like a `` true '' spaniel . spaniels are gun dogs , for hunting . tibetan spaniels are companion dogs , and are not useful for hunting . no one is sure how they got the name `` spaniel '' if they are not gun dogs , but it may be because tibetan spaniels look very similar to the small , `` lapdog '' versions of the hunting spaniels , such as the cavalier king charles spaniel . the tibetan spaniel has a round head that is small for their size . it has a short muzzle ( nose ) , which is smooth , without wrinkles . the nose is black . the eyes are medium-sized and oval , and are far apart from each other . the tibetan spaniel does not have extra skin around the eyes ; this helps to tell the difference between the tibetan spaniel and its close relative , the pekingese . the ears hang down either side of the head to cheek level , with furry ends , called `` feathered . '' the neck is covered in a mane of hair . male tibetan spaniels have larger manes . like their ears , their tails are feathered with fur . their hair is `` double coated , '' with long , silky hair covering short , soft hair .
