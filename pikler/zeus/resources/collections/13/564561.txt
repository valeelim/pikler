Combined gas law     the combined gas law is a formula about ideal gases . it comes from putting together three different laws about the pressure , volume , and temperature of the gas . they explain what happens to two of the values of that gas while the third stays the same . the three laws are : - charles 's law , which says that volume and temperature are directly proportional to each other as long as pressure stays the same . - boyle 's law says that pressure and volume are inversely proportional to each other at the same temperature . - gay-lussac 's law says that temperature and pressure are directly proportional as long as the volume stays the same . the combined gas law shows how the three variables are related to each other . it says that : the formula of the combined gas law is : where : to compare the same gas with two of these cases , the law can be written as : by adding avogadro 's law to the combined gas law , we get what is called the ideal gas law . boyle 's law states that the pressure-volume product is constant :
