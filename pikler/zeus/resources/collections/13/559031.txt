Catenary     a catenary is a type of curve . an ideal chain hanging between two supports and acted on by a uniform gravitational force makes the shape of a catenary . ( an ideal chain is one that can bend perfectly , can not be stretched and has the same density throughout . ) the supports can be at different heights and the shape will still be a catenary . a catenary looks a bit like a parabola , but they are different . the equation for a catenary in cartesian coordinates is where formula_2 is a parameter that determines the shape of the catenary and is the hyperbolic cosine function , which is defined as hence , we can also write the catenary equation as the word `` catenary '' comes from the latin word `` catena '' , which means `` chain '' . a catenary is also called called an alysoid and a chainette .
