Open class     an open class of words is a part of speech that can easily add new words . a closed class of words , on the other hand , can not add new words easily . for example , since pronouns are a closed class , there are fairly few pronouns : i , me , my , mine , myself , you , you , your , yours , yourself , he , him , his , his , himself , she , her , her , hers , herself , it , it , its , its , itself , we , us , our , ours , ourselves , they , them , their , theirs , themselves . since pronouns are used to replace whole noun phrases , there is no need to have many kinds of pronouns . instead of saying `` the earl of sandwich introduced the earl of sandwich 's favorite food , the sandwich '' , one uses the pronoun `` his '' to replace `` the earl of sandwich 's '' to make the sentence not repeat itself when it does n't have to , thus the sentence becomes `` the earl of sandwich introduced his favorite food , the sandwich '' . new nouns , on the other hand , can easily be made , and are constantly being added into the english language .
