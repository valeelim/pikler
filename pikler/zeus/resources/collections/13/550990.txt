Ethnic minorities in Azerbaijan     this article is about the ethnic minorities in azerbaijan . although more than 91 % of the people are ethnic azerbaijanis , azerbaijan has many ethnic minorities including russians , ukrainians , georgians , jews and other minorities . however the numbers of most of these ethnic minorities are small . after the end of the soviet union with the independence of azerbaijan and the nagorno-karabakh war , almost all armenians ( outside the separatist region of nagorno-karabakh ) fled or were deported from the country . at the same time , almost all azerbaijanis fled or were deported from armenia and nagorno-karabakh . most russians and other minorities have also left the country and are continuing to leave the country . as a result , azerbaijan has become ethnically more `` pure '' .
