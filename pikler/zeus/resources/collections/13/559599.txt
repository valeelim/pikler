Piezoelectricity     piezoelectric material generates a small electrical voltage , when its shape is deformed . this can be by as little as a 0.09 % change , and can produce 12mah worth of electricity at 230v ( standard power output ) . it is important to note that the actual values of a piezoelectric material 's volume or surface area do not change , as only the ratios of each axis ( x , y and z ) that are altered . e.g . a cuboid with 20 meters cubed volume can have the normal dimensions 1 meter by 2 meters by 10 meters , and the deformed dimensions 2 meters by 2.5 meters by 4 meters ; the volume would remain the same ( 20 meters cubed ) . when processed , the piezoelectric crystal become sharper as they get refined through heating and cooling . this process makes the material much more sensitive to changes in pressure , as well as increases their resistance to compressive stress that would impede its ability to function . reference book :
