Relativistic jet     relativistic jets are very powerful jets of plasma with speeds close to the speed of light . they are emitted by the central black holes of some active galaxies ( notably radio galaxies and quasars ) , and by the black holes of massive stars and neutron stars . their lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of light years . if the jet speed is close to the speed of light , the effects of the special theory of relativity are significant . the mechanics behind how jets are created , and what they are made of , are still a matter of debate . jet composition might vary . massive galactic central black holes have the most powerful jets . similar jets on a much smaller scale develop from neutron stars and black holes in other stars . even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary star systems . the general hypothesis among astrophysicists is that the formation of relativistic jets is the key to explaining the production of gamma-ray bursts . these jets have lorentz factors of ~100 or greater ( that is , speeds over roughly 0.99995c ) , making them some of the fastest celestial objects known at present .
