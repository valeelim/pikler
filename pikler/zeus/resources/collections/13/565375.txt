Fore-and-aft rig     a fore-and-aft rig is a sailing rig that mainly has sails that are set along the line of the keel instead of perpendicular to it . such sails are described as fore-and-aft rigged . two of the earliest fore-and-aft rigged sailing designs were the chinese junk and the triangular lateen sails of the egyptian feluccas and dhows . the lateen sail was used by greek ships as early as the 9th century . by the 11th century the fore-and-aft rig began to be used in the italian city-states and the mediterranean sea . the generally gentle climate made its use practical . there seems to be no record of when it was first used in northern europe . the square rigged sails came first in the north . the vikings used square rigged sails which became popular in britain and northern europe . they certainly had seen its use in the course of trade and during the crusades . the renaissance changed this . slowly the fore-and-aft rig came into common use on rivers and in estuaries in britain , northern france , and the low countries . the square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open north sea as well as for transatlantic sailing . the lateen sail was more maneuverable and faster , while the square rig was clumsy but seaworthy .
