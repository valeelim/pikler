Zeno sama     zeno sama ( 全王 zen ’ ō , lit . `` king of all '' ) is one of the two kings of the 12 universes , one of the two entities who stands above the entire multiverse , alongside his future counterpart , future zeno sama . zen-oh has a very small , childlike humanoid figure . his purple and blue-striped face can often be seen with a near blank expression . he has no visible nose . he wears a pink vest on his body , which bears two `` all '' kanjis ( 全 ) on the front . his head has a lemon-like shape , with his two ears being pointed and grey . he also has an extremely high and childlike voice . zen-oh can come off as childlike and innocent on many occasions . he can be swayed easily by a good fight , as seen from his interest in setting up a tournament after witnessing goku 's fight against hit . he also took a liking to goku , letting the saiyan talk directly to him and shake his hand to the point of lifting the small deity off the ground . his interest in goku led him to ask the saiyan to become his friend , and to have goku give him the nickname `` zen-chan . '' he prefers goku to speak plainly , and is unappreciative ( to the point of threatening ) of those who attempt to speak in his place . it is possible that zen-oh is lonely , as almost nobody knows of his existence , and those who do fear his power , proving a barrier to friendship , to add a little bit of lonliness , and the great priest only treated him as if he is royalty , blithely following his orders without question .
