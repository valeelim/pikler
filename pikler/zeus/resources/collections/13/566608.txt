Otto Wichterle     otto wichterle ( 27 october 1913 now in the czech republic – 18 august 1998 ) was a czech chemist known for his invention of modern soft contact lenses . he decided to be a chemist after his father , which co-owned a farm machine factory . he graduated from high school in and then he studied at the of the . after he got his diploma he wanted to continue in his studies , but the protectorate regime did n't let him do so . fortunately , he could continue in his scientific work because he was able to take part in the research institute at 's works in zlín . his team made the first czechoslovak called '' silon . '' he was arrested by the gestapo in 1942 but was released few months later . after world war ii he returned to the university and started teaching and inorganic chemistry . he wrote an inorganic chemistry textbook and german and czech organic chemistry textbook . in 1952 he was made the dean of the i in prague . otto studied the synthesis of hydrophilous gels . he wanted to find a perfect material that can be in permanent contact with living tissues . his colleague helped him and together they prepared a gel . this gel absorbed up to 40 % of water and was transparent . this new material is the poly ( 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) . they patented it in 1953. wichterle thought that it might be a good material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses . in 1957 wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses . the problem was that the edges tore when the lens was getting removed . he wanted to find a better way to make them . unfortunately , he was forced to leave the because of its communist leadership in 1958. so the research at the institute came to an end , but he did the important experiments to transform into a good shape of a contact lens by himself at home .
