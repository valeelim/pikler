Chigger     a chigger is a small , parasitic mite which lives in tall grass . it is a member of a larger family known as the trombiculidae . the species of trombiculidae which bite in their larval stage cause `` intense irritation '' , or `` a wheal , usually with severe itching and dermatitis '' . their color can range from bright red to brown . chiggers are almost too small to see with the naked eye , so checking grass for them is near impossible . chigger bites appear 2-3 hours after a host is bitten , and can last for a few weeks . they bite in hot , moist places , such as the armpits , under the knees , and the genitals . trombiculidae live in forests and grasslands and in low , damp areas such as woodlands , berry bushes , orchards , along lakes and streams . it does live in drier places , such as lawns , golf courses , and parks . they are most numerous in early summer when grass , weeds , and other vegetation are heaviest . in their larval stage they attach to various animals and feed on skin , often causing itching .
