Seyfert galaxy     seyfert galaxies are named after carl seyfert who first described them in 1943. these galaxies are one of the two main types of active galaxies . the other large group are quasars . seyfert galaxies have quasar-like nuclei : they are very distant luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation . their very high surface brightness has spectra with strong , high-ionisation emission lines . however , unlike quasars , their host galaxies are clearly visible . seyfert galaxies are about 10 % of all galaxies , and are some of the most intensely studied objects in astronomy . they are thought to be powered by the same phenomena as quasars , although they are closer and less luminous than quasars . these galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers which are surrounded by accretion discs of in-falling material . the accretion discs are believed to be the source of the observed ultraviolet radiation . ultraviolet emission lines and absorption lines are the best way to analyse the surrounding material .
