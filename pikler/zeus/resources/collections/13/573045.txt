B chromosome     b chromosomes are chromosomes which are not needed for the life of a species . they are also called 'supernumerary ' or 'accessory chromosomes ' . in addition to normal chromosomes ( the karyotype ) , many species have b chromosomes . wild populations of many animal , plant , and fungi species have b chromosomes . these chromosomes are not essential for their life , and are lacking in many individuals . so a population might have individuals with 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ( etc ) supernumeraries . most b chromosomes are mainly or entirely heterochromatic , and so do not code for anything . some , such as the b chromosomes of maize , contain sizeable euchromatic segments , and therefore do code for some products . it seems unlikely that supernumeraries would survive in a species unless there was some positive advantage . in a few cases this has been identified . for instance , the british grasshopper `` myrmeleotettix maculatus '' has b chromosomes with a satellite dna . they occur in warm , dry environments , and are scarce or absent in humid , cooler places .
