Capital asset pricing model     the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) is a model of stock returns . it makes a key assumption , which is that investors care only about two things : the mean returns of stocks over , for example , a year , and the volatility around that mean during this year . the main result of the model is that the return of a stock can be broken down in the sum of two things : a risk-free rate and a risk premium . this risk premium can be seen as the product of two things : a measure of the risk of the stock ( called the `` beta '' ) and the average reward for risk in the market ( the `` equity risk premium '' , which is the return of the market over and above the risk-free rate ) .
