Christianity and homosexuality     various christian denominations are negative about homosexuality , like the catholic church , eastern christianity , orthodox protestant churches , and sects like mormonism . they consider homosexuality and other forms of lgbt activities as sinful and contradictory with god 's purpose in creating people . god created man and woman ( adam and eve ) , and only they are allowed to have sexual intercourse , and only within marriage ( no same-sex marriage ) . for that reason homosexuality is considered a severe sin in the bible , as stated for example in the book of leviticus and the epistle to the romans . especially in evangelical denominations the increase of lgbt activities in modern times is subscribed to the approaching end time when evil will reach its highest point . liberal christian denominations and some ( less ) orthodox protestant churches have more or less accepted lgbt activities . related pages . - religion and homosexuality
