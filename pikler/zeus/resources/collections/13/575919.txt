Olfactory bulb     the olfactory bulb is a part of the vertebrate forebrain . it works in olfaction , or the sense of smell . the olfactory bulb has one source of sensory input ( axons from olfactory receptor neurons , and one output ( mitral cell axons ) . it is thought that it functions as a filter . however , the olfactory bulb also gets `` top-down '' information from brain areas like the amygdala , neocortex , hippocampus , locus coeruleus , and substantia nigra . its range of functions probably include : - discriminating between odors - enhancing sensitivity of odor detection - filtering out background odors - permitting higher brain areas involved in arousal and attention to modify the detection or discrimination of odors .
