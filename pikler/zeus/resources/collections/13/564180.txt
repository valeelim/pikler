Turkish Airlines Flight 981     turkish airlines flight 981 was a regular flight operated by turkish airlines , from istanbul to london heathrow , with an extra stop in paris . the aircraft was a mcdonnell douglas dc-10 . on march 3 , 1974 , the airplane crashed into the ermenonville forest , shortly after it had left paris . all 346 people on board were killed in the accident . an investigation after the crash found out that one of the cargo doors at the rear of the aircraft was not properly closed and secured . after takeoff , part of the door broke off and caused an explosion in the rear of the aircraft . the explosion also damaged cables needed to fly the aircraft . this meant that after the explosion , the aircraft could not be completely controlled . an american airlines dc-10 , flying as american airlines flight 96 , had experienced the same problem about two years earlier . at that time , the crew had managed to land the plane safely . on the ground it was discovered the rear cargo door had opened in flight . this caused damage to the fuselage but not the explosive damage in the case of turkish 981. the two planes were also configured differently above the baggage compartment . there were three rows of seats added to turkish 981 which added a greater load to the floor . when the cargo door blew out , the additional seats and passengers were ejected from the plane before the crash . both planes experienced uncontrolled decompression when the cargo door latches failed . but turkish 981 had additional damage to the plane that may have made it uncontrollable in flight .
