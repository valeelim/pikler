Amyloidosis     amyloidosis is a rare and serious disease that could be fatal that is caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal , insoluble fibres , known as amyloid fibrils , within the tissues of the body . amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in 'local amyloidosis ' or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in 'systemic amyloidosis ' . the symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging , so that diagnosis is often delayed . there are many different types of amyloidosis , each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients . about 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein . though this disease being rare , many famous people have died from this disease such as : martin mcguinness , david lange , robert jordan and robert p. casey .
