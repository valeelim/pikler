Yosemite Decimal System     the yosemite decimal system ( yds ) is a system that is used to rate the difficulty of walks , hikes , and climbs . the system has three parts . it is used mostly by mountaineers in the united states and canada . the yds system divides all hikes and climbs into five classes . classes 1-3 are used mainly in hiking and trail running . - if a trail is rated class 1 , a person can walk on the trail with very little chance of getting hurt . wearing hiking boots is a good idea . - if a trail is rated class 2 , a person can 'scramble ' up the trail . they may need to use their hands every now and then . there is little chance of getting hurt . wearing hiking boots is important . - if a trail is rated class 3 , a person can still 'scramble ' up the trail , but they need to be able to hold on with their hands . if a person is just learning to climb , they should use a rope to make sure they are safe if they fall . falls from class 3 trails could kill a person . if a trail is rated class 4 , a person will have to do some simple climbing to get up the trail . there is a lot of natural protection on the trail ( like parts of a rock wall that are easy to step on or grab onto . ) often , people use ropes for safety on class 4 climbs , because falls from class 4 climbs could easily kill a person .
