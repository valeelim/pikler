Cladding     cladding is the application of one material over another to provide a skin or layer . this may be for protection against the weather , or it may be for aesthetic purposes . rainscreen cladding is one form of weather cladding : it is designed to protect against the elements , but also offers thermal insulation . the cladding does not need , itself , to be waterproof , merely a control element : it may serve only to direct water or wind safely away in order to control run-off and prevent its infiltration into the building structure . cladding may also be a control element for noise : whether entering or escaping . cladding applied to windows is often referred to as window capping and is a specialized field . in the wake of the grenfell tower fire , in london , and similar fires , in france , dubai and elsewhere , great attention has been paid to the fire protection qualities of cladding used in tower-blocks and similar high-rise multiple-occupancy housing and , in particular , the use of aluminium composite material ( acm ) and acm panels ( acp ) .
