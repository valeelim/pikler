History of hearing aids     the first modern hearing aids were made in the 17th century . even though that was when they first became popular , since the 13th century people had already been making similar devices by hollowing out the horns of animals . hearing aids did not improve very much until electricity and the telephone were created in 1898. this is when the first electric hearing aid was also created , but it was not given out to the public to use until later in the 20th century . over the past century however , the fast development of technology has changed and improved the hearing aid greatly , making new designs and adding new functions to be able to help even more hearing problems . the first hearing aids were called ear trumpets and were large funnel-shaped devices that were mostly made out of metal , animal horns , wood and even snail shells . people would hold to the device to their ear when they needed to use it to hear . these hearing aids did not make sound louder but collected sound and directed it into the ear which made the sound energy stronger when it hits the ear drum , helping to make hearing easier for people with hearing loss .
