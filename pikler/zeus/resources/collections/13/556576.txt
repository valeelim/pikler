Autophagy     autophagy ( which means `` eating itself '' ) , is one of the basic cell mechanisms . it allows the controlled breaking down of cell parts which do not work , or are not needed . the cell parts can then be recycled as required . there are several ways this happens . targeted cell parts may be isolated from the rest of the cell in an `` autophagosome '' ( a double-membraned vesicle ) . the autophagosome fuses with lysosomes and the contents are broken down and recycled . in the extreme case of starvation , the breakdown of cellular components promotes cellular survival by maintaining cellular energy levels . the name `` autophagy '' was coined by belgian biochemist christian de duve in 1963. the identification of autophagy-related genes in yeast in the 1990s let researchers figure out the mechanisms of autophagy . this led to the award of the 2016 nobel prize in physiology or medicine to japanese researcher yoshinori ohsumi .
