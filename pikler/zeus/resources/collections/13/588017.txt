Aortic dissection     aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inside of the aorta causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta , forcing the layers apart . in most cases this is associated with a sudden onset of severe chest or back pain , often described as `` tearing '' in character . also , vomiting , sweating , and lightheadedness may occur . other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia . aortic dissection can quickly lead to death as a result of not enough blood flow to the heart or rupture of the aorta . aortic dissection is more common in those with a history of high blood pressure , a number of connective tissue diseases that affect blood vessel wall strength such as marfan syndrome , a bicuspid aortic valve , and previous heart surgery .
