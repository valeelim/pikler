Irish English     after the british invasion of ireland , irish or ( gaelic / gaeilge ) was almost completely removed from the country and replaced by english . understandably there 's next to know difference between irish english and british english . mainly the only differences are the colloquials and slangs depending what part of the country you 're in .
