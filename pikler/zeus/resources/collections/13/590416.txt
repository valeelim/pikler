List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom     the united kingdom is divided by royal mail into postcode areas . the postcode area is the largest geographical unit used and forms the first characters of the alphanumeric uk postcode . each postcode area is divided into post towns and postcode districts . the london post town is instead divided into several postcode areas . the single or pair of letters chosen for postcode areas are generally a mnemonic for the places served . the crown dependencies ( which are not part of the united kingdom ) did not introduce postcodes until later , but use a similar coding scheme . they are separate postal authorities . glasgow , like london , was divided into compass districts : c , w , nw , n , e , se , s , sw. when postcodes were introduced , these were mapped into the new `` g '' postcode : c1 became g1 , w1 became g11 , n1 became g21 , e1 became g31 , s1 became g41 , sw1 became g51 , and so on . as nw and se had never been subdivided they became g20 and g40 respectively . norwich and croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s , which was replaced by the current system . the format was of the form nor or cro followed by two numbers and a letter , e.g . nor 07a .
