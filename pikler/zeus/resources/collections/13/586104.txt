Roman citizenship     client state citizens and allies ( socii ) of rome could receive a limited form of roman citizenship such as the latin right . such citizens could not vote or be elected in roman elections . slaves were considered property and lacked legal personhood . over time , they acquired a few protections under roman law.the rights available to individual citizens of rome varied over time , according to their place of origin , and their service to the state . they also varied under roman law according to the classification of the individual within the state . various legal classes were defined by the various combinations of legal rights that each class enjoyed . however , the possible rights available to citizens with whom roman law addressed were : the toga was the characteristic garment of the roman male citizen , and statues of emperors ( here antoninus pius ) frequently depict them togate ( togatus ) . ius suffragiorum : the right to vote in the roman assemblies . ius gentium : the legal recognition , developed in the 3rd century bc , of the growing international scope of roman affairs , and the need for roman law to deal with situations between roman citizens and foreign persons . the ius gentium was therefore a roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time , and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the greek city-states and of other maritime powers . [ 4 ] the rights afforded by the ius gentium were considered to be held by all persons ; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship .
