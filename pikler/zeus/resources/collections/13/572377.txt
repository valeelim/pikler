Hot stick     a hot stick is a tool used by utility workers ( known as linemen or linesmen ) dealing with high voltage electricity . it is an insulated pole made usually from fiberglass , measuring anywhere from 5ft-10ft , up to about 40ft in length . it can have different tools attached to the end of it , making it possible to do everything from tightening bolts and nuts , through to testing voltage or removing and replacing fuses . hot sticks are usually used when the installation being worked on is live , or `` hot '' . most electrical work on high voltage networks is done whilst the power is still active , making equipment like this a very important piece for safety purposes . working `` hot '' saves electricity users from being disconnected while routine maintenance is taking place .
