Series and parallel circuits     two types of electrical circuits are the series circuit , and the parallel circuit . in a series circuit , the electrical current is only able to flow around a single path . the current will flow from a power source , such as a battery , into one or more electrical loads , such as a light bulb , and then back to the power source . in a series circuit , the same amount of amperage from the power source flows through each load . the voltage in a series circuit is divided up across all of the loads . if one of the loads on a series circuit stops working , the current will not be able to flow through the rest of the circuit , and the rest of the loads will also stop working . in a parallel circuit , the electrical current may flow along more than one path before returning to the power source . the voltage in a parallel circuit is the same across all of the loads in the circuit . in a parallel circuit , the amperage is divided up across all of the loads . if one of the loads in a parallel circuit stops working , the other loads in parallel will be able to continue to work .
