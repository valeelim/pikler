Special Administrative Region     a special administrative region ( sar ) is a region in china that has a high level of sovereignty , or a lot of power to rule itself . there are 2 sar 's in china , hong kong and macau . unlike other regions in mainland china , sar 's have a constitution that is different from that of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , basic law . basic law allows hong kong and macau to have freedoms that are not in the rest of china , like freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , and freedom to petition . basic law also allows the sar 's to decide the economic rules of their region , which is why the economies are a lot less controlled in hong kong and macau than in mainland china , as well as giving them the freedom to choose who to let into their own regions without needing a visa . as a result , hong kong and macau have their own currencies , passports , official languages , etc . this is commonly known as the `` one country , two systems '' policy . chinese is an official language in both sar 's , but unlike mainland china where mandarin is the main spoken language and simplified chinese is the main written language , cantonese is the most spoken language and traditional chinese is the main written language in these areas . interestingly enough , the vagueness of simply stating chinese as the official language allows this to happen . also , english and portuguese , the main languages of the nations that controlled hong kong and macau in the past in respective order , are also official languages in the respective sar 's .
