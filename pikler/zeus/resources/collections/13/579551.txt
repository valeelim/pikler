Laboratory thermometer     laboratory thermometer is a tool used in laboratories to measure temperature with a high level of accuracy . it can be partially or fully immersed in the substance being measured . a laboratory thermometer is recognizable by its long stem with a silver bulb at the end . the silver color on the laboratory thermometer at the bulb normally indicates the presence of mercury . mercury expands as the temperature increases , thus raising the reading , while decreasing temperatures contract the mercury , lowering the reading . mercury thermometers are being phased out as of 2014 as preference is shifted to other types of thermometers , such as digital , alcohol-filled and organic-based thermometers.its normal temperature is ( -10 ) degree celsius to ( +110 ) degree celsius
