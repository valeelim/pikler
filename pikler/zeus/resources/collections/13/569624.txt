Muhammad bin Tughluq     after the death of his father , ghiyasuddin tughlaq , juna khan took the name of muhammad-bin-tughlaq . he apposed the interference of ullemas ( religious leaders ) to consolidate his position . he was a great scholar bit lacked common sense . he was harsh as well as liberal . he transferred his capital from delhi to devgiri but in the absence of transportation and being the distance between the two be of 950 kms many people died and the expence caused a great loss to the empire . to add more , this absence in north encouraged frequent mongol attacks . after 5 years , he ordered a retreat that caused even greater hardships to the people . to cover the loss on his previous projects he imposed land tax in doab area at 50 % of the produce . the peasants who were already suffering due to a widespread famine , were stunned by the order . many of them gave up cultivating and layed their land barren . another failure of his was that he issued token currency of copper which resulted in high production of counterfeit coins . during his last days he had to face many rebellions in diffrent parts of rhe sultanate .
