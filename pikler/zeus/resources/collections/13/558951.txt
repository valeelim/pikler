Slow loris     slow lorises are the genus nycticebus , nocturnal species of strepsirrhine primates . they live in southeast asia and nearby areas . there are about eight species : the sunda slow loris ( `` n. coucang '' ) , bengal slow loris ( `` n. bengalensis '' ) , pygmy slow loris ( `` n. pygmaeus '' ) , javan slow loris ( `` n. javanicus '' ) , philippine slow loris ( `` n. menagensis '' ) , bangka slow loris ( `` n. bancanus '' ) , bornean slow loris ( `` n. borneanus '' ) , and kayan river slow loris ( `` n. kayan '' ) . the group 's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern india and sri lanka . their next closest relatives are the african lorisids , the pottos , false pottos , and angwantibos . they are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids ( the various types of galago ) , and more distantly to the lemurs of madagascar . their evolutionary history is uncertain : their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given various results . slow lorises eat insects , small birds and reptiles , eggs , fruits , gums , nectar and some vegetation . a 1984 study of the sunda slow loris found its diet was 71 % fruit and gums , and 29 % insects and other animal prey . a more detailed study of another sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions : 43.3 % gum , 31.7 % nectar , 22.5 % fruit , and just 2.5 % arthropods and other animal prey .
