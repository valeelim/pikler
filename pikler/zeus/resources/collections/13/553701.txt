History of baseball in the United States     the history of baseball in the united states can be traced to the 19th century . this is when amateurs played a baseball-like game by their own informal rules using equipment they made themselves . the popularity of the sport inspired the semi-pro national baseball clubs in the 1860s . the earliest known mention of baseball in the united states was a 1791 pittsfield , massachusetts , law banning the playing of the game within of the town meeting house . in 1903 , the british sportswriter henry chadwick wrote an article saying that baseball came from a british game called rounders . a game which chadwick had played as a boy in england . but baseball executive albert spalding disagreed . baseball , said spalding , was basically an american sport and began in america . to decide they agreed to let abraham g. mills settle the question by heading a commission . after three years they found that abner doubleday had invented the national pastime . in 2004 , baseball historian john thorn discovered the 1791 town ordinance , putting pittsfield 's connection to baseball 48 years before abner doubleday accepted invention of the game in 1839 in cooperstown , new york . this is where the national baseball hall of fame now stands . the hall of fame recognized the ordinance as the first known reference to the game and honored the town with a plaque . another early reference reports that `` base ball '' was regularly played on saturdays in 1823 just outside of new york city in an area that today is greenwich village .
