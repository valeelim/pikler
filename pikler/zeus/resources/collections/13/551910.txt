Shock tactics     shock tactics are those military tactics designed to overwhelm an enemy with fear , causing panic and confusion . shock tactics are as old as warfare itself . the mongols got their reputation for being invincible by the use of shock tactics . numbers of medieval knights mounted on their warhorses made coordinated shock attacks into the ranks of enemy soldiers . robert e. lee saw the advantage of the shock attack as not so much killing enemy soldiers , but to `` create a panic and virtually destroy the [ enemy ] army . '' the disadvantage of a shock attack is that the attacker may suffer heavy casualties . during world war i , for example , germany suffered great losses with its use of the shock attack . ancient armies often defeated their enemy through through the psychological impact of shock tactics . - the hittites and ancient egyptians used the first mobile tool for shock tactics ; the war chariot . charioteers were the elite branch of most armies of the time . but by the beginning of the classical period they were no longer effective . armies had developed ways to defeat the chariots in battle . even the infamous scythed chariots used by darius i of persia could be easily defeated by the infantry . they changed to a wider spacing of their phalanx formation . this allowed the soldiers to avoid the blades and let the scythed chariots to go right through . they then ran directly into the long pike formations directly behind each phalanx which impaled the chariots and their riders .
