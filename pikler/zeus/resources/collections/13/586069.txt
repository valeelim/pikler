Sound barrier     when an object comes closer to the speed of sound ( mach 1 ) , air pressure changes drastically , and there will be pressure waves around the object . this pressure will rise until the speed of mach 1 is reached . at this point , it will suddenly decrese , and a sound burst will result . the speed of mach 1 , where this burst happens , is often called sound barrier . aircraft wings had to be redesigned , so that certain aircraft can fly at speeds faster than mach 1 .
