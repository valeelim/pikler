Lactate dehydrogenase     lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh or ld ) is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells ( animals , plants , and prokaryotes ) . it catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvic acid and back this is an important function because lactic acid builds up in muscle tissue . ldh works to prevent muscle fatigue and failure in various ways . each ldh molecule is made of four subunits . there are somewhat different types of ldh in different tissues . the main type in the lungs has two m subunits and two h subunits ( 2h2m ) . the m and h subunits are coded by two different genes . the m subunit is coded by ldha on human chromosome 11 , and the h subunit is coded by ldhb on chromosome 12 .
