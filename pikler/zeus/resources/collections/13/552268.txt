Preemptive war     a preemptive war is one in which a country takes military action against another country or group that poses a real threat of waging a war against them . the purpose is to stop the threat before the country or group has a chance to strike . this is an old philosophy of war or of preventing a war . sun tzu , the ancient chinese general , military expert and philosopher , advised using preemptive war to make sure your enemy does not attack first . a declaration of war may or may not come before a preemptive first strike . preemptive war is thought of as a defensive act . this is true when it is clear an enemy is threatening an attack and that attack will do great harm . also , a country which preemptively attacks another to defend itself can claim it was a moral act and avoid the label of an aggressor . there is often confusion between preemptive war and a preventative war . a preemptive war is one in which striking first gives a country an advantage over an enemy whose intentions are clearly to strike and do great harm . an example is the 1967 six-day war . when it became clear that egypt and syria were about to attack , israel attacked them first in a preemptive strike .
