Presidency of Abraham Lincoln     the presidency of abraham lincoln began when he took office as the 16th president of the united states on march 4 , 1861. it ended with his death on april 15 , 1865. during his presidency he claimed more prerogatives than any other president had done before him . as a result , the small and relatively limited powers of the president grew enormously during his time in office . when lincoln won the 1860 presidential election , he did it without the support of any of the southern states . since the 1830s , southern states had talked about secession , but it became a serious issue in 1860. between the election and lincoln 's inauguration in march of 1861 , seven states had seceded from the union . they formed the confederate states of america ( csa ) . when confederates attacked fort sumter on april 12 , 1861 and captured it the next day , this started the american civil war . while having little previous military experience , lincoln still managed to stand out as a great war president . in 1863 , his emancipation proclamation freed the slaves in southern states . it led directly to the abolition of slavery in the united states . given later that year , his gettysburg address is and remains one of the most important speeches in american history . in 1865 , as the civil war was ending he was shot and killed by john wilkes booth , a confederate sympathizer . his death made lincoln a martyr to the union cause . he is widely recognized as one of the greatest presidents in u.s. history .
