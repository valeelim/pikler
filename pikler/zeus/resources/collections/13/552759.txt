Anthocyanin     anthocyanin is a chemical compound which makes the red colour in plants . for example , red cabbage has anthocyanins which make it red . in flowers , bright-reds and purples attract pollinators . in fruits , the colourful skins also attract the attention of animals , which may eat the fruits and disperse the seeds . in photosynthetic tissues ( such as leaves and sometimes stems ) , anthocyanins have been shown to act as a `` sunscreen '' . they protect cells from high-light damage by absorbing blue-green and ultraviolet light . ionizing radiation can damage dna . there are some other suggestions . the red colour of leaves may camouflage leaves from herbivores blind to red wavelengths . the pigment may signal bad taste , since anthocyanin synthesis often comes with unpalatable phenolic compounds . making these pigments is done by a series of enzymes that are stuck on cell membranes .
