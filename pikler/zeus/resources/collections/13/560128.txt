South African Border War     the south african border war usually refers to the conflict that took place from 1966 to 1990 in south-west africa ( now namibia ) and angola between south africa and its allied forces on the one side and the angolan government , the south-west africa people 's organisation ( swapo ) and their allied forces on the other . the roots of the conflict can be traced back to world war i , when south africa invaded and conquered the then german south-west africa on behalf of the allied forces . in the aftermath of the war , the league of nations gave south africa a mandate to administer the territory . after world war ii , south africa refused to surrender its mandate for replacement by a united nations trusteeship agreement requiring closer international monitoring of the territory 's administration . although the south african government wanted to incorporate south-west africa into its territory , it never officially did so , although it was administered as the de-facto `` fifth province '' , with the white minority having representation in the ( whites-only ) parliament of south africa .
