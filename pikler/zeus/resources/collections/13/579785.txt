Heteronormativity     heteronormativity is the belief that there are two types of people , and each has to act in a way that is already set out for them . these types of people , or genders , are men and women . heteronormativity says that men and women make each other whole . because of this , it says that relations between people of the same gender are not as good or normal as those between men and women . a heteronormative view of the world believes that a person 's sex decides their sexuality , gender identity and gender roles . homophobia , transphobia , and heterosexism could not exist without heteronormativity . according to queer theory , societies force heteronormativity on people it does not fit , such as lgbt people , queer people , and intersex people . michael warner made the word `` heteronormativity '' popular in 1991 in one of the first books on queer theory . it came from gayle rubin 's idea of the `` sex/gender system '' and adrienne rich 's idea of `` compulsory heterosexuality . '' according to samuel a. chambers , heteronormativity shows what societies expect , demand , and allow when they consider relations between men and women to be the only normal ones .
