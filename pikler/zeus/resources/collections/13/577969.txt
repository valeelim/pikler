Ada Yonath     ada e. yonath , hebrew : עדה יונת , ( born june 22 , 1939 ) is an israeli crystallographer . she was born in the geula quarter of jerusalem . her father was a rabbi . yonath and her family moved to tel aviv after her father died . she received her bachelor 's degree in chemistry in 1962. she received her master 's degree in biochemistry in 1964. she got both degrees from the hebrew university in jerusalem . she received her ph.d. in x-ray crystallography at the weizmann institute of science in 1968. yonath made the first protein crystallography lab at the weizmann institute . her work showed the function of ribosomes . yonath worked at carnegie-mellon university and mit for several years . she stayed as weizmann institute for the rest of her career . ada yonath is an israeli chemist who made pictures of ribosomes using x-ray crystallography . ribosomes are the part of cells in the human body that put together proteins . x-ray crystallography makes pictures of molecules by bunching them into crystals . this method is only used to make models of single atoms . yonath used this methods to crystallize ribosomes although they are made of many atoms and proteins . this made her work very difficult . she returned to the weizmann institute of science in 1970. she started the first protein crystallography lab in israel . she did research at the max planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin , germany from 1979 to 1984. she began trying to make ribosomes into crystals in 1970 .
