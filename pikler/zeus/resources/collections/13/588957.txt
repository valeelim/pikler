Paradigm     in science , a paradigm is a way of thinking about a problem . the word comes from greek παράδειγμα ( `` paradeigma '' ) , `` pattern , example , sample '' from the verb παραδείκνυμι ( `` paradeiknumi '' ) , `` exhibit , represent , expose '' and that from παρά ( `` para '' ) , `` beside , beyond '' and δείκνυμι ( `` deiknumi '' ) , `` to show , to point out '' . paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject . the idea that the earth is the center of the universe , or that the earth and other planets move around the sun are examples of paradigms . one of the first modern people to use the word was georg christoph lichtenberg ( 1742-1799 ) , an 18th century mathematician and scientist . in rhetoric , paradeigma is known as a type of proof . the purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences . this illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion , however it is used to help guide them there . a personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience . it is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what ( and what not ) to spend their money on , but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals . anaximenes defined paradeigma as , `` actions that have occurred previously and are similar to , or the opposite of , those which we are now discussing . '' aristotle uses the word in a similar way , in inductive logic . usually , induction is used to get from a number of special cases to a general one . aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another .
