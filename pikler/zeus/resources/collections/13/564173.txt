Ta Moko     “ ta moko ” means tattoo art in maori . often these tattoos covered the whole face and were a symbol of rank , social status , power and prestige for the maori people . ta moko is a visual language which connects the person who has it to his “ whakapapa ” . whakapapa is the family , it ’ s the genealogical tree , so there is nothing which links religion to ta moko . ta moko symbolises identification with their origins . it is considered to be beautiful but ferocious because they have to frighten their enemies . the maori facial tattoo was used as a kind of “ identification card ” . these tattooes look like animals or geometric shapes . the most popular tattoo is “ the tortoise ” . the technique of making tattooes leaves scars . traditional tools to make ta moko are albatross bone chisels and black ink . a maori tattoo takes a lot of time to do ; generally the maori people start tattooing themselves in adolescence and they finish in adulthood . they take years to be finished . but a real ta moko is very painful . the tattoo artist removes your skin by making wide cuts with a mallet and either a turtle scale or an albatross bone . so it takes a long time and you suffer a lot .
