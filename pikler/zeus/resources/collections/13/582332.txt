Heat of combustion     heat of combustion heat of combustion ( `` δ '' h '' ° '' ) is the measure of the amount of energy released in the form of heat ( `` q '' ) when one mole of a substance is burned ( combustion ) . the production of heat means the reaction is an exothermic process and gives off energy . heat of combustion is a specialized form of reaction enthalpy because it is measured at standard conditions and is limited to one mole starting material . the ( ° ) symbol shows that the heat of combustion value is obtained at standard conditions : 25 degrees celsius ( 298.15 kelvin ) and at a constant pressure . the pressure is reported both at either one bar or at one atmosphere depending on the source . , heat of combustion is also called the enthalpy of combustion because the energy evolved from the combustion reaction results from the change in the overall enthalpy of the starting substance as it reacts completely with oxygen . the terms heat of combustion and enthalpy of combustion are used interchangeably due to the first law of thermodynamics and the relationships between heat at constant pressure ( `` q '' ) , the change in internal energy ( δu ) , and the change in enthalpy ( δh ) . ,
