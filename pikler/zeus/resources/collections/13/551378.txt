Cynthia Kenyon     cynthia jane kenyon ( born february 21 , 1954 ) is an american molecular biologist and geneticist . she does research on the genetics of aging in the model organism `` caenorhabditis elegans '' , which is a roundworm . kenyon did postdoctoral studies with nobel laureate sydney brenner at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge , england , studying the development of `` c. elegans '' . since 1986 she has been at the university of california , san francisco ( ucsf ) , as the herbert boyer distinguished professor of biochemistry and biophysics , and now as an american cancer society professor . she is also vice president of aging research at calico , a new company focused on health , well-being , and longevity . her early work led to the discovery that hox genes , known to pattern the body segments of the fruit fly `` drosophila '' , also pattern the body of `` c. elegans '' . these findings showed that hox genes were part of an ancient and fundamental metazoan patterning system . michael klass discovered that lifespan of `` c. elegans '' could be altered by mutations , but he believed the effect was due to reduced food consumption ( calorie restriction ) . later , thomas johnson showed that the 65 % life extension effect was due to the mutation itself , not calorie restriction .
