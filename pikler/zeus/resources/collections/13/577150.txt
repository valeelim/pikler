Tern     terns are seabirds in the family sternidae . they are normally found near the sea , rivers , or wetlands . they are slender , lightly built birds with long , forked tails , narrow wings , long bills , and short legs . most species are pale grey above and white below , with a contrasting black cap to the head , but some have dark plumage for part of the year . terns breed in noisy colonies and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material . marsh terns make floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats , and a few species build simple nests in trees , on cliffs or in crevices . most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight , but the marsh terns are insect-eaters , and some large terns may take small land vertebrates . many terns are long-distance migrants , and the arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal .
