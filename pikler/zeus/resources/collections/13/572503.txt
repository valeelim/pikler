Unreachable code     unreachable code is a section of code in a program that can never be executed . having unreachable code is bad because it wastes space on the disk , memory , and cpu cache . luckily , many modern compilers alert the programmer with a warning or error whenever it detects unreachable code . in this example , `` : ' ( `` will never be printed because the loop never exits .
