Leader Dynamics T2MK5     the leader t2 mk5 series weapons were chambered for the 5.56Ã—45mm nato cartridge and manufactured by leader dynamics of smithfield , nsw , australia ( 1978-1982/1983 ) . the leader was the brainchild of weapons designer charles st. george . it was originally a contender for a 5.56 mm australian military service rifle to replace the then-issued lithgow l1a1-f1 slr and colt m16a1 rifles . what was unique about this endeavor was that australia had never designed or manufactured its own commercial gas-operated semi-automatic rifle . the rifle was abandoned when the steyr aug was adopted for use by the australian military . of interest to those that study weapons , designs and evolution , the t2 used a triangular bolt-face that was similar to the winchester model 100. this was adopted because the original bolt-face was too complex and expensive to manufacture . in a case of parallel development , barrett firearms uses a similar design for the m82a1 and its bolt action guns . st. george worked for barrett at around this time but was not involved in design or engineering duties .
