Indian name     indian names , written in roman letters may use the letters for the vowels to denote different sounds than is conventional in american or british english . the sanskrit/devanagari vowels अ ( u̱nder ) , आ ( ah ) , इ ( in ) , ई ( eat ) , उ ( put ) , ऊ ( boot ) , ए ( ate ) , ऐ ( add ) , ओ ( oh - not as a diphthong ) , औ ( ogre ) , are mapped to 'a ' , 'aa ' , 'i ' , 'ee ' , 'u ' , 'oo ' , 'ae ' , 'ei ' , 'o ' , 'ou ' , in that order , in most transcriptions of indian names into english . thus ‘ ekamresh ’ is pronounced ‘ akaamrash ’ where the capitalized a ’ s represent the long ‘ a ’ ( as in the name of the letter ) and the 'aa ' has the vowel sound in 'ah ' . the short 'a ' and short 'o ' of american english are absent in indian languages and their use can often result in mispronunciation of indian names . furthermore , the letters used in english for the retroflex consonants ( t and d ) are also used to sound dentals ( as in 'math ' and 'the ' ) , especially when they occur in the beginning of a word . as an example , the india name 'dev ' would not have its first consonant pronounced as in the american name 'dave ' . similarly the name 'tarun ' would not have its first consonant sounded as in 'tom ' .
