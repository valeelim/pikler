English alphabet     the modern english alphabet is a latin alphabet of 26 letters ( each having an uppercase and a lowercase form ) – exactly the same letters that are found in the iso basic latin alphabet : the exact shape of printed letters changes depending on the typeface ( and font ) . the shape of handwritten letters can be very different from the standard printed form ( and between individuals ) , especially when written in cursive style . see the individual letter articles for information about letter shapes and origins ( follow the links on any of the uppercase letters above ) . written english uses 18 digraphs ( strings of two letters to represent just one sound ) , such as `` ch , sh , th , ph , wh , '' etc. , but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet . some traditions also call two ligatures , `` æ '' and `` œ '' , and the ampersand ( & ) part of the alphabet . the english language was first written in anglo-saxon futhorc runes , used since the 5th century . this alphabet was brought to what is now england , along with old english itself , the earliest form of the language , by anglo-saxon settlers . very few examples of this form of written old english have survived , with most of these being short writings or pieces .
