Railroad company     a railroad company or railway company is an organization that operates a railroad track or trains . the company can either be private or public . some railway companies operate both the trains and the track . in other cases , particularly in european union ( eu ) , ownership of track and train operation is run by separate companies . in the united states the railroad track system is owned by the railroad companies . in the 1800s , the federal government gave large land grants to the railroads . many countries have a national railway company that owns all track and operates all trains in the country . for example , the russian railways ( the world 's largest rail company by network size ) . other countries have many different , sometimes competing , railway companies that operate each their own lines . this is true in the united states and canada . in europe , the eu requires its members to split the railway companies into a number of different companies . usually public owned companies own the track and other public companies ( sometimes owned by regional governments ) own the train cars . franchising is then used to determine the right to operate the line for a limited time period . a number of private companies bid for the right to operate . other companies offer track and train car maintenance .
