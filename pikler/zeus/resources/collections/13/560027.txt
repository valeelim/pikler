Theory of mind     theory of mind is the ability to understand that other people have their own minds with their personal state of knowledge , their personal beliefs , wishes and intentions , and that these may differ from one 's own mind . autistic people typically show an impaired ability to recognize other people 's minds . therefore they experience difficulties with explaining and predicting other people â€™ s behaviour . this leads to problems in social communication and interaction . children on the autistic spectrum usually develop the theory of mind more slowly than other children . they have difficulties with it throughout their lives . however , autistic people 's performance on theory of mind tasks varies . for testing whether someone lacks the theory of mind , the `` sally-anne '' test is performed . the child sees the following story : sally and anne are playing . sally puts her ball into a basket and leaves the room . while sally is gone , anne moves the ball from the basket to the box . now sally returns . the question is : where will sally look for her ball ? the test is passed , if the child correctly assumes that sally will look in the basket . the test is failed if the child thinks that sally will look in the box . children below the age of four as well as older autistic children typically fail this test .
