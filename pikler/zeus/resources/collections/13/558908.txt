Partial fraction decomposition     partial fraction decomposition is taking a big algebra fraction and splitting it into a bunch of smaller fractions that are added together . partial fractions are used to get the antiderivatives of algebra fractions . in math writing , we 're turning this : formula_1 into this : formula_2 the denominators of all these fractions are factors of g ( x ) .
