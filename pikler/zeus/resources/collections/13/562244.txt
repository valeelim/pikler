Gordon Welchman     william gordon welchman ( 15 june 1906 , bristol â€“ 8 october 1985 , newburyport , massachusetts ) was a second world war codebreaker at bletchley park . he was a british mathematician , university professor , and author . after the war he moved to the us , and later took american citizenship . welchman was one of four early recruits to bletchley park ( the others being alan turing , hugh alexander and stuart milner-barry ) . they were also the four signatories to the letter to winston churchill in october 1941 , asking for more resources for the code-breaking work at bletchley park . churchill responded with one of his 'action this day ' written comments . welchman 's main work at bletchley was `` traffic analysis '' of encrypted german communications . this is , first , looking for an increase in signals . major events in warfare are signalled in advance by a huge increase in messages . second , there are standardized parts of a message , such as message origination , message destination , time/date information , and so on . these are much easier to decipher than the actual message content . welchman developed this approach . today we describe this as `` meta-data '' analysis .
