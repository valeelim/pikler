English law     english law , also called english common law , is the legal system developed in england in about 1066 and is still in use today . as a legal system it has spread to former english colonies including australia , canada , the united states and new zealand , as well as many other countries . english law is unique in that it is based on applying legal precedent ( `` stare decisis '' ) to present and future decisions made by judges . a judge must follow past legal decisions made by higher courts but not necessarily those made by lower courts . english law is not based on a constitution and there is no codification of laws . however , there are unofficial publications that provide organized lists of current laws . parliament has the power to create laws which are automatically considered valid and may not be reviewed by the courts . only parliament has the power to change a law . the first system of laws in written history is that left by the romans . considering the romans came to britain in 53 bc and left in 410 , a period of over 450 years , english historians disagree as to how much modern english law was influenced by roman civil law . written in about 602 , the law of Ã¦thelberht is the oldest example of anglo-saxon law . anglo-saxon law was based on ancient germanic law which was a system of laws based on kinship . the kinship group was responsible for the acts of their members as well as for their protection . wrongs against another were paid by weregild , a value placed on every person and piece of property . by the 10th century these had changed into a system of hundreds . no longer based on kinship , they organized themselves to protect others in the hundred and to enforce the laws . a hundredsmann was in charge of a hundred and was responsible to see that all disputes were settled .
