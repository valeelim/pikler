Theodicy     theodicy is a branch of theology that seeks to explain why a god that is seen as all-loving , all-seeing , and all-powerful allows evil to exist . the word comes from the greek words for god and judgment and so means the judgment of god . it was first made up by the german philosopher gottfried leibniz in 1710 in his work `` théodicée '' . the subject has been the focus of argument and thought for hundreds of years before that and since . theodicy tries to explain why god , who has complete free will , has the power to change anything he wants to , can see all the evil in the world and is all-loving and compassionate , yet does nothing to alleviate the suffering in the world , especially the suffering of innocents . the weakness of the arguments for theodicy are often used by atheists to emphasise the problems that go with the belief in god . there are many arguments to try and explain evil ; here is an incomplete list : - the argument of the 'greater good ' . god has a plan for the world which is unfolding as it should ; this involves some suffering at the hands of evil for the arrival at a destination for the greater good of all . this is also called the ultimate harmony theodicy .
