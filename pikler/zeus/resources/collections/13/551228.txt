Rapamycin     rapamycin , also known as sirolimus , is a compound produced by the bacterium `` streptomyces hygroscopicus '' . it is used in medicine to prevent organ transplant rejection . it has immunosuppressant functions in humans and is especially useful in preventing the rejection of kidney transplants . it inhibits activation of t cells and b cells by reducing the production of interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) . sirolimus is also used as a coating for coronary stents . rapamycin was first shown to extend lifespan in eukaryotes ( actually , yeast cells ) in 2006. in a 2009 study , the lifespans of mice fed rapamycin were increased between 28 and 38 % from the beginning of treatment . that is a 9 to 14 % increased maximum lifespan . the treatment began in mice aged 20 months , the equivalent of 60 human years . later , rapamycin has been shown to extend mouse lifespan in several separate experiments . it is now being tested for this purpose on nonhuman primates ( the marmoset monkey ) . a study on dogs is also planned . because rapamycin at high doses can suppress the immune system , people taking rapamycin for transplant or cancer therapy are more susceptible to dangerous infections .
