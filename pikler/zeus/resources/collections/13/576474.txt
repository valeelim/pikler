Symsyn     symsyn is a simple syntax programming language and real time multitasking runtime environment . named for its simple syntax , symsyn is based on free pascal , which is based on pascal , developed by niklaus wirth and named in honor of the french mathematician , philosopher and physicist blaise pascal . symsyn has a simple syntax and short learning curve . it provides access to functionality found in more sophisticated languages , such as the free version of the pascal programming language , free pascal . the language 's primitives , or basics , are pascal procedures which , in some cases , access the free pascal run time library . these primitives provide the normal testing , arithmetic , move , and string handling capabilities as well as the following additions : - inter program synchronization and data passing . - bit manipulation , or changing . - des encryption instructions . - re assignable instruction opcodes , or lower level codes to inhibit reverse engineering , or determination of source code from compiled code .
