Turkification     turkification was the process of turning a culturally , linguistically , or ethnically non-turkish area into a cultural , linguistic , or turkish area . turkification was sometimes voluntary and sometimes forced . turkey was once the home to many different ethnic groups before the arrival of the turks . among these groups were greeks , kurds , armenians , and many more . these groups had been subjected to centuries of cultural assimilation . however , under mustafa kemal ataturk , these groups were subjected to a second wave of forced turkification , this time targeting their languages . turkification partially explains why turkish culture is a mixture of western , islamic , and shamanistic cultures .
