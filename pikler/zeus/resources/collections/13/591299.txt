Division of Korea     the division of korea between north and south korea happened because of the allied victory in world war ii in 1945. after japan surrendered , the allies made japan give up all the colonies they took through military force , even those before wwii started . even though korea was a colony of japan before wwii , japan still had to give it up because it used military force to take it over . so after 35 years , korea no longer became a colony of the empire of japan . however , on the same day japan surrendered , thesoviet union invaded korea , after having occupied northeast china . the united states and the soviet union occupied the country , meaning they had their military there , with the border between their zones of control along the 38th parallel , or the land on the korean peninsula from east to west 38 degrees north . with the rise of the cold war , negotiations between the united states and the soviet union failed to create an independent , unified korea . in 1948 , the elections led by the un were held only in the southern part of korea , which was occupied by the united states . this led to the creation of the republic of korea in south korea , which was afterwards followed by the creation of the democratic people 's republic of korea in north korea . the united states supported the south , and the soviet union supported the north , and each government claimed sovereignty , or the right to rule itself , over the whole korean peninsula .
