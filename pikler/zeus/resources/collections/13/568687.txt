Nomen dubium     a nomen dubium is latin for `` doubtful name '' ( plural nomina dubia ) . it is a scientific name in zoology which is of unknown or doubtful use . with a `` nomen dubium '' it may be impossible to decide whether a specimen belongs to that group or not . this may happen if the original type specimen is lost or destroyed . the zoological and botanical codes allow for a new type specimen , or neotype , to be chosen in this case . a name may also be considered a `` nomen dubium '' if its name-bearing type is fragmentary or lacking important diagnostic features . this is often the case for species known only as fossils . to preserve stability of names , the international code of zoological nomenclature allows a new type specimen , or neotype , to be chosen for a `` nomen dubium '' in this case . it is one of a number of terms which are used in biological taxonomy .
