Sabre     the sabre ( british english ) or saber ( american english ; see spelling differences ) is a type of backsword . it has a curved blade associated with the light cavalry of the early modern and napoleonic periods . it was first associated with central european cavalry , such as the hussars . it became widespread in europe during the thirty years ' war . in particular the croat light cavalry helped spread it . in the 17th century a light sabre was also used by infantry . in the 19th century sabres without curved blades became common . these could be used by heavy cavalry . the last sabre to be given to us cavalry was the patton sabre ( model 1913 cavalry sabre ) in 1913. the sabre was used as a duelling weapon in fencing in the 19th century . this has led to the rise of sabre fencing , which first appeared at the 1896 summer olympics . this discipline allows for cuts as well as thrusts , as did the historical sabre .
