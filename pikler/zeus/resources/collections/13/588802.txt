Cerebral infarction     a cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain . the lack of oxygen due to the low blood supply causes an ischemic stroke that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time . the blockage can be due to a thrombus , an embolus or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries . which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected ( infarcted ) . these varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes . about one third will prove fatal .
