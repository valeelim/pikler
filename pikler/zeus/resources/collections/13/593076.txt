Collateral adjective     a collateral adjective is an adjective whose word origin is different from the noun it represents . english uses many collateral adjectives from french , latin , and greek , since much of its own vocabulary came from these languages . for example , the adjective form of `` horse '' , which is a native english word , is `` equine '' , which is borrowed from the latin word `` equus '' of the same meaning . so `` equine '' is a collateral adjective of `` horse '' . when describing a science describing the study of horse , one would call it equine science . the collateral adjective of `` moon '' is `` lunar '' , which comes from the latin word `` luna '' . instead of calling it the `` moon calendar '' , it is called the `` lunar calendar '' . sometimes collateral adjectives can exist alongside derived adjectives , or adjectives formed from the same noun it describes . for example , while `` father '' has the denomial adjective `` fatherly '' , it also has the collateral adjective `` paternal '' , which comes from the latin word `` pater '' , which means also `` father '' .
