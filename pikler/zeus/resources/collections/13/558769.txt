Parabolic trough     a parabolic trough is similar to a solar panel tower , because it has parabolic mirrors that collect large amounts of heat which is reflected on water-filled pipes . the water is heated until it turns into steam , rotating a turbine using a large steam piston . the rotating turbine produces electricity , which is then transferred by transformer , before being converted dc to ac and transferred by current lines . see also . - solar panels
