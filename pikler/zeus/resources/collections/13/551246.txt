Turning movement     a turning movement , also called a wide envelopment is a maneuver designed to pass around the enemy 's front to strike a vital part of the enemy 's rear . it is a military tactic where a command is divided into two parts . the first part holds the enemy from the front while the other part moves around to attack the enemy 's rear or flank . unlike an envelopment or a flanking maneuver , the two forces operate beyond the distance where they could usually support each other . it is often easier for an enemy force to avoid an envelopment than it is to avoid a turning movement . to counter a turning movement , the enemy must either abandon their position or turn to meet the new threat . the turning movement is a variation of the envelopment tactic . another difference is that the turning movement often seeks to `` avoid '' enemy contact until they are deep in the enemy 's rear . faced with a new threat in his rear area , the enemy is `` turned '' out of his defensive position and forced to act . an early example of a turning movement was by julius caesar in 48 bc . one of napoleon i of france 's favorite tactics was the `` strategy of indirect approach '' or the turning movement . one corps of his army would hold the enemy 's attention while the main force would move behind the enemy in a wide circle . ideally he would use the terrain to hide the turning movement . he used this to great effect during his 1805 ulm campaign . he repeated his success with this tactic at the battle of jenaâ€“auerstedt in 1806 , and at the battle of friedland in 1807 .
