Kenneth I of Scotland     kenneth i or `` cináed mac ailpín '' was king of the picts and scots . he was known for combining them into one kingdom named scotland , although some records show it was the other way round and donald ii named them scotland . his legacy lives on in many tales but these can be attributed to kenneth ii , a later scottish monarch . he was also king of dal riata and his father was king of dal riata . not much is known about kenneth 's birth except he was born around 810 in iona , argyllshire and was the son of king alpin ii of dalriada , a land which covered modern day northern ireland and the hebrides - argyll . upon his fathers death in 839 he became king of dalriada styled `` cinaed , son of alpin '' and also king of scots due to the fact that the hebrides - argyll were important parts of the land at the time . at this time the picts were conquered by vikings with bridei vi of pictland being defeated , and kenneth was set to become the next monarch . although it was n't until 843 he became king of the now united pictish & scottish tribes . there has also been some evidence he did not become king until 848 although it is pretty unclearnd historically .
