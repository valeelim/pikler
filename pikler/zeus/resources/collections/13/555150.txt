Tinnitus masker     a tinnitus masker is an electronic device that produces noise at low levels and is used by those experiencing tinnitus to cover up the ringing or other sounds they are hearing . many people who experience tinnitus also have hearing loss and are able to use a hearing aid that also acts as a tinnitus masker . these devices will usually need to be customised by an audiologist to ensure that the masking noise used brings relief to the user as tinnitus is experienced differently by everyone . tinnitus is experienced differently by everyone . it can be occasional or constant , can come as different sounds and can be loud or soft . how loud it is ( the sensation level ) compared to other noise in the environment is an important factor when setting the sound generator . the level of noise produced by a sound generator depends on the sensation level of tinnitus experienced and can be close to this level of this noise or even louder . the purpose of this is to cover up the tinnitus sounds by having a constant noise playing in the background . noise produced by a tinnitus masker , which is called white noise , is designed to be calming and less irritating than tinnitus sounds . tinnitus maskers are not actually eliminating tinnitus or reducing it but provide a distraction to cover it up for those experiencing it .
