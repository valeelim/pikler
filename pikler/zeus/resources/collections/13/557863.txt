United States Life-Saving Service     the united states life-saving service ( uslss ) was a united states government agency that grew out of concerns for saving the lives of shipwrecked sailors and ship 's passengers . the federal life-saving service was established on june 28 , 1848 as an agency of the united states department of the treasury . in 1915 , the uslss merged with the united states revenue cutter service to form the united states coast guard . large areas of the atlantic coast of the united states were relatively unpopulated during the 18th and 19th centuries . any ship that ran aground , even within sight of land , could not expect much help . even if people saw a ship in trouble they did not have organizations or the equipment to go out and rescue those who were in trouble . even in places like new york harbor ships could run aground on sandbars during storms and not have anyone to help them . in a storm a ship caught on a sandbar could be broken into pieces in just hours . some survivors might be able to swim to shore , but in winter they could die from hypothermia before anyone might find and help them . an example was the american sailing ship `` mexico '' . in 1837 it ran aground on the new jersey coast and before anyone knew of the wreck , all 112 passengers had died .
