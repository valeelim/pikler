Feigned retreat     a feigned retreat is a military tactic where a force will pretend to be defeated , fake a retreat , then while they are being pursued , turn and ambush the enemy . it can be used to cause confusion in the enemy ranks or to force some to leave and weaken their battle formations . battlefield commanders have had to use this tactic carefully so the feigned retreat did not become a real retreat . it was a tactic used in ancient history and is still being used today . sun tzu wrote about it in his book `` the art of war '' . he warned his readers : `` when some are seen advancing and some retreating , it is a lure . '' in history . - at the battle of salamis in 480 bc , the ancient greeks were fighting a sea battle with the more numerous persian navy . themistocles , the greek leader leaked information that was taken back to the persians that the greeks were ready to flee and if they acted right away they could claim a huge victory . while not an actual feigned retreat but more a rumored one , it worked just as well . the persians were defeated .
