Eulerâ€“Mascheroni constant     the euler-mascheroni constant is a number that appears in analysis and number theory . it first appeared in the work of swiss mathematician leonhard euler in the early 18th century . it is usually represented with the greek letter , formula_1 , although euler used the letters c and o instead . it is not known yet whether the number is irrational ( which would mean that it can not be written as a fraction with an integer numerator and denominator ) and/or transcendental ( which would mean that it is not the solution of a polynomial with integer coefficients ) . the numerical value of formula_1 is about formula_3 . italian mathematician lorenzo mascheroni also worked with the number , and tried , unsuccessfully , to approximate the number to 32 decimal places , making mistakes on five digits . it is significant because it links the divergent harmonic series with the natural logarithm . it is given by the limiting difference between the natural logarithm and the harmonic series :
