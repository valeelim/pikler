Cantor's diagonal argument    cantor 's diagonal argument cantor 's diagonal argument is a mathematical method to prove that two infinite sets have the same cardinality . cantor published articles on it in 1877 , 1891 and 1899. his first proof of the diagonal argument was published in 1890 in the journal of the german mathematical society ( deutsche mathematiker-vereinigung ) . according to cantor , two sets have the same cardinality , `` if it is possible to associate an element from the second set to each element of the first set , and to associate an element of the first set to each element of the second set '' . this statement works well for sets with a finite number of elements . it is less intuitive for sets with an infinite number of elements . the example below uses two of the simplest infinite sets , that of natural numbers , and that of positive fractions . the idea is to show that both of these sets , formula_1 and formula_2 have the same cardinality . first , the fractions are aligned in an array , as follows : next , the numbers are counted , as shown . fractions which can be simplified are left out :
