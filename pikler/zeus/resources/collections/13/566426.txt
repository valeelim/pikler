Bermuda rig     a bermuda rig , also called a marconi rig , is a fore-and-aft rig that uses a triangular mainsail . the sail is usually attached to a boom at its foot . it has a number of variations . due to the physics of the wind , the tall thin sails of the bermudian rigs have more power sailing into the wind than other types . this is why it is such a popular rig with modern sailboats . it was called a marconi rig after the inventor guglielmo marconi because its system of mast stays that looked like the early wireless masts . however , the name bermuda rig was in use two centuries earlier . it came from the late 1600s when european sailors noticed how well the small sloops in bermuda worked . it was developed in bermuda in the 17th century . it was based on the leg-of-mutton sail . the strong gusty winds around the bermuda islands made sailing around the waters difficult to navigate . the prevailing winds came out of the west which lined up with the islands . in addition , the number of reefs around the islands required caution . most other sail designs did not address these issues .
