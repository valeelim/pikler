I Zw 36     i zwicky 36 ( often abbreviated like i zw 36 ) is a galaxy blue compact dwarf . the stars that more abound in i zwicky 36 are of which can consider young , in stellar terms , with ages underneath of the three millions . the i zw 36 ( ≈z⊙/14 ) was studied by means of the space telescope hubble obtaining images in the wavelength of the rays go near . previous images `` in '' the length uv near of the spectrum obtained by means of the `` pre-cost faint object camera '' —foc by his acronyms ( in english ) — . colectaron data of the `` near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer '' —nicmos , by his acronyms ( in english ) — . whereas with the `` foc '' evidenciaron hot and massive stars , the data of the `` nicmos '' provide a census of the cold stars , of intermediate and low masses . there are indications that there was activity of stellar training before the events that drove to his clasificacioón like galaxy compact blue dwarf/wolf-rayet . the detection of luminous and asymptotic branches of stars , precise that these have formed several million years backwards . the branches of giant red indicate stars of at least 1-2 gigaaños .
