Open bolt     a semi or fully automatic firearm is said to fire from an open bolt if , when ready to fire , the bolt and working parts are held to the rear . when the trigger is pulled the bolt goes forward , feeding a round from the magazine into the chamber and firing it . like any other self-loading design without an external power supply , the action is cycled by the energy of the shot ; this sends the bolt back to the rear , ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot ( or continuing forward again , if the trigger is held down and the weapon is an automatic ) . generally , an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons ( except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs ) . firearms using advanced primer ignition blowback inherently fire from open bolt only .
