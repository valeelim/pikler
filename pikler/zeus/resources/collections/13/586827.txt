Taliban insurgency     after the war in afghanistan in 2001 , the taliban started an insurgency , which is known as the taliban insurgency . the taliban started to attack the forces of isaf and nato , in afghanistan , and committed terrorist attacks . al-quaeda is lnked to these attacks . with this , the conflict in the region spread to pakistan . the related conflict in pakistan is known as war in north-west pakistan today . iin the conflict , the taliban fight against the afghan government and its allies . because afghanistan has seen a number of conflicts and wars in recent decades , its economy has changed , and many people depend on growing cash crops , such as poppy seeds which are used to produce illegal drugs such as opium , or heroin . many people do not think the problems are caused by the taliban . resolving the problem will therefore probably more effort than winning against the taliban . it will also mean that there need to be changes in the economy , and the way in which the country is run . currently , afghanistan is one of the biggest producers of opium . while opium also has its uses as a regular drug , it is mainly used as an illegal drug . in 2001 , afghanistan produced only 11 % of the world 's opium , today it produces over ninety percent . in 2007 , 93 % of the `` non-pharmaceutical-grade '' opiates on the world market originated in afghanistan . this amounts to an export value of about $ 4 billion ; opium farmers earn about a quarter of this amount , the rest goes to district officials , insurgents , warlords , and drug traffickers . the drug trade accounts for half of afghanistan 's gdp .
