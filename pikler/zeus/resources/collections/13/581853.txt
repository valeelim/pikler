Caradoc     knight of the round table . he was raised as the son of caradoc the elder , the king of nates . his mother had an affair with a sorcerer named eliavres who was his real father . during a beheading game he chopped off his opponents head . the corpse replaced the head and explained that he was caradoc ’ s biological father . humiliated , he took his father and locked him in a tower . while attempting to escape , the wizard caused a serpent to entwine itself around his sons arm . a witch persuaded eliaures , who was a magician , to cause the snake to attach itself to caradoc 's arm , sucking his blood . his friend cador saved his life by putting his sister guimer in a vat of milk and caradoc in a vat of sour wine . this induced the snake to cross from one vat to the other , giving cador the chance to kill it with his sword . the attack caused caradoc ’ s arm to “ shrivel away ” and became known as breifbras ( little-arm ) . later in life he married guignier . due to caradoc ’ s mother ’ s infidelity , he was very paranoid and made his wife go through a chastity test while they were both in camelot . she passed with flying colors and the two were given the city of cirencester as a reward .
