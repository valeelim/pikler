Pig iron     pig iron is iron with a high carbon content . pig iron is made by smelting iron ore into ingot form , in a blast furnace . it â€™ s called pig iron because when being cast , each ingot being cast looks like a piglet suckling milk from a sow . ancient egyptians , greeks , and chinese knew about pig iron , and were producing it as early as 1100bc . pig iron is refined into wrought iron by melting it and blowing hot air through it . pig iron can also be turned into gray iron . originally , pig iron was poured out the bottom of the furnace and shipped to a steel mill for processing . now , we turn the metal into pellets before shipping it .
