Moors murders     the moors murders were carried out by ian brady and myra hindley between july 1963 and october 1965 , in and around what is now greater manchester , england . the victims were five children aged between 10 and 17. they were pauline reade , john kilbride , keith bennett , lesley ann downey and edward evans . at least four of whom were sexually assaulted . the murders are so named because two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on saddleworth moor ; a third grave was discovered on the moor in 1987 , more than 20 years after brady and hindley 's trial in 1966. the body of a fourth victim , keith bennett , is also suspected to be buried there , but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered . the police were initially aware of only three killings , those of edward evans , lesley ann downey and john kilbride . the investigation was reopened in 1985 , after brady was reported in the press as having confessed to the murders of pauline reade and keith bennett . brady and hindley were taken separately to saddleworth moor to assist the police in their search for the graves , both by then having confessed to the additional murders .
