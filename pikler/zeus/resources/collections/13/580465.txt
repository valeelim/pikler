Win–loss record (pitching)    win–loss record ( pitching ) in baseball , a win–loss record shows the number of games that a pitcher has won and the number of games he has lost . in each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the `` winning pitcher '' ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the `` losing pitcher '' ) . these pitchers are known as the pitchers of record . the awarding of a win or a loss for a pitcher is known as a `` decision '' , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision in each game . a starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have `` no decision '' . in certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win .
