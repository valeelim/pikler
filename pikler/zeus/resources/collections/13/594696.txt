Binding energy     a binding energy is the negative potential energy ( `` i.e . `` , energy debt ) pulling a bound system together . conversely , an unbinding energy is the positive actual energy required to disassemble a bound system into separate parts . a bound system has a more negative potential energy than the sum of its parts ; this is what pulls the system together in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle . from the law of conservation of energy , it follows that positive energy is borrowed into actuality upon the creation of a bound ( `` i.e . `` , energetically indebted ) state . this positive actual energy tends to unbind the system and must be radiated away for the system to become bound by the negative potential energy . because of the massâ€“energy equivalence , the negative potential energy has a negative inertial mass ( `` i.e . `` , a negative resistance to acceleration ) , so that it self-accelerates to an infinite speed , and , in accordance with relativity theory , exerts its attraction from the future .
