Forestay     on a sailing vessel , a forestay , sometimes called a jibstay , or a headstay , is a piece of standing rigging . it keeps a mast from falling backwards . it is usually attached to the very top of the mast . the other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat . often a sail is attached to the forestay . this sail may be a jib or a genoa . in a cutter rig , the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the forestay , perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit . the sail on the forestay is then referred to as the staysail . a forestay might be made from stainless steel wire or rod .
