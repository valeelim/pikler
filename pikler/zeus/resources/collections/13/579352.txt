Monterchi     a place were all could live in freedom . a place where all were equal . that place does n't exist . i never heard of this place . it was during the renaissance , that 's all i know . “ there is no such thing as a `` broken family . '' family is family , and is not determined by marriage certificates , divorce papers , and adoption documents . families are made in the heart . the only time family becomes null is when those ties in the heart are cut . if you cut those ties , those people are not your family . if you make those ties , those people are your family . and if you hate those ties , those people will still be your family because whatever you hate will always be with you. ” ― c. joybell c .
