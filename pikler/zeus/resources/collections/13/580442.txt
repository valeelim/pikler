11D-Supergravity     as in three spaces of space , there may be three which fold over it in dimensions of time , i.e. , the space-time continuum . as space and time are collapsed over itself , so may also the membrane or matrix that divide into four dimensions that include the dark matter , dark fluid , dark energy , and gravity ( that `` incompensate '' material which holds together the known physical universe ) . that continuous motion above explaining that of the 11th dimension supergravity , or best equated as a dimension subsistent in the core of derivatives composing those effort upon space-time-dark nature fulfilling the potential notion towards supergravity within a string or m-theory of 11 dimensions .
