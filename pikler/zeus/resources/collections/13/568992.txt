Ouija board     the ouija ( pronounced wee-jee or wee-jah ) is a game board supposedly used to talk to the dead . it is designed to be a fun activity based on self-deception . they are also called `` spirit boards '' or `` talking boards . it is a flat board with the numbers 0-9 and all the letters of the alphabet . it has the words `` yes '' and `` no '' at the top with the word `` goodbye '' on the bottom . the board uses a planchette , which is a small wooden plank in the shape of an upside down heart . it has a glass circle ( or plain hole ) in the top . the player asks a question . then one or more players guide the planchette to the letters or numbers to spell out a message . however , scientists know the game is based on the ideomotor effect . a participant believes they are not controlling the message , that it comes from ghosts or spirits . it can seem very mysterious . but anyone can test a ouija board by blindfolding or hiding the board from the ones moving the planchette . what usually results is gibberish and no message .
