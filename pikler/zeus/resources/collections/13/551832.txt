Red herring     a red herring is something that misleads or distracts from an issue . there are two ways in which it is used . it may be used as logical fallacy during an argument or as literary device that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion , for example in detective mystery books . it has long been thought that the phrase came from kippers ( a strong-smelling smoked fish ) to train dogs to follow a scent , or to divert them from the correct route when hunting ; however , modern research suggests that the term was probably invented in 1807 by english polemicist william cobbett , referring to one occasion on which he had supposedly used a kipper to divert dogs from chasing a hare , and that hunters never actually used kippers to train dogs . the phrase was later borrowed to provide a formal name for the logical fallacy and literary device .
