Immaculate Conception     the immaculate conception is the catholic doctrine which says that mary , the mother of jesus , was conceived in the womb of her mother , saint anne , without original sin . the catholic church teaches this because they believe that jesus , as god , had to be conceived in a mother whose soul was without any kind of sin , since god does not like sin . the immaculate conception became official catholic teaching in 1854 , announced by pope pius ix . four years later , people claimed that mary appeared to a girl named bernadette in lourdes , france , and that mary told bernadette : `` i am the immaculate conception . '' the immaculate conception does not mean the conception of jesus in the womb of his mother mary . this is correctly called the incarnation .
