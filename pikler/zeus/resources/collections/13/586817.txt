Heat death of the universe     the idea of the heat death of the universe , proposed in 1851 by william thomson , stems from the second law of thermodynamics , which states that heat tends to pass from hotter to colder bodies and eventually becomes uniformly distributed . as an elementary particle of matter ( such as a proton ) self‑gravitationally shrinks , its heat becomes intensified ( `` augmented '' ) to a higher temperature and then radiated away into the ambient vacuum : although mechanical energy is indestructible , there is a universal tendency to its dissipation , which produces throughout the system a gradual augmentation and diffusion of heat , cessation of motion and exhaustion of the potential energy of the material universe . initially , the universe has the maximal ( `` i.e . `` , zero ) potential energy , and the minimal ( `` i.e . `` , zero ) actual energy . such a universe is in a state of heat death and exists as a uniform blanket of zero-temperature heat . according to the second law of thermodynamics , heat tends to pass from hotter to colder bodies . so , when a portion of the zero‑temperature heat self‑gravitationally shrinks to a nonzero temperature , a half of the resultant nonzero‑temperature heat becomes radiated into the colder ambient vacuum , at which moment the particle of nonzero‑temperature heat undergoes self‑gravitational shrinkage to a still higher temperature . thus the temperature difference between the self‑gravitationally shrinking particle and the ambient vacuum increases , which increases the rate of heat loss and thereby accelerates the particle 's self‑gravitational shrinkage :
