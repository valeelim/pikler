Sago     sago is a starch extracted from the spongy centre , or pith , of various tropical palm stems , especially that of `` metroxylon sagu '' . it is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of new guinea and the moluccas , where it is called `` saksak '' , `` rabia '' and `` sagu '' . the largest supply of sago comes from southeast asia , particularly indonesia and malaysia . large quantities of sago are sent to europe and north america for cooking purposes . it is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms , such as rolled into balls , mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste ( papeda ) , or as a pancake . sago is often produced commercially in the form of `` pearls '' ( small rounded starch aggregates , partly gelatinized by heating ) . sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding . sago pearls are similar in appearance as the pearled starches of other origin , e.g . cassava starch ( tapioca ) and potato starch , and they may be used interchangeably in some dishes .
