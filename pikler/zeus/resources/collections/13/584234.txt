Franksgiving     in 1939 , president franklin d. roosevelt moved thanksgiving one week earlier than normal , believing that doing so would help bolster retail sales during one of the final years of the great depression . this led to much upheaval and protest , causing some to deride the holiday as franksgiving . thanksgiving ( after 1941 ) takes place on the fourth thursday of november .
