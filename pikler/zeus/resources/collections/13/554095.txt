Ataxia     ataxia is trouble with balance that is not caused by a person 's muscles being weak . instead , ataxia is caused by a neurological problem . ataxia is not a diagnosis . it is a neurological sign . it is a sign of damage to the parts of the nervous system that control balance . there are three different types of ataxia . each type has many possible causes . cerebellar ataxia is ataxia that is caused by a problem with a person 's cerebellum . the cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination . it makes the body move smoothly and controls movements like walking . people with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble with actions like these : - controlling how hard their muscles contract , how fast , and in what direction - getting their muscles to work together ( asynergy ) - walking ( gait abnormality ) - moving their eyes - swallowing ( dysphagia ) - saying words ( dysarthria ) - judging how far away something is ( dysmetria ) - reacting quickly sensory ataxia is caused by the loss of proprioception ( knowing where parts of the body are ) . it is usually caused by damage to the parts of the spinal cord that carry information about proprioception to the brain . however , it can also be caused by damage to the parts of the brain that receive that information ( the cerebellum , the thalamus , and the parietal lobes of the brain ) .
