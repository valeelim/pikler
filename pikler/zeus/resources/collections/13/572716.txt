Pyruvic acid     pyruvic acid is the simplest of the keto acids , with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group . pyruvate , the conjugate base , is an important part of several metabolic chemical reactions . pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry . pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis . one molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate . these are then used to give more energy to living animals , plants and microorganisms . it is then changed back to carbohydrates ( such as glucose ) by a metabolic chemical reaction named gluconeogenesis , or to fatty acids through a similar reaction . it can also be used to make the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid by fermentation . pyruvic acid gives energy to cells through the citric acid cycle , when oxygen is present ( aerobic respiration ) , and also makes lactate when oxygen is lacking ( fermentation ) .
