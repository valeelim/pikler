Decisive victory     the term decisive victory refers to a military victory that decides a matter or a conflict . a decisive victory has to result in a positive outcome for the victor and create a condition of peace between the two warring states . by comparison , an inconclusive victory is one in which one side won , but the issues between them are not resolved . a desirable goal for all armies fighting conventional wars is a quick and decisive victory with few casualties . for example , in the six-day war that started on 5 june 1967 , the israel defense forces ( idf ) achieved a decisive victory over the combined armies of egypt , syria and jordan . this established israel as a superpower in the middle east with about six years of peace . during the cold war ( 1947-1991 ) the idea of a decisive victory ( or any victory ) seemed obsolete . instead , the theory of limited war seemed more practical in the age of nuclear weapons as it would not escalate into a full-scale war that would result in mutual assured destruction .
