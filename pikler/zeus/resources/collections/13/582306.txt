Differential scanning calorimeter     differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) , is an analysis tool widely used in materials sciences , thermochemistry , drug purity and food quality testing . its speed and ease of operation give instant information about the thermodynamic characteristics that play an important role in understanding complex processes during the formation of substances ; for instance , polymer cross-linking , heat exchange due to folding and unfolding of proteins or formation mechanism of single or double stranded dna . the dsc was firstly invented in 1960 by e.s . watson and m.j. o â€™ neil and made available to the market in 1936 at the `` analytical chemistry and applied spectroscopy '' conference held in pittsburgh . the two most common types of differential scanning calorimeter , are `` heat flux dsc '' , which operates by keeping the heat supply to the system as constant and `` power-compensated dsc '' , which works by maintaining the power supplied to the calorimeter as constant . in general , a dsc calculates heat changes by measuring the temperature difference between the sample and reference holder . the typical design of the `` heat flux dsc '' can be seen from figure 1. it contains the `` sample holder '' , where the material of interest is placed , and the `` reference holder '' , which is generally kept empty . both of these are placed on a `` support '' , which is in good contact with the `` walls '' of calorimeter . the `` heating resistor '' is attached to the boundary walls that enables one to obtain a furnace generating and keeping the required heat amount inside the enclosure . the `` thermocouple '' connected to both sample and reference holder is a measuring device that gives the temperature to be used in the analysis . heat supplied by the `` heating resistor '' flows further into the sample and the reference materials chambers .
