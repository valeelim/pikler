Windows on Windows     with computers , windows on windows ( often shortened to wow , ) is a compatibility layer of x86 versions of the microsoft windows nt family of operating systems that allows many legacy 16-bit programs run that were made for windows 3.x or before to run . wow allows many 16-bit windows programs to run without changes on newer 32-bit versions of windows . this was made to give software developers time to make their software 32-bit while people moved from windows 3.1x to windows 95 , so the os can be upgraded to a newer version while running most , or all of , a customer 's 16-bit programs . windows 9x operating systems , which were made on top of dos , had both 16 and 32-bit systems , so if it kept those 16-bit parts , the os could run 16-bit software without emulation . nt-based versions are very different in how they run , so they need a more sophisticated solution . there are two main techniques to let 16-bit programs run on 32-bit versions of windows ( with some limitations ) called thunking and shimming .
