Infobot     infobot is a perl irc bot , first written in 1995 by kevin lenzo . the bot 's main goal was to remember urls and associate them with a name , so if someone needed a specific web address they could ask the bot . for this reason , the first infobot , in the # macintosh channel in the efnet irc network , had the nickname 'url ' . the main project is now inactive , many forks from the original program were made , some of which are still active . many of these forks carry extra features .
