The Room (film)    the room ( film ) the room is a 2003 american independent romantic drama film starring , written , directed , and produced by tommy wiseau . the film is mainly about a love affair where a banker named johnny ( played by wiseau ) , is cheated on by his future wife lisa ( juliette danielle ) , with his best friend mark ( greg sestero ) . the movie is considered by many to be the worst film ever made , but is enjoyed by a cult audience for its odd story structure , having bad acting and being funny , although mostly not on purpose . a lot of the film brings up unrelated subplots that do not get solved . most of these have at least one supporting character . there is also confusion about why the film is called `` the room '' , but wiseau says he named it that because a room in a house is where lots of good and bad things take place .
