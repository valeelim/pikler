Wakinosaurus     wakinosaurus ( meaning `` wakino lizard '' ) is a dubious genus of theropod dinosaur . it is named from the find of `` a single tooth '' .‭ ‬the genus is dubious ( doubtful ) because it is almost impossible to assign further fossil material to it . the find was made in lower cretaceous deposits in fukuoka , japan in 1990 by masahiro sato . the triangular-shaped tooth has fine serrations on its cutting edge , which is standard for a theropod dinosaur .
