New7Wonders of the World     new7wonders of the world ( 2000–2007 ) was an idea to choose new wonders of the world from a selection of 200 existing monuments . the popularity poll was led by canadian-swiss bernard weber and organized by the new7wonders foundation in zürich , switzerland . winners were announced on 7 july 2007 in lisbon . the foundation took only private donations and the sale of broadcast advertising . it had no public funding or taxpayers ' money . after the final announcement , new7wonders said it did not make money and barely recovered its investment . the program caused different reactions from countries and organisations . some countries praised their finalist and tried to get more people to vote for it . others criticized the contest or did not think it was very important . in the beginning , unesco helped the new7wonders foundation by giving advice on nominee selection . then they decided they could not continue to help . saying they have to give equal status to all world heritage sites , they dropped out of the program in 2001 and again in 2007 .
