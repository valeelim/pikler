Saint Lawrence Seaway     the saint lawrence seaway is a navigable waterway in north america . it is long and allows marine vessels to go from the atlantic ocean to all of the great lakes . most of it is in canada , but a small part of it is in the united states . it gets its name from the saint lawrence river , the river which goes from lake ontario to the gulf of saint lawrence . before the seaway was built , there was no way for boats and ships to get around the rapids and dams on the saint lawrence river , and over niagara falls , the waterfalls on the niagara river between lake ontario and lake erie . in the early 20th century , the governments of both canada and the u.s. saw that the cities near the great lakes could grow and become an important part of the economy of both countries . there were people in both countries who did not want the seaway to be built , but the project went ahead . in 1954 , construction began on a system of canals from montreal in the east to port colborne in the west . it included 15 locks where the water level changes , and several places where electricity could be made from the flow of water . the project also involved making the welland canal bigger so that large ships can pass through it .
