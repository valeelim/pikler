Brig     a brig is a sailing ship with two square-rigged masts . during the age of sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable . they were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . even after the sailing age ended they were used as training ships . the brig was one of the smaller two-masted sailing ships . they popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size . they were also difficult to sail into the wind . they are not to be confused with a brigantine , which has different rigging ( a brigantine has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail ) . a brig is different from a three-masted ship because it only has two masts . in sailing , a full-rigged brig is a vessel with two square rigged masts ( called the fore and main ) . the main mast of a brig is the aft ( rear ) one . to improve maneuverability , the mainmast carries a small ( gaff rigged ) fore-and-aft sail .
