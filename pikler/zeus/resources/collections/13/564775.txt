Fentanyl     fentanyl ( sometimes spelled fentanil ) is a synthetic opioid that is used as a analgesic ( painkiller ) . it also acts as a sedative . it has a short duration of action and a rapid onset . the two most common forms are patches that are put on the skin , and an intravenous solution . paul janssen developed fentanyl in 1960. fentanyl is about 120 times as potent as morphine ; this means , much less fentanyl is needed to get the same effect . the effects of the intravenous solution can be seen after three to five minutes . in about twelve hours , the concentration in the bloodstream will have halved . fentanyl is also used as a recreational drug . this has led to thousands of overdose deaths each year from 2000 to 2015. deaths have also resulted from improper medical use . fentanyl has a relatively wide therapeutic index ( 270 ) which makes it a very safe surgical anesthetic when monitored carefully . because it is so potent , finding the right dose to use requires great care : fentanyl comes as a highly diluted solution . there is also a powder , but its use is impractical without advanced scientific equipment : the effective dose needed and a lethal dose of fentanyl powder placed next to each other would be difficult or impossible to differentiate with the naked eye .
