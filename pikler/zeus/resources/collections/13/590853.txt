SIR model     the sir model is a simple mathematical model of epidemics . an epidemic is when the number of people infected with a disease is increasing in a population . s , i , and r stand for : below is a graph of a solved sir model . the bottom ( x ) axis is time and the left ( y ) axis is population , or the number of people . blue represents the number of susceptible people . at the beginning of the epidemic , the number of susceptible ( blue ) people decreases as the number of infected ( green ) people increases . gradually the number of recovered ( red ) people increases . in this particular model , after the epidemic is over , all of the people have been infected and recovered . this is not always the case ; sometimes some susceptible people remain uninfected . this model is also missing some elements , such as the creation of new susceptible people by being born , and the removal of susceptible , infected , and recovered people who die . in addition , this model does not work well for every disease . it works well where people recover from a disease and become immune , such as measles . not all infectious disease follow this pattern . for instance , people who are infected with hiv never recover and there is no vaccine , so there is no group of recovered people , only susceptible and infected people . there is also the case where people recover from a disease but do not become immune or lose their immunity over time . for instance , when people get the flu , they are generally only immune for a short time before they become susceptible again .
