Mandate of Heaven     the mandate of heaven ( 天命 ) was a chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify the rule of the emperor of china . according to this belief , heaven ( 天 , `` tian '' ) stands for the natural order and will of the universe . heaven will give a mandate to a just ruler , the son of heaven . if a ruler was overthrown , this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy , and had lost the mandate . it was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven 's displeasure with the ruler , so there would often be revolts after major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the mandate of heaven had been withdrawn . the mandate of heaven does not require a legitimate ruler to be of noble birth , and dynasties such as the han and ming dynasties were founded by men of common origins . the mandate of heaven had no time limitations , depending instead on the just and able performance of the rulers and their heirs . the concept is in some ways similar to the european concept of the divine right of kings ; however , unlike the european concept , it does not confer an unconditional right to rule . the concept of mandate of heaven also included the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler . chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler . throughout chinese history , times of poverty and natural disasters were often taken as signs that heaven considered the current ruler unjust and in need of replacement . the mandate of heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in china as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler .
