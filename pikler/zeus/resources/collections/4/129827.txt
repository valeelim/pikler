IWork     iwork is a suite of programs created by apple inc. , containing pages , a word processing and desktop publishing program , keynote , a presentation package and numbers , a spreadsheet program . although iwork is called `` a successor to appleworks '' by apple , it does not have the functions of appleworks 's database and drawing tools . also , it does not compete directly with the mac version of microsoft office , but instead offers tools with a different focus ( presentation , rather than analysis ) at a lower price . it is made to integrate with other applications from apple 's ilife suite . although ilife comes free on every mac , iwork is sold separately . a free 30-day trial of iwork was given with every new mac ( up through february of 2008â€”as of march 2008 , but now the iwork trial is available only as a download ) , and with copies of ilife . iwork '05 was launched on january 11 , 2005 and had the new version 2 of keynote and the first release of pages . before it was released , what would become iwork was said to be an add-on , upgrade , or new release of appleworks .
