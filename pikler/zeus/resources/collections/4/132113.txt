Hernando de Soto (economist)    hernando de soto ( economist ) hernando de soto ( born june 2 , 1941 in lima ) is an economist from peru . he has become known for what he wrote and said on the informal economy and property rights . in his books , de soto says that an economy can not go past the stage of a subsistence economy if there is not a formal system of owning property ( land or goods ) . developing countries have `` informal ownership '' since no formal certificate says that land or goods really belong to a certain person . de soto thinks the capitalist economies of the united states developed because they had a clear system of owning property . for the united states , the formal system of owning property came from it being a colony of england . japan 's formal system came after the second world war . because formal ownership systems do not exist in developing countries , the poor people in these nations can not develop . they can not use their land as a guarantee to the bank to get money to build something , for example . de soto argues that this is the basis for enterpreneurship . in much of the developing world , famers therefore are left with subsistence agriculture . as such , he argues that this informal ownership should be made formal , for example by giving squatters in shanty towns land titles to the land they now live on .
