Bolt action     a bolt action gun has a breech ( back part of the barrel ) that is opened and closed by hand with a small handle . they can only be fired once before the breech must be opened for a new round to enter the chamber , where it can then be fired from . many older sniper rifles , as well as many hunting rifles today , work in this way . when the bolt is opened , the first cartridge in the gun is loaded . after firing the gun , opening the bolt takes out the empty cartridge , and closing the bolt puts in a new one . bolt action rifles are usually the most accurate type of small arms , leading them to be used more widely than probably any other type of marksman rifle . the rifle wo n't cycle a round without the shooter doing it manually , causing less movement of parts and gases while the round is being fired . this puts accuracy at the very least excellent , but also increasing recoil over automatic rifles of the same caliber . despite being significantly slower to fire than lever-action rifles , which were invented around the same time , militaries across the world chose to replace the muzzleloading musket with bolt action guns over level action ones because bolt action rifles are loaded over the barrel . this makes it easy to load without throwing off the shooter 's aim when he or she is laying on the ground . with lever action guns , on the other hand , the ground is in the way of loading downwards , and to load the gun would mean to throw off the shooter 's aim .
