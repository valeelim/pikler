Martin Heidegger     martin heidegger ( 26 september 1889 â€“ 26 may 1976 ) was a german philosopher . his best known book , `` being and time '' , is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century . it is a very difficult book , even for the german reader . in it , and later works , heidegger maintained that our way of questioning defines our nature . but philosophy , western civilization 's chief way of questioning , has lost its way . finding ourselves `` always already '' fallen in a world of presuppositions , we lose touch with what being was before its truth became `` muddled '' . as a solution to this condition , heidegger advocated a return to practical life in the world , allowing it to reveal , or `` unconceal '' itself .
