Command economy     a command economy , or a planned economy , is where the big decisions are made at the centre by the government . in an economic system the main decisions are , for example , allocating resources like labour , capital and oil . prices , too , are controlled . in a command economy , these decisions are taken by a central body , usually the government . this system contrasts that of a market economy where all the economic actors involved take decisions . the benefit of a planned economy is that the planning body has ( supposedly ) perfect information , and can make a better decision than in the market economy . countries at war sometimes command their people to make things the war needs . friedrick von hayek , a 20th-century economist , pointed out that it is not possible for the planning body to have perfect information . for this reason , the decisions taken by this body will be wrong , as it is not possible to foresee all possible events . once the decision has been taken there is only a small margin to vary the production ; this means that a planned economy can not adapt to a change as rapidly as a market economy . according to ludwig von mises , there is no competition , and there are no reasons to innovate or to look for different solutions to a problem , in a planned economy .
