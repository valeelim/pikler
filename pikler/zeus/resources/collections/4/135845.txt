Pseudoephedrine     pseudoephedrine ( commonly abbreviated as pse ) is a decongestant . the salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter drugs either as single-ingredient preparations , or more commonly in combination with antihistamines , paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) and/or ibuprofen . sudafed is a trademark for a common brand which contains pseudoephedrine hydrochloride , though sudafed pe does not . unlike antihistamines , which modify the systemic histamine-mediated allergic response , pseudoephedrine only relieves nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies . the advantage of oral pseudoephedrine over topical nasal preparations , such as oxymetazoline , is that it does not cause rebound congestion ( rhinitis medicamentosa ) ; however , it is more likely to cause adverse effects including high blood pressure . some countries started to replace pseudoephedrine by other drugs , such as phenylephrine . the reason for this is that pseudoephedrine can be used to make methamphetamine , which is an illegal drug .
