Blowfish (cipher)    blowfish ( cipher ) in cryptography , blowfish is a keyed , symmetric block cipher , made in 1993 by bruce schneier and since 1993 has been included ( put together ) in a large number of encryption products . blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found . however , the aes block cipher algorithm now has more attention . schneier made blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm , to be used as a replacement for the old des algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms . at the time blowfish was released , many other algorithms were proprietary , or were secrets . schneier has said that , `` blowfish is unpatented , and will remain so in all countries . the algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain , and can be freely used by anyone . '' main features of the design include key-dependent s-boxes and a very complex key schedule . blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people , except when changing keys . each new key needs to be pre-processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text , which is very slow compared to other block ciphers . this stops its use in certain applications ( such as in the smallest embedded systems like the early smartcards ) , but it is not a problem in other applications . in one of the applications , it is actually good : the password-hashing method used in openbsd uses an algorithm that comes from blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule ; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks . `` see '' key strengthening .
