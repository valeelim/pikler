Pawn (chess)    pawn ( chess ) the pawn ( ♙♟ ) is the weakest piece in the game of chess . they represent foot soldiers . each player starts the game with eight pawns , one on each square of the second row ( or rank ) from the view of the player . in the white pawns start on a2 , b2 , c2 , ... , h2 , while the black pawns start on a7 , b7 , c7 , ... , h7 . pawns move differently than other pieces . unlike all the other pieces , pawns can not move backwards . most of the time , a pawn moves by going up a single square , but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place , it can go forward two squares . pawns may not use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture . any piece in front of a pawn , white or black , stops its moving . the white pawn at e4 can capture either the black rook at d5 or the black knight at f5 , but not the bishop at e5 , which blocks its straight way forward . unlike other pieces , the pawn does not capture in the same way as it moves . a pawn captures diagonally , one square forward and to the left or right . in the diagram to the left , the white pawn can capture either the black rook or the black knight .
