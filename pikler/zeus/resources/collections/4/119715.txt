Stromatolite     stromatolites are special rock-like structures . they usually form in shallow water . they are formed by bacteria such as cyanobacteria . there may also be other types of bacteria and single-celled algae . the mucus secreted by the bacteria collects grains of sediment , and they are stuck together with calcium carbonate , also from the bacteria . this builds up into the structures seen in certain sea-shore bays . cyanobacteria use water , carbon dioxide , and sunlight to create their food , and put out oxygen as a by-product . the real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest fossil evidence of life on earth . the oldest stromatolites are dated to 3,450 million years ago , during the archaean eon . the ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic photosynthesis is highly significant . early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primaeval earth 's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis . they were the first known organisms to photosynthesis and produce free oxygen . after about a billion years , the effect of this photosynthesis began to a huge change in the atmosphere . the process , called the great oxygenation event , actually took a long time . eventually , it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen , and led to the kinds of environment we know today , where most organisms use and need oxygen .
