Fibre Channel     fibre channel , or fc is an architecture ( and a set of protocols to attach disk drives to computers , like in a storage area network . networks today are done with 4 gbit/s and 8 gbit/s over fiberglass cables . this is enough to support data transfer rates of up to 800 mbit/s . fibrechannel permits connecting the same disk subsystem to several computers . basically , there are two `` topologies '' ( ways to do this ) : - `` arbitrated loop '' : all the devices are connected in a logical bus topology ( shown on the right in the picture above ) . the devices can be connected in a ring much like token ring . this avoids using the fibre channel switches , which are very expensive . - `` fabric '' all devices are connected to fibre channel switches . this is similar to ethernet . it is more expensive though , because switches that support fibre channel are very expensive .
