Supercomputer     a supercomputer is a computer with great speed and memory . this kind of computer can do jobs faster than any other computer of its generation . they are usually thousands of times faster than ordinary personal computers made at that time . supercomputers can do arithmetic jobs very fast , so they are used for weather forecasting , code-breaking , genetic analysis and other jobs that need many calculations . when new computers of all classes become more powerful , new ordinary computers are made with powers that only supercomputers had in the past , while new supercomputers continue to outclass them . electrical engineers make supercomputers that link many thousands of microprocessors . supercomputer types include : shared memory , distributed memory and array . supercomputers with shared memory are developed by using a parallel computing and pipelining concept . supercomputers with distributed memory consist of many ( about 100~10000 ) nodes . cray series of crayreserch and vp 2400/40 , necÏùò sx-3 of hucis are shared memory types . ncube 3 , ipsc/860 , ap 1000 , ncr 3700 , paragon xp/s , cm-5 are distributed memory types .
