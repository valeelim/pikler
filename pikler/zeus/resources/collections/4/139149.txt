Interrupt latency     in realtime operating systems ( rtos ) , interrupt latency is the time between the generation of an interrupt by a device ( or a peripheral ) and servicing the device which generated the interrupt . for many operating systems ( os ) , the os code is programmed so that devices are serviced as soon as the device 's interrupt handler is executed . interrupt latency depends on the cpu , interrupt controllers , interrupt masking , and the operating system 's ( os ) `` interrupt handling methods '' .
