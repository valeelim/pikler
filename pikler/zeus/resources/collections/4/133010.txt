Heraclitus     heraclitus of ephesus or herakleitos ( about 535â€“ 475 bc ) was a pre-socratic greek philosopher . he was a native of ephesus , ionia , on the coast of asia minor . his teaching , as we have it now , is a series of epigrams . that is , sayings and remarks , rather than systematic essays . heraclitus is famous for his doctrine of change being central to the universe . his famous sayings , `` all is flux '' , and `` you can not step twice into the same river '' is still remembered today . another of his sayings appeals to some psychologists : - `` you can not discover the depths of the psyche , even if you travelled every road to do so , such is the depth of its meaning '' . often it is difficult to understand what he saying . he believed in the unity of opposites , stating that `` the path up and down are one and the same '' . his utterance that `` all things come to be in accordance with this `` logos '' , '' ( literally , `` word , '' `` reason , '' or `` account '' ) has been the subject of many interpretations . - `` good and bad are the same '' . in many of these 'opposite ends ' pairs , if the one never happened , then the other would be meaningless .
