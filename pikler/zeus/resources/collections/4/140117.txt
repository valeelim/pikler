European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo     the european union rule of law mission in kosovo also called eulex kosovo is a contract between the european union and kosovo . with this , certain states of the european union will send police forces as well as lawyers to help make kosovo more secure . this is what was agreed by the ahtisaari plan . the idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in kosovo , as planned under united nations security council resolution 1244. russia and serbia see this mission as illegal . the plan is to have 2.000 police force and lawyers on the ground . the mission started to deploy its forces on 16 february 2008. currently only 400 of the some 1,900 police officers and judges foreseen by the eulex mission are in place . the european council agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 december 2007. because of the unstable political climate , this force was later increased to 2000 people . primarily this was done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with serbia . the force is made up mainly of police officers . some of the officers have received training on how to control rioting crowds . some people of the force are prosecutors and judges . because the force is so big , there will soon be the most eu civil servants doing their job there , rather than in brussels . chief of the mission is yves de kermabon , who is accountable to the european union special representative in kosovo , pieter feith . the mission is expected to cost â‚¬165 million in its first year .
