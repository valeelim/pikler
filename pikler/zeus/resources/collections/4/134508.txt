Agorism     agorism is an anarcho-capitalist political philosophy founded by samuel edward konkin iii that believes the ultimate goal as bringing about a society in which all `` relations between people are voluntary exchangesâ€“ a free market . '' the term comes from the greek word `` agora , '' referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient greek city-states . agorist theory divides people into two classes : people who make their living through the market , and people who make their living by coercing others ( called the `` economic class '' and `` political class '' , respectively ) . they support a nonviolent overthrow of the second class by the first , through peaceful black market and gray market activity , known as counter-economics .
