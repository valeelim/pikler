Genetic algorithm     a genetic algorithm is an algorithm that imitates the process of natural selection . natural selection is a central concept of evolution : some organisms have traits that will make it more likely that the organism survives long enough to reproduce . that way , it is likely that these traits will be passed on to the next generation . this has also been called survival of the fittest . genetic algorithms are often used to find solutions for optimization and search problems . genetic algorithms are part of the broader class of evolutionary algorithms . genetic algorithms imitate the same mechanisms as those found in nature , that is to say inheritance , mutation , selection and crossover . the concept of genetic algorithms is a search technique often used in computer science to find complex , non-obvious solutions to algorithmic optimisation and search problems . genetic algorithms are categorised as global search heuristics , and can be used in many ways , particularly in generating useful artificial intelligence agents in computer games .
