Lungfish     lungfish are members of the subclass dipnoi . they are a sister group to the coelacanths and to the early lobe-finned fish which gave rise to the tetrapods . all these fish have paired appendages , fins or limbs , attached to a pelvis or shoulder by means of a single bone , the femur or humerus . the living members of the group are special freshwater fish . they are the only living fish that have both lungs , as well as gills . they need this because they live in small lakes and rivers that sometimes dry up . when this happens , these fish do n't die , but they can survive in the mud , for up to 4 years . they use their lungs during this time . this is called aestivation , which is a type of dormancy . currently there 8 species of lungfish , 6 of them in africa , one in south america and one in australia .
