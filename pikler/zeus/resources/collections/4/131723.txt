Hieronymus Bosch     hieronymus bosch , ( born jeroen anthonissen van aken , c. 1450 â€“ 9 august 1516 ) was an early dutch painter . he lived , worked and died in 's-hertogenbosch , a dutch town . this was then the capital of the duchy of brabant , a region which included much of modern belgium and holland . many of his works depict temptation , sin and punishment in hell . the paintings have a dreamlike surreal quality , with sexual and sadistic images . the intent was probably serious , to warn of the punishment which awaited sinners in hell . the paintings often look like , and certainly did influence , the modern art movement known as surrealism . bosch used images of demons , half-human animals and machines , to evoke fear and confusion , and to portray the evil of man . his works contain complex , highly original , imaginative , and dense use of symbolic figures and iconography , some of which was obscure even in his own time . today only 25 paintings are known to be by him ; philip ii of spain collected some of the best , which are now in the prado museum , madrid .
