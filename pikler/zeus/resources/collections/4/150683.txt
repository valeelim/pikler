Ambulocetus     ambulocetus ( `` walking whale '' ) was an early amphibious cetacean . it could walk as well as swim . `` ambulocetus natans '' lived from the early eocene ( 50 to 48 million years ago ) . its fossils have been found in pakistan . when the animal was alive , pakistan was a coastal region of india , which was then a large island in the indian ocean . it looked like a 3-meter ( 10-foot ) long mammalian crocodile . it was clearly amphibious : its back legs are better adapted for swimming than for walking on land , and it probably swam by undulating its back vertically , as otters and whales do . ambulocetids may have hunted like crocodiles , lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting prey . chemical analysis of its teeth shows that it was able to move between salt and fresh water . `` ambulocetus '' did not have external ears . to detect prey on land , they may have lowered their heads to the ground and felt for vibrations . scientists consider `` ambulocetus '' to be an early whale because it shares underwater adaptations with them . it had an adaptation in the nose that enabled it to swallow underwater , and its periotic bones had a structure like those of whales , enabling it to hear well underwater . in addition , its teeth are similar to those of early cetaceans .
