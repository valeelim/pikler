Digital signature     a digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of asymmetric cryptography . for messages sent through an insecure channel , a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender , and trust the message . digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects ; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type . digital signature are implemented using cryptography . digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement , meaning that the signer can not successfully claim they did not sign a message , while also claiming their private key remains secret ; digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures , a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature , but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures . in some countries , including the united states , and in the european union , electronic signatures may have legal significance .
