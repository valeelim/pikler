Register renaming     in computer engineering , register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions . programs are composed of instructions which operate on values . the instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another . a typical instruction might say , add x and y and put the result in z. in this instruction , x , y , and z are the names of storage locations . in order to have a compact instruction encoding , most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named . for example , the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers , x86-64 has 16 , many riscs have 32 , and ia-64 has 128. in smaller processors , the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a register file . different instructions may take different amounts of time ( e.g. , cisc architecture ) . for instance , a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from main memory instruction is in progress . shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first , thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order . out-of-order execution has been used in most recent high-performance cpus to achieve some of their speed gains .
