ITS 90     the its 90 is the international temperature scale , published in the year 1990. it mainly is a set of fixed temperatures and instructions how to realise a practical temperature scale , being as close to the thermodynamical temperature scale as current knowledge allows . the first international temperature scale was established in 1927. an improved version came in 1948. in 1968 the ipts 68 was issued . note the letter p , which stands for practical . in 1975 the very low side of the scale ( below 1 kelvin ) was added . since 1990 the its 90 is in use . a list of fixed temperatures is given . this list has been produced by national laboratories from all over the world . it has been approved by the b.i.p.m . ( bureau internationale des poids et mesure ) in paris . temperatures between the fixed points can be measured , using a platinum resistance thermometer ( up to 660 Â°c ) . this thermometer , however , has to be calibrated first . this is being done at a number of fixed temperatures , covering the desired range . procedures and formulae for defining an interpolating thermometer are given as well .
