British Rail Class 50     the british rail ( br ) class 50 is a diesel locomotive built from 1967-68 by english electric at their vulcan foundry works in newton-le-willows . fifty of these locomotives were built to haul express passenger trains on the , then non-electrified , section of the west coast main line between crewe , carlisle and scotland . they were originally hired from english electric leasings , not being purchased outright by br until around 1973. under the pre-1968 classification system these locomotives were known as the english electric type 4. the class were affectionately nicknamed `` hoovers '' by rail enthusiasts because of their distinctive engine sound , caused by the centrifugal air filters originally fitted . these proved unreliable , and were later removed , but the `` hoover '' nickname stuck .
