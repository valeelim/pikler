First Fleet     the first fleet is the name given to the 11 ships which sailed from great britain on 13 may 1787 , to start the first european colony in new south wales . it was the beginning of a plan to transport thousands of prisoners to australia to make convict settlements . the fleet was led by captain arthur phillip . this journey lasted eight months , and used a route across the oceans that had only been used three times ; once by abel tasman and twice by james cook . the 1700s were a period of great change in europe , and especially in england . there was an industrial revolution . this was a time when many machines were being invented for use in large factories . with machines now doing the ordinary tasks of men , people were left without jobs and wages . this made it very difficult to survive . men , women and even children resorted to theft in order to live . with the rise of machines , farmers were also forced to move to the city to look for jobs . as a result , london had become very overcrowded , and so had the prisons . in fact , prisons had become so overcrowded that convicts had been relegated to hulks ( floating prisons ) .
