Product cipher     in cryptography , a product cipher is a popular type of stream ciphers that works by executing in sequence a number of simple transformations such as substitution , permutation , and modular arithmetic . product ciphers usually consist of iterations of several `` rounds '' of the same algorithm . while individual `` rounds '' are not themselves secure , it is hoped that a sufficiently long chain of `` rounds '' would load the cipher with sufficient confusion and diffusion properties as to make it resistant to cryptanalysis . a product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a sp-network . feistel ciphers are another important class of product ciphers .
