Trivium (liberal arts)    trivium ( liberal arts ) the word trivium , from latin , is made of two parts . the first part `` tres '' meant `` three '' and the second part `` v√≠a '' meant `` way '' . in antiquity and the high middle ages , there were different ways of teaching young men at the university . the trivium was three simplest ways to study the world , and so young men learned them first . after the trivium , they studied the quadrivium . together , these subjects were called the seven liberal arts . the most difficult , and final subject studied was theology . the three subjects were related to talking about the world . these subjects were grammar , logic and rhetoric . they were ways of preparing for the quadrivium , which includes arithmetic , geometry , music and astronomy . one way of studying the world is to look at the form of the words . grammar is the mechanics of the language . when a man studied grammar , he studied how words were put together , and how words were combined to make sentences , paragraphs , chapters , and stories . the word `` grammar '' has a more limited meaning now than it did before now . many subjects , such as syntax and phonetics were part of grammar .
