Ciphertext-only attack     in cryptography , a ciphertext-only attack ( coa ) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts . the attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced ( extracted ) or , even better , the key . the ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success . every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks . the process of selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise . on the other hand , poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection ; for this reason , many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use . examples include : - early versions of microsoft 's pptp virtual private network software used the same rc4 key for the sender and the receiver ( later versions solved this problem but may still have other problems ) . in any case where a stream cipher like rc4 is used twice with the same key , it is open to ciphertext-only attack .
