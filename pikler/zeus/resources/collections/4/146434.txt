Hydrofoil     a hydrofoil is a type of boat that can lift its hull out of the water with a pair of special wings underwater . these wings are like the wings of an airplane . when a hydrofoil moves quickly , its wings allow it to fly . when this happens the boat is said to be in `` foilborne '' . the result of flying means less of the boat is touching the water and can make the boat have less drag which allows it to move faster ( drag slows a boat down ) . or special pontoons when going fast keep it out of the water . other websites . - the international hydrofoil society - classic fast ferries magazine - kawasaki jetfoil - rodriquez cantieri navali - soviet-made hydrofoils - swiss experimental hydrofoils
