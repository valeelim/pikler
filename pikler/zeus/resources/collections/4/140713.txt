Cynic     the cynics ( , ) were an important group of philosophers from the ancient school of cynicism . their philosophy taught that the purpose of life was to live a life of virtue in agreement with nature . this meant rejecting all the usual desires for wealth , power , health , and fame , and by living a life free from all possessions . people are reasoning creatures . they could therefore gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans . they believed that the world belonged equally to everyone , and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society . many of these thoughts were later absorbed into stoicism . the first philosopher to outline these themes was antisthenes , who had been a pupil of socrates in the late 5th century bce . he was followed by diogenes of sinope , who lived in a tub on the streets of athens , took cynicism to its logical extremes , and came to be seen as the archetypal cynic philosopher . he was followed by crates of thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of cynic poverty in athens . cynicism spread with the rise of imperial rome in the 1st century , and cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire . it finally disappeared in the late 5th century , although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early christians .
