Cavity magnetron     the cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that makes microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field . the 'resonant ' cavity magnetron type of the earlier magnetron tube was invented by john randall and harry boot in 1940. the high power of pulses from the cavity magnetron made centimetre-band radar practical . shorter wavelength radars allowed the finding of smaller objects . the small cavity magnetron tube made the size of radar sets much smaller so that they could be put into in aircraft and ships used to find submarines . at present , cavity magnetrons are commonly used in microwave ovens and in various radar applications .
