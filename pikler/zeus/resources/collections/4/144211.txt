Rhea (bird)    rhea ( bird ) the rheas are flightless birds of the genus `` rhea '' , native to south america . they are ratites , which means they are large flightless birds with no keel to their breastbone or sternum . the greater or american rhea ( also called the 'nandu ' ) is a large , flightless bird from forests of south america . this ratite is the largest bird in the americas . it is a fast runner ; and when it runs , its neck is almost horizontal to the ground . rheas congregate in flocks of 20 to 30 birds . the lesser or darwin 's rhea , `` rhea pennata '' , is mostly found in the southern part of south america . rheas eat mostly plants , fruits , seeds , and nuts , but also will also eat insects and other small animals ( like lizards ) . the female rhea lays 12-30 yellow-cream eggs in a clutch . the male digs the nest ( a simple scrape in the ground ) , incubates the eggs ( for 6 weeks ) , and raises the chicks . rheas are mature at 2 years of age . it was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group , which evolved together in gondwana in the upper cretaceous . then they evolved in their separate ways as gondwana split up , and the parts drifted apart . the parts became the modern southern continents , plus africa and the indian subcontinent .
