Amborella     amborella trichopoda is a small , evergreen , deciduous shrub . it occurs only in the moist , shaded understory of montane forests on the south pacific island of new caledonia . the genus is the only member of the family amborellaceae and contains only this single species . `` amborella '' is of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses put it at or near the base of the flowering plant lineage . since `` amborella '' is apparently basal among the flowering plants , the features of early flowering plants can be inferred . this is done by comparing derived traits shared by other angiosperms but not present in `` amborella '' . these traits are assumed to have evolved after the divergence of the `` amborella '' lineage . the amborellaceae are a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on ( about 130 million years ago ) from all the other living species of flowering plants . among living flowering plants , it is the sister group to all other flowering plants .
