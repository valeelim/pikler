RLC circuit     a circuit containing resistance ( r ) , inductance ( l ) , and capacitance ( c ) is called an rlc circuit . a simple circuit only has one rlc series . with a resistance `` r '' present , the total electromagnetic energy `` u '' of the circuit ( the sum of the electric energy and magnetic energy ) is no longer constant . instead , it decreases with time as energy is transferred to thermal energy in the resistance . because of this loss of energy , the oscillations of charge , current and potential difference continuously decrease in amplitude , and the oscillations are said to be damped . they are damped in exactly the same way as those of the damped block-spring oscillator . to analyze the oscillations of this circuit , an equation can be written for the total electromagnetic energy formula_1 in the circuit at any instant . this is because the resistance does not store electromagnetic energy . however , this total energy decreases as energy is transferred to thermal energy . where the minus sign indicates that formula_1 decreases . by differentiating eq . 1 with respect to time and then substituting the result in eq . 2 , the following is obtained :
