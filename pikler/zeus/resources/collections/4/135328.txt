Power loom     the term power loom , corresponds to a mechanized loom powered by a driveshaft . the first `` power loom '' was designed in 1784 by edmund cartwright and first built in 1785 , later to be perfected by william horrocks . it allowed textile making to be done far faster than if a human had done the same work . by 1850 , over 250,000 of cartwright 's designs were used in england . james henry northrop invented the automatic `` weft replenishment '' loom . it revolutionized the weaving industry . some 700,000 `` northrop '' automatic looms were sold worldwide . originally , power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across , but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use . today , advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material . the most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms . computer-driven looms are now also available to individual home weavers .
