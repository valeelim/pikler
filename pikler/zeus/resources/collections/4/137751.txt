Alternative hip hop     alternative hip hop is a form of hip hop music that is very different from gangsta rap , crunk , and snap . a way to explain it would be that if `` regular hip hop '' was on the middle of a number line , gangsta rap , crunk , and snap would be on one side , and alternative hip hop would be on the other . even though it is a form of hip hop , fans of alternative hip hop tend to also be fans of horrorcore more than `` regular hip hop '' or especially r & b . alternative hip hop originally came from the united states , and some artists like gorillaz sprang up from the united kingdom . examples of american alternative hip hop artists are talib kweli , mos def , ( and the band they started together , black star ) , common , nas , kanye west , a tribe called quest , jurassic 5 , and styles of beyond . it started as a movement-of-sorts from hip hop artists against the `` tasteless '' hip hop that was popular in the 1990s .
