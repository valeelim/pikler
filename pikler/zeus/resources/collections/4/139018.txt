Furby     a furby ( plural furbys or furbies , according to tiger . co. ) is a popular electronic toy or robot , more specifically , a hamster/owl-like creature made by tiger electronics , which went through a time of being the `` must-have '' toy following its launch in the winter holiday season of 1998 , with continuing sales until 2000. furbies sold 1.8 million units in 1998 , 14 million units in 1999 , and altogether in its three years of original production , furby sold over 40 million units , and its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages . a video game of the furbies was released in 1998 by hasbro interactive with many activities . furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a programmed robot . in 2005 , new furbies were released , with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements , among many other changes and improvements . there was a common mistake that they repeated words that were said around them . this belief most likely came from the fact that it is possible to have the furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words . as a result of this myth , several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices .
