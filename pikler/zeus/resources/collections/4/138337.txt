Cryptosystem     there are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem . - one is used by the cryptographic community . - the other is a general meaning which is how the word cryptosystem is understood by the public . in this meaning , the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand , or as an abbreviation for `` cryptographic system '' . a cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography . such systems include for instance , a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures , cryptographic hash functions , key management techniques , and so on . in this meaning , a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption . typically , a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms : 1. key generation algorithm . 1. encryption algorithm . 1. decryption algorithm . the term `` cipher '' ( sometimes `` cypher '' ) is often used to refer to a pair of ( encryption/decryption ) algorithms . therefore , the term `` cryptosystem '' is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important . for this reason , the term `` cryptosystem '' is commonly used to refer to public key techniques ; however both `` cipher '' and `` cryptosystem '' are used for symmetric key techniques .
