Sophism     sophism can mean two very different things . in ancient greece , sophism was practiced by `` sophists '' , who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric . in the modern definition , a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone . the word `` sophism '' originated from the greek word σόφισμα , `` sophisma '' ( from σοφίζω , `` sophizo '' meaning `` i am wise '' ) . the similar greek word σοφιστής , `` sophistēs '' means `` wise-ist , one who does wisdom , one who makes a business out of wisdom '' while σοφός , `` sophós '' means a `` wise man '' . the ancient greek philosopher protagoras ( ca . 490–420 bc ) is often said to be the first of the sophists . others include : gorgias , prodicus , hippias , thrasymachus , lycophron , callicles , antiphon , and cratylus . plato opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the truth and justice . in modern usage , `` sophism '' , `` sophist '' , and `` sophistry '' are derogatory terms , due the influence of many philosophers in the past . sophism and platonism were rival schools , as enemies of each other .
