Gray whale     the gray whale ( `` eschrichtius robustus '' ) is a baleen whale ( a filter feeder ) that has a layer of blubber up to 10 inches ( 25 cm ) thick . because a mother gray whale would defend her calf so fiercely it would actually attack whalers and overturn their boats , whalers often called the gray whale a devilfish . the gray whale migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods . gray whales are very agile swimmers . they can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet ( 155 m ) deep . gray whales make grunts , clicks , and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales . this giant cetacean eats small fish , crustaceans , squid , and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor . it sieves its food through its comb-like plates of baleen . compared to most baleen whales , gray whales are rather small , growing to be only about 45 feet long . they are easy to see with their gray color , which is actually more charcoal black than it is gray . gray whales have lots of barnacles and lice on their skin . however , scientists say the lice and barnacles do not harm the whale , and it is possible they may actually `` help '' the whale by feeding off of dead skin , which the whale needs to get rid of .
