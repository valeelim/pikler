Third Punic War     the third punic war ( 149 bc to 146 bc ) was the third and last of the punic wars . it was fought between the former phoenician colony of carthage , and the roman republic . the war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous punic wars , and was mostly just the romans attacking the city of carthage in the battle of carthage . the romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city , tore down the buildings , and put salt in the earth so that plants would n't be able to grow . they did this because they hated the carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them , and did n't want to fight another , so they totally destroyed them ! other websites . - delenda est carthago
