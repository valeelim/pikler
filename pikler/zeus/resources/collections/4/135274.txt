Beaufort scale     the beaufort scale is a scale for wind speeds . it is based on observation rather than accurate measurement . it is the most widely used system to measure wind speed today . the scale was developed in 1805 by francis beaufort , an officer of the royal navy and first officially used by hms beagle . there are twelve levels , plus 0 for `` no wind '' . from 1946 to 1970 , there were also beaufort levels 13 to 17. all of them were labelled as `` hurricane '' . because they were only used in special cases , they are no longer in use internationally . china and taiwan still use them , because they often have typhoons . the wave heights given are for waves on the open ocean , not near the shore . other websites . - uk meteorological office : the beaufort scale - investigating clouds , a lesson plan from the national science digital library that uses the beaufort scale . - radio interview with scott huler . - oceanweather.com gives current graphics for wind , waves and temperature - open source textbook at oceanworld.tamu.edu cites the original definition formula in chapter 4
