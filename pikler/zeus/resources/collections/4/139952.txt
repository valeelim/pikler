Group (mathematics)    group ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a group is a kind of algebraic structure . a group has a set and an operation . the group 's operation can put together any two elements of the group 's set to make a third element , also in the set . a familiar example of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operator . instead of `` an element of the group 's set '' , mathematicians usually save words . they say `` an element of the group '' . mathematicians use capital letters to stand for groups . they often use `` g '' , `` h '' , or `` k '' . they use lower-case letters to stand for group elements . to save words , they say `` '' a '' is in `` g '' to mean `` a '' is an element of `` g '' . they write group operations with symbols like • or * , or by writing two elements next to each other . so `` a '' • `` b '' , `` a '' * `` b '' , and `` ab '' '' can all mean `` the element formed when the group 's operation combines `` a '' and `` b '' '' . not every set and operation make a group . a group 's set and operation must obey some special rules . these are called group axioms . this list has each axiom twice , once in words , and once in mathematical symbols .
