Associativity     associative property is a property of mathematical operations ( like addition and multiplication ) . it means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator ( like + ) in a row , the order of operations does not matter . for example , if you have formula_1 , there are two plus signs ( + ) in a row . this means we can add it in either this order : or this order : the answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative . in other words , associativity means : not all operations are associative . subtraction is not associative , which means : this is true because : and : also , associativity is different from commutativity , which lets you move the numbers around .
