RC2     in cryptography , rc2 is a symmetric-key block cipher . designed by ronald rivest in 1987 . `` rc '' stands for `` rivest cipher '' , or alternatively , `` ron 's code '' . rc2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds . rounds are arranged as a source-heavy feistel network , with 16 rounds of one type called `` mixing rounds '' interleaved by two rounds of another type called `` mashing rounds '' . the 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence : 1. perform 5 mixing rounds . 1. perform 1 mashing round . 1. perform 6 mixing rounds . 1. perform 1 mashing round . 1. perform 5 mixing rounds . rc2 uses `` key-expansion algorithm '' by which an expanded key consisting of 64 ( 16-bit words ) is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied `` variable-length '' input key . a mixing round consists of four applications of the `` mix-up '' transformation , as shown in the diagram . a round is `` mashed '' by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key ( rfc 2268 ) .
