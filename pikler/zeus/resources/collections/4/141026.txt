Controlled language     controlled natural languages ( cnls ) are artificial languages built by simplifying the grammar and reducing the number of words in the language to avoid ambiguity or complexity . there are two types of controlled languages : some designed to help non-native speakers of a language , and some designed to enable automatic semantic analysis . the first type of languages are often called `` simplified '' or `` technical '' languages . they are used by businesses or industries to improve the quality of technical writing . the standard terms simplify the ( emi-automatic translation to other languages . examples are : the asd simplified technical english , caterpillar technical english , and ibm 's easy english . these languages guide the writer by general rules such as `` write short and simple sentences '' , `` use the person 's name ( `` john smith '' for example ) instead of saying `` him '' , and `` talk about who is doing something , rather than what is being done , unless you need to say what is being done '' . the second type of languages have well defined rules for writing and understanding . these rules can be matched to formal languages , such as first-order logic . the languages can be analysed by computer . they can be checked to see they are correct . they can be searched for information easily .
