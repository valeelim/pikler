Trans-Karakoram Tract     the trans-karakoram tract is an area of nearly 5,800 kmÂ² that , india claims , was transferred by a border agreement from the pakistani-administered northern areas to china in 1963 with the proviso that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the kashmir dispute . pakistan says that it was a no-man 's undemarcated border land , hence no question arises of its being transferred . the transfer is disputed by india which claims the tract as part of jammu and kashmir state . the tract , called shaksgam , is technically part of shigar , a valley of baltistan region of ladakh province . the raja of shigar controlled this land until 1971 , when pakistan abolished the raja government system . a polo ground in shaksgam was built by the amacha royal family of shigar , and the rajas of shigar used to invite the amirs of yarkand to play polo there . all the names of the mountains , lakes , rivers and passes are in balti/ladakhi , suggesting that this land has been part of baltistan/ladakh province for a long time .
