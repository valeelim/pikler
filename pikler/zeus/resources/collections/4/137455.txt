Mechanical energy     in physics , mechanical energy describes the potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system . when a given amount of mechanical energy is transferred ( such as when throwing a ball , lifting a box , crushing a soda can , or stirring a beverage ) it is said that this amount of mechanical work has been done . both mechanical energy and mechanical work are measured in the same units as energy in general . it is usually said that a component of a system has a certain amount of `` mechanical energy '' ( i.e . it is a state function ) , whereas `` mechanical work '' describes the amount of mechanical energy a component has gained or lost . the conservation of mechanical energy is a principle which states that under certain conditions , the total mechanical energy of a system is constant . this rule does not hold when mechanical energy is converted to other forms , such as chemical , nuclear , or electromagnetic . however , the principle of general conservation of energy is so far an unbroken rule of physics - as far as we know , energy can not be created or destroyed , only changed in form .
