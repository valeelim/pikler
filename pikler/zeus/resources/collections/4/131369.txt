'' `` hunted down '' , soundgarden 's first single , is representative of the early `` grunge '' sound â€” with its dirty guitar , dissonant atmosphere and lyrics concerning entrapment and escape . `` nothing to say '' features drop d tuning , which would become a signature of soundgarden 's sound on later albums . guitarist kim thayil said he learned about the tuning from the melvins 's buzz osborne . the original version of `` tears to forget '' appeared on the 1985 `` deep six '' compilation album , which featured some of the first recordings by the earliest seattle grunge bands , including soundgarden . that version was recorded with drummer scott sundquist , but the version on `` screaming life '' was recorded with cameron .
