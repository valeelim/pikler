Wind power     wind power is the conversion of the energy in wind into a more useful form of energy , like electricity . it is a renewable source of energy that helps to cut down on the pollution of earth 's air . wind power capacity has expanded quickly to 336 gw in june 2014 , and wind energy production was about 4 % of total worldwide electricity usage , and growing fast . wind power is widely used in european countries , and more recently in the united states and asia . in 2012 wind power accounted for approximately 30 % of electricity generation in denmark , 20 % in portugal and 18 % in spain . wind power stations use the wind to turn a turbine which turns a magnet inside a coil ( a type of generator ) . the wind has kinetic energy ( movement energy ) which is changed into mechanical energy by the blades on the turbine . the turbine then turns a generator which creates electrical energy ( voltage ) . the turbine is usually connected by a gearbox to help control the speed it turns the generator at . wind power stations have the advantage over fossil fuel power stations as they do not produce any greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or water vapour . they also do not produce gases that help make acid rain such as sulfur dioxide .
