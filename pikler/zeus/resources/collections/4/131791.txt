Flora and fauna of Pakistan     vast indus plains have had vegetation taken away to grow crops . very little wildlife lives there and only animals like the jackal , mongoose , jungle cat , civet cat , scaly anteater , desert cat and the wild hare live in these areas . parts of thal desert and cholistan desert are now being irrigated . the chinkara is the only animal living there now . the blackbuck , who lived there once in big numbers , is now extinct . however , efforts are being made to reintroduce them back into the country . irrigated forest plantations are now being made . these give very good conditions for chinkara , hog deer and blue bull to live in . the striped hyena and the wolf are found almost everywhere in the country . however , little is known about the black bear and brown bear populations . birds of prey like the peregrine , cherrug or saker falcons , tawny eagle , imperial and greater spotted eagles , osprey , awesome shikra , and the black-winged kite live throughout pakistan but their population statuses are unknown .
