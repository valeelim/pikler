British Rail Class 153     the british rail class 153 `` sprinter '' is a single-car diesel multiple unit train . in the early 1990s , british rail took the decision that running 2-car trains on rural routes was inefficient , and identified the need for single-carriage trains . initially consideration was given to splitting the met-cam class 156 units to form class 152 units , however due to various problems with the class 155 units , the decision was taken to split these units instead . work was undertaken by hunslett-barclay in kilmarnock between 1991 and 1992. the modifications included fitting a cramped cab to the b end of each carriage , making it extremely difficult to load a bicycle !
