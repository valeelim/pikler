FM Towns Marty     the fm towns marty was the world 's first 32-bit game console ( not the amiga cd32 , which was only in europe and north america ) . it was one of the first cd-based consoles and the first made for gaming rather than high-end pc-like systems , like the amiga cdtv and phillips cdi . it was only released in japan and was a commercial failure , but despite this , it was made until 1999 â€“ longer than the average games console .
