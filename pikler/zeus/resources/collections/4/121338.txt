Roman army     the roman army is the military of ancient rome , the forces used by the roman kingdom , roman republic and later roman empire . its infantry for much of its history , was the roman legion . rome also had a navy . the size of the army in the late roman empire was about 128,000 179,200 men . it was very well organized . the main roman soldiers in the empire were the legionaries . the legions were separated into centuries , made up of 80 soldiers and 20 other men who remained in the camp to cook and do other chores . other soldiers in the army were called the auxilia . auxilia were non-citizens who mainly came from the roman provinces . they were paid less than legionaries and did not usually wear armor but at the end of their service , which was a minimum of 25 years , they were given roman citizenship . the army had cavalry units called equites . their men were rich enough to have horses and more expensive weapons . being few , they were less important in battle than the infantry . the soldiers of the roman army wore helmets and body protection . in the early to mid-republican era , legionaries usually bought their own equipment . `` hastati '' , the first line of soldiers , usually had breastplates , called a `` cuirass '' , and some wore `` lorica hamata '' , or chainmail . the richer principes , the second line of soldiers , could afford `` lorica hamata '' but they were sometimes seen wearing the cheaper `` cuirasses '' . both hastati and principes were each armed with a `` gladius '' - a short , 60 centimeter ( two foot ) sword - and each had two `` pila '' - short spears .
