Lucy (Australopithecus)    lucy ( australopithecus ) lucy is the common name of al 288-1. this is a fossil discovery of about 40 % of the skeleton of a female `` australopithecus afarensis '' . there are several hundred pieces of bone . the discovery was made in 1974 at hadar in the awash valley of ethiopia 's afar depression . this discovery gave us much scientific evidence . lucy lived about 3.2 million years ago , and is a hominid . the skeleton shows that lucy had a small skull capacity , like an ape , but also that she walked upright like a human . this supported the view that bipedalism came before the increase in brain size in human evolution . those features are true of all australopithecines .
