Gynoecium     a gynoecium ( from ancient greek `` gyne '' , `` woman '' ) is the female reproductive parts of a flower . the male parts are called the androecium . some flowers have both female and male parts , and some do not . another key term is carpel . carpels are the building blocks of a pistil . the gynoecium may have one pistil or more . a pistil may have one carpel or more than one stuck together ( `` fused '' ) . carpels and pistils have three parts : a stigma at the top where the pollen lands ; a style and an ovary . in the case of a pistil , the stigma , style , and ovary may be made up of those parts of more than one carpel , fused . plant ovaries are the parts of the gynoecium which ( much like animal ovaries ) contain ovules . the style is generally stalklike . it is between the ovary at the bottom and the stigma at the top . in some plants , there are no styles in the pistils . the stigma is the pollen receptor at the top of the carpel . stigmas may be separate or they may be in a region called the `` stigmatic region '' .
