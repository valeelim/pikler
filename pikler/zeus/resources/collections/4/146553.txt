Burgess Hill     burgess hill is a town in west sussex , england , uk . it is not far from the border with east sussex . it is 38 miles ( 62 km ) south of london , 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of brighton and hove , and 29 miles ( 47 km ) east-northeast of the county town of chichester . it had a population of 28,803 at the time of the 2001 census . other nearby towns include haywards heath to the north and lewes , the county town of east sussex , to the east . burgess hill is mainly situated just on the west sussex side of the border dividing the two counties . parts of the town are across the county boundary in east sussex . although a roman road was built joining london to the south coast and passing through what is now burgess hill , there is no evidence that the romans settled in the area . from the fourteenth century or earlier the annual midsummer fair was held on this common land on 24th june and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913. with the development of the london to brighton mainline railway , however , those in the business soon realised that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways . most of the animal trading business began to revolve around rail side markets such as those at hassocks , haywards heath and lewes train stations . by the start of the 20th century , the animal trading business had all but left the burgess hill area .
