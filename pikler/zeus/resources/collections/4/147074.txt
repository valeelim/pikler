British Rail Class 56     the british rail class 56 is a type of diesel locomotive designed for heavy freight work . it is a type 5 locomotive , with a ruston-paxman power unit developing 3,250bhp ( 2,423kw ) , and has a co-co wheel arrangement . the fleet was introduced between 1976 and 1983. the first thirty locomotives ( nos.56001-56030 ) were built by electroputere in romania , but these suffered from poor construction standards , and many were withdrawn from service early . the remaining 105 locomotives were built by brel at doncaster works ( nos.56031 to 56115 ) and crewe works ( nos.56116 to 56135 ) . enthusiasts nicknamed them `` grids '' , likely due to the grid-like horn cover on the locomotive 's cab ends . the 'grid ' name was given due to the fact that class 56 locomotives were the main motive power used on merry-go-round coal deliveries to national grid power stations .
