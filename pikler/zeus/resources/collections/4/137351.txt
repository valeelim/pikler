Chosen-plaintext attack     a chosen-plaintext attack ( cpa ) is a model for cryptanalysis which assumes that the attacker can choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts . the goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme . in the worst case , a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key . modern cryptography , is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications ; for many applications , a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible . chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography , where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose . any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks ; this is a conservative approach to security . two forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished :
