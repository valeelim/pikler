George Berkeley     george berkeley ( 12 march 1685 â€“ 14 january 1753 ) , or bishop berkeley , was an irish bishop and philosopher . berkeley was one of the three 'british empiricists ' , philosophers around the late 1600s and 1700s who believed in 'empiricism ' , the philosophy that everything we learn comes through our senses . the other british empiricists included the englishman john locke and scotsman david hume . his philosophy was called `` immaterialism '' , or `` subjective idealism '' . his idealism said that all our ideas came through sensations , but our senses did n't tell us anything about the world . he said that locke 's belief in matter was wrong . he said that even though we can see , hear , taste , touch and smell , there was no way of knowing that our senses were reacting to matter , because to find out how accurate our senses were , we would need to study the very thing we use to study . instead , he said that our experiences are caused by god , a being that is also a mind , like us , and powerful enough to create all our ideas and senses .
