Client-server     in computer science , client-server is a software architecture model consisting of two parts , client systems and server systems , both communicating over a computer network or on the same computer . a client-server application is a distributed system made up of both client and server software . client server application provide a better way to share the workload.the client process always initiates a connection to the server , while the server process always waits for requests from any client . when both the client process and server process are running on the same computer , this is called a single seat setup . another type of related software architecture is known as peer-to-peer , because each host or application instance can simultaneously act as both a client and a server ( unlike centralized servers of the client-server model ) and because each has equivalent responsibilities and status . peer-to-peer architectures are often abbreviated using the acronym p2p . the client-server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request to the server , and how the server can accept these requests , process them , and return the requested information to the client . the interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagrams . sequence diagrams are standardized in the unified modeling language .
