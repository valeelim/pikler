Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet     tibet and mongolia signed a treaty called the treaty of friendship and alliance between the government of mongolia and tibet on february 2 , 1913 , at urga ( now ulaanbaatar ) . today , we are not sure if the treaty can be used or not . the qing dynasty ended in 1911. after this , both tibet and mongolia were independent . both had a lamaist head of state . the republic of china did not see them as independent . in the treaty , both mongolia and tibet said they would see each other as independent , and help each other in war . the people who signed for mongolia were foreign minister da lama ravdan and general manlaibaatar damdins√ºren . those who signed for tibet were agvan dorjiev , chijamts , and gendun-galsan , who lived in tibet . dorjiev was a buryat , a citizen of russia . for this reason , the treaty may not be legal . the 13th dalai lama denied that he had let dorjiev sign a treaty with mongolia . more importantly , neither the cleric nor the tibetan government has ever signed any treaty . the russian government said that dorjiev was russian . he could therefore not act as a diplomat for the dalai lama . the mongolian text of the treaty has been published by the mongolian academy of sciences in 1982 .
