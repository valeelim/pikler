User Datagram Protocol     the user datagram protocol ( udp ) is one of the core members of the internet protocol suite , the set of network protocols used for the internet . with udp , computer applications can send messages , sometimes known as `` datagrams '' , to other hosts on an internet protocol ( ip ) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths . udp is sometimes called the universal datagram protocol . the protocol was designed by david p. reed in 1980 and formally defined in rfc 768. udp applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications . sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission . a port is a software structure that is identified by the port number , a 16 bit integer value , allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. port 0 is reserved , but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response . ports 1 through 1023 ( hexadecimal 0x3ff ) are named `` well-known '' ports and on unix-like operating systems , binding to one of these ports requires superuser ( root ) access .
