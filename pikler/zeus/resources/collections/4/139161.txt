Context switch     a context switch is the computing process of saving and restoring the state ( context ) of a cpu such that multiple processes can share a single cpu resource . the context switch is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system . context switches are usually time consuming and much of the design of operating systems is to minimize the time of context switches . a context switch can mean a register context switch , a task context switch , a thread context switch , or a process context switch . what will be switched is determined by the processor and the operating system . the scheduler is the part of the operating systems that manage context switching , it perform context switching in one of the following conditions : 1. multitasking : one process needs to be `` switched out of '' ( termed `` yield '' which means `` give up '' ) the cpu so another process can run . within a preemptive multitasking operating system , the scheduler allows every task ( according to its priority level ) to run for some certain amount of time , called its `` time slice '' where a timer interrupt triggers the operating system to schedule another process for execution instead. < br > if a process will wait for one of the computer resources or will perform an i/o operation , the operating system schedules another process for execution instead .
