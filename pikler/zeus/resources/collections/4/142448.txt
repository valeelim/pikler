Strain (biology)    strain ( biology ) in biology , strain is a low-level taxonomic rank used in three related ways . a strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism , that is to say a virus or bacterium or fungus . for example , a `` flu strain '' is a certain biological form of the influenza or `` flu '' virus . properly speaking , bacteria , archaea and viruses do not have species , because they do not have eukaryote-type sexual reproduction . bacteria do exchange dna , but they may exchange it between different kinds of bacteria , illustrating their considerable difference from eukaryotes . strains are therefore an absolutely essential part of bacterial identification . in botany , the term is not used to rank plants . it is sometimes used to refer to all the descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character . a strain is a designated group of offspring that have descended from a modified plant , produced ether by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means or result from genetic mutation . as an example , some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant , all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with a unique genetic code that is passed on to later generations ; the strain designation , which is normally a number or a formal name , covers all the plants that descent from the originally modified plant . the rice plants in the strain can be breed to other rice strains or cultivars , and if desirable plants are produced , these are further breed to stabilize the desirable traits ; the stabilized plants that can be propagated and come true , are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers .
