Canopus     canopus , or alpha carinae in the bayer designation system , is the brightest star in its constellation ( carina ) and the brightest star in the southern night sky . canopus is quite unusual , because its distance from earth was not known until the 1990s . before the launching of the hipparcos satellite telescope , distance estimates for the star varied widely , from 96 light years to 1200 light years . hipparcos established canopus as lying 310 light years ( 96 parsecs ) from our solar system . the difficulty in measuring canopus ' distance stemmed from its being a `` less luminous supergiant '' . such stars are rare and poorly understood . they are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from red giant status . this in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright canopus is , and therefore how far away it might be . direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem . canopus is too far away for earth-based parallax observations to be made , so the star 's distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s .
