Instruction set     an instruction set is a list of all the instructions , with all their variations , that a processor can execute . instructions include : - arithmetic such as add and subtract - logic instructions such as and , or , and not - data instructions such as move , input , output , load , and store - control flow instructions such as goto , if ... goto , call , and return . an instruction set , or instruction set architecture ( isa ) , is the part of the computer architecture related to programming—including the native data types , instructions , registers , addressing modes , memory architecture , interrupt and exception handling—and external i/o . an isa includes a specification of the set of opcodes ( machine language ) , the native commands implemented by a particular central processing unit design . instruction set architecture is distinguished from microarchitecture , which is the detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system , as well as how they are inter-connected and inter-operate to implement the isa .
