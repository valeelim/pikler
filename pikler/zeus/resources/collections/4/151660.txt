Toothpaste     toothpaste is a part liquid paste , applied to the bristles of a toothbrush in order to aid oneself with the act of toothbrushing . this substance has several purposes , such as removing plaque from one 's teeth , whitening one 's teeth and freshening one 's breath . several toothpaste brands specialize in caring for teeth sensitive to certain conditions ( for example heat , cold ) or flavours ( such as sweetness ) . the majority of these products work by strengthening the tooth enamel , thus easing discomfort and providing the teeth with a protective outer layer . traditionally , toothpaste has a minty flavour , as this is said to allow a sense of freshness in the mouth . however , fruit and flavours have been popular in the past . fruit toothpastes , however , are discouraged by dentists due to their acidic and tooth-eroding properties .
