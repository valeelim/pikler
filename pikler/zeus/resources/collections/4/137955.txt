Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems     communication theory of secrecy systems is a paper published by claude shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory . it is one of the `` foundational treatments '' ( `` primitives '' ) of modern cryptography . it is also a proof that all theoretically `` unbreakable '' ( `` un-crack-able '' ) ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad encryption algorithm . shannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report a mathematical theory of cryptography , memorandum mm 45-110-02 , sept. 1 , 1945 , bell laboratories . in 1948 , shannon published his great paper `` a mathematical theory of communication '' which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory . related pages . - confusion and diffusion - product cipher references . - shannon , claude . `` communication theory of secrecy systems '' , `` bell system technical journal '' , vol.28 ( 4 ) , page 656â€“715 , 1949. other websites . - online retyped copy of the paper
