Lethal injection     lethal injection is injecting a person with poison , usually a fatal dose of drugs so that person will die . this is usually done as capital punishment . it is the main way to execute prisoners in the united states . the idea of lethal injection was first suggested in new york in 1888 , but oklahoma was the first place to make a law that said it could use it in 1977. texas was the first state to actually use lethal injection for an execution . this first happened when charlie brooks was executed in 1982. thirty-four us states now use it for capital punishment . other countries to use it are china , taiwan , and guatemala . lethal injection is usually done by using three chemicals . the chemicals are usually sodium thiopental ( an anesthetic ) , pancuronium bromide ( used to paralyze the person being injected ) , and potassium chloride ( to stop the heart so that the person being injected dies ) . in the united states , a chemical shortage has made some states have to wait to inject criminals . other states have changed what chemicals they use .
