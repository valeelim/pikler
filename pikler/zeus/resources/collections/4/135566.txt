John B. Watson     john broadus watson ( january 9 , 1878â€“september 25 , 1958 ) was an american psychologist . he established the psychological school of behaviorism , after doing research on animal behavior . this school was extremely influential in the middle of the 20th century , when b.f. skinner developed it further . watson was forced to resign his chair at johns hopkins university , baltimore , because his affair with a graduate student became a public scandal . after this , watson worked for many years for j. walter thompson , a leading american advertising agency . he is credited with popularizing the `` coffee break '' during an ad campaign for maxwell house coffee . watson founded behaviorism in the spring of 1913 with his paper `` psychology as the behaviorist views it '' . in this article , watson outlined the major features of his new philosophy of psychology , called `` behaviorism '' . the first paragraph of the article concisely described his position : psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science . its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior . introspection forms no essential part of its methods , nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness . the behaviorist , in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response , recognizes no dividing line between man and brute . the behavior of man , with all of its refinement and complexity , forms only a part of the behaviorist 's total scheme of investigation .
