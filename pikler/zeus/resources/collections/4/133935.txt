Ancient Greek boxing     ancient greek boxing is a very old kind of sport . it has been practiced at least since the eighth century bc . homer wrote about it in his poem `` iliad '' . at that time , greece was made of many city-states that were independent . each city state seems to have had its own version of the sport . today , most of the sources that talk about greek boxing are either legends , or they are fragmentary . when a source is fragmentary , this means that part of the text has been lost , or is missing . this makes it difficult to find the rules , or where and how the activity was done . several details are missing , but it seems boxing with gloves was an important part of the greek athletic culture of the time . the activity was called `` pyx '' or `` pygme '' in ancient greek . archeologists have found evidence that this activity was probably done by the minoan and mycenaean cultures . many legends tell about the origins of boxing in greece . one legend says that the heroic ruler theseus invented a type of boxing where two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed . later , the boxers began to fight while standing . they also started to wear gloves ( with spikes ) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows . in ancient greece , most sports were done naked , boxing too .
