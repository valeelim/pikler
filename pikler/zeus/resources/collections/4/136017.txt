Rlogin     in computing , rlogin is a unix program that allows users to log in on another host using a network . rlogin uses tcp port 513. it was first distributed as part of the 4.2bsd release . rlogin is also the name of the application layer protocol used by the software , also the protocol is part of the tcp/ip protocol suite . the rlogin homepage is located at http : //rlogin.sourceforge.net . rlogin has several serious security problems , the most important are : - all information , including passwords , is transmitted unencrypted ( making it open to interception ) . there is a modern version , called rlogin kerberos , that uses the mit kerberos authentication technique . - the protocol partially depends on the remote rlogin client to provide information honestly ( including source port and source host name ) . a corrupt client is thus able to rebuild this and gain access . - the protocol lakes all means of authenticating other machines ' identities , or ensuring that the rlogin client is running on a trusted machine , or if it is the `` real '' rlogin client .
