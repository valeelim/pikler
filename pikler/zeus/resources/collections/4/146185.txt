Holography     holography is a method that uses the wave character of light , which depicts an exact description that goes beyond the options of the classic photography . a `` hologram '' is a 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) picture made from a laser . when a person looking at it moves , the hologram changes slightly with the movement to make it look as if the picture was 3-d. holograms are made with light that is flashed onto the scene , then something to write or draw the hologram on , almost like how photos are made . to make a hologram and not a photo , some of the light ( a `` reference beam '' ) has to go right onto the thing that the hologram is being written on . the light has to be a laser because lasers are more accurate and have a wavelength that does n't change , like the wavelength of other light sources like lightbulbs do . to stop other light from messing the hologram up , holograms are usually taken in the darkness . holograms might be easier to explain if compared to photos . in contrast to photography , holography not only records the intensity of light , but also its difference of phase . all pieces of information reflected by the object , are recorded .
