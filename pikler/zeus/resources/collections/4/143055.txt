Cyclotron     a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by ernest lawrence from the university of california , berkeley in 1930. it accelerates charged particles by whirling them in a circle . the first cyclotrons were the size of a hand . some modern circular accelerators use a circle as wide as a city . cyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electrons and particles through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field . the applied electric field accelerates electrons between the `` d '' electrodes ( also called `` dees '' ) of the magnetic field region . the accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle , so that it accelerates them across the gap . with a higher speed , they move in a larger semicircle . after repeating this process several times , they come out the exit port at a high speed . a moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field . if the time to complete one orbit is calculated :
