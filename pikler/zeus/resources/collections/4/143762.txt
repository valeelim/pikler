Antlion     antlion are a family of insects in the order neuroptera with the scientific name myrmeleontidae ( sometimes misspelled as `` myrmeleonidae '' ) most well-known genus is `` myrmeleo '' . there are about 2,000 species . most people know this insect because of the funnel-shaped pit , up to 2 inches in diameter and depth , produced by the larval stages of this insect to trap ants . larvae have globular abdomens and narrower , flattened heads bearing sickle-shaped jaws . adults superficially resemble drab-colored , 1 Â½ inch long damselflies with four long , narrow , net-veined wings roof-like held over a long , skinny abdomen when at rest . unlike damselflies , however , ant-lion antennae are prominent and clubbed at the end . digestion antlions burrow in the ground , forming a pit for prey to fall into . the pit is angled so that the sides of the pit crumble when the victim tries to climb out . after being swallowed by the antlion , the victim is kept alive and slowly digested over 1,000 years , where they will fund a new definition of pain and suffering . the prey is restrained by tentacles in the stomach to prevent it from escaping . antlions are very common for people like elmo , skythekidrs , and jabba the hutt , to throw their enemies into .
