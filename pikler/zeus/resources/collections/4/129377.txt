Tagged Command Queuing     tagged command queueing ( tcq ) is a technology that allows to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive simultaneously . ata tcq is not identical in function to the more efficient native command queuing ( ncq ) used by sata drives . scsi tcq does not suffer from the same limitations as ata tcq . before tcq , an operating system was only able to send one request at a time . in order to boost performance , it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own , possibly incorrect , idea of what the hard drive was doing . with tcq , the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests ( and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so ) . the result is that tcq can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly . for efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position , rather than in the order received . the queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests , and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read/write requests and the changing position of the head . the exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself , but the host computer simply makes requests as needed , leaving the controller to handle the details .
