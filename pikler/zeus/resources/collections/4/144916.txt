Hymenoptera     the hymenoptera is one of the larger orders of insect . it includes the wasps , bees , ants and sawflies . there are over 130,000 recognised species , with many more remaining to be described . the name is derived from the greek words `` hymen '' meaning 'membrane ' and `` ptera '' meaning 'wings . the hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks called `` hamuli '' . females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places . the ovipositor is often modified into a stinger . the young develop through complete metamorphosis â€” that is , they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature ( see holometabolism ) . these are the sawflies , the most primitive hymenoptera . their adults do not have a narrow 'waist ' between the thorax and abdomen . the female 's ovipositor is adapted to burrowing or sawing into the substrate , usually plant tissue . these , the bees , wasps and ants , have a 'waist ' between the thorax and abdomen . they are by far the most numerous hymenoptera , and include the famous groups of colonial insects . in fact , the group with the most species is not colonial ; it is the vast number of parasitoid wasps , such as the ichneumons .
