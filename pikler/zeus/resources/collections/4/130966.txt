Noble gas compound     noble gas compounds are chemical compounds that have an element from group 18 of the periodic table in them . group 18 ( previously called group 0 ) contains all the noble gases . for a long time , scientists thought that noble gases could not form compounds because their valence electron shell had no space for more electrons . this means that they could not accept any more electrons , which made bonding impossible . however , in 1933 , linus pauling said that heavy noble gases could react with fluorine or oxygen , as they are the most electronegative atoms . his prediction was correct , and xenon hexafluoride ( xef ) was later discovered . many more noble gas compounds have been found since then . noble gases can also make endohedral fullerene compounds when the noble gas atom is pushed inside a fullerene molecule . in 1993 , it was discovered that when c is put under pressure of about 3 bar of helium or neon , he @ c and ne @ c are made . only about one out of every 650,000 c were found with a helium atom . but with more pressures ( about 3000 bar ) , it is possible to get as much as 0.1 % . endohedral molecules with argon , krypton and xenon have also been made , as well as other compounds of he @ c .
