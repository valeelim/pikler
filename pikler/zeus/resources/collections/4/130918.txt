Apoptosis     apoptosis is the controlled death of a cell . it plays an integral part of tissue development . during limb development in a foetus , apoptosis allows body digits ( fingers and toes ) to separate from each other . the process is most prevalent until puberty begins . the rate of apoptosis should be balanced by the rate of cell production via mitosis . the phenomenon of programmed cell death was first described by carl vogt in 1842. however , it was only in 1965 that john foxton ross kerr researched the idea extensively . using electron microscopy , he was successfully able to distinguish between necrosis and apoptosis . he then joined the research team of professor currie and andrew wyllie who , in 1972 , published a report on their findings in the `` british journal of cancer '' . they used the term `` apoptosis '' as used by hippocrates to mean `` bones falling off '' . when a cell dies by apoptosis , surrounding tissue is not harmed . < br > 1. enzymes break down the cytoskeleton of the cell. < br > 2. cytoplasm becomes dense , with organelles tightly packed. < br >
