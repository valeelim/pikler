Socratic method     the socratic method ( or method of elenchus or socratic debate ) , is named after the greek philosopher socrates . it is a form of philosophical questioning . the central technique of the socratic method is called an elenchus . it means argument to disprove or refute ( prove wrong ) . our knowledge of socrates comes mainly from plato , who was one of his pupils . no writing by socrates survives . socrates was famous for not answering questions in a direct manner . `` i know that i know nothing '' , he said . socrates 's stated position ( as presented in plato 's dialogues ) was that other person already knew the answer to a question . he ( s. ) only drew out what was already in the other 's mind . in plato 's early dialogues , the `` elenchus '' is the technique socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts , such as justice or virtue . according to one scholar , it has the following steps : 1. socrates ' student or partner asserts a thesis , for example `` courage is endurance of the soul '' . 1. socrates secures his agreement to further premises , for example `` courage is a fine thing '' and `` ignorant endurance is not a fine thing '' .
