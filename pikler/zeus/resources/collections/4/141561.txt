Israeli–Palestinian conflict     the israeli–palestinian conflict is a battle that is still going on between the state of israel and the palestinians . it forms part of the wider arab–israeli conflict . it is a dispute between two groups of people with claims over the same area of land . many attempts have been made to make a two-state solution , which would create an independent palestinian state alongside israel . at present , the vast majority of israelis and palestinians , according to many major polls , agree a two-state solution is the best way to end the conflict . most palestinians view the west bank and gaza strip as constituting the area of their future state , which is a view also accepted by most israelis . a handful of academics advocate a one-state solution , whereby all of israel , the gaza strip , and west bank would become a bi-national state with equal rights for all . however , there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments . the conflict started in 1948 .
