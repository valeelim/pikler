Rocket-propelled grenade     a rocket-propelled grenade or an rpg is the name for any kind of weapon , held on the shoulder that fires rockets that have with an explosive warhead . these warheads are attached to a rocket motor and the rocket has fins which help it to fly straight . some types of rpg are reloadable , while others are used only once and then thrown away . rpgs , with the exception of self-contained versions , are loaded from the muzzle , that is the front part . rpgs with high explosive anti-tank warheads are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers ( apcs ) . they can also be used against tanks , as long as the shooter targets a weak part of the tank , such as the tracks or the top door of the turret . in general , the front armour on a tank is too thick to be penetrated by an rpg warhead . in some cases , teams attacking tanks with rpgs will have multiple rpg users fire at the same tank , which may penetrate the armour . insurgents have sometimes successfully used rpgs to shoot at helicopters .
