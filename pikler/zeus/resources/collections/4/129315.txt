Red Army Faction     the red army faction or raf ( german `` rote armee fraktion '' ) , was one of postwar west germany 's most active and prominent militant left-wing groups . it described itself as a communist `` urban guerrilla '' group engaged in armed resistance , while it was described by the west german government as a terrorist group . the raf was formally founded in 1970 by andreas baader , gudrun ensslin , horst mahler , ulrike meinhof , irmgard möller and others . the red army faction operated from the 1970s to 1993 , committing numerous crimes , especially in the autumn of 1977 , which led to a national crisis that became known as `` german autumn '' . it was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards—and many injuries in its almost 30 years of existence . it ceased activities in 1993 and disbanded in 1998 .
