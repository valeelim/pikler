Zero Install     zero install is a way to distribute and package software for linux and unix-like operating systems . currently , the only operating system to include zero install is super ubuntu instead of the normal method of downloading a software package , extracting it , and installing it before it can be used , packages distributed using zero install need only to be opened and usually comes in application directory format ( presented to the user as a single file ) . some advantages of zero install are : - no root password needed to install software ; packages are installed in system locations writable by that user . thus , package installation affect only the user installing it , which makes it possible for all users to be able to install and run new software . - because it is easier to install extra packages later , it is easier to split documentation and translations ( for example ) into separate packages . for instance , translations would not be downloaded until they are accessed , so if only the default language of a piece of software is used , the translations will never be accessed and thus downloaded and installed . however , most current zero install packages are split the same way as their non-zero install counterparts .
