EFF DES cracker     in cryptography , the eff des cracker ( nicknamed `` deep crack '' ) is a machine built by the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ) to perform a brute force search of des cipher 's key space â€” that is , to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key . the aim in doing this was to prove that des 's key is not long enough to be secure . the des uses a 56-bit key , meaning that there are 2 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted . this is approximately 7.21 ( more than 72 quadrillion ) . when des was approved as a federal standard in 1976 , a machine fast enough to test such amount of keys in a reasonable time would have cost an unreasonable amount of money to build . other websites . - the des cracker page on eff 's site - photos of the machine on cryptography research 's site - copacobana , an off-the-shelf des cracking device
