Page cache     a page cache or disk cache is a buffer of pages certain operating systems keep in memory . these operating systems usually use paging . the page cache uses virtual memory techniques to cache file data as pages rather than as file system oriented blocks . caching file data is far more efficient than caching through physical disks blocks . several systems - including solaris , linux , and windows nt , 2000 , and xp - use page caching to cache both process pages and file data . this is known as unified virtual memory .
