Port wine     port wine ( also called vinho do porto , oporto , porto , and often simply port ) is a portuguese wine . it comes from the douro valley in the northern provinces of portugal . porto is a fortified wine . this means that alcohol was added to it to make it stronger . porto is a sweet wine , but comes as dry or semi-dry too . it is often served as a dessert wine . wines which are similar to the portuguese product called `` port '' are made in several countries around the world . the biggest producers are australia , south africa , india , canada and the united states . however , under european union guidelines , only the product from portugal may be labelled as `` port '' . in the united states , federal law mandates that the portuguese-made product be labeled `` porto '' or `` vinho do porto '' . port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the douro region . the wine produced is then fortified with the addition of a brandy ( distilled grape spirits ) . this is done to stop the fermentation leaving residual sugar in the wine and to increase the alcohol content . the wine is then stored and aged . for aging , it is often put in barrels stored in `` caves '' ( `` portuguese '' meaning `` cellars '' ) as is the case in vila nova de gaia . after aging , it is bottled . the wine received its name , `` port , '' in the second half of the 17th century from the seaport city of porto at the mouth of the douro river . much of the product was brought there . it was then either sold on a market or exported to other countries in europe . the leix√µes docks were used for this . the douro valley where port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region , or appellation in 1756. it is the oldest defined and protected wine region in the world .
