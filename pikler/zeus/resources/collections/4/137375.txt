Linear cryptanalysis     in cryptography , linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher . attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers . linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers ; the other being differential cryptanalysis . a variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested , including using multiple linear approximations or including non-linear expressions . evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs . related pages . - differential cryptanalysis
