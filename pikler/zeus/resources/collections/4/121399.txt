Halting problem     the halting problem is a problem in computer science . the problem is looking at a computer program and finding out if the program is going to run forever or not . we say that a program `` solves the halting problem '' if it can look at any other program and tell if that other program will run forever or not . for example , a program like this : will loop forever , but the program stops very quickly . is there a program that solves the halting problem ? it turns out there is not . we prove this fact by showing that if there is a program that solves the halting problem then something impossible happens . so for the moment we will act like there really is a program that solves the halting problem . here , p is a function which will evaluate function f ( called with argument i ) and return true if it runs forever and false otherwise . p can look at any program and find out if it will run forever or not . we use p to make a new program that we will call q. what q does is look at another program and then answer the following question : `` if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself , will it run forever ? '' . we can make q because we have p. all we need to do is to tell q to create a new program that is the old program looking at itself , and then use p to find out if the new program runs forever or not .
