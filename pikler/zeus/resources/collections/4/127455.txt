Shipping Forecast     the shipping forecast is a weather forecast covering the sea around great britain . it has been broadcast four times a day on bbc radio 4 since the 1920s . the met office , the uk meteorological centre , produces it for the maritime coastguard agency . the forecast talks about lots of places , starting with `` viking '' in the northeast and going clockwise around the british coastline until it reaches `` southeast iceland '' in the northwest . sometimes the names are changed to keep them the same as in other countries . it is one of the first items on radio 4 each day , and has been referenced in many poems and songs , including a poem by seamus heaney and a song by the british band , blur ( `` this is a low '' ) . there is a strict set of rules ( a protocol ) on how the forecast is written , and it has a limit of 370 words . it is always said in the same way and is around 9 minutes long . the language of the forecast is hard to understand unless the listener understands how the rules work . for example : people listening to the forecast who know the protocol can understand it as `` in the english channel , there are strong winds , followed by a stronger wind in less than twelve hours time with some light rain , but good visibility '' . the numbers refer to the beaufort scale of wind strength . `` imminent '' means within 6 hours , `` soon '' between 6 and 12 , and `` later '' meaning after 12 hours . there are lots of other jargon used in the shipping forecast .
