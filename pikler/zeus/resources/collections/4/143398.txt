White supremacy     white supremacy is the belief that white people are better than other races . the words `` white supremacy '' are sometimes used to describe a political idea that shows the social and political dominance of whites . white supremacy is a form of racism . white supremacists also want racial separation , which means people of different races living apart . white supremacy has often resulted in anti-black racism and antisemitism ( anti-jewish hate ) . different kinds of white supremacy have different ideas of whiteness , and not all white supremacist groups agree on which group is their worst enemy . white supremacists often consider jews to be the biggest threat to their cause , because they think jews are able to mix much more easily than other ethnic groups . politically , socially and economically , white supremacy was common in the united states before the american civil war and for decades after . the same is true of apartheid in south africa and of parts of europe at different time periods ; importantly under nazi germany 's third reich . the size of white supremacy 's influence on western culture , and the way in which it influences society , is still being debated . in some parts of the united states , many people who were considered non-white could not vote and were not allowed to be part of the government . they were also not allowed to hold most government jobs â€” well into the second half of the 20th century . white leaders often thought of native americans and australian aborigines as stopping society from going forward , rather than as settlers in their own right . many european-settled countries at the pacific ocean limited immigration from asian and pacific countries . many u.s. states banned marriage between races , through `` anti-miscegenation laws '' until 1967 , when these laws were changed . south africa kept its white supremacist-like apartheid system until the early 1990s .
