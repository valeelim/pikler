Task (computers)    task ( computers ) a task is a set of program instructions that are loaded in memory , then the address registers is loaded with the initial address to start running the task . it is defined as `` an execution path through address space where part of a plan will be accomplished after executing the task ' '' . processes are often called tasks in embedded operating systems so `` task '' gives a meaning of a real-time ( also small ) application , which differs from a process . a process is an instance of a computer program . the kernel creates a process by allocating some memory ( in kernel address space and user address space ) , loading program code from a disk or another part of memory into the newly allocated space , building the process tables and other operating systems structures , calculating the initial address then executes the process as one or more tasks . both `` task '' and `` process '' should be distinguished from event , which takes place at a specific time and place , and which can be planned for in a computer program . in a computer graphical user interface ( gui ) , an event can be as simple as a mouse click or keystroke .
