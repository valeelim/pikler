Public-key cryptography     public-key cryptography , also called asymmetric cryptography , is a communication where people exchange messages that can only be read by one another . in public key cryptography , each user has a pair of cryptographic keys : - a public key - a private key the private key is kept secret , while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users . incoming messages are encrypted with the `` recipient 's public key '' and can only be decrypted with their corresponding private key . the keys are related mathematically , but the user 's private key can not be easily got from the widely used public key . the two main branches of public key cryptography are : - public key encryption : a message encrypted with a `` recipient 's public key '' can not be decrypted except by the `` recipient private key '' . this is used to ensure secrecy . - digital signatures : a message signed with a sender 's private key can be verified by anyone who has the sender 's public key . so if the sender signed the message no one can alter it . this is used to get authenticity .
