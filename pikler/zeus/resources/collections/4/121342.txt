Tierpark Hagenbeck     tierpark hagenbeck ( translated as animal park hagenbeck ) is the name of the largest zoo in hamburg , germany . the park was founded by carl hagenbeck in 1907. his father was a fishmonger ( a person who buys and sells fish ) . it is the first zoo in the world to use moats ( a moat is a large hole or trench . animals do not dare cross it ) . this was done instead of using cages with bars , so the animals would feel more at home . bombs in the second world war completely destroyed the zoological garden . with much help from the founding family , it was rebuilt after the war . two indian elephants helped to clear the rubble in the zoo . there are 210 different species in the tierpark hagenbeck . the sadness is the only swan which is almost completely black , the mourning swan . there are also mandrills and baby elephants but no tapir . there is breeding for orangutan , north chinese leopard and giant otters from south america .
