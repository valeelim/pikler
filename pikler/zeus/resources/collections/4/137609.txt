Selectable marker     a selectable marker is a reporter gene introduced into a cell along with a gene insert . what this means is , the experimenter can tell the right gene is in the cell because the marker can be seen or detected . most often , this is used for bacteria or for cells in culture . selectable markers show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign dna into a cell . it is a technique in gene targeting and gene knockout . selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes ; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign dna are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic . the antibiotic knocks out cells which do not have the resistant marker . those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material . an alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker , which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells . examples of selectable markers include :
