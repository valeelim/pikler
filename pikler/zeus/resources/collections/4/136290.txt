Masochism     masochism is a medical condition . people who suffer from it can get pleasure from being hurt or humiliated by others . often , the pleasure is sexual . when a person gets pleasure from being the one who causes hurt or humiliation , their condition is called sadism . the word `` masochism '' was invented by richard von krafft-ebing , a german psychiatrist . he named it after leopold von sacher-masoch ( 1836-1895 ) , a writer whose books and stories often featured men in love with women who treated them cruelly . many people with masochistic feelings do not really want to be hurt badly . they want to act out their daydreams , such as being tied up and kidnapped , or becoming the slave of another person . in bdsm , people often agree who will be `` top '' and `` bottom '' before they do anything together , and talk about exactly what they will do before they do it . people who do this kind of masochism usually do it for sexual excitement . most people who practice bdsm are concerned about their partner 's safety . when people are careless about safety , or have no partner and play masochistic games when they are alone , it can be very dangerous . in some cases people have died from such games , especially when they involve suffocation , like hanging or rubber masks , even more dangerous when making it hard to get out by putting themselves in things like handcuffs .
