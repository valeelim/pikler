Altaic languages     altaic is suggested as a language family but now seen as wrong . it would include 66 languages that are spoken by about 348 million people , mostly in and around central asia and northeast asia . according to the best-known classification of altaic , it consists of the turkic languages , mongolic , and the tungusic languages . it is probably fair to say that this is the meaning attributed to `` altaic '' by most general linguists . however , since the publication of gustaf john ramstedt 's `` einführung '' in 1952–1957 , most altaicists have included korean in altaic . since the publication of roy andrew miller 's `` japanese and the other altaic languages '' in 1971 , some also included japanese ( nicholas poppe ) or better japonic , consisting of japanese and ryukyuan . a few linguists even count ainu with the altaic languages , but as part of a node including korean and japanese , in contradistinction to a turkic-mongolic-tungusic node , with korean-japanese-ainu and turkic-mongolic-tungusic in turn forming a node at a higher level ( e.g . street 1962 ) .
