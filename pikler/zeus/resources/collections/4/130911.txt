Racism     racism is the belief that some races are better than others , and the actions which result from those beliefs . for example , during the holocaust , nazis in germany believed that some races did not even deserve to exist . these beliefs were racist . because of those beliefs , they killed many people who belonged to those races . those actions , which resulted from their racist beliefs , were also racist . racism has existed throughout human history . it has influenced wars , slavery , the creation of nations , and laws . however , racism has never been the `` only '' cause of wars and slavery . leaders often used racism to make their actions seem all right . for example , the nazis used the idea that slavic peoples were less than human to make it seem all right to take over those people 's countries . humans often categorize themselves by race or ethnicity . they do this based on ancestry , as well as visible traits like skin color and facial features . people of the same ethnic group are often connected by ancestry , speaking the same language , having the same culture , and living in the same places .
