Graduate school     a graduate school ( or grad school ) is a school that gives advanced academic degrees , such as master 's degrees ( m.s . or mba ... ) and doctoral degrees ( ph.d. or l.l.d . or d.d.s . etc. ) . a graduate student ( or grad student ) is a student who goes to the school . also , in british english , the phrase `` postgraduate student '' is more common . usually , students must have an undergraduate ( bachelor 's ) degree before beginning graduate school . many universities give graduate degrees . a graduate school is not always a separate school . the term `` graduate school '' could be confusing because the verb `` graduate '' is also used to mean completing high school education or a bachelor 's degree ( known as an `` undergraduate degree '' ) . the verb infinitive `` to graduate '' is used for all those types of schools , but the meaning of the adjective `` graduate '' is changed to mean `` postgraduate '' in the term `` graduate school '' . the small change in meaning can be viewed with an air of sophistication , where experienced students are often more aware of the issue , while novice students might not be aware , as being more naive .
