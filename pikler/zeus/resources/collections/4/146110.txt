Scholarship     a scholarship is financial help ( money ) given to someone who wants to study . scholarships can be given by schools or by universities or colleges or any other institution where people can study or where research needs to be done . it is similar to a bursary . there are very many kinds of scholarships . some scholarships will cover all the tuition fees ( money that the student needs to pay to study ) , others may just help towards the tuition fees . some scholarships may include money for other things such as food and accommodation . sometimes the students are expected to do something in return for having a scholarship . they may , for example , be expected to do some particular work after they finish their studies , or they may need to help the institution in some way . quite often the amount of money a student gets will depend on how much money the family has . convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women says that scholarship must be equally given for girls without discrimination .
