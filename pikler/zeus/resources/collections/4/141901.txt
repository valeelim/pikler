Morse code     morse code is a type of code that is used to send telegraphic information using rhythm . morse code uses `` dots '' and `` dashes '' to show the alphabet letters , numbers , punctuation and special characters of a given message . when messages are sent by morse code , dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes , and dashes are longer ones . morse code is named after samuel morse , who helped invent it . it is not used as much today as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries . teletypewriters were invented in the early 20th century with their own codes and gradually replaced morse code . other types of technology that are easier to use for communication became even more common . however , some people still use morse code to communicate on amateur radio . there are different types of morse code for some different countries . there are three different symbols in morse code ; there 's a short one , usually called 'dit ' , a long one , called 'dah ' , and the pause . a dah is three times as long as a dit , and the pause has the same length as the dit .
