Key schedule     in cryptography , the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers , where the decryption of data is done in `` rounds '' . the general setup of each `` round '' is the same , except for some hard-coded parameters and a part of the cipher key , called a subkey . a key schedule is an algorithm that , given the key , calculates the subkeys for these `` rounds '' . some types of key schedules . - some ciphers have simple key schedules . for example , the block cipher tea simply splits the 128-bit key into four 32-bit pieces and uses them repeatedly in successive rounds . - des uses a key schedule where the 56 bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves then each half is treated separately . in successive rounds , both halves are rotated left by one or two bits ( specified for each round ) , and then 48 subkey bits are selected by permuted choice 2 ( pc-2 ) â€” 24 bits from the left half , and 24 from the right . the rotations mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey ; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys .
