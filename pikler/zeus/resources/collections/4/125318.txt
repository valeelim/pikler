Hubble Ultra Deep Field     the hubble ultra deep field , or hudf , is an image of a small part of space in the constellation fornax . it took more than 3 months to capture this image , from september 24 , 2003 through january 16 , 2004. it is the furthest image of the universe ever taken by humans . in it we see the universe as it was 13 billion years ago , when it was about 800 million years old . the hudf contains an about 10,000 galaxies . the patch of sky where the galaxies are was chosen because it has few bright stars in the near-field . although most of the targets visible in the hubble image can also be seen at infrared wavelengths by ground-based telescopes , hubble is the only instrument which can make observations of these distant targets at visible wavelengths . southwest of orion in the southern-hemisphere constellation fornax at right ascension 3h 32m 40.0s , declination -27° 47 ' 29 '' ( j2000 ) , the image covers 36.7 square arcminutes . this is smaller than a 1 mm by 1 mm square of paper held 1 meter away , and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky . the image is such that the upper left corner points toward north ( -46.4° ) on the celestial sphere . the star near the center of the field is usno-a2.0 0600-01400432 with apparent magnitude of 18.95 .
