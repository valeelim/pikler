Parqués     parqués is the colombian board game . the game is similar to those in the cross and circle family ( the category that includes pachisi ) . the game is described as a `` random thinking '' one : the moves depend on the roll of the dice but players must consider possible strategies before executing their move . the objective of the game is to advance all the pieces to the end . parqués is the colombian version of pachisi , which originated in india . although it could be argued that the game comes from spain ( exactly as a derivation from parchís ) due to the similarity between both games , there is wide agreement in colombia that the game is completely colombian . parqués stems directly from pachisi in the same way as parcheesi , parchís or ludo . there is no proof to the claim that it stems from a country other than india . moreover , no parqués game is played in any other latin american countries , neither the world . parqués is a mixture of the original indian game and the influences of local colombian culture . other colombian variations also exist .
