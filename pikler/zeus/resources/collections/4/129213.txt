Emancipation Proclamation     the emancipation proclamation was an order by u.s. president abraham lincoln to free slaves in 10 states . it applied to slaves in the states still in rebellion in 1863 during the american civil war . it did not actually immediately free all slaves in those states , because those areas were still controlled by the confederacy . it did , however , free at least 20,000 slaves immediately , and nearly all 4 million slaves ( according to the 1860 united states census ) as the union army advanced into confederate states . until the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution in 1865 , only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders . thus , lincoln issued the proclamation as a war measure in his role as commander-in-chief . the proclamation made emancipation a goal of the civil war . it also weakened efforts within england and france to officially recognize the confederacy . as union troops advanced into rebel ( confederate ) territory , they freed thousands of slaves per day . many did not wait , but fled their owners to claim their freedom .
