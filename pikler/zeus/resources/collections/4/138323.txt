Battle of the Mediterranean     the battle of the mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the mediterranean sea during world war ii . for the most part , the campaign was fought between the forces of the italian royal navy ( `` regia marina '' ) , supported by other axis naval forces , and the forces of the british royal navy , supported by other allied naval forces . each side had three overall goals in this battle . the first was to attack the supply lines of the other side . the second was to keep open its own supply lines , the axis to their own armies in north africa and the allies to supply the island of malta . the third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea . outside of the pacific ocean , the mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war . in particular , allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of malta . italian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking . but some italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour . all italian warships lacked radar for most of the war , although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that italian warships had good `` rangefinder '' and `` fire-control '' systems . in addition , whereas allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act , italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by italian naval headquarters ( `` supermarina '' ) . this could lead to action being avoided when the italians had a clear advantage ( e.g. , during `` operation hats '' ) . italian naval headquarters was conscious that the british could replace ships lost in the mediterranean , whereas italian navy resources were limited and there was a terrible lack of fuel .
