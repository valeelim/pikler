Free content     free content , or free information , is any kind of work , artwork , or other creative content which does not have lots of legal about how people can use it . people have freedom to make changed versions of the content , give changed and not changed versions of the content to others , and sell copies of the content and changed versions of it . the author of free content does not use all of his copyright monopoly , he gives many of the rights to others . the articles in wikipedia are free content . free software is different from free music or text , because it is often much more difficult to understand and change a program if one does not have its source code , than it is to change a song or a text . because of that , the source code of free software must always be easy to receive , or the software will not be free . however , source code for pictures , movies and music can also exist and be given to others . choosing what to call a “ source code ” is sometimes important when publishing a work under a copyleft license .
