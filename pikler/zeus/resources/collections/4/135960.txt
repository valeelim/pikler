Raster image processor     a raster image processor is a component that can be found in some printers . the raster image processor receives the data in a description language , like postscript , pcl , or pdf and converts it to a bitmap or raster image . raster image processing can be done in two ways : as software running as part of the operating system , or as a special microprocessor inside the printer . cheaper printers use a solution called host-based printing , where this is done in the operating system , more expensive printers , and those that support pcl , postscript or a similar language have a raster image processor inside the printer . stages of rip . 1. interpretation : this is the stage where the supported pdls ( page description languages ) are translated into a private internal representation of each page . most rips process pages one after another so the current machine state is only for the current page . they do one page at a time . once a page has been output the page state is discarded to make the rip ready for the next page .
