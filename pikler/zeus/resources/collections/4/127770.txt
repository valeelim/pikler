Pilot whale     pilot whales are two types of oceanic dolphins , whose scientific name is globicephala . the two types of pilot whales are the long-finned pilot whale and the short-finned pilot whale . their behaviour resembles that of the larger whales more than that of dolphins . the two look similar at sea and are usually just known simply as pilot whales or calder√≥n in spanish . they and other large dolphins are also known as blackfish . pilot whales can be found nearly worldwide . the long-finned variety prefers colder waters , for example near antarctica . the short-finned ones can also be found in tropical waters . pilot whales are highly social animals , they live in groups of 20-30 animals , called `` pods '' . larger groups of over 100 pilot whales have been observed . studies suggest that the young remain in the same pod as their parents , which is unusual for mammals . female short-finned pilot whales go through menopause . females that do no longer reproduce contribute to the survival of the young.for reasons which are still unclear , pilot whales seem to end up stranded on a beach fairly often .
