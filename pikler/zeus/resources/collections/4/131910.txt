Docetism     docetism is an early christian teaching that says that jesus only appeared to have a human body . the term comes from `` dokein '' : `` to seem '' . early gnostics , whose teachings began to threaten christian doctrine and theology , believed all matter was unclean . for this reason , christ could not have a physical body , as he was seen as the eternal logos . today , it is unclear where this teaching came from . it might have been influenced by the teachings of plato . plato taught that only ideas mattered and that matter itself was inferior . many gnostic teachings are docetic . for a long time , people believed that docetism and gnosticism were developed together . this is however not the case , there are also some gnostic systems that are not docetic , as well as some docetic systems that are not gnostic . today , most christian theologians see docetism as a heresy .
