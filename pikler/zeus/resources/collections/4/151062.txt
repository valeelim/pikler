Workstation     a workstation is a computer used for scientific or technical calculations , or purposes . these computers are usually expensive , high-end computers . they are different from the ordinary computers used for text-processing . very often they have operating systems that allow several users to work at the computer at the same time . very often , workstations are connected to a computer network . computer terminals may be used to access them . currently , almost all workstations use a unix or unix-like operating system . workstation computers often use a 64-bit server-class cpu such as the intel xeon or amd opteron , and some have more than one cpu . they may also have more memory than a normal desktop computer , and they often have 10000 or 15000 rpm hard drives or solid-state drives . some workstations have devices that are not commonly used on normal desktop computers , such as ecc ( error-corrected ) memory , scsi , fibre channel , and 10 gigabit ethernet . some technologies that were once only found on workstations have now become common in normal pcs , such as multi-core processors , solid-state drives , hardware-accelerated graphics , 24-bit color , broadband internet access , virtual memory , pre-emptive multitasking , and opencl .
