Lyrebird     a lyrebird is a ground-dwelling australian bird . there are two species in the genus menura . the live in forests , especially rainforests , of eastern australia , and they were introduced to tasmania in the 19th century . the are found in two national forest areas of victoria , new south wales and southeast queensland . they are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment . since they live on the ground in fairly dense undergrowth , sound is used by the males to attract attention . when a female arrives , the visual display comes into action . it is a typical `` female choice '' mating system , where males defend a mating territory , and sing and display to get a mate . the lyrebird 's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment , including other birds . it takes young birds about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire . the female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics , and will sing on occasion but the females do so with less skill than the males . a lyrebird classic is their imitation of human sounds in the forest such as car alarms , camera shutters and forest logging with chain-saws .
