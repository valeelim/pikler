Financial crisis of 2007–2008     the financial crisis of 2007–2008 was a major financial crisis , the worst of its kind since the great depression . it became prominently visible in september 2008 with the failure , merger , or conservatorship of several large united states-based financial firms . the underlying causes leading to the crisis had been reported in business journals for many months before september , with commentary about the financial stability of leading u.s. and european investment banks , insurance firms , and mortgage banks consequent to the subprime mortgage crisis . there are many reasons why economists think the crisis happened . most economists believe that it started in the united states . from 1997 until 2006 , people bought expensive houses , even though they did not have enough money for it . since the money had come from other countries , it was easy to have good credit . people used this credit for expensive home loans . this created an economic bubble which caused the houses ' prices to raise . because they had a lot of money , the loaning companies made it easier to get a loan , even if the borrower did n't have a good credit history . these loans are known as subprime loans .
