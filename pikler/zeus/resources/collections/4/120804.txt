Proprietary software     proprietary ( or closed source ) software does not let people see or change source code of the computer software . it is the opposite of free software . proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software , but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them . with proprietary software , only the people that make the software can see and change the code . even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people , the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these : - change the code , - give the code to other people , - give the changed code to other people , - use the code on a different computer , - change it to work on a different operating system and give that to other people . most companies who sell their software for money ( and even some who do not charge money for it ) make it proprietary source . this makes it harder for people to copy or change the software , or to use the source code to make similar software .
