Particle accelerator     a particle accelerator , also called an atom smasher , is a machine that accelerates ( speeds up ) particles and makes them travel at very high speeds . accelerators work by pushing particles like electrons , protons , or atomic nuclei ( the centers of atoms ) with electric fields and by steering them with magnetic fields . their main use is to study particle physics . the largest accelerators are used to study particles smaller than atoms ; smaller accelerators are used to study atomic nuclei and make radioactive materials . there are two kinds of particle accelerators : linear accelerators and circular accelerators . linear accelerators move the particles in a line , while circular accelerators move the particles in a circle . one example of a particle accelerator is the large hadron collider at cern . it is very big , stretching through two countries . another example is the tevatron in the united states . an example of a particle accelerator used in everyday life is the cathode ray tube , used in older televisions and computer monitors .
