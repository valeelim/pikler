Pollen     pollen is a powder made of pollen grains , which produce sperm cells ( male cells used for reproduction ) of seed plants . the pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes . the anther contains microsporangia . each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells . these undergo meiosis , and produce pollen grains , which produce the male gametes ( sperm ) . the pollen is released by the opening of the anther . the pollen is carried by some agent ( wind , or some animal ) to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower . this process is known as pollination . after successful pollination , the pollen grain ( immature microgametophyte ) completes its development by growing a `` pollen tube '' and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes . there are two main kinds of pollination . one kind happens when pollen from a stamen sticks to the pistil of the same plant . that is self-pollination . the other kind of pollination takes place when pollen from one plant travels to the pistil of another plant . most plants use this kind of pollination . plants need help for this kind of pollination , because they can not move . so , they need another way to move pollen from one plant to another plant .
