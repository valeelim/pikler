Language reform     language reform is a type of language planning . language reforms make big changes to a language . these changes are usually done to make a language simpler to understand or to write . sometimes changes are done to make the language purer ; that is , to get rid of foreign parts of the language , or to get rid of parts of the language that are not grammatical . simplification makes the language easier to use . it tries to regularise spelling , vocabulary , and grammar . purification makes the language similar to a version of the language that people think is more pure . sometimes language reforms were done to unite the people speaking the language . for this reason , many language reforms happened in 19th century europe when there was a rise of nationalist movements . the most common form of language reform involves changing the spelling of words . this is known as spelling reform . sometimes the grammar of the language is changed . inflection , syntax , vocabulary and word formation can sometimes be simplified , in addition to spelling . english uses many different prefixes that mean `` the opposite of '' , like `` un- '' , `` in-/im- '' , `` a ( n ) - '' , `` de- '' . a language reform might suggest that there is only one prefix to mean `` the opposite of '' , for example `` un- '' . on top of this , there are words such as `` good '' and `` bad '' that roughly mean the opposite of each other , but would be better ( in terms of simplicity ) portrayed as `` good '' and `` ungood '' , so the word `` bad '' is not part of the language anymore .
