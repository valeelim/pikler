False killer whale     false killer whales ( `` pseudorca crassidens '' ) are cetaceans and larger members of the oceanic dolphin family ( delphinidae ) . the species is the only member of the `` pseudorca '' genus . they live in temperate and tropical waters throughout the world . as its name implies , the false killer whale shares characteristics with the more widely known `` orca '' ( `` killer whale '' ) . the two species look somewhat similar and , like the orca , the false killer whale attacks and kills other cetaceans . however , the two dolphin species are not closely related . the false killer whale has not been extensively studied in the wild by scientists ; much of the data about the dolphin has been got by examining stranded animals .
