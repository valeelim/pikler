Lenz's law    lenz 's law lenz 's law is a common way to understand how electromagnetic circuits obey newton 's third law and the conservation of energy. < ref name= '' electromagnetics explained : a handbook for wireless/rf , emc , and high-speed electronics '' > schmitt , ron . `` electromagnetics explained '' . 2002. retrieved 16 july 2010. < /ref > lenz 's law is named after heinrich lenz , and it says : an induced electromotive force ( emf ) always gives rise to a current whose magnetic field opposes the change in orignal magentic flux . lenz 's law is shown with the negative sign in faraday 's law of induction : which indicates that the induced emf ( ℰ ) and the change in magnetic flux ( ∂φ ) have opposite signs . the induced emf and the resulting induced current are counterclockwise when b is directed out from the page and the area of the circuit is decreasing . the flux through this circuit is decreasing in the outward direction . now the induced current i produces its own magnetic field , and we may use the right-hand grip rule to compute the direction of this field . the result is that the magnetic field due to the induced current is also directed outward within the circuit . it is as though nature , through this induced field , tried to compensate for the reduction in the flux due to the applied field b. this turns out experimentally to be a general rule , so that we may say that
