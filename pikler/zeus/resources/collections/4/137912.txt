Substitution box     in cryptography , a s-box ( `` substitution-box '' ) is a basic component of symmetric-key algorithms . in block ciphers , the s-boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext ( coded text ) difficult to understand–shannon 's property of confusion . the s-boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis ( decoding ) . in general , an s-box takes some number of input bits , `` m '' , and transforms them into some number of output bits , `` n '' : an `` m '' × '' n '' s-box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2 words of `` n '' bits each . fixed tables are normally used , as in the data encryption standard ( des ) , but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key ; e.g . the blowfish and the twofish encryption algorithms . bruce schneier describes idea 's modular multiplication step as a key-dependent s-box . one good example is this 6×4-bit s-box from des ( s ) : given a 6-bit input , the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits , and the column using the inner four bits . for example , an input `` 011011 '' has outer bits `` 01 '' and inner bits `` 1101 '' ; the corresponding output would be `` 1001 '' .
