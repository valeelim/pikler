Leedsichthys     leedsichthys problematicus , ( 'leeds fish ' ) was a giant fossil fish of the jurassic period . it was a pachycormid , a group of extinct ray-finned fishes ( actinopterygii ) . `` leedsichthys '' is the largest fish known , with an estimated length of up to 16 meters . the blue whale is twice as long , at 30 metres , but that is a mammal , not a fish . leedsichthys fossils are incomplete , making it impossible to know the exact length . the fossil is named after its discoverer , alfred nicholson leeds , who discovered it before 1886 near peterborough , england . like the worlds biggest fish today , the whale shark , the `` leedsichthys problematicus '' was a filter feeder , getting its nutrition from plankton . remains of over 70 individuals have now been found .
