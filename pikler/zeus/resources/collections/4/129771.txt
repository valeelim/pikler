Russo-Japanese War     the russo-japanese war was a war between the japanese empire and the russian empire . it started in 1904 and ended in 1905. the japanese won the war , and the russians lost . the war happened because the russian empire and japanese empire disagreed over who should get parts of manchuria and korea . it was fought mostly on the liaodong peninsula and mukden , the seas around korea , japan , and the yellow sea . the politics of the two countries in the war were very complicated , but both wanted to gain land and economic benefits . the chinese empire of the qing , was large but weak , and it was qing land and possessions they fought over . for example korea was under qing rule , but was seized by japan . the russians wanted a 'warm-water port ' on the pacific ocean for their navy and trade . the harbour at vladivostok freezes over in the winter , but port arthur ( now called the liaodong peninsula in china ) can be used all the time . russia had already rented the port from the qing and had got their permission to build a railway from st petersburg to port arthur .
