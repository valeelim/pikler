Key exchange     key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between users , allowing use of a cryptographic system . if two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages , each needs to know how to decrypt received messages and to encrypt sent messages . the information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use . if they use a code , both will require a copy of the same codebook . if they use a cipher , they will need appropriate keys . if the cipher is a symmetric key cipher , both will need a copy of the same key . if an asymmetric key cipher with the public/private key property , both will need the other 's public key . the key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so , in such a way , that no one else can obtain a copy . usually , this required trusted secure channel . with the arrival of ( public key / private key ) cipher algorithms , the encrypting key ( aka , the public key ) could be made public , since ( at least for `` high quality '' ciphers ) no one without the decrypting key ( aka , the private key ) could decrypt the message .
