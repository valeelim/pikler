Homeopathy     homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine . it was created in the 18th century by samuel hahnemann . the theory behind homeopathy is that an ill person can be healed with very small amounts of something that produces the symptoms of the illness in a healthy person . scientists say that homeopathy does not work and only makes people think they feel better ( this is called the placebo effect . ) homeopaths make their medicines by taking the ingredients , adding water , and shaking the mixture . they then take a drop of the mixture , throw out the rest , and add more water . they do this usually 30 times but sometimes up to 200 times . they call it potentisation . hahnemann said this would bring out the `` spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug '' . science can show how many atoms or molecules - tiny things that can not be divided up any more - of the original substance are left in the homeopathic drug . in most homeopathic drugs , there is not a molecule left of the substance they started out with . homeopaths believe that the solution carries a `` memory '' of the original substance . science says that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry .
