Witch hunt     a witch hunt is when everybody in a town looks for witches to capture . this happened way more a long time ago than nowadays . it was mostly done by christians . the time when the witch hunts were most common in europe was from about 1480 ad to 1700 ad . that was when there was the protestant reformation and the thirty years ' war . back then , tens of thousands of witches were executed . witch hunts also happened a lot in america around that time . today , most countries do n't have laws against witches any more , so there are less witch hunts , although the term `` witch hunt '' can also be used as a joke to refer to something like a witch hunt . an example of a modern `` witch hunt '' would be the cold war communist hunt . which was discredited partly through being compared to the salem witch trials . further reading . - behringer , wolfgang . `` witches and witch hunts : a global history .
