Adiabatic process     an adiabatic process is a thermodynamic process where a fluid becomes warmer or cooler without getting heat from , or giving it to , something else . usually the temperature instead changes because of changes in pressure . adiabatic cooling is the usual cause of clouds . when warm , humid air rises due to convection or other cause , water condenses to make clouds , and in some cases precipitation . convection also causes cold air to sink . this warms it adiabatically , often destroying a cloud and sometimes causing any precipitation to evaporate before hitting the ground .
