Kerberos (protocol)    kerberos ( protocol ) kerberos ( pronounced `` kur-ber-uhs '' ) is a computer network authentication protocol , which allows people communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner . it is also a suite of free software published by massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) that implements this protocol . its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model , and it provides mutual authentication â€” both the user and the server verify each other 's identity . kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks . kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read , modified , and inserted . kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center . extensions to kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication .
