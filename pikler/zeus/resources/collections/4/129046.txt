Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)    civil disobedience ( thoreau ) civil disobedience ( `` resistance to civil government '' ) is a text by henry david thoreau . it was first printed in 1849. it says that people should not allow a government to order them to do wrong things . in 1848 , thoreau lectured at the concord lyceum ( a place for people to meet and learn in the town of concord , massachusetts ) . the words of the lecture were later printed with the name `` resistance to civil government '' in 1849. now many people call it `` civil disobedience '' which means : `` not doing what the government orders you to do . '' in the early 1840s thoreau stopped paying his `` poll tax '' ( a tax that is the same amount for everybody ) . he was angry that the government used tax money to make people slaves and to war with mexico . thoreau did not want to help them do these things . in 1846 the tax agent put thoreau in prison for one night . thoreau wrote `` civil disobedience '' to say why he would not pay . thoreau says governments are more bad than good , and society without government would be more good . letting people vote does not make government good , because people may vote for bad things . one person with their conscience ( their feeling of right and wrong ) may make decisions that are more good than decisions made by governments or by most of the people who vote .
