Hernando de Soto     hernando de soto ( jerez de los caballeros , badajoz , spain , c.1496/1497â€“may 21 , 1542 ) was a spanish explorer and conquistador . he lead the first european expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day united states and was probably the first european to discover the mississippi river . the expedition was looking for gold and for a way to china . they explored the southern united states . de soto died in 1542 on the banks of the mississippi river at present-day lake village , arkansas . hernando de soto was born to parents who were hidalgos in extremadura , a region of poverty and hardship from which many young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere . his parents were poor , too . two towns , badajoz and jerez de los caballeros , claim to be his birthplace . all that is known with certainty is that he spent time as a child at both places . in his will , he wanted to be buried at jerez de los caballeros , where other members of his family were also buried . the age of the conquerors came on the heels of the spanish reconquest of the iberian peninsula from islamic forces . spain and portugal were filled with young men begging for a chance to find military fame after the moors were defeated . with discovery of new lands to the west ( which seemed at the time to be far east asia ) , the whispers of glory and wealth were too compelling for the poor .
