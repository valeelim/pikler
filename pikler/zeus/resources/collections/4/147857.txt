Passerine     a passerine is a bird of the order passeriformes , which includes more than half of all bird species . they are songbirds which can perch . most of them are small in size , and most can sing very well . the passerines have a number of adaptations which , taken together , have made them highly successful , with many species round the world . 1. the use of song for communication . this is the most obvious adaptation . 1. perching . all passerines have four toes on each foot . three of the toes point forwards . the other toe points backwards . this means that passerines can easily hold onto trees or rocks . because of this , they are also known as perching birds . a tendon in the rear of the leg makes the foot curl and grip when the bird lands on a branch . this is more than just a convenience for the birds : it is a locking mechanism so they can sleep without falling off . 1. all passerine chicks ( babies ) are born in an undeveloped state : they need parental help . their eyes are closed , and they are bald , with little or no down . they can not leave the nest , and must be fed by the parents . the advantage of this is that their brains grow larger during the fledgling stage . in birds which leave the nest early , their brains depend mainly on material in the egg . passerines have significantly large brains compared to body size , and many passerines are comparatively intelligent .
