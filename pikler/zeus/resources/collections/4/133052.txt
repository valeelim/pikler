Pirate code     a pirate code is a code of conduct for pirates - a set of rules for how to behave . some of these codes were used by real pirates ; others are from movies . in the second half of the 17th century , pirates started following rules . these rules had many different names , including chasse-partie , charter party , custom of the coast , or jamaica discipline . eventually , they became known as articles of agreement , or the pirate 's code . these changed from one captain to another . sometimes they were different from one voyage ( journey ) to another . these rules included punishments for rule breakers and said how much treasure each crew member would receive . each crew member signed the articles ( or if they could not write , they would make a mark to show they agreed ) . after the rules were signed , they were then posted in a common place , often the door of the grand cabin . there are three known sets of these rules that still exist today . most of these come from charles johnson 's book `` a general history of the pyrates '' . part of a code from henry morgan , a famous british pirate , is remembered in a book called `` the buccaneers of america '' by alexandre exquemelin , who probably sailed with morgan as a ship 's doctor . very few of these rules still exist today , because often pirates burned the papers before being caught . they did this to prevent these papers from being used against them .
