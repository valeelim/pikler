Linux kernel     linux is an operating system kernel used by a group of unix-like operating systems . these are known as linux operating systems . the linux kernel is released with the gnu general public license version 2 ( gplv2 ) and developed by programmers worldwide . in april 1991 , linus torvalds , then 21 years old , started working on some simple ideas for an operating system . then , on 25 august 1991 , torvalds posted to `` comp.os.minix '' : after the post , many people contributed code to the project . by september 1991 , linux version 0.01 was released . it had 10,239 lines of code . in october 1991 , linux version 0.02 was released . a newsgroup `` alt.os.linux '' was started , and on january 19 1992 , the first post to alt.os.linux was made . on march 31 1992 , alt.os.linux became `` comp.os.linux '' . the x window system was soon moved to linux . in march 1992 , linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running x. this large version number jump ( from 0.1x to 0.9x ) was because of a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing parts would be released soon .
