Lady Godiva     lady godiva ( ; about 980 – 1067 ) was an anglo-saxon noblewoman . she was married to earl leofric and frequently donated to the church , and was highly religious . there are legends that say that she rode naked through the streets of coventry in england . lady godiva was the wife of earl leofric of mercia . the earl ’ s taxes were very high , and people in coventry was very upset about it . lady godiva begged her husband to lower the taxes many times , but he never agreed to . finally , the earl told lady godiva that if she rode through the streets completely naked , he would lower the taxes . lady godiva sent a message through town that told everyone to close their shutters and stay indoors . then , she rode through town only clothed by her hair . the earl gave in and lowered the taxes of the town . however , a tailor named tom drilled a hole through his shutters , and caught a glimpse of lady godiva . he was struck blind , some think from heaven , and some think the town “ took care of him ” themselves . this is where the phrase “ peeping tom ” for a voyeur comes from . there were many celebrations to remember lady godiva ’ s courage . peeping tom was added to the story in the 17th century .
