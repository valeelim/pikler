Falls Apart     falls apart was a single released by thousand foot krutch in 2007. it was made available online in july 2007. it is on their album the flame in all of us . the `` falls apart '' video starts off showing the band in a dark wood room , with lots of rope around them . the members only have enough room to play their instruments . eventually a man and a woman are shown and they are being held together by ropes . the man walks over to the woman and puts his arm around her . after a while she gets up and starts walking away , but then the ropes come off around everyone ( the band and the couple alike ) . because of this all of the body parts of the couple lie on the floor . but the man 's hand crawls to the woman 's hand and they hold each other while the band ends the song .
