Transmission Control Protocol     the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) is one of the main protocols of the internet protocol suite . tcp is part of the popular `` tcp/ip '' combination used by the internet . the internet protocol , or ip , makes sure data on the internet gets to the right place . then tcp makes sure the data is put in the right order , and none of it is missing . tcp also helps to control traffic on the internet so it does not get overloaded . these protocols , which are kind of like languages that computers use , are designed so that any computer , and any program ( such as a web browser or e-mail client ) , can use them . tcp makes it easier for computer programs to communicate with each other , typically over a computer network . when a program wants to send a lot of data , tcp is in charge of dividing the data , sending it through the network , and putting it back together correctly on a different computer . in the process , ip chooses which wires and `` intersections '' get used to send all the data pieces in the fastest way . it does this using packets .
