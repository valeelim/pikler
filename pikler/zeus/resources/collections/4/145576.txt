Fortress     a fortress is a building designed to be defended , which means it was very hard for enemies to get inside . fortification kept the people inside safe . there is little difference between a fortress and a castle . fortresses normally have thick stone walls , thicker but less tall than in castles so artillery can not break them . there were very small windows , without glass , so that soldiers inside could fire out through them . as time passed , the weapons they used changed , from bow and arrow , crossbow , gun or cannon . soldiers outside had great difficulty firing into such small windows . the people defending the fortress were also able to drop things like rocks and boiling oil on the heads of those below . successful attacks were usually sieges . fortresses were not designed for comfort . they were dark and often damp . the tower of london is an example of a fortress .
