Debugger     a debugger is a computer program that is used to test and `` debug '' other programs , mainly to solve programming bugs . debuggers offer advanced functions such as : 1. running a program step by step ( single-stepping ) , 1. stopping ( breaking ) ( pausing the program to examine the current state ) at some kind of event by means of breakpoint ( a place for stopping or pausing in a program ) , 1. tracking ; which means following , the values of some variables , 1. some debuggers have the ability to modify the state of the program while it is running , rather than watching it only . the same features which makes a debugger useful for solving software bugs allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to crack copy protection and other software protection features .
