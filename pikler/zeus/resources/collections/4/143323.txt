Application-specific integrated circuit     asic or application-specific integrated circuit is a kind of integrated circuit . it is built for a particular use instead of for general-purpose use . digital circuits are a common form of asic , but analog asics were manufactured beginning in the latter half of the 1990s . asic has advantages compared to programmable logic device or standard logic ic . 1. asic has a miniaturized embodiment size . 1. asic can improve speed . 1. asic needs less electric power to operate . there are also disadvantages of asic . 1. the cost per a unit can be high when producing a small number of units because of the cost in producing a photomask . 1. they can be hard to design and it is expensive and wastes time if they need to be redesigned . 1. the time of a manufacturing process can be long . design of asic is gate array design , cell base design , embedded array design , standard cell design , and structured asic design . gate array design has elementary gate circuit at first base , ( we ) manufacture the products with putting ordered proper wire-layers .
