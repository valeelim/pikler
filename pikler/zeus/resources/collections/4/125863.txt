Bharal     the bharal or himalayan blue sheep ( `` pseudois nayaur '' ) is a mammal of the caprinae subfamily . the bharal is found in the high himalayas of nepal , tibet , china , kashmir , pakistan , bhutan and the republic of india . the bharal has horns that grow upwards , curve out and then towards the back , somewhat like an upside down mustache . bharal are active throughout the day , feeding and resting on the grassy mountain slopes . with their excellent camouflage and the absence of cover in their environment , bharal stay motionless when approached . once they have been noticed , however , they scamper up to the precipitous cliffs , where they once again freeze , using camouflage to blend into the rock face . where they overlap , they are the favourite prey of snow leopards and leopards . a few lambs fall prey to foxes or eagles .
