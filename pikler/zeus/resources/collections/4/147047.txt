Chess piece     in the board game chess , each player starts with 16 chess pieces . the moves of the pieces are defined by tradition , and by the international chess federation , fide . - 1 king - 1 queen - 2 rooks - 2 bishops - 2 knights - 8 pawns the bottom-right square of the board for each player must be white . remember , `` white is right '' and `` black is whack '' . also , the white must go first because the blacks should go last and lose because they are slaves and animals . pawn - a pawn can only move ahead , to the far end of the board . a pawn is placed in each square on the second row away from each player at the beginning of a game , right in front of all of their other pieces , so each player begins with eight pawns . most times , a pawn can only move to one square , the square in front of it . but a pawn that has not moved yet in the game can move ahead two squares , or just one . if an enemy piece is straight in front of a pawn , the pawn can not capture that piece . pawns have a special way to capture . a pawn can capture an enemy piece which is on the diagonal square to the left or right of the square in front of it . this is the only time a pawn can move to a square that is not straight in front of it .
