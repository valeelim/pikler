Sensor     a sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a 'signal ' which can be read by an observer or by an instrument . for example , a mercury thermometer converts the measured temperature into the expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube . video cameras and a digital cameras have an image sensor . there are many different types of sensors . some are used in everyday objects , and some are separate . a sensor that detects temperature . thermal sensors are in many laptops and computers in order to sound an alarm when a certain temperature has been exceeded . - temperature sensors : thermometers , thermostats - heat sensors : bolometer , calorimeter an electronic device used to measure a physical quantity such as pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind ( e.g . a voltage ) . - electrical resistance sensors : ohmmeter - electrical voltage sensors : voltmeter - electrical power sensors : watt-hour meter - magnetism sensors : magnetic compass
