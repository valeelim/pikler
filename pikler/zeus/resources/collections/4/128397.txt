Damn Small Linux     damn small linux or dsl is a free operating system for the x86 family of personal computers . it was designed to run graphical applications on older pc hardwareâ€”for example , machines with 486/early pentium processors and very little memory . dsl is a live cd with a size of 50 mb . what originally started as an experiment to see how much software could fit in 50 mb eventually became a full-fledged linux distribution . it can be installed on storage media with small capacities , like bootable business cards , usb flash drives , various memory cards , and zip drives . dsl was originally conceived and maintained by john andrews . the community now includes robert shingledecker , who created the mydsl system , dsl control panel , and other features . dsl was originally based on model-k , a 22 mb stripped-down version of knoppix , but soon after was based on knoppix proper , allowing much easier remastering and improvements . dsl supports only x86 pcs . the minimum system requirements are a 486 processor and 8 mb of ram . dsl has been demonstrated browsing the web with dillo , running simple games and playing music on systems with a 486 processor and 16 mb of ram . the system requirements are higher for running mozilla firefox and optional add-ons such as the openoffice.org office suite .
