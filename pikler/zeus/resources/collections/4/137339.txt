Attack model     attack models or attack types specify how much information a cryptanalyst has access to when `` breaking '' or `` cracking '' an encrypted message , commonly known as codebreaking or cracking the code . some common attack models are : - ciphertext-only attack - known-plaintext attack - chosen-plaintext attack - chosen-ciphertext attack - adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack - indifferent chosen-ciphertext attack the ciphertext-only attack model is the weakest because it implies that the cryptanalyst has just the encoded message . different attack models are used for other cryptographic systems , or more generally for all kind of security systems . examples for such attack models are : - adaptive chosen-message attack for digital signatures references . - information security laboratory ( powerpoint ) other websites . - university of colorado at boulder 's introduction to cryptography and attack models ( pdf ) - university of waterloo paper that discusses attack models ( postscript file ) html version
