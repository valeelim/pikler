Gorgon     in greek mythology , the gorgons were female monsters that had fangs and serpents for hair with bronze claws . they were the daughters of phorkys and keto . the serpents in their hair were special : everyone who looked at them was turned to stone . there were three gorgons , named stheno , euryale and medusa . only medusa was mortal . she was beheaded by perseus . medusa 's head was brought to athena . there are many motives showing athena with an aegis , and a gorgon 's head on her chest . homer only talks about one gorgon . hesiod names all three , stheno , the powerful one , euryale , who could jump far , and trouble-ridden medusa , the queen . according to hesiod , they lived at the edge of the known world , in the atlas mountains . at a later time , libya is also named as their home . with hellenism came the myth that the gorgo was a sister of alexander the great . in this myth , she is a neck , a water spirit . the sailors of each passing boat are asked whether he is still alive . if they answer no , she takes the boat and the sailors into the water . the answer that saves the lives of the seamen is `` yes , and he reigns as a king '' ( greek : ζεί και βασιλέβει ) .
