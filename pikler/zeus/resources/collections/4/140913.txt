Ancient Church of the East     the ancient church of the east is an assyrian church . the church separated from the assyrian church of the east . this happened because mar shimun xxiii , the patriarch of assyrian church of the east introduced reforms which were not supported . these reforms included changes such as those of using the new roman calendar rather than the old calendar . the people who did not support the changes thought they were opposed to the sanctity of being one of the oldest christian churches in the world . for this reason , the followers of the ancient church of the east resisted the changes made to the church . mar thoma darmo , a native of mesopotamia , who was metropolitan of the assyrian church of the east in india from 1952 to 1968 , based at trichur separated from the assyrian church of the east . he became the head of the ancient church of the east in october 1968 and moved to baghdad . he died the following year . after his death , mar addai ii was elected to replace him . since january 2011 the synod of the ancient church of the east has split between those accepting the patriarchate of mar addai ii and those old calendarists rejecting it .
