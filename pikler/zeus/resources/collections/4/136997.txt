Thermosphere     the thermosphere is the fourth layer of the earth 's atmosphere which lies directly above the mesosphere ( middle layer ) and directly below the exosphere ( top layer ) . the name thermosphere is taken from the greek word `` thermos `` which means heat . this layer has high temperatures because it absorbs ionizing radiation . even though it has temperatures of 2,000 °c ( 3,360 °f ) , the density of the thermosphere is so low that it does n't feel hot . within this layer , ultraviolet radiation causes ionization . that is why it is also called the ionosphere . shortwave radio waves can bounce off the kennelly-heaviside layer ( ionosphere ) and go to distant parts of the earth . this layer is very helpful in radio communication .
