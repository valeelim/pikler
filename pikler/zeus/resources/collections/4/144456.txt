Doenjang     doenjang is a korean soybean paste . it is salty and savory , and is used to season many kinds of korean food . it is similar to miso , japanese soybean paste . the history of doenjang begins before the period of three kingdoms . books from the chosun dynasty explain the way to make good doenjang , saying that if doenjang in a house tastes bad , food in the house tastes bad . this means doenjang has been an important food in korea for a long time . the main ingredients of doenjang are sea water and `` meju '' . the basic way to make doenjang is to take mejus and put them into big jars with sea water . bad bacteria and odor are removed by adding charcoal and sun-dried chili peppers . liquid is then taken out to make korean soy sauce . this sauce takes about 20 to 30 days to make . the mejus are taken out from the jar and tempered . salt and soy sauce is added on this paste and the paste is put in jars again . after sun-drying for several days , it becomes doenjang . there are several kinds of doenjang ; chungukjang , makjang , dambukjang , bbamjangbbagaejang , patjang , jipjang , garoojang , and borijang . each is made in different ways using different ingredients or at different times of the year . for example , chungukjang is made within two to three days , whereas the other take longer time to make . patjang uses red bean . makjang is made in spring .
