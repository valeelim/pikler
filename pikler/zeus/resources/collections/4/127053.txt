Dust Bowl     the `` dust bowl '' is a phrase used to describe prairie regions of the united states and canada in the 1930s . the dust bowl spread from saskatchewan and manitoba to the north , all the way to oklahoma and parts of texas and new mexico in the south . in these areas , there were many serious dust storms and droughts during the 1930s . these caused major damage to the dust bowl areas ' economies , ecology , and agriculture . the people who lived in the dust bowl area were mostly farmers . many years of intense farming without rain left the soil dry . when strong winds blew , they covered cities , towns , and farms in dried , dusty soil , ruining the farmland . one famous storm on april 14 , 1935 , called `` black sunday '' , was so bad it covered dozens of cities in black clouds of dust and made it impossible to see the sky or even a few feet ahead . writer timothy egan says that the black sunday storm `` carried away twice as much dirt as was dug out of the earth to create the panama canal . '' the dust bowl period is still considered one of the worst environmental disasters in united states history . many thousands of people died from breathing in the dust , or from starvation . many others who survived lost everything they had , and left the dust bowl to look for work in other parts of the country . these people were called `` dust bowl refugees .
