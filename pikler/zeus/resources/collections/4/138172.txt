Avalanche effect     in cryptography , the avalanche effect refers to an attractive property of block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions algorithms . the avalanche effect is satisfied if : 1. the output changes significantly ( e.g. , half the output bits flip ) as a result of a slight change in input ( e.g. , flipping a single bit ) 1. in `` quality '' block ciphers , such a small change in either the key or the plaintext should cause a strong change in the ciphertext . both of above features allow small changes to propagate rapidly through iterations of the algorithm , in such a way that every bit of the output should depend on every bit of the input before the algorithm terminates . the term `` avalanche effect '' was first used by horst feistel ( feistel 1973 ) , although the concept was identified by `` shannon 's property of confusion '' . if a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree , then it has poor randomization , and thus a cryptanalyst can make forecasts about the input , if given only the output . this may be sufficient to partially or completely break ( crack ) the algorithm .
