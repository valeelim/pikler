C. Everett Koop     charles everett koop ( october 14 , 1916 â€“ february 25 , 2013 ) was an american physician who became well known as a pediatric surgeon at the children 's hospital of philadelphia . he was an early name in today 's pediatric surgery , and then served as the surgeon general of the united states and as vice admiral in the public health service commissioned corps from 1982 to 1989 , under president ronald reagan . he was thought of as the first `` celebrity surgeon general '' , because he is the first surgeon general to receive an emmy award , and remains the only surgeon general to have done so . koop was also called chick koop by some of his friends . today koop is well known for four parts of his work : - abortion : though koop did not think abortion was right due to his religion , he did not say anything as to whether abortions done by very skilled medical doctors were bad for the health of women who the abortions were being done on . - tobacco : in 1984 he wrote that nicotine has an addictiveness like that of heroin or cocaine . people did not think that koop would say something like this , mainly people who thought he would stay with the views his office had on tobacco products . he also wanted a warning to be mentioned on all cigarette packs , although some of these warnings were there since 1965 .
