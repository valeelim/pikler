Anti-nuclear movement in California     the 1970s proved to be a pivotal period for the anti-nuclear movement in california . there was confrontation between nuclear power advocates and environmentalists . in 1981 , 1,900 activists were arrested during protests at diablo canyon power plant . in 1984 , the davis city council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone . california has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal . the start of the anti-nuclear movement in california was the controversy over pacific gas & electric 's attempt to build the nation 's first nuclear power plant in bodega bay . this conflict began in 1958 and ended in 1964 , with the forced abandonment of these plans . subsequent plans to build a nuclear power plant in malibu were also abandoned . the anti-nuclear movement grew in california between 1964 and 1974. it was during this period that some scientists and engineers began supporting the positions of the activists . they were influenced by the non-material philosophy that had inspired activists and had impacted the public consciousness . while californian voters failed to pass a 1972 proposal placing a 5-year moratorium on nuclear plant construction , anti-nuclear groups campaigned to stop construction of several proposed plants in the seventies , especially those located on the coast and near fault lines . these proposals included the sundesert nuclear power plant , which was never built .
