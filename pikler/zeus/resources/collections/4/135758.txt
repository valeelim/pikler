Secure Shell     secure shell ( ssh ) is an internet communication protocol used mostly to allow users to log into other computers and run commands . it lets people exchange data using a secure channel between two computers . it is used mainly on linux , macintosh and unix computers . it is a lot like telnet , but is safer . it is less likely to be hacked than telnet is . a person can make a key out of numbers . this key has two parts , a private part that should not be shared and a public part that should be . these parts are mathematically related to each . to send a message to a computer , the message is encrypted with the sender 's private key and the receiver 's public key . this is done in such a way that the message can only be read if the receiver has their private key and the sender 's public key . this means that an attacker can not read the messages without both keys . ssh was designed by tatu yl√∂nen in 1995 to replace the less secure protocols rlogin , telnet and rsh , which were used to access shell accounts on remote computers .
