Mast-Allah     a mast-allah is a kind of spiritual person in the part of the muslim religion called sufism . masts sometimes seem strange or crazy to people who do n't know about them , but sufis of iran , pakistan , and india believe they are not really crazy , but are saints . the indian teacher meher baba asked a doctor named william donkin to write a book about masts called `` the wayfarers . '' wayfarer means wanderer , and the book 's title implied that masts are on a spiritual journey . meher baba wrote the introduction of the book . in his introduction meher baba explained that masts are traveling along an internal path and are lost because they are so dazzled ( amazed ) by the sights they see . they are so amazed and dazzled by these sights they see that they forget how to act normally . so meher baba says they are like people who are drunk , only the masts are not drunk on alcohol but on god and are very close to god . references . - purdom , charles b. : `` the god-man : the life , journeys & work of meher baba with an interpretation of his silence & spiritual teaching '' , george allen & unwin , london , 1964
