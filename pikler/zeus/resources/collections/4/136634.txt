RC4     in cryptography , rc4 ( also known as arc4 or arcfour meaning alleged rc4 , see below ) is one of the most common software stream ciphers . it is used in popular protocols like secure sockets layer ( ssl ) ( to protect internet traffic ) and wep ( to secure wireless networks ) . rc4 is known for being simple and quick , but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed , or one keystream is used twice ; some ways of using rc4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as wep . rc4 was created by ron rivest of rsa security in 1987. while its official name is `` rivest cipher 4 '' , the rc acronym is also known to stand for `` ron 's code '' ( see also rc2 , rc5 and rc6 ) . rc4 was first created as a trade secret , but in september 1994 a description of it was posted to the cypherpunks mailing list . it was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup , and from there to many websites on the internet . the code was confirmed to be genuine ( not fake ) as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed rc4 . because the algorithm is known , it is no longer a trade secret . the name `` rc4 '' is trademarked , however . rc4 is often referred to as `` arcfour '' or `` arc4 '' ( meaning alleged rc4 , because rsa has never officially released the algorithm ) , to avoid possible trademark problems . it has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards , including wep and wpa for wireless cards and tls .
