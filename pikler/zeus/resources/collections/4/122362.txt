Status Quo     status quo , also known as the quo or just quo , is a rock band from england . they were called `` the status quo '' in late 1967 , and settled on the name `` status quo '' in 1970. they have recorded over 60 chart hits in the uk , and have sold a total of 118 million records worldwide . they have also had a total of 33 hit albums in the uk charts - more than any other band other than the rolling stones . their hayday was in the early to mid '70 's with hits like caroline , whatever you want , and down down . they formed in 1962 , changed their name to the status quo in 1967 and to status quo in 1969. although sometimes criticized for a repetitive and apparently simple guitar riff sequence and harmonies on many of their numbers , their musical versatility can be heard in some of their earlier or less well-known numbers , such as ice in the sun , pictures of matchstick men and forty-five hundred times . the latter probably highlights , more than any other , rossi and parfitt 's talent for close vocal and guitar harmonies , which owe much to the english folk and folk/rock genres . whether intentional or not this has become their hallmark .
