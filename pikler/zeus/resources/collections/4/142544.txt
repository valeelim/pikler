Cathode     a cathode is a type of electrode through which electrons move . electrodes are an electrical conductor ( usually a metal ) that is connected to something that is not a metal . the cathode type of electrode delivers electrons ( negative charge ) and the anode collects electrons ( has the positive charge ) . this lets an electrical current go into an electrical device such as a battery . it can also end in a vacuum , like in a cathode ray tube . in this case , the electrons may go into open space . in other words , a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell . electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing . so electrons go into the + terminal of a battery , but electric current goes out . electrons go into the - terminal of an electrolytic cell , but electric current goes out . an electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed an anode because it is positively charged . an anode is a negative electrode on a battery and a positive electrode on an electrolytic cell .
