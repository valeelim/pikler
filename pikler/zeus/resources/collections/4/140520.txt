Pierre-Auguste Renoir     pierre-auguste renoir ( 25 february 1841–3 december 1919 ) was a french artist . he was a leading painter who helped to create the impressionist style . he painted portraits , and still life , but above all , he painted social scenes of the day . as a painter of women , it has been said that `` renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from rubens to watteau '' . pierre-auguste renoir was born in limoges , haute-vienne , france , the child of a working class family . as a boy , he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china . he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school . during those early years , he often visited the louvre to study the french master painters . in the late 1860s , through the practice of painting light and water `` en plein air '' ( in the open air ) , he and his friend claude monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black , but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them , an effect today known as diffuse reflection . several pairs of paintings exist in which renoir and monet , working side-by-side , depicted the same scenes ( `` la grenouillère '' , 1869 ) .
