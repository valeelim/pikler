Cryptographic protocol     a cryptographic protocol ( also known as encryption protocol or security protocol ) is an abstract or an existing protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods . a protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information . the description of a protocol must include details about all data structures and representations , and all details about how to utilize the protocol by programs . cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application-level data transport , in order to secure transferred messages . a cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features : - key generation . - entity authentication . - key agreement . - symmetric encryption of transferred messages using the agreed generated key . the term `` cryptographic protocol '' is used in different ways . for example , cryptographic `` application '' protocols often use one or more underlying key-agreement protocols which are also sometimes themselves referred to as `` cryptographic protocols '' , like the secure sockets layer ( ssl ) which uses what is known as the diffie-hellman key exchange , diffie-hellman may be seen as a complete `` cryptographic protocol '' in itself for other applications .
