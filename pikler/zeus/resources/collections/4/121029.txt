Progressive metal     progressive metal ( often called prog metal ) is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that mixes the powerful , guitar-driven sound of metal with the complexity of progressive rock , which includes odd time signatures and complicated instrumental playing . some progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music . like progressive rock songs , progressive metal songs are usually much longer than other metal songs , and they are often themed in concept albums . as a result , progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs . the origins of progressive metal started with progressive rock bands from the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s such as yes , pink floyd , jethro tull , king crimson , genesis , kansas and rush . however , progressive metal did not evolve into a genre of its own until the mid-1980s . bands such as queensr√øche , fates warning and dream theater took certain aspects of progressive rock music and mixed them with heavy metal styles .
