Porta Alchemica     porta alchemica ( english : `` alchemical door '' ) , or alchemy gate or magic portal , is an ancient monument built between 1678 and 1680 by `` massimiliano palombara '' marquis of pietraforte ( 1614-1680 ) in his residence , palombara villa , located in the east of rome on the `` esquilino '' hill in a position almost corresponding to `` piazza vittorio '' , where today was placed . porta alchemica is the only survivor of the five gates of the palombara villa , there was an lost door on the opposite side enabling to give it a date of 1680 , there were also four other inscriptions lost on the walls of the mansion inside the villa . according to a legend dated 1802 sent us by the scholar `` francesco girolamo cancellieri '' , a pilgrim `` stibeum '' ( from latin : `` stibium '' = antimony ) was hosted in the villa for a night . the `` pellegrino '' , identifiable with the alchemist `` giustiniani bono '' , stayed for a night in the gardens of the villa in search of a mysterious herb capable of producing gold , the next morning he was seen disappearing forever through the door , but left behind a few flakes of gold fruit of a successful alchemical transmutation , and a mysterious paper full of puzzles and magic symbols that would contain the secret of the philosopher 's stone .
