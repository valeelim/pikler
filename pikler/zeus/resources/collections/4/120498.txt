Object-oriented design     object-oriented design ( ood ) is a way for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do , using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think . people think in terms of classes and objects . for example , fruit is a class , and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapples . if a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket , then he or she would specify the program in terms of classes and objects which is how people think . a computer program called a compiler and/or an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run . computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers . object-oriented-design ( ood ) uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programs , by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think .
