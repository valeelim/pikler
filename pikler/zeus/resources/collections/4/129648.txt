Saffron     saffron ( ) ( persian : زَعْفَرَان ) is a spice made from the stigma of the flower of the saffron plant . the spice is used in cooking as a seasoning and as a food colouring . it is native to southwest asia . it is the world 's most costly spice , and has been for a long time . saffron has a bitter taste and smells like hay . this smell is caused by the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal . saffron also contains a dye , crocin , that gives food a rich golden colour . saffron is a part of many foods from around the world , and is also used in medicine . the word `` saffron '' comes from the 12th century old french word ' , which comes from the latin word ' . ' is also related to the italian ' and spanish ' . `` safranum '' comes from the arabic word ' ( ) , which means `` yellow '' . the cultivated saffron ( saffron crocus `` c. sativus '' ) flowers in the autumn and comes up every year , so it is known as a perennial plant . it does not grow wild , and is now a triploid form of the eastern mediterranean plant called `` crocus cartwrightianus '' . it is thought that `` c. cartwrightianus '' came from crete . the saffron crocus resulted when `` c. cartwrightianus '' was subjected to a lot of artificial selection by growers who wanted plants with longer stigmas . it can not reproduce because the saffron crocus 's purple flowers do not produce useful seeds . this means that reproduction needs human help . the corms ( underground bulb-like starch-storing organs ) must be dug up , broken apart , and planted again . a corm lives for only one season , reproducing by splitting into up to ten `` cormlets '' that will grow into new plants . the corms are small brown balls up to in diameter and are covered in thick parallel fibres .
