Complex instruction set computer     a complex instruction set computer ( acronym cisc pronounced `` sisk '' ) , represents a cpu design method in which each instruction can execute several low-level operations , such as a load from memory , an arithmetic operation , and a memory store , all in a single instruction . the term is used in contrast to reduced instruction set computer ( risc ) . the terms risc and cisc have become less meaningful with the continued improvements of both cisc and risc designs and implementations . the first highly pipelined `` cisc '' implementations , such as intel 80486 series , supports every instruction that their predecessors did , but achieved `` high efficiency '' only on a few simple x86 subset ( similar to a risc instruction set , but without the `` load-store '' limitations of risc ) . modern x86 processors also decode and split more complex instructions into a series of smaller internal `` micro-operations '' which can thereby be executed in a pipelined ( parallel ) fashion , thus achieving high performance on a much larger subset of instructions .
