Bas-Rhin     bas-rhin is a department in the grand est region of france , named after the moselle river . the prefecture ( capital ) of bas-rhin is strasbourg . bas-rhin means `` lower rhine '' , however , geographically speaking it belongs to the `` upper rhine '' region . this is the last french department to have kept the term bas , meaning `` lower '' , in its name . other departments using this word preferred to change their names . bas-rhin is one of the original 83 departments created during the french revolution on 4 march 1790. it was divided in four districts : haguenau , benfeld , strasbourg and wissembourg , with strasbourg as is capital . soon , the district of sarre-union was created and the the name of the district of benfeld was changed to sélestat ( in its origins , schlestadt ) . in 1800 , with the creation of the `` arrondissements '' in france , the five districts were changed into four `` arrondissements '' : strasbourg , barr , saverne and wissembourg . the subprefecture of barr is moved to schlestadt ( sélestat ) in 1806 .
