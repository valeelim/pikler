Vitaceae     vitaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants including the grape and virginia creeper . the family name comes from the genus `` vitis '' . the name sometimes appears as vitidaceae , but vitaceae is a conserved name and therefore has priority over both vitidaceae and another name sometimes found in the older literature , ampelidaceae . the relationships of vitaceae are unclear and the family does not appear to have any close relatives . in the cronquist system , the family was placed near the family rhamnaceae in order rhamnales . the family was placed in the rosid clade , but not classified in an order , by the angiosperm phylogeny group ( apg ) . the angiosperm phylogeny web places vitaceae in its own order , vitales . recent phylogenetic analyses support vitaceae as the sister-group to all other rosids ( jansen et al . 2006 ) . most vitis species have 38 chromosomes ( n=19 ) , but 40 ( n=20 ) in subgenus muscadinia , while ampelocissus , parthenocissus , and ampelopsis also have 40 chromosomes ( n=20 ) and cissus has 24 chromosomes ( n=12 ) .
