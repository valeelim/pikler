Subculture     a subculture is a group of people involved in a community of some sort . subcultures can be hobbies , groups or communities . a subculture is a group of people with a culture ( whether distinct or hidden ) which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to , known as the `` dominant '' culture . if a subculture is described as opposing the dominant culture , it may be described as a counterculture . as ken gelder notes , subcultures are social , with their own shared rules , values and rituals , but they can also seem self-involvedâ€”another thing that makes them different from countercultures . subcultures can be shown to be different because of the age , race , ethnicity , social class , location , or gender of the members . the qualities that determine a subculture as different from each other may be linguistic , aesthetic , religious , political , sexual , geographical , or a combination of factors . members of a subculture often signal each other through the use of fashion style , certain behaviors , and use of a secret language created to prevent others not in their group from understanding them ( this is known as argot ) . they also live out particular relations to places : ken gelder talks about 'subcultural geographies ' along these lines .
