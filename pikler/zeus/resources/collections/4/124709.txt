Cod wars     the cod wars , also called the iceland cod wars ( icelandic : `` þorskastríðin '' , `` the cod wars '' , or `` landhelgisstríðin '' , `` the wars for the territorial waters '' ) were a series of confrontations in the 1950s and 1970s between the united kingdom and iceland regarding fishing rights in the north atlantic . the name of the conflict may be derived from a pun on the term `` cold war '' ( with `` cod '' reading so similarly to `` cold '' ) , possibly via the british tabloid press . in 1972 , iceland unilaterally declared an exclusive economic zone extending beyond its territorial waters , before announcing plans to reduce over-fishing . it policed its quota system with the coast guard , leading to a series of net-cutting incidents with british trawlers that fished the areas . as a result , a fleet of british royal naval warships and tug-boats was employed to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of british fishing crews by the icelandic craft . in 1976 , a compromise between the two states allowed a maximum of 24 british trawlers access to the disputed 200 nautical mile ( 370 km ) limit . two-hundred-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones became recognized internationally on november 14 , 1994 , after having been agreed at the conference on the third united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) in 1982 .
