Digital signal processing     digital signal processing ( dsp ) is concerned with the processing of digital signals or analog signals after converting from analog to digital format . dsp includes subfields like : communication signals processing , radar signal processing , sensor array processing , digital image processing , etc . dsp is usually used with real-world analog signals found in our lives , the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form , by using an analog-to-digital converter . often , the required output signal is another real-world analog signal , which requires a digital-to-analog converter . digital signal processing algorithms can run on : 1. general purpose microprocessors and standard computers . 1. specialized processors called digital signal processors ( dsps ) . 1. purpose-built hardware such as application-specific integrated circuit ( asics ) and field-programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) . 1. digital signal controllers ( mostly for industrial applications such as motor control ) .
