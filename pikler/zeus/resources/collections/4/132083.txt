Waggle dance     the waggle dance is a special 'figure-of-eight ' dance that is done by the honey bee in its hive . by this , a worker tells the others where it has found nectar . this was shown by the austrian ethologist karl von frisch . the dance is a type of communication for bees . it is done to give other bees information about the direction and distance to flowers that have nectar or pollen , or both . it is also used to tell the bees where water can be found . the dance is used for bees to get others to help them collect resources for the hive . it used to be thought that bees have two distinct `` recruitment '' dances . there were the `` round dances '' and waggle dances . round dances were thought to be used for things that were close by and wiggle dances were for things farther away . it is now known that a round dance is only a waggle dance with a very short `` waggle run '' ( see below ) . a waggle dance is made up of one to 100 or more circuits . each circuit has two phases . these phases are the waggle phase and the return phase . when a bee returns to the hive after finding a good food source , it performs the dance . the bee will run through a small wave-like pattern ( a waggle run or waggle phase ) . after this , it will turn to the right and circle back to the starting point ( the return phase ) . it will then do another waggle run and then turn to the left and circle back to the beginning . the waggle phase of the dance is the most notable and informative part of the dance .
