Copy-on-write     copy-on-write ( cow ) is a means of optimisation in computer science . when several callers ask for the same resource , they can all be given a pointer to the same address . only when they try to change the resource does a local copy need to be made . this happens without the caller noticing . it is done so that all the other callers do not see the change they did not do .
