Cleartext     in telecommunications , cleartext is the form of a message or data which is in a form that is immediately understandable to a human being without additional processing . in particular , it implies that this message is sent or stored without cryptographic protection . the phrases , `` in clear '' , `` en clair '' and `` in the clear '' are the same . it is close to , but not entirely the same as , the term `` plaintext '' . formally , plaintext is information that is fed as an input to a coding process , while ciphertext is what comes out of that process . plaintext might be compressed , coded , or otherwise changed before it is converted to ciphertext , so it is quite common to find plaintext that is not cleartext . websites using insecure http send using cleartext , with all data supplied ( including usernames and passwords ) being sent from the user 's computer through the internet using cleartext . anyone with access to the medium used to carry the data ( the routers , computers , telecommunications equipment , wireless transmissions , and so on ) may read the password , username , and anything else sent to the website .
