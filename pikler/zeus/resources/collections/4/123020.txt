Assembly language     an assembly language is a programming language that can be used to directly tell the computer what to do . an assembly language is almost exactly like the machine language that a computer can understand , except that it uses words in place of numbers . a computer can not really understand an assembly program directly . however , it can easily change the program into machine code by replacing the words of the program with the numbers that they stand for . a program that does that is called an assembler . programs written in assembly language are usually made of `` instructions '' , which are small tasks that the computer performs when it is running the program . they are called instructions because the programmer uses them to instruct the computer what to do . the part of the computer that follows the instructions is the processor . the assembly language of a computer is a low-level language , which means that it can only be used to do the simple tasks that a computer can understand directly . in order to perform more complex tasks , one must tell the computer each of the simple tasks that are part of the complex task . for example , a computer does not understand how to print a sentence on its screen . instead , a program written in assembly must tell it how to do all of the small steps that are involved in printing the sentence .
