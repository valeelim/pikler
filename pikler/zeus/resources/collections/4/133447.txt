Paranthropus     paranthropus is an extinct genus of robust australopithecines . they probably descended from the gracile australopithecine `` australopithecus '' . all species of `` paranthropus '' were bipedal , and many lived during a time when species of the genus `` homo '' , such as `` homo ergaster '' and `` homo erectus '' , were living . `` paranthropus '' first appeared roughly 2.7 million years ago . most species of `` paranthropus '' had a brain about 40 percent of the size of modern man . there was some size variation between the different species of `` paranthropus '' , but most stood roughly 1.3-1.4 m ( 4.26 to 4.59 feet ) tall and were quite well muscled . `` paranthropus '' is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of the `` australopithecus '' . `` australopithecus '' and `` paranthropus '' also looked very different from each other . these differences were only found in remains of the skull . the other parts of the skeleton were still very similar , so it is reasonable to think the difference was an adaptation to different food . `` paranthropus '' was more massively built as to skull and teeth . it often had gorilla-like sagittal crests on the cranium which anchored massive temporalis muscles for chewing .
