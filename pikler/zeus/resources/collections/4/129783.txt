WikiLeaks     wikileaks is a non-profit organization which uses its website to publish governmental , private data , corporate or religious documents that had previously been secret . the website was started in 2006 , and had over 1.2 million documents in its database by the time one year had passed . usually , it does not give out the names and addresses of people who post documents . the site is based in sweden . though its name is similar to wikipedia , it is not related to wikipedia or the wikimedia foundation . the name was chosen because wikileaks used a wiki model at first , where people could edit the site , but it has since changed and is no longer open for editing . in july 2010 , wikileaks was in the news for publishing over 76,900 documents related to the war in afghanistan . in october that same year , wikileaks posted almost 400,000 documents that were about the war in iraq . this was the largest ever leak of documents about the us army . it reported mainly on deaths of civilians , soldiers , and sightings of homemade bombs or armed civilians .
