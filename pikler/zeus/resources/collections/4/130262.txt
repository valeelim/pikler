Excelsior Stadium     the excelsior stadium is the home of airdrie united f.c . of the scottish first division . the ground is named as such as a tribute to the fact that airdrieonians began life as excelsior football club in 1878. when the stadium first opened it was officially titled shyberry excelsior stadium ( `` shyberry '' being the company who sponsored the stadium when it first opened ) . now , though , even the name `` excelsior stadium '' is rarely used by airdrie united supporters as well as opposing fans and even the media as the stadium has instead come to be referred to as new broomfield which is more palatable from an airdrie perspective due to its association with the former home of airdrieonians , broomfield park .
