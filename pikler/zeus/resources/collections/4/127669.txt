Personal space     personal space is a concept from sociology . the concept talks about two actors ( two people ) . the basic idea behind it is these actors have space around them . the closer they are to each other emotionally , the closer an actor will be able to stand to the other , without being intrusive . the concept was introduced by edward t. hall in 1966. discomfort will result if one actor steps into the personal space of the other , without this being desired . the amount of space a being needs can be classified in two categories : - immediate individual physical space ( determined by imagined limits ) - a space an individual considers theirs to live in ; this is often called territory or habitat . its size is dependent on many things , such as growth needs , habits , courtships , etc . hall 's spacing models were based on heini hediger 's 1955 psychological studies of zoo animals .
