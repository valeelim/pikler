Air New Zealand Flight 901     air new zealand flight 901 was a flight that operated from 1977 to 1979. the flight did not stop in antarctica . it was a sightseeing flight to antarctica . it was supposed to loop between auckland , new zealand , and antarctica . the flight 's route had been changed without the crew 's knowledge shortly before the plane took off . because the weather conditions of the antarctic were so bad ( severely limiting visibility ) , and the crew believed they were following the original flight plan-the plane crashed straight into mount erebus . none of the 257 people on board the plane survived the crash . the original investigation showed it was the pilot 's fault , but people protested and it led to an inquiry into the crash . the conclusion was the accident was caused by a correction made to the route the night before the disaster , and they failed to inform pilot captain jim collins and co-pilot greg cassin .
