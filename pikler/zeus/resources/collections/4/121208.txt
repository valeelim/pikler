Direct-to-video     a movie that is released direct-to-video ( also known as made-for-video , straight-to-video , more recently , straight-to-dvd ) is one which has been released to the public on home video formats ( historically vhs ) before or without being released in movie theaters or broadcast on television . the term is also at times used as an insulting term for sequels of movies that are not expected to have financial success . direct-to-video releases can occur for several reasons . often a production studio will develop a tv show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons : poor quality , lack of support from a tv network , controversial nature , or a simple lack of general public interest . studios , limited in the annual number of movies they grant cinematic releases to , may choose to pull the completed movie from the theaters , or never exhibit it in theaters at all . studios then recover some of their losses through video sales and rentals . in the case of a tv show , low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show , possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes . if the show has a considerable fanbase , the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recover losses. `` '' and `` firefly '' are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on dvd . occasionally outstanding dvd sales may revive a canceled show , as in the case of `` family guy '' .originally canceled in 2004 , the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent dvd sales .
