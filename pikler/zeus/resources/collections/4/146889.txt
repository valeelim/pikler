Manchester Metrolink     manchester metrolink ( or usually just metrolink ) is the name of the tram system in greater manchester , england . the system is owned by transport for greater manchester ( tfgm ) , which used to be called the greater manchester passenger transport executive ( gmpte ) . it is operated under contract by the ratp group . the construction of manchester 's railway network in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had created a lot of termini around the city centre . these were not linked together . this left a large amount of manchester disconnected from the railway network . for many years there had been plans to connect manchester 's two main railway stations . these are piccadilly and victoria . in the late 1960s and early 1970s there were plans for a `` picc-vic tunnel '' . this tunnel would carry main-line trains under the city centre . the proposal was abandoned because it would cost too much . metrolink was created by converting two british rail lines serving the suburbs of manchester , one to the town of altrincham to the south , and another to the town of bury to the north , to light rail . these two lines were joined up in manchester city centre , where trams run on the roads , and had a short branch to piccadilly railway station . this first section of the new system opened in 1992 , and a newer line to eccles opened in 2001 .
