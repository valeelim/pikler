Syllogism     a syllogism is a deduction . it is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition ( the `` conclusion '' ) is inferred from two or more others ( the premises ) . the idea is an invention of aristotle . in the `` prior analytics '' , aristotle defines the syllogism as `` a discourse in which , certain things having been supposed , something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so '' . ( 24b18â€“20 ) each proposition must have some form of the verb 'to be ' in it . a categorical syllogism is like a little machine built of three parts : the major premise , the minor premise and the conclusion . each of these parts is a proposition and , from the first two , the `` truth value '' of the third part is decided . each of the three distinct terms represents a category . in the above example , `` men , '' `` mortal , '' and `` greeks . '' `` mortal '' is the major term ; `` greeks '' , the minor term . the premises also have one term in common with each other , which is known as the `` middle term '' ; in this example , `` man . '' both of the premises are universal , as is the conclusion .
