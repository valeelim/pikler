Magazine circulation     a magazine 's circulation is the number of copies it usually distributes for each issue . it is one of the main factors used to determine how much money they will charge businesses to advertise in the magazine . is not always the same as copies sold , which is usually called paid circulation , because many magazines are distributed to readers without making them pay anything . this is more true for magazines dealing with business and professional topics . when determining readership figures , which is how many people read an issue , the number is usually considered to be higher than the circulation figures because of the assumption that most copies of the magazine are read by more than one person . in many countries , circulation figures are checked by companies that do not work for the magazine , such as the audit bureau of circulations , to make sure that the numbers a publisher gives to advertisers is accurate .
