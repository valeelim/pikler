British Rail Class 08     the british rail class 08 is a class of diesel locomotive designed for shunting . it was the standard br diesel-electric shunter . it was based on the lms 12033 series ( later tops class 11 ) . production started in 1953 and when it finished in 1962 , the class had become the most numerous of all british classes , numbering 996 in total . there were also 26 of the near-identical but higher geared class 09 , and 171 similar locomotives fitted with different engines and transmissions ( some of which became class 10 ) , which together brought the total number of outwardly-similar machines to 1193. since their introduction , rail freight has primarily moved to fixed-rate bulk freight traffic and intermodal freight operations which reduce or remove the need for shunting , therefore only a few class 08 locomotives remain in service today .
