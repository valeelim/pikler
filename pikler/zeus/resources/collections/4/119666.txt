Flemish Brabant     flemish brabant ( dutch : `` vlaams-brabant '' , french : `` brabant flamand '' ) is the youngest and smallest province of the flemish region , one of the three regions of belgium . it covers the dutch-speaking northern part of the former province of brabant . flemish brabant also completely surrounds the brussels-capital region , which forms an enclave within the territory of the province . its capital , and also the largest city of the province , is the university city of leuven ( , often used in english ) . `` flemish '' in `` flemish brabant '' means that it is in the flemish part of the former province of brabant of belgium . `` brabant '' was an old region , the duchy of brabant . the word `` brabant '' appears for the first time in the seventh century when the abbey of nivelles was founded in the `` pagus bracbatensis '' ( `` pagus '' is a latin word meaning a very small town , with only few houses ) . flemish brabant was created in 1995 by the splitting of the former province of brabant into three parts : two new provinces , flemish brabant and walloon brabant ; and the brussels-capital region , which no longer belongs to any province . the split was made to accommodate the eventual division of belgium in three regions ( flanders , wallonia and the brussels-capital region ) .
