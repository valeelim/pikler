Circa     circa is latin for `` around '' or `` about '' . it is often used to show when something approximately happened . it is often shortened to c. , ca. , ca or cca . an encyclopedia entry may begin with circa in the date of birth , for example : `` genghis khan ( c. 1162 â€“ august 18 , 1227 ) '' . the `` c. '' means that he was born in about 1162 , but the exact date is not certain . sometimes the circa symbol is italicized to show that it is not in the english language .
