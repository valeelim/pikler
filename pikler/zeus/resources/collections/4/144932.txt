Dipole antenna     the dipole antenna is one of the most important and commonly used type of radio antenna . it is widely used on its own . it is also used in many other radio antenna designs where it forms the radiating or driven element for the antenna . the dipole antenna is made of two poles into which radio frequency current flows . this current and the voltage causes an electromagnetic or radio signal to be radiated . being more specific , a dipole is usually an antenna that uses a resonant length of conductor . this conductor is cut so it can be connected to the what is sending the signal . for resonance , the length of the conductor is an odd number of half wavelengths long . in most cases a single half-wavelength is used . the length of a dipole is very important for selecting the frequency that the antenna will work at . the antenna is an electrical half wavelength , or multiple of half wavelengths . this is not the same length as the wavelength for a signal travelling through air . there are a number of reasons for this . this means that an antenna will be a small amount shorter than the length calculated for a wave moving in air .
