Spontaneous generation     the theory known as spontaneous generation held that complex , living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances . mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat . according to aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants , fleas from putrid matter , mice from dirty hay , crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water , and so forth . in the 17th century these things started to be questioned . sir thomas browne wrote a book called `` pseudodoxia epidemica '' . he subtitled it `` enquiries into very many received tenets , and commonly presumed truths '' . he published it in 1646. he wrote it as an attack on `` false beliefs and `` vulgar errors '' '' . scientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached . for example , alexander ross , a scientist who lived at the same time as browne , wrote about it : `` to question this ( he meant : to question spontaneous generation ) is to question reason , sense and experience . if he doubts of this let him go to egypt , and there he will find the fields swarming with mice , begot of the mud of nylus , to the great calamity of the inhabitants .
