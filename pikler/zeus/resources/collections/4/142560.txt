Knol     knol is a google project which aims to include user-written articles on a range of topics . the project was announced on december 13 , 2007 and opened in beta to the public on july 23 , 2008. when it was opened , there were a few hundred articles mostly about health and medicine . knol pages are `` meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read '' , according to manber . the term `` knol '' , which google defines as a `` unit of knowledge '' , refers to both the project and an article in the project . several experts see knol as google 's attempt to compete with wikipedia , while others point out the differences between the projects . anyone can create and own new knols . there can also be several articles on the same topic , each written by a different author . because multiple articles can have the same title , readers find a topic by searching , rather than just by title . the authors can say who can edit their articles : the public , other authors , or only themselves . they may also choose to include ads from google 's adsense to their knols . knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project . relevant nudity is allowed ( in most countries ) , but pornography , commercial or otherwise , is forbidden . also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content . content designed to promote businesses , products or services is allowed , but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not .
