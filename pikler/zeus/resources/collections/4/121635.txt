Hapkido     hapkido ( ) is a korean martial art . to simple sight it is a combination of techniques of taekwondo with others of aikibudo . its teaching is very much focused to the self-defence . the history of hapkido is enough confused , but many resources believe it to be the work of two koreans : choi yong sul ( 1904-1986 ) and ji han jae ( 1936- ) . when was child , choi had been in japan , where it seems that he worked as servant for the master of daito ryu aiki jutsu , sokaku takeda . choi had demonstrated qualities in daito-ryu aiki-jutsu and often in takeda they sent him in order to face with other persons who performed martial arts . from his return to korea , choi had begun to give classes of martial arts . one of his students , ji han jae , had made korean traditional techniques of kicks and punches ( obtained from taekkyon and from hwarangdo ) a part of the collection of techniques and in result he gave it the name of hapkido in the 1959. besides of choi and ji , many schools of korean martial arts have taken part in the development of several techniques that have helped in causing such hapkido as it is known it .
