Dhole     the dhole ( `` cuon alpinus ) '' is a canid from asia . it is related to dogs and foxes . it is native to central , south and southeast asia . there are many common names for it : asiatic wild dog , indian wild dog , whistling dog , red dog , and mountain wolf . it is most closely related to species in the genus `` canis '' ( dogs and wolves ) , during the pleistocene time period , the dhole lived in asia , europe and north america , but 12,000â€“18,000 years ago it died out everywhere except where it lives now . the dhole lives in big , loosely organised groups with several breeding females . the groups usually have about 12 dholes , but some have over 40. it is awake in the day and hunts in groups . it usually eats medium sized to big hoofed animals . in tropical forests , the dhole competes with tigers and leopards , targeting somewhat different prey species , but still with substantial dietary overlap . it is listed as endangered by the iucn . the population is getting smaller , and there are probably fewer than 2,500 adults left . the reasons for this are lack of habitat , lack of food , competing with other animals , being hunted , and getting diseases from pet dogs .
