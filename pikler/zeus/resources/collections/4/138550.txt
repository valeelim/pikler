Optimization (computer science)    optimization ( computer science ) in computing , optimization is the process of modifying a system to make some features of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources . for instance , a computer program may be optimized so that it runs faster , or to run with less memory requirements or other resources ( see space-time tradeoff ) , or to consume less energy . this is a branch of software engineering . the optimization can have sense at different levels , from the lowest ( development of circuits , writing of machine code designed especially for the architecture ) up to the highest levels of making of implementation , use or design of algorithms . the optimization is generally recommended to leave until the end of the process of development , since the premature optimization can introduce new errors ( generally more difficult to detect for being of algorithmic nature ) . the optimized system may be a single computer program , a collection of computers or even an entire network such as the internet . other websites .
