Alfred Wegener     alfred lothar wegener ( 1 november 1880 â€“ 13 november 1930 ) was a german scientist and meteorologist . he is most notable for his theory of continental drift , which he proposed in 1912. this was the idea that the continents were slowly drifting around the earth . at the time he was unable to demonstrate a mechanism for this movement , and other scientists thought it was simply impossible . his hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s when several discoveries gave evidence of continental drift . wegener was born in berlin and in 1904 he earned his phd in astronomy at the university of berlin . in 1914 he was drafted ( 'called up ' ) into the german army . after he was severely wounded he was transferred to the army weather service . the theory had been proposed before , more than once . the first time was by the mapmaker abraham ortelius in the 16th century . wegener used geologic , fossil , and glacial evidence from opposite sides of the atlantic ocean to support his theory of continental drift . for example , he said that there were geological similarities between the appalachian mountains in north america , and the scottish highlands . also , he said that the rock strata in south africa and brazil were similar .
