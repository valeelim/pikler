Runtime     in computer science , runtime or run time describes the operation of a computer program , the duration of its execution , from beginning to termination . the term runtime can also refer to a virtual machine to manage a program written in a computer language while it is running . run time is sometimes used to mean runtime library , a library of basic code that is used by a particular compiler but when used in this fashion , runtime library is more accurate . a runtime environment is a virtual machine state which provides software services for processes or programs while a computer is running . runtime activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program , optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program , and actual program execution . for example , a program written in java calls for services from the java runtime environment by issuing commands from which the expected result is returned by the java runtime . by providing these services , the java runtime environment is considered the runtime environment of the program . both the program and the java runtime environment request services from the operating system . the operating system kernel provides services for itself and all processes and software running under its control . the operating system may be considered as providing a runtime environment for itself .
