Punic Wars     the punic wars were three wars fought between rome and carthage between 264 and 146 bc , and were probably the largest wars in the ancient world . they are known as the `` punic '' wars because the latin term for carthaginian was `` punici '' ( older `` poenici '' , from their phoenician ancestry ) . the main cause of the punic wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of carthage and the expanding roman republic . carthage lost the three wars . - first punic war 264 to 241 bc . hannibal 's father hamilcar barca was the carthaginian general . - second punic war 218 to 201 bc . hannibal was the carthaginian general . hannibal crossed the alps with war elephants in order to attack rome on land , because they had put their fortifications on the coast , expecting a naval attack . carthage lost when romans invaded africa . - third punic war 149 to 146 bc . carthage lost again and completely destroyed . carthage was a trading nation founded by phoenicians . it was the dominant sea power in the western mediterranean . it was a maritime empire , in contrast to the land-based roman empire . the romans decided they needed sicily , which was then in carthaginian hands . the consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years , and ended in the utter destruction of carthage .
