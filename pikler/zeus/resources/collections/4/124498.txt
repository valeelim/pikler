Aquila (constellation)    aquila ( constellation ) aquila is a constellation . the name means 'eagle ' in latin . the constellation is normally represented as an eagle . aquila is just a few degrees north of the celestial equator . the constellation is best seen in the summer as it is along the milky way . because of this location along the line of our galaxy , many clusters and nebulae are within its borders . however , they are dim and there are not many galaxies . aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer ptolemy . it had been earlier mentioned by eudoxus in the 4th century bc and aratus in the 3rd century bc . it is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the international astronomical union . the greek aquila is probably based on the babylonian constellation of the eagle ( mul.a.mushen ) , which is in the same area as the greek constellation . two major novae have been observed in aquila . the first one was in 389 bc and was recorded as being as bright as venus . the other was in 1918 and is known as ( nova aquilae 1918 ) . it briefly shone brighter than altair , the brightest star in aquila .
