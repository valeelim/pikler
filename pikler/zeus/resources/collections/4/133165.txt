Chirality     chirality is when an object is present in two forms which are mirror images of each other . the two forms can not be superimposed . human hands are chiral . the left hand is a mirror image of the right hand . you can not turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other . this is why you can not put a left handed glove on your right hand , or shake the right hand of a person using your left hand . in chemistry , chirality refers to molecules . if a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but `` otherwise identical '' . chemists call these `` enantiomers '' or `` optical isomers '' . because the difference between right and left hands is easy to understand , chemists call enantiomers either 'right- ' or 'left-handed ' . a mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers is called a `` racemic mixture '' . molecular chirality is quite common . it is found in stereochemistry , inorganic chemistry , organic chemistry , physical chemistry , and biochemistry . the symmetry of a molecule ( or any other object ) tells us whether it is chiral . a molecule is `` achiral '' ( not chiral ) if it has an axis of symmetry .
