Access control     access control is the ability to allow or deny the use of a certain object by a certain person or entity . access control machine can be used in managing physical objects ( such as a movie theater , to which only people with tickets are allowed in ) or digital objects ( for example , a private text document on a computer , which only certain users should be able to read ) . because every person â€™ s fingerprint , iris , voice , retina , face , hand , vein and signature are unique , a biometric time clock provides a quick , accurate , and reliable way to record who is accessing an object or place . that is why many companies now employ biometrics ( systems that identify people based on a body part ) . in recent times , there are large number of biometric systems that are commercially available . such biometric systems are based on unique characteristics of human being . the most common , reliable and successful system is the one based on fingerprints . users are supposed to put their thumb/index finger ( or any specified finger ) in the finger reader . the system then compares the fingerprint that is read with the one in the central database for authentication .
