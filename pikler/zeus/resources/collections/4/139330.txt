Superscalar     a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallel computing called instruction-level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster cpu throughput at the same clock rate . a superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions ( termed instruction dispatching ) to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor . each functional unit is not a separate cpu core but an execution resource inside the cpu such as an arithmetic logic unit , floating point unit ( fpu ) , a bit shifter , or a multiplier . while most superscalar cpus are also pipelined , it possible to have a non-pipelined superscalar cpu or a pipelined non-superscalar cpu . the superscalar technique is associated with several identifying characteristics of the cpu core : 1. instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream . 1. cpu hardware dynamically checks for data dependencies between instructions at run time .
