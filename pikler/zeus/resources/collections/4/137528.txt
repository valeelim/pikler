Plaintext     in cryptography , plaintext is the information which the sender want to transmit to the receiver ( s ) . before computers , plaintext meant text in the language of the communicating parties . since computers , the definition has been expanded . it now includes not only the electronic representation of text , such as emails and word processor documents , but also the computer representation of speech , music , pictures , videos , atm and credit card transactions , sensor data , and so forth . that is basically any information which the communicating parties might wish to hide from others . the plaintext is the normal representation of the data before any action has been taken to hide it . the plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm ; the output is termed ciphertext . some systems , however , use a cascade of layers of encryption ( called 'rounds ' ) in which case the ciphertext output of one encryption algorithm becomes the plaintext input to the next . triple des is an example .
