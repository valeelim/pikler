Hypercube     in geometry a hypercube is a kind of multidimensional shape , like a square or a cube except that it has four dimensions or more . a square is a two-dimensional shape , a cube has three dimensions . a cube is constructed by putting six squares together . mathematicians say that the cube is the three-dimensional analogue of the square . the analogue of the square in an n-dimensional space is called hypercube . in four dimensions , this figure is also called tesseract . other pages . - simplex - the n-dimensional analogue of the triangle - hyperrectangle - the general case of the hypercube , where the base is a rectangle . other websites . - olshevsky , george , `` measure polytope '' at `` glossary for hyperspace '' . - www.4d-screen.de ( rotation of 4d â€“ 7d-cube ) - `` rotating a hypercube '' by enrique zeleny , wolfram demonstrations project . - stereoscopic animated hypercube
