God is dead     `` god is dead '' ( german : ; also known as the death of god ) is a well known phrase by german philosopher friedrich nietzsche . friedrich nietzsche wrote this in his book `` the gay science '' . it is also found in nietzsche 's classic work `` thus spoke zarathustra '' ( deutsch : `` also sprach zarathustra '' ) , which is most responsible for popularizing the phrase . the phrase is not meant literally . the idea is stated in `` the madman '' as follows `` god is dead '' does not mean that nietzsche believed in an actual god who first existed and then died in a literal sense . it refers to the growth of non-believers in supposedly christian countries . `` when one gives up the christian faith , one pulls the right to christian morality out from under one 's feet . this morality is by no means self-evident ... by breaking one main concept out of christianity , the faith in god , one breaks the whole : nothing necessary remains in one 's hands '' . this is why in `` the madman '' , the passage quoted above mainly addresses nontheists ( especially atheists ) . their problem ( according to nietzsche ) is to retain any system of values without a divine order .
