Private network     in internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private ip address space , following the rfc 1918 standard . computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an intranet network ( internal private computer network that uses the internet protocol ) . private networks are quite common in home and office local area network ( lan ) designs , as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique ip addresses for every computer , printer and other devices that the organizations use . private ip addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered ip addresses created by the ipv4 standard . one of the reasons ipv6 was created is to overcome this limitation of the ipv4 standard . however ipv6 still did not achieve a widespread use . routers on the internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private ip addresses in the ip packet header . this isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses . as connections can not be made between different private networks via the internet , different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts ( communications accidents caused by reaching a third party using the same ip address ) .
