Analog signal processing     an analog signal processor is used to quickly process signals that can be too complex to handle any other way . a comparator is used to offer level triggers correct down to microvolts with reaction times in the picoseconds . analog filters offer anti-aliasing in sampled value systems as inputs and outputs , and can be used as pre-filters in audio and communications . analog multipliers and dividers are used to offer brief gain control , radiometric function , or continuous energy measurement , with surprising accuracy . over-voltage protection applications can protect the front-end of analog transmission/receiver systems , multiplexers . amplification and filtering for noise removal are the main feature of analog signal processing .
