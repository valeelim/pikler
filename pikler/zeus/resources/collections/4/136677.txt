SSH file transfer protocol     in computing , the ssh file transfer protocol ( sometimes called secure file transfer protocol or sftp ) is a network protocol that implements file transfer between computers . it is often used as more secure alternative of an ftp protocol , which transmits file contents , folder contents and even passwords without encryption . sftp protocol is built on top of ssh protocol which is used as a transport layer over the port 22 and is implemented by an ssh server such as openssh . sftp is different from scp , which is another protocol relying on an ssh connection . it is also different from ftps , which used ssl to encrypt the connection itself , rather than sending the data through an ssh tunnel . many popular ftp programs have added support for sftp . access to the sftp server can be granted either through a username , a password or by using a public key .
