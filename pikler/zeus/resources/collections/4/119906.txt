Books of Kings     the books of kings are a set of books in the old testament . both judaism and christianity see it as a part of the bible . the books of kings describes the history of israel 's kings from the end of the rule of david until the time of the babylonian exile ( so it writes about a time of about 453 years ) . after a long description of solomon 's rule , 1,2 kings writes of how the kingdom of israel was divided and then shows how the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah developed . 1 and 2 kings , like 1 and 2 samuel and 1 and 2 books of chronicles are actually one book . it was simply called `` kings . '' however , it was divided into two books by the translators of the septuagint ( the greek translation of the old testament ) , and so it was written as 1 and 2 kings by the latin translation and many other versions . the division between 1 and 2 kings was made after the death of ahab in the northern kingdom ( 22:37 ) and jehoshaphat in the southern kingdom ( 22:50 ) . it is not known for sure who is the author ( writer ) of 1,2 kings . jewish tradition says that jeremiah wrote 1,2 kings , but people do not usually think so today . whoever the author was , he knew the book of deuteronomy , like many of israel 's prophets . he also used lots of sources , like `` the books of the annals of solomon '' ( 11:41 , niv ) , `` the book of the annals of the kings of israel '' ( 14:19 niv ) , and `` the book of the annals of the kings of judah '' ( 14:29 niv ) '' . probably other sources were used , like those inside chronicles ) .
