Period (physics)    period ( physics ) a time period ( denoted by 't ' ) is the time needed for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point . as the frequency of a wave increases , the time period of the wave decreases . `` frequency '' and time `` period '' are in a reciprocal relationship that can be expressed mathematically as : t = 1/f or as : f = 1/t . - orbital period is the time for something to go round ( orbit ) something else . - the period of a pendulum is the time it takes from one side to the other and back . - an electron moving in a helical orbit that has an axis at right angles to the magnetic field has a period given by t=2Ï€m/qb , where m is the mass of the electron , q is the charge of the electron and b is the magnetic field in the region . other pages . - amplitude - damping - resonance
