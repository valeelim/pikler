Hydrogen car     a hydrogen car is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its fuel for motive power . a hydrogen car does not have to be a car , it can be any transportation vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way , like an aircraft . hydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe . even though it 's simple and there 's so much of it , hydrogen does not occur naturally as a gas on the earth : it 's always combined with other things . hydrogen is high in energy , yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution . advantages of hydrogen energy . - hydrogen comes from water by splitting it into oxygen and hydrogen , so supplies are almost limitless . - as hydrogen is a diatomic molecule , the product of combustion is only water . therefore , it does not produce the harmful gasses that gasoline and diesel cars produce , such as carbon dioxide . - hydrogen itself is not poisonous . therefore , in case of outflow , hydrogen is safer than any other gas . disadvantages of hydrogen energy .
