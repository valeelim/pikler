Shorinji kenpo     shorinji kenpo is the style of kenpo ( a kind of martial art ) . it was created by nakano michiomi . a japanese with the name nakano michiomi - he later changed his name to so doshin - incorporates his martial art school into his buddhist teachings . so doshin said , that he taught martial arts mostly in order to attract young people to buddhism . religious societies did n't pay the taxes , and so doshin probably considered it , too . until 1972 , so doshin said that he was the 21st grand master of an esoteric northern shaolin system called iher man thuen . in 1972 he changed his mind because the japanese court gave an official decision that his style was not chinese , but a mixture of karate ( perhaps wado-ryu ) and jujutsu ( perhaps hakko-ryu ) . consequently , the style 's name was changed from `` shorinji kempo , '' meaning `` kung fu of shaolin temple , '' to `` nippon shorinji kempo , '' meaning `` japanese way of fist of shaolin . '' the students of nippon shorinji kempo have signs of manji on their kimonos , but it is not treated as the symbol of fascism , it signifies happiness in buddhism .
