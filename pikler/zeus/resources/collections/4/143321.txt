LC circuit     an lc circuit is an electronic circuit made up of an inductor and a capacitor . lc circuit 's resonant frequency is equal to : formula_1 the angular frequency Ï‰ has units of radians per second . lc circuits are used for creating signals at a particular frequency , or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal . an ideal lc circuit does not have resistance . at lc circuit energy saves in the capacitor 's electric field . formula_2 u is energy and q is electric charge . at lc circuit energy also save in the inductor 's magnetic field . formula_3 u is energy and i is electric current that flows in inductor . let 's analyze an lc circuit 's vibration . vibrating lc circuit 's total energy is u. formula_4 because circuit 's resistance is 0 , there is no energy that transmits to heat energy , and u is maintained regularity . formula_5 so lc circuit 's vibration is shown like that formula_6 first consider the electrical impedance of the series lc circuit . the total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances
