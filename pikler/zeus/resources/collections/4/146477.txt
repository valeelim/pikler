River Wear     the wear is a river in northeast england . it starts in wearhead , county durham and opens up into the north sea at sunderland . much of the river wear shows the history of the industrial revolution . its upper end runs through lead mining country , until this gives way to coal seams of the durham coalfield for the rest of its length . as a result of limestone quarrying , lead mining and coal mining , the wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways . the weardale railway continues to run occasional services between stanhope and wolsingham . the upland area of upper weardale has a flora which survives from the end of the last ice age . after the ice age , the wear valley became thickly forested . during the neolithic period and increasingly in the bronze age , the forests were progressively cleared for agriculture . references . - natural environment research council , institute of geological sciences , 1971 , `` british regional geology : northern england '' fourth edition , hmso , london .
