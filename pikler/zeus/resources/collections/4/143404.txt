Vulcan (hypothetical planet)    vulcan ( hypothetical planet ) vulcan was a theoretical planet . in the 19th century , the planet was thought to orbit close to the sun . its gravitational pull would explain changes seen between the perihelion advance of mercury from that predicted by classical mechanics . the theory that vulcan exists come from the earlier prediction that an outer planet ( now neptune ) was causing similar changes in the orbit of uranus from the orbit predicted by classical theory . none of the searches for vulcan found a planet . this caused some people to not agree with newtonian theory . it led to the development of special relativity and general relativity . albert einstein 's modified theory of gravity showed why the orbit of mercury changes without the existence of vulcan . this disproved the theories of vulcan .
