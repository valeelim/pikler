Key generation     key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography . the key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted . modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms ( such as des and aes ) and public-key algorithms ( such as rsa ) . symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key ; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret . public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key . the public key is made available to anyone ( often by means of a digital certificate ) . a sender will encrypt data with the public key ; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data . since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms , modern systems such as tls and its predecessor ssl as well as the ssh use a combination of the two in which : 1. one party receives the other 's public key , and encrypts a small piece of data ( either a symmetric key or some data that will be used to generate it ) .
