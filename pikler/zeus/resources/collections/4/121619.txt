Dilemma     a dilemma ( greek δί-λημμα `` double proposition '' ) is a problem with at least two solutions or possibilities . none of the solutions are practically acceptable ; a person in this position has been traditionally described as being impaled on the horns of a dilemma , neither horn being comfortable . the dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device , in the form `` you must accept either a , or b '' ; here a and b would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion . applied in this way , it may be a fallacy , a false dichotomy . in formal logic , the definition of a dilemma differs markedly from everyday usage . two options are still present , but choosing between them is immaterial because they both imply the same conclusion . symbolically expressed thus : formula_1 this can be translated informally as `` one ( or both ) of a or b is known to be true , but they both imply c , so regardless of the truth values of a and b we can conclude c. '' horned dilemmas can present more than two choices . the number of choices of horned dilemmas can be used in their alternative names , such as two-pronged ( two-horned ) or dilemma proper , or three-pronged ( three-horned ) or trilemma , and so on .
