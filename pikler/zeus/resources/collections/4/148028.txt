British Rail Class 312     the british rail class 312 is a type of alternating current ( ac ) electric multiple unit ( emu ) built in 1966-1974 intended for use on outer-suburban passenger services . it was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the british rail mark 2 bodyshell , and also the last with slam doors . this latter feature contributed to their relatively early withdrawal ( between 25â€“28 years old , compared to a life expectancy of 30 years ) . ironically , the examples withdrawn by first great eastern and later 'one ' great eastern between 2003 and 2004 were slightly newer than most of the carriages the operator is introducing during 2005 for use on its premier express service .
