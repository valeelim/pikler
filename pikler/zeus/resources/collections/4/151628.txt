Canadian Albums Chart     the canadian albums chart is the official album sales chart in canada . it is compiled every wednesday by u.s.-based music sales tracking company nielsen soundscan , and published every thursday by `` jam ! '' canoe , along with its sister charts the canadian singles chart and the canadian bds airplay chart . the chart has 200 positions , however , `` jam ! '' only publishes the top 100 for the public . unlike the case with its cd single equivalent ( the canadian singles chart ) , album sales are not declining as rapidly in canada as cd singles are , and the canadian albums chart remains the most reliable source for the most popular albums in canada . references . - nielsen soundscan - `` jam !
