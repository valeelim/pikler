British Rail Class 141     the british rail class 141 was the first production model of the pacer diesel multiple units . they were created because then british rail had a large shortage of trains so rather than spending lots of money on expensive proper trains , they invented the pacer . british leyland at the time had a surplus in the production of bus bodies so the idea was to weld the bus body from an old bus on to a freight waggon chassis . the result of this was that pacers have notoriously poor suspension and are noisier around corners due to flanging ( the squeaky noise that you 'll sometimes hear when travelling by train ) . this makes them non-ideal passenger trains so they are now being replaced ( or have been replaced in the case of the class 141 ) by new trains .
