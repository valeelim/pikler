Fancy rat     the fancy rat or pet rat is a type of the brown rat ( `` rattus norvegicus '' ) that is bred to be a pet . the name `` fancy rat '' has nothing to do with the `` fanciness '' of how they look . it comes from the phrase `` animal fancy '' . a person who keeps pet rats is said to be involved in `` rat fancy . '' some people domesticate black rats ( `` rattus rattus '' ) , and gambian pouched rats ( `` cricetomys gambianus '' ) . these types of rats are not usually called fancy rats because the hobby does not center around them . fancy rats have been bred as pets at least since the late 19th century . they can have many different colors and coat types . they are sociable , intelligent animals . they can learn to come when called , use a litter box , and do many different tricks . pet rats act differently from rats found in nature . the number of generations since they have been removed from the wild and how they were bred has an effect on how much they act differently . they are not any more of a health risk than other common pets .
