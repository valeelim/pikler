SA80     sa80 ( small arms for the 80s ) is the name of a weapons family used by the british army and royal marines . all are of bullpup design : this means the magazine is behind the trigger so the weapon is shorter yet still has a long barrel . the series includes an assault rifle known as the l85 and a light support weapon ( lsw ) designated the l86 as well as a carbine variant for helicopter crews and a bolt action army cadet variant . the lsw variant is far more accurate than its predecessor , and is used in army fsgs ( fire support groups ) . they are amazingly accurate for their size ( army marksmanship tests were redesigned after the sa80 introduction because it was so accurate ) . nevertheless , the sa80 family has been plagued by poor reliability . they have had an upgrade by the german arms company h & k when it was british owned . this resulted in the a2 series , but not all models have been upgraded . the sa80 also has a cadet force variant ( l98 a2 cadet gp ) that is the same size , and is used throughout the acf . it has a success rate far higher than the old , bolt-action a1 version .
