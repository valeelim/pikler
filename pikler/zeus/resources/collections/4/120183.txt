Australopithecine     the term australopithecine ( 'australos ' for short ) refers to any species in the related genera `` australopithecus '' or `` paranthropus '' . these genera occurred in the plioceneâ€“pleistocene era , and were bipedal . the arrangement of their teeth , especially the dental arcade , was similar to humans . they did not have the large canine teeth characteristic of present-day apes . they had a brain size not much larger than modern apes , lacking the large brain of the genus `` homo '' . they were mainly bipedal , but probably capable of climbing and living at least partly in trees . their arms were longer in proportion to their bodies , and this also suggests their inherited capacity to move above the ground . the efficiency of their walking is difficult to estimate , but they were not so well adapted to bipedalism as humans . the males were much larger than the females , which suggests a family arrangement with a dominant male and several females , as with modern apes . nothing is known for certain about their use of tools .
