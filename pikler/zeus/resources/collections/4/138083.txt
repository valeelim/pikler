Substitution-permutation network     in cryptography , an sp-network , or substitution-permutation network ( spn ) , is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as aes . these networks consist of s-boxes and p-boxes that transform blocks of input bits into output bits . s-boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits . a good s-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits . it will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit . p-boxes permute or rearrange bits across s-box inputs . in addition , at each `` round '' the key is combined using some group operation , typically xor . references . - jonathan katz and yehuda lindell , `` introduction to modern cryptography '' . crc press , 2007. other pages . - feistel cipher - product cipher - square - international data encryption algorithm
