Stream cipher     in cryptography , a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream ( keystream ) using an exclusive-or ( xor ) operation . in a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time , and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state . an alternative name is a state cipher , as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state . in practice , the digits are typically single bits or bytes . stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers . block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length . stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements . however , stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly ; for example , in particular , the same starting state must never be used twice . a stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic key , for example 128 bits keys . based on this key , it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one-time pad encryption algorithm . however , because the keystream is pseudorandom , and not truly random , the security associated with the one-time pad can not be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure .
