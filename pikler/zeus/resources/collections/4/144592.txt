Hurricane Andrew     although the 1992 atlantic hurricane season was below average , hurricane andrew was the exception to that . this hurricane blasted the bahamas , southeast florida and south central louisiana , taking a path extremely similar to hurricane betsy , which also struck southern florida and louisiana . however , unlike betsy , andrew did not make flooding in new orleans . contrary to typical , damage from hurricane andrew was caused almost entirely by high winds rather than storm surge in florida and louisiana . this storm caused between $ 23 billion and $ 37 billion in damage ( 1992 usd ) and between 56 and 68 fatalities , making andrew the costliest atlantic hurricane to hit the united states . however , hurricane katrina would later surpass andrew in official damage amounts . andrew 's devastating damage spawned many rumors . these included claims that hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south dade county ( now miami-dade county ) were killed and their deaths were not reported in official accounts . an investigation by the `` miami herald '' found no basis for such rumors . these rumors were probably based on the 1928 okeechobee hurricane , when the deaths of migrant workers initially went uncounted , and were still debated at the time of andrew .
