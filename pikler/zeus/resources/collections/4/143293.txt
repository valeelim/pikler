Case (grammar)    case ( grammar ) in grammar , case shows the role of a noun , adjective or pronoun in a sentence . it is a set of forms which depend on the syntax ( how the words go together ) . case is an example of inflection , which is an affix ( a part of a word that is added to other words ) that signals a grammatical relationship . once it was part of old english , but modern english does not use it much . in the romance languages ( spanish , french , portuguese , etc . ) , which are all derived from latin , nouns pack several ideas into one word . these ideas are : - gender : nouns must be masculine ( `` latin '' : end in -us ) , feminine ( end in -a ) or neutral ( end in -um ) . then adjectives must 'agree ' with the nouns , that is , have the same endings . english is one of the few european languages which does not have gender in nouns ( usually ) . - case : nominative ( subject ) , accusative ( object ) , genitive ( of the noun ) , dative ( to , for or with the noun ) ; each has a singular and plural form . so , in many languages like latin , german , russian , spanish , korean and japanese , a noun 's case is shown by the end of the word ( the nouns change depending on their role in the sentence ) . nouns change their endings to show if they are doing an action , if they are having an action done to them , if they just happen to be there during the action and whether they own something . therefore , the word order is less important in these languages , whereas in english it is vital .
