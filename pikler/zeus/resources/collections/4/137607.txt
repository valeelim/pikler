Artificial selection     artificial selection is the intentional breeding of plants or animals . it means the same thing as selective breeding and is an ancient method of genetic engineering . selective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals , such as dogs , pigeons or cattle . some of these animals may have traits that a breeder will want to carry over to the next generation . the breeder will therefore select those animals to breed which have that quality , rather than those that do not . inbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding , designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical . such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory . they lose fertility . to control this , most breeds are outcrossed or backcrossed to wild-type individuals , or at least less inbred stock . this is done every so many generations : the details differ from breed to breed . the improvement when outcrossing is done is called hybrid vigour . charles darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection . artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection . in natural selection , the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens . this is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction . the process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat .
