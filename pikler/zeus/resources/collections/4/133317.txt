Ignoratio elenchi     ignoratio elenchi ( also known as irrelevant conclusion or irrelevant thesis ) is the informal fallacy of presenting an argument that may in itself be valid , but does not address the issue in question . `` ignoratio elenchi '' can be roughly translated by `` ignorance of refutation '' , that is , ignorance of what a refutation is ; `` elenchi '' is from the greek , meaning an argument of disproof or refutation . ( some sources give `` by ignorance of the issues '' or even `` by ignoring the issues '' as a translation of ignoratio elenchi . ) aristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondent 's argument . he called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation . for aristotle , ignoratio elenchi amounts to `` ignorance of logic '' . in fact , aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi . modern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above .
