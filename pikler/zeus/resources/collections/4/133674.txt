American Dream     the american dream is the hope that in the united states of america , anyone can become rich and/or famous if they work hard and try their very best . the statue of liberty officially named `` liberty enlightening the world '' , is a monument symbolising the united states . the statue is placed near the entrance to new york city harbor . many migrants , people who come to america from other countries , come to america because they hope for a better life . america is attractive to migrants , because often there is more freedom to become rich or famous than the country that they leave . the standard icon of the american dream is the statue of liberty . with american dream is also meant to live freely and equally with all other people in the usa . the american dream is also a main theme in the book by john steinbeck , `` of mice and men '' . the two friends george and lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch , so they can `` live off the fatta the lan ' '' and just enjoy a better life . but the symbolism shows this is futile due to the fact that it will never happen , and lennie ends up being shot in the back of the head as a mercy killing , like candy 's dog . this shows that not everyone can achieve the american dream , thus proving by contradiction it is not possible . although it is possible to achieve the american dream for few . a lot of people follow the american dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich . this was easier in the 1900s and now it is really hard to achieve the american dream because of all the competition and hard work required to achieve this dream . this is also shown in the great gatsby .
