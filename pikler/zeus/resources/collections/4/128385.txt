Fluxbox     in unix computing , fluxbox is an x window manager based on blackbox 0.61.1. it tries to be lightweight and customizable , and has very little support for graphical icons . its user interface has only a taskbar and a menu that can be used by right-clicking on the desktop . all basic settings are controlled by text files . fluxbox can show some eye candy such as : colors , gradients , borders , and several other basic appearance settings can be changed . effects managers such as xcompmgr and transset-df can add true transparency to desktop elements and windows . enhancements can also be provided by using idesk or fbdesk , or the rox desktop . fluxbox also has several features blackbox does not have , including tabbed windows and a configurable titlebar . because of its small memory use and quick loading time , fluxbox is popular in many live cds such as knoppix std and gparted . it was the default window manager of damn small linux , but was replaced with jwm after the release of damn small linux 4.0. it is currently the default window manager of antix , a linux distribution based on mepis and designed for old computers , pcfluxboxos , a remaster of pclinuxos , and linguasos , a live cd distribution for professional translators . fluxbuntu , ubuntu with fluxbox and lightweight applications , was released in october 2007 .
