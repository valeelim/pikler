British Rail Class 13     the british rail class 13 was formed in 1965. the tinsley marshalling yard needed more powerful shunters to move vehicles around . this was provided by permanently coupling together two class 08 shunters as a ‘ master and slave ’ ( or ‘ cow and calf ’ ) unit . the second of the two units had its cab taken off . both units were ballasted to improve traction . at first the units were coupled cab-to-cab but it was easier to couple master nose to slave cab . the thinking behind adopting this dual locomotive design is that a larger , rigid locomotive could not be used due to the risk of grounding on the hump .
