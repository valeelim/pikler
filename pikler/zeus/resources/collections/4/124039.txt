Horst-Wessel-Lied     the horst-wessel-lied ( `` horst wessel song '' ) , also known as `` die fahne hoch '' ( `` the flag on high '' , from its opening line ) , was the anthem of the nazi party from 1930 to 1945. from 1933 to 1945 it was also part of germany 's national anthem . the lyrics of the song were composed in 1929 by horst wessel , a nazi activist and local commander of the nazi militia , the sa , in the berlin district of friedrichshain . wessel was assassinated by a communist activist in january 1930 , and the propaganda apparatus of berlin gauleiter dr joseph goebbels made him the leading martyr of the nazi movement . the song became the official song of consecration ( `` weihelied '' ) for the nazi party , and was extensively used at party functions as well as being sung by the sa during street parades . when the nazis came to power in 1933 , the `` horst-wessel-lied '' was recognised as a national symbol by a law issued on may 19 , 1933. nazi germany thus had a double anthem , consisting of the first verse of the `` deutschlandlied '' followed by the `` horst wessel-lied '' . a regulation attached to a printed version of the `` horst wessel-lied '' in 1934 required the right arm to be raised in a `` hitler salute '' when the first and fourth verses were sung .
