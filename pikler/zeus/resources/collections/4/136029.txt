Serial port     in computing , a serial port is a `` serial communication physical interface '' through which information transfers , either in or out , one bit at a time ( in contrast with parallel port ) . during most of the personal computers history , serial ports connected computers to devices such as terminals and various peripherals . while such interfaces as ethernet , firewire , and usb all send data as a serial stream , the term `` serial port '' usually identifies hardware meeting the requirements of the rs-232 standard , for the purpose of interfacing with a modem or with a similar communication device . for many computer peripheral devices the usb interface has replaced the serial port . while nearly every server has a serial port , many modern low-end workstations and laptops often do n't have one . the serial port is not present for cost savings , and is considered to be a legacy port on personal computers . however , serial ports can be found in industrial systems , scientific analysis and laboratory equipments , point of sales and some industrial and consumer products . network equipments ( such as routers and switches ) often have serial ports for configuration . serial ports are still used in these areas as they are simple , cheap and allow communications between devices .
