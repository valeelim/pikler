Object (computer science)    object ( computer science ) in object-oriented programming , an object is an instance of a class . objects are an abstraction . they hold both data , and ways to manipulate the data . the data is usually not visible outside the object . it can only be changed by using a well-specified mechanism ( usually called `` interface '' ) . suppose there is a bank account ; this bank account has a current balance , but it also has a `` history '' of things that were done . these fields are however not directly accessible . there are methods like `` deposit ( ) '' and `` withdraw ( ) '' and `` checkbalance ( ) '' . most applications ( and other objects ) only change this object through this interface . banks usually impose a `` credit limit '' . suppose , there are 1000 dollars on the account . if the client does not have a special agreement with the bank , he can not take out more money than there is on the account ; so he can withdraw ( ) a maximum of 1000 dollars . he might have an agreement with the bank , so he can borrow money from the bank ( but has to pay a fee ) . in that case , he might be able to withdraw 1500 dollars ( or 2000 dollars ) . so the withdraw method has to do a lot of checks as described above .
