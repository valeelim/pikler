Mantophasmatidae     the insect family mantophasmatidae is the sole family in its order . it is a group of african carnivorous insects discovered in 2002. the most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators , but it is not well known under any name . their modern centre of endemism is western south africa and namibia , although a relict population and eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution . members of the order are wingless even as adults , making them relatively difficult to identify . they resemble a mix between praying mantids and phasmids . molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to a family known as the grylloblattidae . the mantophasmids were originally described from old museum specimens that found in namibia ( `` mantophasma zephyrum '' ) and tanzania ( `` m. subsolanum '' ) , and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of baltic amber ( `` raptophasma kerneggeri '' ) . the most recent classification recognizes numerous genera , including fossils .
