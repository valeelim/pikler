Page replacement algorithm     certain operating systems use paging to get virtual memory . this means that a part of the hard disk or a file is used so that the applications or the operating system see more memory that is actually there . a page replacement algorithm is an algorithm that decides which pages should be written to disk or file , when a new page needs to be allocated . some of the algorithms used are : - `` not recently used '' : the algorithm wants to keep pages that have recently been used in memory . it has two bits it sets . one of the bits is set if the page has been used , the other if the page has been modified ( written to ) . the modified bits are cleared periodically . - `` first-in , first-out '' ( fifo ) : all the pages are kept in a queue , if a new page is allocated it is put at the back of the queue ; the page at the front is the oldest one , and can be written to disk . the algorithm is easy and cheap to implement , but it does not have a good performance . belady 's anomaly may also be a problem .
