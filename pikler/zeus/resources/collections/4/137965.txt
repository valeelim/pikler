International Data Encryption Algorithm     in cryptography , the international data encryption algorithm ( idea ) is a block cipher designed by xuejia lai and james massey of eth zurich in 1991. it was meant to be a replacement for the data encryption standard . idea very like an earlier cipher called proposed encryption standard ( pes ) , but with some improvements . because of this , idea was first called ipes ( improved pes ) . the cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non-commercial use . the name `` idea '' is also a trademark . the patents will expire in 2010â€“2011 . today , idea is licensed worldwide by a company called mediacrypt . idea was used in pretty good privacy ( pgp ) v2.0 after the cipher used in v1.0 , bassomatic , was found to be breakable . idea can be used with the openpgp standard . idea operates on 64-bit blocks , using a 128-bit key . it contains a series of eight identical transformations ( `` rounds '' ) and one output transformation ( the `` half-round '' ) . it does this for a total of 8.5 rounds . the processes for encryption and decryption are similar .
