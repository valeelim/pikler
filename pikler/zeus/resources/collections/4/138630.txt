Earth's inner core    earth 's inner core the inner core is the very center of the earth , and the hottest part of the planet . it is a mainly a solid ball with a radius of about , according to seismological studies . it is believed to consist mostly of an iron–nickel alloy and to be about the same temperature as the surface of the sun : about 5700 k ( 5400 °c ) . the inner core was discovered by inge lehmann in 1929 , using seismology . lehmann was studying a large new zealand earthquake . an earthquake makes vibrations which move through the inside of the earth . the vibrations lehmann studied seemed to be moving across something solid in the center of the planet . she called this the `` inner core '' . she wrote about it for many years , but it was not proved to exist until 1970. the inner core is more than 5,000 kilometers below the earth 's surface . the pressure in earth 's inner core is about 3,500,000 atmospheres . iron can only be solid at such high temperatures because its melting temperature increases dramatically at such pressures .
