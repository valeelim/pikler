Nude photography     nude photography is a style of photography which shows the naked human body as a form of art . this is different form erotic photography , and pornography which focus on sexual arousal . for many photographers , nude photography is a study of the human body , much like some paintings did . photographing a named person is called portraiture . nude photography focuses on showing the human body , and often the face is not visible . in general , nude photography is a `` planned image '' , not a snapshot . nude photography wants to show a stylised depiction of the human body . photographers sometimes use extremes of light and shadow , oiled skin , and shadows falling across the body to show the texture and structure of the body . early photographers often showed the nudity of women like the one we see here by f√©lix-jacques moulin . many , like edward weston , jean-christophe destailleur , augustao de luca , ruth bernhard and jerry avenaim , preferred to show the lines of a body as a piece of art . they used the terms `` art nude '' and `` figurenude '' from painting to avoid suggestions that their works were meant to be erotica or pornography .
