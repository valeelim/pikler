Cyclic redundancy check     a cyclic redundancy check ( often shortened to crc ) is a way to calculate a checksum , based on a polynomial . in computer science , crcs are used to check that no errors occurred transmitting the data . the transmitted messages are divided into predetermined lengths which , used as dividends , are divided by a fixed divisor . the remainder of the calculation is appended onto and sent with the computer recalculates the remainder . if it does not match the transmitted remainder , an error is detected . at this point , the data is re-sent . ethernet packets have a ( crc ) code .
