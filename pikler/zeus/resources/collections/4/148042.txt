British Rail Class 321     the british rail class 321 alternating current ( ac ) electric multiple units ( emu ) were built by brel york in three batches from 1986-1989. the design was very successful and led to the development of the similar class 320 and class 322 units for use by strathclyde pte and stansted express ( now used by first scotrail ) respectively . the bodyshell design was also used for construction of the class 456 direct current ( dc ) units . the class 321s were nicknamed 'dusty bins ' , due to the class number sharing the same name as the game show 3-2-1 . ( this name has also been given to the diesel multiple unit ( dmu ) class 153 no . 153321 for the same reason ) . class 321s were originally built for the bedford services . however , in 1990 , they started being used on great eastern main line services to southend victoria , braintree and clacton , to replace the class 302 and 305 emus , many of which were approaching 50 years old . some 321s ( many of the 3214s ) were sent to work inter-regional services for silverlink , and then briefly for london midland , primarily on euston to northampton/milton keynes/tring services .
