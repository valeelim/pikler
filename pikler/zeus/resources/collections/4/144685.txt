Instrumentation     instrumentation is the science that studies measurement and control over variables . measurement and control are studied to make the maximum efficiency and safety of the work place . instrumentation includes finding the most appropriate measurement method , designing and producing of the machine , getting the required information and result of what has been measured by the calculation and take appropriate measures for that result . instrumentation means a lot more than measurement . for example , setting up the sulphur dioxide ( so ) density measuring machine and getting the reading is measurement . but , how to use this machine , which machine is to set up , how many places to set up , what to calculate with the reading , in what situation it should sent the sign for alarm are problems handled by the instrumentation . an instrument is a tool used to measure and manage the variables in a process . instrumentation can be used to measure various variables ( physical values ) like : - pressure , p
