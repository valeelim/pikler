Static electricity     static electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects . this electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground , or loses its charge quickly by a discharge . charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated . a static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow . the effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see , feel and even hear the spark . this spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized . this neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor ( for example a path to ground ) . other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity ( positive or negative ) . the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock ' is caused by the neutralization of charge . in greek age , thales found static electricity when he was cleaning his amber . but at that time , they did not pay attention to this and research it . they just knew that rubbing something made a pulling force . earnest research into static electricity was started in the 17th century , when otto von guericke made the first friction generator . and in the 18th century , coulomb started research into a fixed quantity of static electricity . benjamin franklin associated static electricity with storms . in 1832 michael faraday published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities . this report proved that the electricity made by using a magnet , voltaic electricity produced by a battery , and static electricity are all the same . since faraday 's result , the history of static electricity can be thought as the study of electricity in general .
