Flag semaphore     flag semaphore is a system of spreading information at a distance by using two flags . information is told by the positions of the flags . each set of positions has a meaning . signalling uses two flags . a person signally would commonly stand on a platform about 6-10ft ( 1.8 - 3m ) above the ground . they would use a bright orange , red and white flag . the was a problem because it also made it easier for the enemy to see him and shoot him . the newer system uses two short poles with square flags . the signalman holds one pole in each hand . the poles are held in one of eight possible directions . except for in the `` rest position '' , the flags do not cross over each other . flags of different colour/s are used based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land . at sea , the flags are coloured red and yellow . on land , they are white and blue . there is also a 'flag alphabet ' which consists of many different coloured flags with different symbols on them . here is a list of some examples
