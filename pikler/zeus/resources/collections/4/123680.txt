Sulaiman Range     the sulaiman mountains ( / ) or the kesai mountains are a major feature of southeastern afghanistan ( zabul , most of loya paktia and northeastern kandahar province ) , south waziristan , and most of northern balochistan province of pakistan . they are one of the bordering ranges between the iranian plateau and the south asia . bordering the sulaiman range to the north are the arid highlands of the hindu kush range , with more than 50 percent of the lands there lying above 2,000 m ( 6,500 feet ) . the sulaiman range , and the high plateau to the west and southwest of it , helps form a natural barrier against the humid winds that blow from the indian ocean , creating arid conditions across southern afghanistan to the north . in contrast , the relatively flat and low-lying indus river delta is situated due east and south of the sulaiman mountains . this lush delta is prone to heavy flooding and is mostly uncultivated wilderness . rivers that flow from the sulaiman mountain system include the dori river and the gomal river .
