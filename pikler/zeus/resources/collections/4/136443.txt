Carbon cycle     the carbon cycle is the way carbon is stored and replaced on earth . some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years , others happen annually . the main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes , and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas . through most of history , volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle , but in the last hundred years , people burning fossil fuels have added about a hundred time more co to the air than volcanoes have . that is , for every ton of co added to the air by volcanoes , about 100 tons of co have been added to the air by people . the main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms . some of this gets released as they die and decompose , but a proportion gets buried in sediment . this is shown in the diagram . sediment turns to rock , and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now-solid co. some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil , where it can stay for a long time before decomposing .
