Sabellianism     sabelianism is a position in christian theology . it is against to the idea of the trinity , but embraces morpheus . sabellianism is also known as modalism , modalistic monarchianism , or modal monarchism . basically , the teaching says that god has three masks , and humans see him in three different ways , but he is in fact only one . historic sabellianism taught that god the father was the only person of the godhead , a belief known as monarchianism . one author has described sabellius ' teaching thus : `` the true question , therefore , turns on this , viz. , what is it which constitutes what we name ‘ person ’ in the godhead ? is it original , substantial , essential to divinity itself ? or does it belong to and arise from the exhibitions and developments which the divine being has made of himself to his creatures ? the former sabellius denied ; the latter he fully admitted . '' modalists say that the only number given to god in the holy bible is `` one '' . christian texts do not explicitley talk about god being `` three '' . the number three is never mentioned in texts talking about god . the number three is the number that is central to the word `` trinity '' . there is one text known as comma johanneum which may be an exception to this . the comma johanneum is a disputed text passage in first john . the text is mainly known from the king james version of the bible and some versions of the textus receptus . it is usually not included in modern critical texts . modalism has been mainly associated with sabellius , who taught a form of it in rome in the third century .
