Impossible object     an impossible object is a kind of optical illusion . impossible objects are also known as undecidable figures . in this kind of illusion , a person looks at a two-dimensional picture . the vision center of the brain does much of its work subconsciously and automatically . it interprets the figure as a three-dimensional object . the viewer usually knows such an object is impossible soon after looking at the figure . however , the impression of a 3d figure may still remain even when the viewer knows it is impossible in reality . some of these figures are more subtle . in these cases it is not obvious that they are impossible right away . the viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object ot find out that it is indeed impossible . `` impossible objects '' are of interest to psychologists , mathematicians and artists . swedish artist oscar reutersvärd was the first person to draw many impossible objects . he has been called `` the father of impossible figures '' . in 1934 , he drew the penrose triangle , some years before the penroses . the way reutersvärd drew it , the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes .
