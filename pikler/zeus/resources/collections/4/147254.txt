Hypergiant     a hypergiant ( luminosity class 0 ) is a star with an enormous mass and luminosity , showing signs of a very high rate of mass loss . the exact definition is not yet settled . hypergiants are the largest stars in the universe , even larger than supergiants . the largest known hypergiant was nml cygni , which is about 1,650 times wider than the sun . it is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars . the pulsating red supergiant uy scuti is probably larger still . the hypergiant with the next largest known diameter is vy canis majoris , which is between 1420 times wider than the sun , or roughly the same diameter as the orbit of jupiter . hypergiants are very rare and they have a short lifespan . while the sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion years , hypergiants will only exist for a few million years . most hypergiants are red stars , but there are two special groups : luminous blue variables ( lbv ) , and yellow hypergiants . both of these types are very rare , with only a few examples in the milky way galaxy . their rareness is probably because each type passes through this stage quite rapidly .
