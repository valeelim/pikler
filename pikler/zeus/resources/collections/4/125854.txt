Disk partitioning     disk partitioning is about making a physical or logical hard disk usable by the operating system . each disk partition can be used like a hard disk by the operating system . a hard disk can be divided into many partitions . this is especially useful for : - keeping the user data independent of the operating system . there will be one partition with the operating system on it , and one with the user data . also if there is a problem with one file system , this does usually not affect the other file systems . - some operating systems ( those that are made like unix or linux ) use disk partitions for virtual memory - using a boot loader it is possible to run many operating systems on the same computer . this is known as `` multi-booting '' . - increasing security : certain operating systems allow to limit the access to a file system ( for example : read-only , do not allow executable files , do not allow system files ) usually each partition contains exactly one file system .
