Stud poker     stud poker is a variation of poker where players are typically dealt a total of five or seven cards , with the best five card poker hand winning ( in situations where more than one player has the same poker hand , like a flush or straight , the winning hand is determined by whichever players has the highest one ) . stud poker has neither community cards nor blinds . instead , each player at the table must ante first , and then is dealt two cards face down ( hole cards ) and one card face up . in typical stud games , the player with the lowest card showing must pay the ‘ bring in , ’ an amount relative to the limits , which starts off the action . the bring in is typically a fraction of the limits , ( for example , the bring in for a $ 1/2 stud game may be $ .25 ) , with play then continuing clockwise around the table , where players have the choice of folding , calling the bring in , or making the bet ‘ complete ’ ( in our example , completing the bet to $ 1 ) . once a bring in has been completed , it can be raised by a subsequent player , doubling the amount to twice the completed bet .
