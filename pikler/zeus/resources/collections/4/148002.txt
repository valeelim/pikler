British Rail Classes 251 and 261     the blue pullman was a class of luxury train used from 1960 to 1973 by british railways in the united kingdom . as opposed to the previous pullman car company locomotive-hauled carriage trains , and the brighton belle electrical multiple units , the blue pullmans were the first diesel-electric multiple units designed for high-speed pullman train services incorporating several novel features . named after their custom blue livery , the trains were conceived under the railway 1955 modernisation plan , to create new luxury first-class diesel express trains , to compete with the motor car and the emerging domestic air travel market . although not entirely successful in their own right , the blue pullmans demonstrated the possibility of high-speed fixed-formation multiple-unit inter city train services and inspired the later development of the inter city 125. after their withdrawal , none of the units survived into preservation .
