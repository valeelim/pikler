Propositional logic     propositional logic is a formal system in mathematics and logic . other names for the system are `` propositional calculus '' and `` sentential calculus '' . the system is made of a set of propositions . each proposition has a truth value , it is either true or false . propositions can be joined together using logical connectives to make new propositions . examples for logical connectives that are used often are logical and , logical or , logical if , logical if and only if and logical not . propositional logic only looks at the propositions and how they are connected , it does not decompose the propositions . that way , the proposition `` all cats are dogs and the earth is a disc '' is made of two propositions , `` all cats are dogs '' , `` the earth is a disc '' . these are joined together with and . there are other logic systems that build on propositional logic . one of these is predicate logic , which defines logical predicates , and looks at how they can be applied to arguments . another system is called modal logic . it introduces two new junctors `` it is possible , that '' and `` it is necessary , that '' .
