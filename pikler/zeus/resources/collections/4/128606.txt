Error detection and correction     error detection and correction is about methods to make sure that information or data is not corrupted , and still makes sense . the techniques help reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels . there are different ways to make sure an error can be detected . this is done by adding more data or information to the data transmitted . adding more data than needed is called redundancy . - repetition codes : the data is broken up into blocks . each block is then sent a number of times . - parity bits can be used . the parity bit is 1 for an odd number of ones , and 0 for an even number ( or vice versa ) - checksums - cyclic redundancy checks - hamming codes - hash function - longitudinal redundancy check - transverse redundancy check - polarity schemes there are two main ways to correct an error : - automatic repeat request ( arq ) - the receiver detects an error and automatically requests a repetition - forward error correction other websites . - error control ] -- citizendium
