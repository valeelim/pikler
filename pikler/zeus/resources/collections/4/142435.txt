Muskrat     muskrats are rodents that live in freshwater and saltwater marshes , lakes , ponds , and streams . muskrats often build dome-shaped houses in marshes . these houses , made of plants , protect the muskrat from predators , since the only entrance is underwater . some muskrats live in burrows on the water banks . muskrats are excellent swimmers but are slow on land . muskrats are native to north america , but have been brought to europe and asia , where they now live in the wild . muskrats got their name because they have musk glands that produce a strong scent .
