Louse     lice ( singular : louse ) , are wingless insects that live in hair . they are all external parasites on every species of bird and most mammalian orders . they are not found on monotremes and a few eutherian orders , namely the bats ( chiroptera ) , whales , dolphins and porpoises ( cetacea ) and pangolins ( pholidota ) . there are more than 3,000 different species ; three are classified as human lice . lice spend their whole life on the host . they are adapted to keep close contact with the host . these adaptations are reflected in their size ( 0.5â€“8 mm ) , stout legs , and claws which are adapted to clinging tightly to hair , fur and feathers . they are also wingless and flattened . lice feed on skin ( epidermal ) debris , feather parts , sebaceous secretions and blood . a louse 's color varies from pale beige to dark grey ; however , if feeding on blood , it may become considerably darker . a louse 's egg is commonly called a `` nit '' . lice attach their eggs to their host 's hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to separate without specialized products . living lice eggs tend to be pale white . dead lice eggs are more yellow . lice are very annoying and are difficult to remove , but not impossible . the process is called `` nit-picking '' , and is often done with a close-toothed metal comb . for humans , anti-insect shampoos are available .
