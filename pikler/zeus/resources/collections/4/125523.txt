Sniper rifle     a sniper rifle is a type of gun used to accurately shoot targets a long distance away . a person who uses a sniper rifle in the military is called a sniper . a sniper rifle is much more accurate than a normal rifle . almost all sniper rifles use a sniper scope , a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away . there are two different kinds of sniper rifles : bolt action rifles , which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot , and semi-automatic ( `` semi-auto '' ) rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled , and automatically ready the next shot for firing . fully automatic rifles , which fire continuously when the trigger is pulled as long as there is ammunition , generally are not used though in rare instances they can be converted into a sniper rifle . in one such instance , a heavy machine gun with a scope , while not a true sniper rifle , set the record for longest kill by a sniper for years , until advances in rifle technology and sniper training allowed a sniper with a true sniper rifle to beat that record .
