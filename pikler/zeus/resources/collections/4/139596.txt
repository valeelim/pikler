Pre-shared key     in cryptography , a pre-shared key or psk is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used . such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms . the characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it ; some system require that such keys be in a specific format . it can be a password like 'bret13i ' , a passphrase like 'idaho hung gear id gene ' , or a hexadecimal string like '65e4 e556 8622 eee1 ' . the secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems . the term is used in wi-fi encryption such as wep or wpa , where both the wireless access points ( ap ) and all clients `` share '' the same key . since one weakpoint of the crypto system is the encryption algorithm 's key , the key strength is important , and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key length , it is important to choose a key whose length is cryptographically secure ( see password strength ) . there are several tools available to help one choose a strong key . the diceware method is one example .
