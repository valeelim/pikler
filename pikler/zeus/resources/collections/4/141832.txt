Allspice     allspice ( also called jamaica pepper , kurundu , myrtle pepper , pimento , allspice berries , or newspice ) is a spice which is the dried unripe fruit of the `` pimenta dioica '' plant , a tree native to the west indies , southern mexico and central america . the tree pimenta diocia is from the myrtle family ( myrtaceae ) , and it is very valued for its berries . the allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of cloves , cinnamon , and nutmeg . it is used very much in baking , mostly for making mincemeat and mixed pickling spice . it was discovered first by the early spanish explorers , who mistook it for a type of pepper . allspice is the only spice grown in the western hemisphere . but after that , the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left . there are many plantations in mexico and central america , too . however , the best allspice comes from jamaica where the weather and soil are best for the berries . allspice was used by the mayans and by other south american indians when making chocolate . the name `` jamaica '' comes from xamayca . this means ‘ land of wood and water ’ in the language of the arawaks . the arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting , or sometimes against their enemies .
