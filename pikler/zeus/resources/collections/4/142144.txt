Kavirondo     kavirondo is the old name of the region around kavirondo gulf ( now winam gulf ) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of british east africa ( the `` nilotic kavirondo '' and the `` bantu kavirondo '' ) . broadly , this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the nzoia river , on the western slopes of mount elgon , and along the northeast coast of victoria nyanza . suggested origins of the name `` kavirondo '' include - from local young warriors , armed with spears , bows , arrows , & clubs , who were observed to sit on their heels , which in kiswahili is `` kaa virondo '' . thus the region became kavirondo , the inhabitants pejoratively called `` wa-kavirondo '' : “ people who sit on their heels ” - from `` kaba-londo '' : in buganda two unusual words related to royalty were combined , kabaka , the king & `` namu-londo '' , the stool used as throne on which the king is crowned . kavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes : the bantu immigrated from the south and the other nilotic , came from the north . the bantu appear to have been the first . the nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the acholi . they appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home , the country around kavirondo gulf . of the two groups the bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors , and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race ( hobley ) . their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the nilotic tribes , while the nilotic kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of elgumi people ( themselves probably of nilotic origin ) from the east .
