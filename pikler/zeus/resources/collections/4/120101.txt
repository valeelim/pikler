Red-necked wallaby     the red-necked wallaby ( `` macropus rufogriseus '' ) is a medium-sized macropod , common in parts of eastern australia . as one of the largest wallabies , it looks like a kangaroo . males can weigh more than 20 kg and have a head-body length of 90 cm . red-necked wallabies have a black nose and paws , white stripe on the upper lip , and a medium grey coat with a red color on their neck . red-necked wallabies are found along the coast and forests of eastern australia , from rockhampton , queensland to the south australian border ; in tasmania and on many of the bass strait islands ( many of these may have been introduced to the islands ) . in tasmania , north-east new south wales and coastal queensland , their numbers have got bigger over the past 30 years . this is because they are no longer hunted . a lot of forest has been cleared for grass where wallabies can feed at night , alongside trees where they can shelter by day . it is less common in victoria . like most macropods , the red-necked wallaby lives by itself . groups , also called mobs , share feeding areas . they feed at night and in the late afternoon , generally eating grass and herbs close to forest shelter .
