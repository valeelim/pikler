Peter Henlein     peter henlein ( or henle or hele ) ( 1479/1480 – august 1542 ) , was a locksmith and watchmaker from nuremberg . he is often said to be the inventor of the watch . this is disputed . henlein was certainly one of the first makers of the watch . although many say that henlein invented the mainspring , there are descriptions and two surviving examples show that spring driven clocks had already been made by the early 1400s . he did make improvements to the balance spring , which made it possible to make the watches smaller . around 1504 to 1508 henlein did make a watch ; a small , drum-shaped `` taschenuhr '' . it could run for forty hours before it needed rewinding . they were small enough to be worn around the neck , or carried in a bag or pocket . his watch only had an hour hand . books . - jürgen abeler : `` in sachen peter henlein '' . wuppertaler uhrenmuseum , wuppertal 1980 - maren winter : `` der stundensammler '' . wilhelm heyne verlag , münchen 2004 ( roman ) , isbn 3-453-40146-8,1510 : peter henlein invents the pocket watch
