Diacritic     a diacritic ( for example , an `` accent '' ) is a mark put above , below , through or on a letter . the word comes from the greek word διακριτικός ( transl . diakritikós = 'distinguishing ' ) . usually , it affects the way the word is said ( pronounced ) . most diacritics concern pronunciation because most alphabets do not describe the sounds of words exactly . diacritics are rare in english , but common in many other languages . diacritics are not used much in modern english . there are two types of diacritics that have become part of everyday english : the dot and the apostrophe . but they are no longer commonly thought of as being diacritical . the apostophe is used to show missing letters ( elision , `` it 's '' to replace `` it is '' ) and show possession ( as in `` mike 's car '' ) . in most other cases , use of diacritics for native english words is considered old-fashioned ( not used anymore ) . diaereses ( similar to umlauts ) can be used on words where two vowels next to each other are pronounced separately ( rather than together as a diphthong ) , like `` noöne '' , `` reëstablished '' , or `` coöperate '' . this method is still used sometimes , depending on the word . diacritics are sometimes used in loanwords ( words of foreign origin ) , such as `` naïve '' , `` entrée '' , `` pâté '' .
