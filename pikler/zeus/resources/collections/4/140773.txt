Needham-Schroeder protocol     the term needham-schroeder protocol can refer to one of two communication protocols intended for use over an insecure network , both protocols designed by roger needham and michael schroeder . the two protocols are : 1. the needham-schroeder symmetric key protocol is based on a symmetric encryption algorithm . it forms the basis for the kerberos protocol . this protocol aims to establish a session key between two parties on a network to protect their communication . 1. the needham-schroeder public-key protocol , based on public-key cryptography . this is intended to provide mutual authentication between two parties communicating on a network , but in its proposed form it is not secure . other pages . - kerberos other websites . - http : //www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/nspk.html - description of the public-key protocol - http : //www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/nssk.html - the symmetric-key protocol - http : //www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/nspklowe.html - the public-key protocol amended by lowe
