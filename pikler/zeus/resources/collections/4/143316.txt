Ultra high frequency     ultra high frequency ( uhf ) is a electromagnetic radiation . especially its frequency is between 300 mhz and 3 ghz ( 3,000 mhz ) . because of short wavelength , uhf has strong directivity and it has small area . uhf is commonly used for television signals . it is strong enough to be protected from other signal , but because of its strong directivity , receiving error by an obstacle occurs more . hence it needs sensitive sensors . uhf frequencies have higher attenuation from atmospheric moisture and benefit less from 'bounce ' , or the reflection of signals off the ionosphere back to earth , when compared to vhf frequencies . the frequencies of 300–3000 mhz are always at least an order of magnitude above the muf ( maximum usable frequency ) . the muf for most of the earth is generally between 25–35 mhz . higher frequencies also benefit less from ground mode transmission . however , the short wavelengths of uhf frequencies allow compact receiving antennas with narrow elements ; many people consider them less ugly than vhf-receiving models
