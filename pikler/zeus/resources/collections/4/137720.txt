Meet-in-the-middle attack     the meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack which , like the birthday attack , makes use of a space-time tradeoff . while the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range , the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second functionâ€”quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function . it was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by diffie and hellman in 1977. when trying to improve the security of a block cipher , one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme . certainly , an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take formula_1 attempts if each key is n bits long , compared to the formula_2 attempts required for a single key . however , diffie and hellman , discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme . the attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end , thus meeting in the middle .
