Rocket engine     a rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle . rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion . in some cases ( such as nasa rockets ) , the force created can be over . a garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force . when a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still . the exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine . some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels . solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called `` rocket motors '' . liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move ( and pressurize ) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine . these machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures . liquid oxygen is very cold ( -223˚c ) while the engine is very hot ( 3000˚c ) , and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure . because of these conditions , liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials ( metals , ceramics , etc . ) .
