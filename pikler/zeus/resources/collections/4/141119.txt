Asceticism     asceticism ( greek : `` askēsis '' ) is a word that describes a certain way of living . in this kind of life , a person gets rid of worldly pleasures for religion or spirituality . a person might not have sex or drink alcohol . one might spend much of their time in prayer or meditation . often , the reason is to follow goals of christianity and the indian religions ( including yoga ) . these teach that salvation and freedom involve a process of changing one 's mind and body . this is done by limiting speech , what one thinks and does with the body . the earliest people who practiced buddhism , jainism , and the christian hermits , lived very simply and without luxury . they rejected sensual pleasures and keeping money . this did not mean that life could not be enjoyed . but spiritual and religious goals are hindered by such indulgence . asceticism is closely related to the abstinence and the christian concept of chastity and might be said to be the technical implementation of the abstract vows of renunciation . those who practice ascetic lifestyles do not consider their practices as virtuous but pursue such a life-style in order to satisfy certain technical requirements for mind-body transformation . there is remarkable uniformity among the above religions with respect to the benefits of sexual continence . religions teach that purifying the soul also involves purification of the body which thereby enables connection with the divine and the cultivation of inner peace . in the popular imagination asceticism is considered a sort of perversion ( self-flagellation by birch twigs as the archetypal stereotype of self-mortification ) but the `` askēsis '' enjoined by religion functions in order to bring about greater freedom in various areas of one 's life , such as freedom from compulsions and temptations bringing about peacefulness of mind with a concomitant increase in clarity and power of thought .
