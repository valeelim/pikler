Padded cell     a padded cell is a special room in a hospital for mentally ill people . it 's made so that the patients can be put there when they go through a crisis ( or they have a fit or seizure ) . they are put there so they can go through their crisis on their own , without putting others into danger . padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis can not hurt themselves . padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry . in the 1980s , their use declined in europe . this is because there are drugs that can be given that make them nearly unnecessary . they are still widely used , especially in africa and asia . seizures and crises are usually very tiring . for this reason , patients usually only spend a short time in these cells . they usually collapse because of fatigue rather quickly . when they do , they need medical attention quickly .
