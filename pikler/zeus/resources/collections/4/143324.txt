Photoelectric effect     the photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in physics . the effect is based on the idea that electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of particles called photons . when a photon hits an electron on a metal surface , the electron can be emitted . the emitted electrons are called photoelectrons . the effect is also called the hertz effect , because it was discovered by heinrich rudolf hertz , but this name is not used often . the photoelectric effect has helped physicists understand the quantum nature of light and electrons . the concept of waveâ€“particle duality was developed because of the photoelectric effect . not every electromagnetic wave will cause the photoelectric effect , only radiation of a certain frequency or higher will cause the effect . the minimum frequency needed is called the `` cutoff frequency '' or `` threshold frequency ' . the cutoff frequency is used to find the work function , w , which is the amount of energy holding the electron to the metal surface . the work function is a property of the metal and is not affected by the incoming radiation . if a frequency of light strikes the metal surface that is greater than the cutoff frequency , then the emitted electron will have some kinetic energy .
