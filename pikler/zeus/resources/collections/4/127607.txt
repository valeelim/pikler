Polarization     polarization ( also polarisation ) is a property of some types of waves . some waves have motion in another direction as well as the direction of the wave . in water , for instance , the wave will move across the water , but something on the surface of the water will move up and down . light waves are similarly transverse waves though they are also particles . sound waves do not have polarization , since they are longitudinal waves . light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarized , except when the light is perpendicular to the surface . polarization was first discovered in 1808 by the mathematician etienne louis malus . a polarizing filter , such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses , can be used to observe this effect by rotating the filter while looking through it at the reflection off of a distant horizontal surface . at certain rotation angles , the reflected light will be reduced or eliminated . polarizing filters remove light polarized at 90° to the filter 's polarization axis . if two polarizers are placed atop one another at 90° angles to one another , very little light can pass through both .
