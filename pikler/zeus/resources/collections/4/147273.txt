'' the melody `` started off a lot slower '' according to will champion , the band 's drummer , and sounded like a neil young song . not long after , despite not taking the song seriously , martin 's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse . when jonny buckland , the band 's guitarist , started playing it and added to it with his own ideas , they had created the riff , `` and it sort of got a bit heavier '' .
