Solid mechanics     solid mechanics is the branch of mechanics , physics , and mathematics that concerns itself with how solid matter under external actions works ( such as external forces , temperature changes , applied displacements , etc. ) . it is part of a larger study known as continuum mechanics . one of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the euler-bernoulli beam equation .
