Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics     the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics , ( nuts ) for the french nomenclature d'unit√©s territoriales statistiques , is a geocode standard that shows the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes . it was made by the european union , so it only covers the member states of that union in detail . a nuts code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country , and is identical to the iso 3166-1 alpha-2 code ( the only difference is `` uk '' instead of `` gb '' for the united kingdom ) . the subdivision of the country is then displayed by one number . a second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each . each numbering starts with 1 , as 0 is used for the upper level . in case the subdivision has more than 9 entities , capital letters are used to continue the numbering . in addition to the full three levels for the european union countries , all countries have a nuts code with a two-letter code for a continent and two numbers for the country , and for the usa , canada and australia the states , provinces , and territories are numbered separately .
