Tibetan Fox     the tibetan sand fox ( `` vulpes ferrilata '' ) is a species of true fox . it is endemic to the high tibetan plateau in nepal , china , and kashmir , up to altitudes of about 5300 metres . it is sometimes referred to as the tibetan fox , or simply as the sand fox , but this terminology is confusing because the corsac fox ( vulpes corsac ) , which lives in arid environments north and west of the tibetan plateau , is often called the `` sand fox '' as well .
