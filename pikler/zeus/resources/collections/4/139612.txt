IPsec     internet protocol security ( ipsec ) is a way of making internet communications more secure and private . ipsec is a collection of protocols for securing internet protocol ( ip ) communications by authenticating ( and optionally encrypting ) each of a data stream . ipsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session . ipsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts ( e.g . computer users or servers ) , between a pair of security gateways ( e.g . routers or firewalls ) , or between a security gateway and a host . rfc 2406 ipsec is an end-to-end security solution and operates at the internet layer of the internet protocol suite , comparable to layer 3 in the osi model . other internet security protocols in widespread use , such as ssl , tls and ssh , operate in the upper layers of these models . this makes ipsec more flexible , as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols , because applications do not need to be designed to use ipsec , whereas the use of tls/ssl or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application .
