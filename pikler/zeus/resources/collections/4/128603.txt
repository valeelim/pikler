Forward error correction     in telecommunications forward error correction ( fec ) is a special code . the sender adds parts of the data again . this is called redundancy . the receiver is then able to detect certain errors that came from the sending the data . in certain cases , the receiver can correct the error , without the need for a retransmission . fec adds redundancy to the transmitted information with a known algorithm . each redundant bit is a function of many original information bits . the original information may or may not appear in the encoded output ; codes that include the unmodified input in the output are systematic , while those that do not are nonsystematic . an extremely simple example would be an analog to digital converter that samples three bits of signal strength data for every bit of transmitted data . if the three samples are mostly all zero , the transmitted bit was probably a zero , and if three samples are mostly all one , the transmitted bit was probably a one . the simplest example of error correction is for the receiver to assume the correct output is given by the most frequently occurring value in each group of three .
