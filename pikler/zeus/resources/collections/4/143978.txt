Endoscopy     endoscopy means to `` look inside '' . this often means looking inside the body for medical reasons with an endoscope . an endoscope is a medical instrument that is made to see parts inside a patient 's body . this has the advantage that observations and certain operations can be done without opening up the body . whatever precautions are taken , an open body part is always at risk of infection . the endoscope has a long tube to enter the patient 's body and a tiny camera or lens attached to the front of this tube . it is usually inserted into patient 's nose , mouth , or anus , so surgeons can see what is going on . if necessary , various actions can be taken . an endoscope has at least some of these parts : - a rigid or flexible tube . - a light , which is usually outside the body and delivered by an optical fibre system . - a lens system which takes the image from the objective lens to the viewer . this can be done by a relay lens system in the case of rigid endoscopes or a bundle of fiberoptics in the case of a fibrescope .
