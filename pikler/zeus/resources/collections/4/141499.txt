Responsible government     responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments . it is not the same as a government with responsibility . a 'responsible government ' is one in which there is a degree of accountability towards parliament . there is also the fundamental concept of bicameralism . for example , in the united kingdom the accountability tends towards the lower house ( house of commons ) , as the upper house ( house of lords ) is not wholly elected . thus , there is a better representation of those who voted for the government that holds the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty . in the government of a country that uses responsible government , the leaders of the executive branch of government ( called the cabinet ) are also members of the legislature . also , the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power . if it loses the support of the legislature , there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet . countries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government . some examples of countries that have responsible government are the united kingdom , canada , and australia .
