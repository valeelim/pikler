Flag of Alabama     the flag of alabama was adopted by the alabama state legislature on february 16 , 1895. it 's believed that the crimson saltire of the flag of alabama was designed to look like the blue saltire of the confederate battle flag . the battle flag was square-shaped , and alabama 's flag is sometimes shown as a square . the authors of a 1917 article in national geographic expressed their opinion that because the alabama flag was based on the battle flag , it should be square . in 1987 , don siegelman issued an opinion in which the battle flag derivation is repeated , but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular , as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions . however , the saltire design of the alabama state flag also looks like several other flags . it is identical to the flag of st. patrick , incorporated into the union flag of the united kingdom to represent the union of the kingdom of great britain with the kingdom of ireland . this has led to other origins being put forth as possibilities .
