Unitarianism     unitarianism is a term that describes some forms of christianity . unitarianism can be described as the belief that god is just one person . this is different from what most other christians think , which is that god is three different people all in the same person . that belief is called trinitarianism . unitarian christians believe in jesus of nazareth . they think that jesus was a great leader and prophet , but they generally do not think that jesus is part of god himself . the `` son of god '' is a being that existed before jesus ' human life . it is called the logos who dwelt with god in the beginning and then was born as the man jesus . however , he is not eternal , but had a beginning of existence . god created him . this theology is commonly called arianism , but there are many varieties of this form of unitarianism . they range from the belief that the son , before he came to earth , was a divine spirit of the same nature as god to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from god . arius ' views are only one variation of this theology .
