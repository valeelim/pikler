Fibonacci number     the fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in mathematics named after leonardo of pisa , known as fibonacci . fibonacci wrote a book in 1202 , called `` liber abaci '' . there he introduced the number pattern to western european mathematics , although mathematicians in india already knew about it . the first number of the pattern is 0 , the second number is 1 , and each number after that is equal to adding the two numbers right before it together . for example 0+1=1 and 3+5=8 . this sequence goes on forever . this can be written as a recurrence relation , for this to make sense , at least two starting points need to be given . here , formula_2 and formula_3 . fibonacci numbers are related to the `` golden ratio '' , which shows up in many places in buildings and in nature . some examples are the pattern of leaves on a stem , the parts of a pineapple , the flowering of artichoke , the uncurling of a fern and the arrangement of a pine cone . the fibonacci numbers are also found in the family tree of honeybees .
