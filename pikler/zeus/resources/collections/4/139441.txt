Branch prediction     in computer architecture , a branch predictor is the part of a processor that determines whether a conditional branch ( jump ) in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not . this is called branch prediction . branch predictors are important in today 's modern , superscalar processors for achieving high performance . they allow processors to fetch and execute instructions without waiting for a branch to be resolved . almost all pipelined processors do branch prediction of some form , because they must guess the address of the next instruction to fetch before the current instruction has been executed . many earlier microprogrammed cpus did not do branch prediction because there was little or no performance requirements ; for this reason there is no need for altering the flow of the instruction stream . other websites . - seznec `` et al .
