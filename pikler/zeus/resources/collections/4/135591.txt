Quagga     the quagga ( `` equus quagga quagga '' ) , also cape quagga , is a recently extinct zebra . it was one of the six subspecies of plains zebra . it was a yellowish-brown zebra with stripes only on its head , neck and forebody , and looks similar to an okapi . the quagga was native to dry grassy plains in the south of the african continent . it was found as far north as the orange river . it is believed to have separated from other plains zebras between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago . the name `` quagga '' comes from the noise that they made . ( kwa-ka-ka ) ( qua-ga-ga ) . the quagga was hunted for food , for their skin and also because farmers did not want it to eat the grass they needed for their sheep and goats . the last wild quaggas died during a drought in 1878. the last captive quagga died in the amsterdam zoo on 12 august 1883. her body is now in a museum . there are 23 quagga specimens in museums , seven skeletons , and some skulls and other bones . a foundation in africa is trying to bring quaggas back to life by taking zebras that have very light stripes and breeding them . they began in 1987 and the first quagga foal was born in 2005 .
