Oneness Pentecostalism     oneness pentecostalism , also known as apostolic pentecostalism , is a movement of christianity that split from the pentecostal movement , at around 1914. followers believe that the bible was inspired by god . `` oneness '' means that they believe that god is one being , not three persons ( like in the trinity doctrine ) , and that jesus is god in human flesh â€“ fully god and fully human . this makes them different from most unitarians who say that the son of god was only man . `` apostolic '' means that they follow the apostolic doctrine ( by the 12 apostles in the early church ) . `` pentecostal '' means that they put an emphasis on the moving of the holy spirit ( like speaking in tongues ) as was done on the day of pentecost .
