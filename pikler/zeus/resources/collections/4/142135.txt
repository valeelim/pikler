Sexual dimorphism     sexual dimorphism is a concept in biology . it means that the male and the female of a species look noticeably different . the word comes from the greek : `` di '' ( two ) and `` morphe '' ( form ) . it is the most common type of polymorphism . it may be the result of sexual selection , that is , competition between members of the same species for reproduction . more generally , sexual dimorphism is inherited , which means the differences between males and females have survival value . the features that distinguish the two sexes of a species are called secondary sex characteristics . they are not directly part of the reproductive system . they are the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in survival and reproduction . the difference between sexes can include : - size : males in some species have harems ( 'ownership ' of a group of females ) . in this case the males are usually larger than the females , e.g . gorillas , lions . - sexual dimorphism is extreme in rotifers , with the males ( if present ) always much smaller than the females . even more extreme are the sea devils , whose tiny males physically fuse with the females to form a chimaera .
