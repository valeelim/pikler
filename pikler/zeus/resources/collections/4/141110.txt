Riemann sum     in mathematics , a riemann sum is a sum that makes an approximation of the total area underneath a curve on a graph . the area can be known as the integral . it may also be used to define the integration operation . the sum is named after a german mathematician who was called bernhard riemann . you divide the horizontal length under the part of the function you want to evaluate into `` n '' equal pieces . that is the n on top of the σ ( greek letter sigma ) . the ( x-x ) represents the size of one horizontal segment that is created from dividing the whole by the `` n '' . the f ( y ) is a y value in an `` n '' segment . since the area of a rectangle is `` length '' × `` width '' , the multiplication of x and f ( y ) is the area of a rectangle for that part of the graph . the σ means we add up all of these small rectangles to get an approximation of the area under the segment of a function . other websites . - a simulation showing the convergence of riemann sums
