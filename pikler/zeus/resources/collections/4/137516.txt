Twofish     in cryptography , twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths up to 256 bits . in 1997 , the nist announced for competition to choose a successor to des to be known as aes , twofish was one of the `` five finalists '' of the advanced encryption standard competition , but was not selected as a standard . twofish is related to the earlier block cipher blowfish . twofish 's main features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent s-boxes , and a relatively complex key schedule . one half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm ( key-dependent s-boxes ) . twofish uses some elements from other designs ; for example , the pseudo-hadamard transform ( pht ) from the safer family of ciphers . twofish uses the same feistel structure as the des . on most software platforms twofish is slightly slower than rijndael ( the chosen algorithm for advanced encryption standard ) for 128-bit keys , but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys .
