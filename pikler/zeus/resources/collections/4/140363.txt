Golden poison frog     the golden poison frog , `` phyllobates terribilis '' , or the golden dart frog , is a poison dart frog . it lives in the pacific coast of colombia . in captivity , poison dart frogs are not poisonous . it is in the wild where they are poisonous because of what they eat . this amphibian of the dendrobatidae family is currently considered the most poisonous vertebrate worldwide . the optimal habitat of `` p. terribilis '' is the rainforest with high rain rates ( 5 m. or more ) , altitude between 100-200 m , temperature of 26 Â°c , and relative humidity of 80-90 % . the high toxicity of `` p. terribilis '' may be due to eating small insects or other arthropods , and one of these may truly be the most poisonous creature on earth . scientists have suggested the crucial insect may be a small beetle from the family melyridae . at least one species of these beetles produces the same toxin found in `` p. terribilis '' . their relatives in colombian rainforests could be the source of the batrachotoxins found in the highly toxic `` phyllobates '' frogs of that region .
