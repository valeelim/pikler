Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology    self-monitoring , analysis and reporting technology self-monitoring , analysis , and reporting technology , or s.m.a.r.t . is a system to watch computer hard disks to help stop the risk of failures . it does this by watching of the hard disks to try and see when a failure might happen and where . hard drive failures fall into two categories : - `` predictable failures '' ' happen over a longer time period . examples for this is mechanical wear , or degradation of the surface of the storage device . - `` unpredictable failures '' happen suddenly , in an unforeseen manner . examples for this is the failure of an electronic component , or sudden mechanical failure , perhaps because of bad handling . predictable failures can be detected by certain monitoring devices . this is like a thermometer in a vehicle that can alert the driver to do something before serious damage occurs , for example because the engine is too hot . about 60 % of all drive failures are caused by failing mechanics . most mechanical failures result from gradual wear . an eventual failure may be catastrophic . before complete failure occurs , there are usually certain signs that failure is imminent . these may include increased heat output , a more noisy drive , problems with reading or writing data and a big increase in the number of damaged disk sectors .
