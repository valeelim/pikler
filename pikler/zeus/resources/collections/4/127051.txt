Megalodon     the megalodon was the largest shark of all time . its scientific name is carcharodon megalodon . it lived from the late oligocene to early pleistocene epochs , 28 to 1.5 million years ago ( mya ) . this giant of a shark was a huge version of the current great white shark , `` carcharodon carcharias '' . megalodon had teeth , which are among the largest ever found , over 7 inches ( 18 cm ) long . nicolaus steno was the first to recognise the teeth as those of a giant shark . the shark was up to 52 feet long ( 16 meters ) and weigh over 60 tons . the skeleton of a megalodon was made of cartilage , but it was calcified : it had calcium to strengthen it . megalodon teeth , however were bone and can be found in all oceans . other remains found are vertebrae . fossil records of `` c. megalodon '' indicate that it occurred in subtropical to temperate latitudes . before the formation of the isthmus of panama , the seas were relatively warmer . this would have made it possible for the species to live in all the oceans of the world .
