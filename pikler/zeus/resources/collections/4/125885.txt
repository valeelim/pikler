Clouded leopard     the clouded leopard ( `` neofelis nebulosa '' ) is a rare cat species . it is a medium-sized felid , found from the himalayan foothills through mainland southeast asia into china . it is 55 to 110 cm ( 2 ft to 3 ft 6 in ) long and weighs between 15 and 23 kg ( 33 to 50 lb ) . it is classified as vulnerable in 2008 by iucn . its total population may be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals . clouded leopards hunt in trees as well as on the ground . their prey are monkeys and birds . they are one of the few cats who are arboreal . the genetic analysis of specimens of `` neofelis nebulosa '' and its close relative `` neofelis diardi '' suggests the two species diverged 1.4 million years ago . a group crossed a now submerged land bridge to borneo and sumatra from mainland asia . and , the sunda clouded leopard is different enough on the two large islands to be classed as two subspecies . the split between the two subspecies corresponds roughly with the catastrophic eruption of the toba supervolcano in sumatra 69,000â€“77,000 years ago . a probable scenario is that sunda clouded leopards from borneo recolonized sumatra during periods of low sea levels in the pleistocene , and these were later separated from their source population by rising sea levels .
