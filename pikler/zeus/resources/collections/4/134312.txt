Church of Scotland     the church of scotland is the national church of scotland , established by law . it is presbyterian . the presbyterian church of scotland is distinguished from the anglican church in a number of ways . it does not have bishops or archbishops ; nor is the british monarch its head . the leading minister is called the moderator , who is the chair of the general assembly for one year . ministers of the kirk , as it is called , may be called rectors . the established kirk has suffered schism ( breaks ) , and this has given rise to the `` wee frees '' : the free church of scotland , and ( a further schism ) the free church of scotland ( continuing ) ( the wee wee frees ) ; and the free presbyterian church of scotland ( also , confusingly , called the wee wee frees ) . the scottish presbyterian church was formed when it broke away from rome in 1560. its theology ( beliefs ) were based on the ideas of john knox , a disciple of john calvin . the free kirks tend to take the bible more literally . about 10 % of the people in scotland are members of this church , but when asked in a census , 47 % of people said this was their religion .
