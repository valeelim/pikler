Taxane     taxanes are poisonous alkaloids produced by yew plants . alkaloids are natural basic chemical compounds which contain nitrogen atoms . the name comes from the word alkaline and was used to describe any alkaline containing nitrogen . alkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms , but taxanes are produced only by plants of the genus `` taxus '' . taxanes work mainly by disrupting the function of cell microtubules . microtubules are essential to cell division , so taxanes are essentially mitotic inhibitors . this explains why taxanes have been used to produce chemotherapy drugs .
