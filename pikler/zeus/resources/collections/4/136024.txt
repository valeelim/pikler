Port forwarding     port forwarding , also referred to as port mapping , is a method of forwarding a network port from one network node to another . this technique can allow an external user to reach a port on a private ip address ( inside a lan ) from the outside using a nat-enabled router . port forwarding allows remote computers ( e.g . public machines on the internet ) to connect to a specific computer within a private lan . for example : - forwarding of port 80 to run an http webserver within private lan from internet - forwarding of port 22 to allow secure shell access within private lan from internet - forwarding of port 21 to allow ftp access within private lan from internet port forwarding is not necessary with ipv6 , because every ipv6-enabled device has a public ipv6 address . other pages . - internet protocol suite - communications protocol
