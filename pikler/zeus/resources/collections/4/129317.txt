Large Hadron Collider     the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the world 's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator . it was built by the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) . it is a giant circular tunnel built underground . the tunnel is 17 miles ( 27 kilometers ) long , and between 50 and 175 meters below the ground . it lies beneath the border of switzerland and france . 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 different countries worked together in the making of this project , and it cost 10.4 billion swiss francs ( $ 10 billion ) to build . it is now the largest and most complicated experimental research facility in the world . as its name states , the research at the lhc involves the collision of hadrons . a hadron is a particle which consists of a number of quarks held together by the subatomic strong force . protons and neutrons are examples of a hadron . the lhc primarily uses the collision of protons in its experiments . protons are parts of atoms with a positive charge . the lhc accelerates these protons through the tunnel until they reach nearly the speed of light . different protons are directed through the tunnel in opposite directions . when they collide , they create conditions similar to the early universe .
