Mortgage     a mortgage is a way to use one 's real property , like land , a house , or a building , as a guarantee for a loan to get money . many people do this to buy the home they use for mortgage : the loan provides them the money to buy the house and the loan is guaranteed by the house . in a mortgage , there is a debtor and a creditor . the debtor is the owner of the property , while the creditor is the owner of the loan . when the mortgage transaction is made , the debtor gets the money with the loan , and promises to pay the loan . the creditor will receive money back with interest over time ( usually in payments made each month by the debtor ) . if the debtor does not pay the loan , the creditor may take the mortgaged property in place of the loan . this is called foreclosure . in the 2008 american economic failure , creditors lent money to debtors who could not pay back that money . this lowered housing prices and hurt the economy . defined under section 58 ( b ) of the indian transfer of property act as a simple mortgage is a transaction whereby â€˜ without delivering possession ( ownership or occupancy ) of the mortgaged property , the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage money and agrees , expressly or implicitly , that in the event of his failing to pay according to his contract , the mortgagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to be sold by a decree ( an order of law ) of the court in a suit ( a case in a law court ) and the proceeds of the sale to be applied so far as may be necessary in payment of the mortgage money ; there is no foreclosure of the mortgaged property . normally a mortgage is to be registered if the mortgaged money is rs.100 or more . mortgage deed is to be executed and appropriately stamped ad valorem with two best available witnesses .
