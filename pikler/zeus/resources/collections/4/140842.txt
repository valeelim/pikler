Naturism     naturism or nudism ( from latin `` nudus '' - `` nude '' ) is a term used by many action groups in society . these action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling , even around other people , and often with males and females mixed together . usually , nakedness is seen without any relation to sex . rather , these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude , like bathing . often , they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary , like naked bicycle tours . it is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group . in 1903 , paul zimmermann opened the first club , `` freilichtpark '' ( in english , `` free light park '' ) , near hamburg , germany . in the united states , german immigrant kurt barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of new york city . his club was called `` the american league for physical culture '' ( alpc ) and started in the late 1920 's . zimmermann 's vice president was a man named ilsley boone . boone had been a minister ( religious leader ) of a large church . he quit to become involved with naturism all the time , and soon replaced zimmermann as president . also , he renamed the alpc as the `` american sunbathing association . '' since 1995 , it is known as the `` american association for nude recreation ( aanr ) . ''
