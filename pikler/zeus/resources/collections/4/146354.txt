Judicial nullification     judicial nullification is a right of a judges to nullify ( make invalid ) a law if they feel it is too harsh in a particular situation where it is being applied . during the constitutional convention many , including george mason , elbridge gerry and james wilson felt the courts could decide if a law was unconstitutional , and if so , refuse to enforce it . other founding fathers including john francis mercer , gouverneur morris and john dickinson argued against allowing judges to have that power . the issue was left unanswered . however , when deciding that a new law needed the approval of the president , all attempts to have the judiciary approve new laws were soundly defeated . judicial nullification is sometimes used to mean jury nullification . however , in most uses it means nullifying a law , legal code or statute by a member of the judiciary . in 2011 the supreme court made a ruling that , in essence , says lower court judges can ignore the law . there were three petitions before the court asking if federal courts need to be stopped from ignoring laws , rules and facts . the supreme court refused to grant `` certiorari '' ( a writ seeking judicial review of a matter ) . in other words , the court refused to consider the three petitions .
