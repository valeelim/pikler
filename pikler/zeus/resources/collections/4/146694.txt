Falsifiability     falsifiability is the capacity to prove something is not correct . scientists make hypotheses and theories about their fields of study . at the start , they hope their hypothesis or theory is true but they and other scientists will use the scientific method to try and prove it false . falsifiability ( or refutability ) means that a theory or hypothesis can be proved wrong because it failed a critical test or experiment . a famous example in the 20th century was the expedition led by arthur eddington to principe island in africa in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the sun during a solar eclipse . the observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the sun were changed . in effect , the light passing the sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation . this confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by albert einstein in the general theory of relativity , published in 1915. eddington 's observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favour of einstein 's theory . had the observations resulted differently , this would have counted against einstein 's theory , and perhaps refuted it .
