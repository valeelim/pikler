Virgin birth of Jesus     the virgin birth of jesus is a belief held by christians , jews and muslims . it says that mary , jesus ' mother , was a virgin even after she became pregnant with jesus . by the 2nd century , most people in the christian church believed this . the idea of the virgin birth was included in the two most common christian creeds , the nicene creed and the apostles ' creed . the nicene creed says that jesus `` was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary '' ( meaning that jesus was god in human form , and was born to the virgin mary ) . the apostles ' creed also says that jesus was `` born of the virgin mary . '' the belief was not challenged , except by some sects which were not very important , before the enlightenment theology of the eighteenth century . the gospels of matthew and luke say that mary was a virgin and that jesus was created by the holy spirit . these gospels started the belief that jesus ' creation was a miracle . this belief , which is now common in christianity , says that jesus had no natural father ; no sexual intercourse and no male seed was involved in creating him . the gospel of matthew also says that the virgin birth of jesus fulfills a prophecy from the book of isaiah .
