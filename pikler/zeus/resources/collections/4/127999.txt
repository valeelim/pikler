Nicotine replacement therapy     the nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products makes people dependent . when they quit , they will get withdrawal symptoms . nicotine replacement therapy ( nrt ) is there to reduce the dependency symptoms . this is usually done by delivering nicotine ( or a substance very similar to it ) in other ways . common methods include `` nicotine patches '' and chewing gums with nicotine in them . cigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year . these people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette , but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide and tars . nrt delivers nicotine to the smoker 's brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do . it helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting , rather than remove them totally . it gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives , and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit . nrt however is best used with some form of support , ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation .
