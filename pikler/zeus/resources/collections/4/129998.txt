Edward de Bono     edward de bono ( born 19 may 1933 ) is a maltese physician , author , inventor and consultant . he is best known because he invented the term lateral thinking ( structured creativity ) . he is also very much in favour to explicitly teach thinking in schools . most of de bono 's writings are about using lateral thinking to solve problems . in his book `` po : beyond yes and no '' ( 1973 ) , de bono describes what he calls an `` open block '' . this is when people ignore certain things that may solve a problem , because they already have an idea of how the problem should be solved . they may therefore not recognise other solutions to the problem . for example , if a person 's car breaks down , the open block of being used to being in a car may cause them to wait for a taxi , ignoring buses passing by , without even reading the destinations . in this book de bono suggested a number of techniques for overcoming the open block . this includes going back and challenging assumptions , or generating new ideas for addressing problems . de bono calls this a `` po '' . a po is an idea that moves thinking forward to a new place from where new ideas or solutions may be found . po can be taken to mean any of the following : provoking operation , provocative operation or provocation operation .
