Chinese herbology     chinese herbs do not grow in china only . if you find the right climate and soil type , you can grow many of those herbs overseas . for instance , american ginseng is grown in wisconsin state . the raw herbs available in retail have the following natural features : - part of a plant : root , leave , seed , flowers , branch , etc . - unprocessed except being cut , sliced , and cleansed of dirt . - dried because the dried form weighs less and can be stored longer . - some herbs can be eaten after boiling because they turn soft . - most herbs can not be eaten for they remain very coarse after boiling . - herbs in general do not taste good . most taste bitter and earthly . some taste neutral . a few taste even sweet . - inexpensive except for a few like ren shen 人參 , chuan bei mu 川貝母 , or dong chong xia cao 冬虫夏草 . how do people take the raw herbs ? raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them . the natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good . one hour of brewing should be good enough . then you drink one or two cups a day . honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad . the herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you . so an herbal package is really tailor-made for you only .
