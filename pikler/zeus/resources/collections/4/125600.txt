Transmutation     transmutation is a basic process in alchemy . the most important form of transmutation is the change of lead into gold . alchemists tried and failed to change `` base metals '' ( metals of very little value ) into a metal of high value like gold . however , more recent work by james chadwick and ir√®ne joliot-curie in nuclear physics has established that radioactivity does lead to elemental changes .
