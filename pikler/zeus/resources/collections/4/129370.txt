Serial Attached SCSI     serial attached scsi ( sas ) is a technology designed to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives . it is a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel scsi . scsi first appeared in the mid 1980s in corporate data centers . sas uses the standard scsi command set . at present it is slightly slower than the final parallel scsi implementation , but in 2009 it will double its present speed to 6 gbit/s . this will permit much higher speed data transfers . the protocol is `` downwards '' -compatible with second generation sata drives . these drives may be connected to sas backplanes ( controllers ) , but sas drives can not be connected to sata backplanes . the sas protocol is developed and maintained by the t10 technical committee of the international committee for information technology standards ( incits ) and promoted by the scsi trade association ( scsita ) . sas ( serial attached scsi ) vs parallel scsi . - the sas bus is point-to-point while the scsi bus is multidrop . each sas device is connected by a dedicated link to the initiator , unless an expander is used . if one initiator is connected to one target , there is no opportunity for contention ; with parallel scsi , even this situation could cause contention .
