XSL attack     in cryptography , the xsl attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers . the attack was first published in 2002 by researchers nicolas courtois and josef pieprzyk . it was claimed that it may break the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) cipher faster than a brute force attack . aes is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information . finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the secret message without having the key could cause wide damage . in 2004 it was shown by one of the cryptanalysts , that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper . in addition , the method requires long effort . unless shortened , the technique does not reduce the effort to break aes in comparison to a brute force attack . therefore , it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future . however , the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current aes .
