Quantum immortality     quantum immortality is an idea in which it is put forward that the consciousness stays alive even though the conscious being dies . for example , someone sets off a bomb beside the victim , that victim survives in an alternate universe by being injured but living , or by the bomb not blowing up . however , in the original universe , the victim `` dies '' in the blast . the consciousness continues to exist in another , perhaps many alternate universes . this is related to the thought experiment of schr√∂dinger 's cat . the idea is that if you use a special gun that goes off , something called a quark is spinning one way , but not if it spins the other way . however , the quark somehow manages to spin both ways at once , so the universe splits into two separate possibilities as the person pulls the trigger . in one universe , the person survives , in the other , the person dies . the person themself does not notice anything different .
