Menoitios     menoitios ( or menoetius ) was the titan god ( perhaps ) of violent anger , rash action , and human mortality . zeus struck him down with a thunderbolt and sent him to erebos ( the underworld ) as punishment for his hybristic behaviour . he was a son of iapetus and clymene or asia , and a brother of atlas , prometheus and epimetheus . he was killed by zeus with a flash of lightning , in the fight of the titans , and thrown into tartarus . ( hes . theog . 507 , & c. , 514 ; apollod . i . 2 . ยง 3 ; schol . ad aeschyl . prom . 347 . ) the name menoitios was derives from the greek words `` menos '' meaning variously might , force , spirit , passion , batterage , and `` oitos '' meaning ill-fated or doomed . hesiod also describes him as `` hybristes '' , a violent , overbearing and insolent man . menoitios and his brothers , the sons of iapetos , were all depicted with extreme human foibles : prometheus was overly crafty , epimetheus a fool , and atlas exceedingly daring . menoitios was perhaps identical to menoites the herdsman of hades , whom herakles wrestled with in the underworld . this connection with cattle , suggests that he was also the same as bouphagos ( the cattle eater ) son of iapetos , a hybristic man who attacked the goddess artemis in arkadia .
