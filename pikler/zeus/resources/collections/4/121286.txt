Coulomb's law    coulomb 's law coulomb 's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist charles augustin de coulomb . it explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges . electrostatic means electric charges without any motion . let 's think of two electric charges existing in an empty space . if the two charges are opposite , ( + ) and ( - ) charges for example , they will attract each other . and if two charges are both the same , both ( + ) or both ( - ) for example , they will push each other . this is similar to how magnets act , as n and s attract each other , and as n and n , s and s push each other . this is because electric charges make an electric field . if two fields exist in the same space at the same time , then the two fields exert ( ~ put ) force on each other . the force they make on each other is called coulomb 's force or electrostatic force . coulomb 's law explains how big the force will be . coulomb 's law explains the scale between two electric charges . the scale of electrostatic force follows the function below .
