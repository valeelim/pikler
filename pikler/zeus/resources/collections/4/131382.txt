Anglicisation     anglicisation or anglicization is the act of changing of spoken or written elements of another language into a form that can more easily be understood by an english speaker . for instance , the italian name of the city of rome , the capital of italy , is `` '' . english speakers call it `` rome '' to make it sound more english . another example is the city of moscow in russia , which sounds like `` moskva '' in russian , though it is written much differently because russian uses the cyrillic alphabet ( it is written in that language as ) . still , english speakers call the city `` moscow '' because it is easier to say . most of these changes were made a few centuries ago . in some cases the original language was different to the modern one . turin in the piedmont province of italy was called ' in piedmontese , the native language of the region , but is now officially known as ' after its italian name . the english and french name for florence , also in italy , is closer to the original name in latin ( ' ) than is the modern italian name of ' .
