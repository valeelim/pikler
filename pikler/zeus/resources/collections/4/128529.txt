Happy Tree Friends     happy tree friends is a show created by rhode montijo , kenn navarro , warren graff , and aubrey ankrum . it is a flash cartoon , a cartoon made using adobe flash . since it first came out the show has become a popular internet phenomenon and has many fans ( though the show is not as popular as it was a few years ago ) . despite the child-like form of the series and having cute characters , the show is violent and not for small children and is only for adults . while the violence and deaths are comparable to that of `` the itchy & scratchy show '' ( the short cartoon featured on the simpsons ) , the comic book series squeak the mouse , the 1978 film watership down and the 1994 film `` felidae '' , the portrayal of death in `` happy tree friends '' is usually more graphic and anatomically correct , showing bloodshed and dismemberment in more vivid and often exaggerated detail . the show is nearly free of speech ; however , when the characters do speak , their words are severely garbled . though it is easy to tell what each character 's reaction is , their words can hardly be understood at all . according to the website , the idea for `` happy tree friends '' was created by rhode montijo when he drew a yellow rabbit , slightly resembling the character cuddles , on a piece of paper and wrote `` resistance is futile '' underneath it .
