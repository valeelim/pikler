Symmetric-key algorithm     symmetric-key algorithms are ways of doing cryptography where the keys for decryption and encryption are exactly the same shared secret . you can generate the secret randomly , from a password , or through a secret key-exchange procedure like diffie-hellman . symmetric-key algorithms are very important because they are faster on computers than public-key algorithms . in public-key cryptography , also called asymmetric-key cryptography , it is hard to figure out the key for decryption from the key for encryption , so you can tell the key for encryption to the public with no problem , and everyone can send you secret messages . this is very useful , but public-key cryptography algorithms are very slow on computers , so they are actually only used to send a shared secret , and then symmetric-key algorithms are used for everything else because they are faster . there are two kinds of symmetric-key algorithms , called stream ciphers and block ciphers . stream ciphers encrypt a message as a stream of bits one at a time . block ciphers take blocks of bits , encrypt them as a single unit , and sometimes use the answer later too . blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used ; though modern ciphers like the advanced encryption standard use 128-bit blocks .
