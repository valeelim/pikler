Computer model     a computer-based model is a computer program that is designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation . they are used in many ways including in astronomy , economics and sciences such as physics and biology . computer models are used in fields such as earthquake performance simulation and making models of buildings . well known areas which use computer models : - models of the atmosphere for weather forecasts - climate models to predict climate change - agent-based modelling is used to simulate social interactions in artificial intelligence computer modelling often uses numerical analysis to approximate the real solution of the problem . simulation techniques are then used to get values . numerical weather predictions are too inaccurate to give a good local prediction of the weather , so other methods are used to adjust them .
