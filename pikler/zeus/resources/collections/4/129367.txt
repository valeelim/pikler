Parallel ATA     parallel ata is a way to connect storage devices , such as hard disks , solid-state drives , and cd-rom drives inside personal computers . the standard is maintained by x3/incits committee t13 . it used to be called advanced technology attachment with packet interface ( ata/atapi ) . ata/atapi is the result of a long history of development . it is an evolution of the at attachment interface , which was itself evolved in several stages from western digital 's original integrated drive electronics interface . as a result , many near-synonyms for ata/atapi and its previous incarnations exist , including abbreviations such as ide which are still in common informal use . with the market introduction of serial ata in 2003 , the original ata was retroactively renamed parallel ata ( pata ) . parallel ata standards allow cable lengths up to only 18 inches ( 46 centimeters ) . because of this length limit the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface . for many years ata provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application .
