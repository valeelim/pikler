Reduced instruction set computer     a reduced instruction set computing ( acronym risc pronounced `` risk '' ) , represents a cpu design method to simplify instructions which `` do less '' but provide higher performance by making instructions execute very fast . risc was developed as an alternative to what is now known as cisc . however , there are cpu designs other than risc and cisc . some examples are vliw , misc , oisc , massive parallel processing , systolic array , reconfigurable computing , and dataflow architecture . the main feature of a risc processors is a small core logic which allows designers to increase the number of the register set and increase internal parallelism using one of the following methods : 1. instruction level parallelism ( ilp ) which increases the rate at which instructions are executed within a cpu 1. thread level parallelism ( tlp ) which increases the number of threads the cpu can execute `` in-parallel '' . other features , which are typically found in risc architectures are : - uniform instruction format , using a single word with the opcode in the same bit positions in every instruction , requiring less decoding .
