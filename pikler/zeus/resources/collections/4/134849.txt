ASCII     ascii ( pronounced a-skee , rhymes with 'pass-key ' ) , is a table of characters for computers . it is binary code used by electronic equipment to handle text using the english alphabet , numbers , and other common symbols . ascii is an abbreviation for `` american standard code for information interchange '' . ascii was developed in the 1960s and was based on earlier codes used by telegraph systems . the code includes definitions for 128 characters : most of these are the printable characters of the alphabet such as abc , abc , 123 , and ? & ! . there are also control characters that can not be printed but instead control how text is processed , to start a new line for example . those are in the left column in the table below . most of the control characters are no longer used for their original purpose . there is no real formatting control ( for bold or `` italics '' , etc . ) sometimes someone talks about a file or document in ascii , meaning it is in plain text . ascii uses 7 binary digits ( bits ) to represent characters : 1000001 ( or 41 in hexadecimal or 65 in standard base-10 numbers ) represents the upper-case letter a ; 1000010 represents b ; 1000011 represents c ; and so on in sequence . seven bits allowed a `` parity bit '' to be included in each byte sent over a serial port or modems , this bit is used for avoiding errors . this was more important years ago when connections were often noisy .
