Hoatzin     the hoatzin ( `` opisthocomus hoazin '' ) is a tropical bird found in swamps , river forests , and mangroves of the amazon and the orinoco delta in south america . they are the only bird which eats leaves as a main part of their diet . their gut has special adaptations which help their digestion . the hoatzin is also notable for having young with claws on two of their wing digits . they are the only living member of the family opisthocomidae . its close relatives probably died out long ago . there has been much debate about the hoatzin 's relationships with other birds . hoatzin chicks are born with hooks on their wings . they use the hooks to climb around in the trees before they are large enough to fly . hoatzins can fly only short distances even when they are fully grown , so they usually climb . they build their nests over water . if danger threatens , the birds dive into the water . they climb back up the tree after the danger has passed . hoatzins communicate through unusual sounds that resemble wheezing , grunting , growls , and hisses .
