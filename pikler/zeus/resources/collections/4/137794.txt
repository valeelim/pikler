Third law of thermodynamics     the third law of thermodynamics says : - if an object reaches the absolute zero of temperature ( 0 k = −273.15c = −459.67 °f ) , its atoms will stop moving . the definition is : at absolute zero , the entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance is zero . experimentally , it is not possible to obtain −273.15°c , as of now . it is found that most of the gases either liquify or solidify before reaching such a temperature , gaseous molecules no longer remaining . so far , scientists have been able to get close to , but not exactly , absolute zero . this may change in the future . other pages . - zeroth law of thermodynamics - first law of thermodynamics - second law of thermodynamics
