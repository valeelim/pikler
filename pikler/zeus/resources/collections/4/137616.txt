Ingo Rechenberg     `` ingo rechenberg '' ' ( born january 20 1934 in berlin ) is a german computer scientist and professor . rechenberg is a pioneer of the fields of evolutionary computation and artificial evolution . in the 1960s and 1970s he invented a highly influential set of optimization methods known as evolution strategies ( from german `` evolutionsstrategie '' ) . his group successfully applied the new algorithms to challenging problems such as aerodynamic wing design . these were the first serious technical applications of artificial evolution , an important subset of the still growing field of bionics . rechenberg was educated at the technical university of berlin and at the university of cambridge . since 1972 he has been a full professor at the technical university of berlin , where he is heading the department of bionics and evolution techniques . his awards include the lifetime achievement award of the evolutionary programming society ( us , 1995 ) and the evolutionary computation pioneer award of the ieee neural networks society ( us , 2002 ) . in 1954 , rechenberg also became world champion in the field of model airplanes .
