Folly     in architecture , a folly is a building usually constructed strictly for aesthetic pleasure . originally , buildings were made to provide shelter or to house people . follies are just decoration ; they no longer have a building 's original function . they were first constructed to put accents into parks and estates . `` folly '' is used in the sense of fun or light-heartedness , not in the sense of something ill-advised . in general , follies have the following properties : - `` they are buildings , or parts of buildings . '' this makes them clearly different from other garden ornaments such as sculpture . - `` they have no purpose other than as an ornament . '' often they have some of the appearance of a building constructed for a particular purpose , but this appearance is a sham . - `` they are purpose-built . '' follies are deliberately built as ornaments . - `` they are often eccentric in design or construction . '' this is not strictly necessary ; however , it is common for these structures to call attention to themselves through unusual details or form .
