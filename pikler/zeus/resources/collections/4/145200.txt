Opportunity cost     opportunity cost is the value of the next best thing you give up whenever you make a decision . it is `` the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen '' . the idea of an opportunity cost was first begun by john stuart mill . the utility has to be more than the opportunity cost for it to be a good choice in economics . for example , opportunity cost is how much leisure time we give up to work . because leisure and income are both valued , we have to decide whether to work , or do what we want . going to work implies more income but less leisure . staying at home is more leisure yet less income . another example is deciding to stop work to go back to university . by choosing to go to university , your opportunity cost is losing your job and your pay check . even though going back to university has a big opportunity cost , many people think it is a good decision because increased education gives you more job opportunities .
