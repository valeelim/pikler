Real-time operating system     a real-time operating system ( rtos ; commonly pronounced as `` are-toss '' ) is a multitasking operating system designed for real-time applications . such applications include embedded systems , industrial robots , scientific research equipment and others . an rtos simplifies the creation of a real-time applications , but does not guarantee the final result will be real-time ; this requires good development of the software . real-time operating systems use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real-time applications . an rtos can respond more quickly and/or predictably to an event than other operating systems . the main features of an rtos are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency . the basic two designs for rtos are : - event-driven ( priority scheduling ) designs : switch tasks only when an event of higher priority needs service , called pre-emptive priority . - time-sharing designs : switch tasks on a clock interrupt , and on events , called round robin .
