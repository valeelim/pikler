Omega SA     omega sa is swiss watch manufacturer that belongs to the swatch group of companies . it is in biel-bienne ( switzerland ) . omega sa produces watches of a high standard . it was founded in 1848 by louis brandt in la chaux-de-fonds ( switzerland ) . there are many famous people that promote omega sa like michael schuhmacher , george clooney , cindy crawford and nicole kidman . the beginning of omega was 1848 in la chaux-de-fonds . louis brandt opened a factory , that produces watches . the watches made there , carried the name louis brandt . after the death of brandt , his sons transferred the production to biel/bienne ( switzerland ) . there , they started to produce their watches industrially . already in 1898 `` louis brandt & fr√®res '' employed more than 500 workers . in 1894 they changed their name to omega , named after their first watch . this name should show the quality of that watch , because omega is the last letter of the greek alphabet and means `` perfection . '' the afforentioned definition of omega is incorrect . it is true that a omega is the last letter in the greek alphabet , however the term means final , end , and completed . as in alpha and omega or beginning and end . my source comes from miriam webster 's dictionary as well as black 's law dictionary .
