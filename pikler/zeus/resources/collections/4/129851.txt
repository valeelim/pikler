Duarte Province     the duarte province is a dominican province ; it is found in the northeastern part of the country . it has the name of one of the founding fathers of the country , juan pablo duarte . it was created in 1896 as a district ( an old country subdivision ) with the name `` distrito pacificador '' but the constitution of 1907 changed all districts to provinces . in 1925 its name was changed to `` duarte '' . the duarte province is bordered on the east by the maría trinidad sánchez and samaná provinces , on the south by the monte plata and sánchez ramírez provinces , on the west by the la vega and hermanas mirabal provinces and on the north by the espaillat and maría trinidad sánchez provinces . the area that currently forms the duarte province was originally part of la vega province until 1885 when it was made part of the espaillat province . in 1896 , this part of the country was made a province , including some coastal towns that are now part of the maría trinidad sánchez province . with the creation of this last province in 1959 , the duarte province lost all coastal areas and became a landlocked province ( surrounded by other provinces by all sides ) . at this time , the municipalities of the duarte province were san francisco de macorís , castillo , pimentel and villa riva , with hostos as a municipal district .
