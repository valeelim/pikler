Autopsy     an autopsy ( also called a post-mortem examination ) is a medical examination of a corpse to find out what killed it ( disease or injury ) . autopsies are done by specialised doctors , called pathologists . autopsies are not done all the time . they are usually done either for medical reasons , or for legal ones . one of the legal reasons why an autopsy is done is to find out if the death was the result of a crime . a medical case is to find the cause of death when it is unclear . sometimes autopsies are done to train new doctors . sometimes , the cause of death can be found by simply looking at the corpse without opening it . in other cases , it may need to be opened , to find the cause of death . if it is opened , it is usually closed again ; most of the time , corpses are buried . before being buried , they are on display for some time . for this , they need to look acceptable . in certain cases , like when the corpse is opened , special permissions are perhaps necessary . these are usually given by the closest living relative , called next of kin .
