Pretty Good Privacy     pretty good privacy ( pgp ) is a computer program that provides cryptographic and authentication . pgp is often used for signing , encrypting and decrypting electronic mails ( e-mails ) to increase the security of e-mail communications . it was originally created by phil zimmermann in 1991. pgp and other similar products follow the openpgp standard ( rfc 4880 ) for encrypting and decrypting data . openpgp is on the internet standards track ; the current specification is rfc 4880 ( november 2007 ) . openpgp is still under development and the successor to rfc 2440 , which is rfc 4880 , has been made a proposed standard . many e-mail clients provide `` openpgp-compliant '' email security as described in rfc 3156. the free software foundation has developed its own `` openpgp-compliant '' program called gnu privacy guard ( abbreviated gnupg or gpg ) . gnupg is freely available together with all source code under the gnu general public license ( gpl ) and is maintained separately faraway from several graphical user interfaces ( guis ) that interact with the gnupg library for encryption , decryption and signing functions ( see kgpg , seahorse , macgpg ) . several other vendors have also developed `` openpgp-compliant '' software .
