One Hot Minute     one hot minute is the sixth studio album by american alternative rock band red hot chili peppers . it was released on september 12 , 1995 by record label warner bros. records . john frusciante had left the band after their previous album , `` blood sugar sex magik '' , so dave navarro joined as the new guitarist . red hot chili peppers ' music was very different because of navarro . `` one hot minute '' is less about sex and love than the band 's previous work , but is instead about themes like drugs and depression . it also had some heavy metal guitar riffs . anthony kiedis had become addicted to cocaine and heroin in 1994 , so some of the lyrics he wrote were about the effects of drugs . `` one hot minute '' did not sell many copies , even though it reached number four on the `` billboard '' 200 chart . `` blood sugar sex magik '' sold twice as many copies as `` one hot minute '' . in 1998 , navarro was asked to leave the band . red hot chili peppers told the media it was because they and navarro liked to make different kinds of music . stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said that `` '' one hot minute '' is as musically ambitious as `` blood sugar sex magik '' , but is even more unfocused , which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the group 's albums .
