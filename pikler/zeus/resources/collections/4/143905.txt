Hermit crab     the hermit crab is a type of crab that does not have a hard shell . they use old shells for protection . they especially like old whelk shells . when the hermit crab grows in size , it finds a larger shell . the hermit crab is a crustacean , but it is very different from other crustaceans . while most crustaceans are covered from head to tail with a hard exoskeleton , the hermit crab is missing part of its exoskeleton . the back part where its abdomen is located , is soft and squishy . thus , the minute a hermit crab molts into an adult , it sets out to find a shell in which to live . to get into the shell , the hermit crab squeezes in backwards , securing itself with its four back legs . the back legs have hooks that anchor the hermit crab into the shell without difficulty . the next four legs are used for walking , while the front two are its chelipeds . the chelipeds are not equal in size : one is big and other is small . the larger one is used for grabbing prey and guarding the entrance to its shell . all together , hermit crabs have a total of ten legs , including the chelipeds and the rear legs used to anchor to the shell .
