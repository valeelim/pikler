Monologue     a monologue is a long , uninterrupted speech or poem by one person . the person may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud or directly addressing other persons , e.g . an audience , a character , reader , or inanimate object . the term 'dramatic monologue ' is used both for monologues in plays and for the poetic genre . a rant ( also called harangue or declamation ) is a monologue that does not present a well-researched and calm argument ; rather , it is typically an attack on an idea , a person or an institution , and very often lacks proven claims . some rants are used not to attack something , but to defend an individual , idea or organization . rants of this type generally occur after the subject has been attacked by another individual or group . rants are used often in situations requiring monologue . comedians , such as lewis black , adam carolla , and rick mercer , use rants as a way to get their message or punch-line across to the listening audience . a rant can be used to flame members of an email group or electronic mailing list that are failing to reach a consensus on an issue .
