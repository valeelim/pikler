Five Families     the five families are the five major italian-american mafia crime families which have controlled organized crime in new york city since the 1930s . the five families , under the suggestion of salvatore maranzano and charles `` lucky '' luciano , were responsible for the establishment of the commission , a council that changed how things worked with mafia activities in the united states . the five families and their bosses are ( currently ) : - bonanno : vincent `` vinny gorgeous '' basciano ( salvatore montagna is the acting boss ) - gambino : nicholas `` little nick '' corozzo and jackie `` nose '' d'amico - colombo : carmine `` junior '' persico ( thomas gioeli is the acting boss ) - genovese : daniel `` danny the lion '' leo - lucchese : vittorio `` vic '' amuso ( steven `` wonderboy '' crea is the acting boss ) the colombo family was once known as the profaci crime family , until a coup caused a name change in the early 1960s . former godfather joe massino had wanted to change the name of the bonanno family to the massino family but since his arrest and defection it is unlikely to happen . the decavalcante crime family , based in nearby elizabeth , nj , also has ties to the five new york families .
