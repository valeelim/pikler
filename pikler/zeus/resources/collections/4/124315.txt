Hamming code     a hamming code is an error-correcting block code . the code is named after richard hamming who developed it in the 1940s . at the time , hamming worked with machines that had relays and used punched cards to read the data . because they were heavily used , the punched cards often had errors , which needed to be corrected by employees . hamming codes are used for digital signal processing and telecommunications . hamming codes are generated according to certain rules . hamming codes use multiple parity bits . a parity bit tells whether a group of bits is even or odd . in a hamming code , each bit of data is covered by several parity bits . this allows to detect errors , and in certain cases , to correct them as well . a hamming code uses redundancy . if there are three parity bits per code word , the code word must have a length of 7 ( formula_1 , for k as the number of parity bits ) . this leaves 4 bits of user data per code word , in the example . usually , this is written as ( n , n ) , where the first number is the total length of a code word , and the second is the number of bits for user data . the example above is ( 7,4 ) .
