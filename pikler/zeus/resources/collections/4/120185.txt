Sahara pump theory     the sahara pump theory attempts to explain how plants and animals from africa moved into the middle east and then europe and asia . at the time , africa was rainier than it is today , and the sahara was wetter , with bigger lakes and more rivers . african rainy periods are associated with a `` wet sahara '' phase , during which larger lakes and more rivers exist . this causes changes in the type of animals found in the area . regardless of the aridity of the greater sahara , migration along the river corridor was halted when , during a desert phase 1.8-0.8 million years ago , the nile ceased to flow completely and possibly flowed only temporarily in other periods due to nubian swell uplift . during the periods of a wet sahara , the sahara and arabia become a savanna grassland and african flora and fauna become common . during the following dry period , the sahara reverts to desert conditions usually as a result of the retreat of the west african monsoon southwards . evaporation exceeds precipitation , the level of water in lakes like lake chad falls , and rivers become dry wadis .
