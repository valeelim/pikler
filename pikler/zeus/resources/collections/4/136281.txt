Network address translation     in computer networking , network address translation ( nat ) is a technique of modifying the network address information in the ip packet headers while transferring the packet across a traffic routing device ; such a technique remaps a given address space into another address space . this allows multiple computers to share a single public ip address , which has become necessary because there are not enough ip addresses for every computer in the world . today , nat is used to hide networks ( called `` network masquerading '' ) or to hide ip ( called `` ip masquerading '' ) . `` masquerading '' is the mechanism that hides an entire address space , usually consisting of private network addresses ( rfc 1918 ) , behind a single ip address usually in the public domain address space . the nat mechanism is implemented inside a routing device that keeps track of the `` state '' of the network connections . the nat device may also implement a firewall . the router uses translation tables to map the `` hidden '' addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing ip packets on exit from the router so that they appear to originate from the router . in the reverse communications path , responses to the outgoing packets are mapped back to the originating ip address using the reverse of the rules ( `` state '' ) stored in the translation tables . the outgoing ip packets establish the device translation tables .
