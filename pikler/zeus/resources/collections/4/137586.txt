Lakes of Titan     the lakes of titan , a moon of saturn , are made of liquid methane . the lakes were found by the `` cassini-huygens '' space probe . the larger lakes are known as maria ( seas ) and the smaller ones as lacūs ( lakes ) . it was possible that there were seas of liquid methane on titan and first suggested after reading voyager 1 and voyager 2 information that showed titan to have a thick atmosphere , capable of supporting lakes , but exact evidence was not found until 1995 when pictures from the hubble telescope and other telescopes had already shown some proof of liquid methane possibly in lakes or planet-wide oceans , similar to oceans on earth . the `` cassini '' mission proved there are liquid lakes on titan , but not at first . when the probe arrived in the saturnian system in 2004 , scientists hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be seen in reflected sunlight from the surface , but no reflections were found . scientists still believed that liquid ethane and methane would be found near titan 's poles , where they expected to find lots of liquid . at titan 's south pole , a large dark area named ontario lacus was the first lake identified , possibly created by rain as clouds are often seen in the area . a possible shoreline was also identified at the pole in radar images . as the huygens-cassini probe flew by on july 22 , 2006 , its radar took pictures of the northern part of the planet ( which was in its winter ) , a number of large , smooth areas were found on the surface near the northern pole . based on this data , scientists announced `` definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on saturn 's moon titan '' in january 2007. the `` cassini–huygens '' team decided that the smooth areas are the hydrocarbon lakes they had been searching for , the first lakes found off earth . some valleys appear to have rivers .
