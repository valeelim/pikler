Analog-to-digital converter     an analog-to-digital converter ( abbreviated adc , a/d or a to d ) is an electronic integrated circuit that converts a continuous quantity to a discrete time digital number . an adc may also provide an isolated measurement . the reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) . typically , an adc is an electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or current to a digital number . the size of the number grows with an increase in the input voltage or current . however , some non-electronic or only partially electronic devices , such as rotary encoders , can also be considered adcs . more websites . - counting type adc a simple tutorial showing how to build your first adc . - an introduction to delta sigma converters a very nice overview of delta-sigma converter theory . - digital dynamic analysis of a/d conversion systems through evaluation software based on fft/dft analysis rf expo east , 1987 - which adc architecture is right for your application ? article by walt kester
