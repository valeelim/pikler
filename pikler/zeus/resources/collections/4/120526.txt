Common Language Specification     a common language specification ( cls ) is a document that says how computer programs can be turned into msil code . when several languages use the same bytecode , different parts of a program can be written in different languages . microsoft uses a common language specification for their .net framework . to fully interact with other objects regardless of the language they were used in , objects must expose to callers only those features that are common to all the languages they must exchange information with . it was always a dream of microsoft to unite all different languages into one umbrella and cls is one step towards that . microsoft has defined cls which are nothing but guidelines for languages to follow so that it can communicate with other .net languages in a seamless manner . most of the members defined by types in the .net framework class library are able to work with cls . however , some types in the class library have one or more members that are not able to work with cls . these members allow support for language features that are not in the cls .
