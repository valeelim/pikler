Governor-General of Pakistan     the governor-general of pakistan was the resident representative of king george vi in pakistan from 1947 to 1952 and then queen elizabeth ii ( `` queen of pakistan '' ) from 1952 until 1956 when pakistan was proclaimed a republic . when pakistan became an independent , self-governing nation in 1947 , it , like post-independent india , provisionally continued to use the government of india act 1935 , as its written constitution until a post-independence constitution could be drafted ; by default this contemplated the continuation of the constitutional monarchy as a commonwealth realm dominion . the monarch appointed a governor-general , upon the advice of the prime minister of pakistan to serve as de facto head of state . muhammad ali jinnah , considered `` quaid-e-azam '' ( `` great leader '' ) , informed louis mountbatten , 1st earl mountbatten of burma : `` when i am governor-general the prime minister will do what i tell him to '' -- however jinnah 's rapidly declining health made the issue moot .
