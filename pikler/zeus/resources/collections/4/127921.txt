And did those feet in ancient time     `` and did those feet in ancient time '' is a short poem by william blake . it comes in the introduction to a long poem called `` milton : a poem '' ( 1804 ) . today it is best known as the hymn jerusalem , sung to music written by c. hubert h. parry in 1916 , more than a century after blake had written the poem . < poem > and did those feet in ancient time walk upon england 's mountains green ? and was the holy lamb of god on england 's pleasant pastures seen ? and did the countenance divine shine forth upon our clouded hills ? and was jerusalem builded here among these dark satanic mills ? bring me my bow of burning gold ! bring me my arrows of desire ! bring me my spear ! o clouds , unfold ! bring me my chariot of fire ! i will not cease from mental fight , nor shall my sword sleep in my hand , till we have built jerusalem in england 's green and pleasant land . < /poem > there is a legend that the young jesus went to england with his uncle , joseph of arimathea , to england and visited glastonbury . the poem connects this legend to an idea in the book of revelation ( 3:12 and 21:2 ) describing a second coming in which jesus builds a new jerusalem . some christians thought that a new jerusalem would be like heaven , somewhere of love and peace . the poem asks if jesus visited england and if heaven was created in england . blake lived in the time of the early industrial revolution when there was a lot of poverty and misery . many people think the “ dark satanic mills ” were the factories where many people worked in horrible conditions . this contrasts with the country with its beauty and clean air : “ england ’ s green and pleasant land ” . the second half of blake 's poem says people should try to establish `` jerusalem '' once more .
