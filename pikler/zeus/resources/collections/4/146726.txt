Thermodynamic entropy     thermodynamic entropy is a measure of how organized or disorganized energy is present in a system of atoms or molecules . it is measured in joules of energy per unit kelvin . entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics . imagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy . if the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized , then the molecules can do ten units of work . however , if the energy became less organized ( that is , the entropy increased ) , the molecules might only be able to do six units of work , even though they still have ten units of energy in them . when total entropy is reached , there is no more energy to spend . a good example of this is a cup of tea . now suppose your cup of tea is hot . the tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in . over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room . the tea will become colder . this is because the energy ( heat ) in the tea escapes into the surrounding area . once the tea has gone cold , there is no more heat that can be spread . the tea has thus reached total entropy .
