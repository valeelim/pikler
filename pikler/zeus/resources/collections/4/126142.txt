Market share     market share , in business and marketing , is the portion ( 'share ' ) of the targeted consumer base ( 'market ' ) that a company actually reaches , for a particular service or product . for example , it can be shown as the amount of money a company brings in ( revenue ) from its consumers , divided by the total amount of money paid from all consumers for that service or product . it can also be shown as the amount of products/services sold ( 'unit sales volume ' ) by a company divided by the total volume sold to all the consumers in that market . it is necessary to commission ( hire ) market research ( generally desk/secondary research , although sometimes primary research ) to estimate the total market size and a company 's market share . increasing market share is one of the most important objectives in business . the main advantage of using market share is that it removes the effects of industry-wide macroenvironmental variables such as the state of the economy , or changes in tax policy . for example , if you were one of only two psychiatrists in chicago , then it would not matter how bad the economy was because you would always have a huge slice of the consumer-base `` pie '' for your service . if your service was less needed , then advertising more would help increase your market share .
