BBC iPlayer     bbc iplayer , commonly shortened to iplayer , is an online service developed by the bbc which lets you catch up on the last week 's television and radio . the service can be used from computers on the bbc website at bbc.co.uk . it can also be used from games consoles , cable television , smart phones and tablets . bbc iplayer was first called the integrated media player ( imp ) , the interactive media player , and then mybbcplayer . bbc iplayer left beta and went live on 25 december 2007. on june 25 2008 , it was announced that a new-look iplayer would be launched . the new version is now live . in july 2007 the bbc started a small beta version of iplayer as a trial service . during this beta time , iplayer was only available as a download ( wmv format ) meaning that any person who did not have windows loaded on their computer could not use iplayer . this was not a popular move , and the bbc was put under pressure to allow all people to use iplayer . on christmas day 2007 , iplayer was no longer in beta . people could now also watch programmes on the website instead of having to download the video as people had to do before . this meant that people who did not have windows installed on their computers could use iplayer as well . this made iplayer a lot more popular and easier to use , so much so that 3.5 million programmes were viewed in a fortnight .
