Applied mathematics     applied mathematics is a field of mathematics which uses mathematics to solve problems of other branches of science . there are many fields : - approximation theory : sometimes it is not possible to get an exact solution to a problem , because this might take too long , or it may not be possible at all . approximation theory looks at ways to get a solution which is close to the exact one , and which can be obtained faster . - probability and statistics : how likely is it that something will happen ? - if a coin is flipped 100 times , and lands heads up 53 times , is this coin good for games of chance , or should another one be taken ? - optimization is about finding better solutions to problems . - in ecology certain things are known about populations of animals or plants . this is usually called population model . biologists use them to tell how a population changes over time .
