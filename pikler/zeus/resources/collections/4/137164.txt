Nucleolus     a nucleus ( plural : nuclei ) is the part of a eukaryote cell where ribosomes are made . viewed through a microscope , the nucleolus appears as a dark spot inside the cell 's nucleus . it is made up of dense rna and proteins . prokaryote cells have ribosomes , but they do n't make as many as eukaryotes do , and there is no visible nucleolus . there is usually more than one nucleolus in a eukaryote cell . the nucleolus may be one or more in number and is not bounded by any membrane . it is rich in protein and rna molecules and acts as the site for ribosome formation the nucleolus is made at a nucleolus organizer region ( nor ) , which is a chromosome region around which the nucleolus forms . inside the nucleolus ribosomes are made . ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins . the ribosomes are exported through the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm , where they do their work . nuclei also have other important functions like assembly of signal recognition particles and playing a role in the cell 's response to stress . malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human diseases .
