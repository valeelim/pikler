Real-time computing     real-time computing is a field of computer science . the idea is to design systems that have a `` real-time constraint '' . real time systems will guarantee to give a result within a specified time . there are two kinds of real-time systems : - `` hard real-time systems '' : after the delay has passed the result is totally useless ( and considered to be an error ) . no matter what happens , hard-real time systems deliver the result in the specified time . real world examples are the controller for the airbag in a car . the reaction time of an airbag system is around 1 ms. another example for a hard real-time system is the anti-lock braking system in a car . if it does not react fast enough , an accident will occur . people might die because the result was not there fast enough . - `` soft real-time systems '' : on average , these systems work `` fast enough '' to make it feel like real-time . a videoconferencing system has microseconds to record sound and video , to send them to the other party , and to process the incoming data . if at one time , this can not be done , the video will be blurred , and the sound may be out of sync for a few moments . this is however not a catastrophe , and the system can continue to work .
