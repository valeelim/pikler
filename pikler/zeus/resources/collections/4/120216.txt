Demosthenes     demosthenes ( 384–322 bc , greek : δημοσθένης , dēmosthénēs ) was a well-known greek statesman and orator from ancient athens . his speeches show the height of classical athenian skill at speaking . they also show us lots about the politics and culture of ancient greece during the 4th century bc . demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators . he delivered his first law court speeches when he was twenty . he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance . for a time , demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer and a lawyer , writing speeches for use in private legal suits . at the age of 21 , demosthenes took the job of the commander of warships in athens . demosthenes grew interested in politics during the time he wrote speeches for others . in 354 bc he gave his first public political speeches . he went on to devote his most productive years to opposing macedon 's expansion . he idealized his city and tried throughout his life to restore athens ' supremacy and motivate the rest of the athenians against philip ii of macedon . he sought to preserve his city 's freedom and to establish an alliance against macedon , in an unsuccessful attempt to impede philip 's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the greek states . after philip 's death , demosthenes played a leading part in his city 's uprising against the new king of macedon , alexander the great . however , his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh macedonian reaction . to prevent a similar revolt against his own rule , alexander 's successor , antipater , sent his men to track demosthenes down . demosthenes took his own life , in order to avoid being arrested by archias , antipater 's confidant .
