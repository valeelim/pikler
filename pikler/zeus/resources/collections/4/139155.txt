Thread switching latency     the thread switching latency is the time needed by the operating system to switch the cpu to run another thread . in some operating systems running on some hardware , switching between threads belonging to the same process is much faster than switching to a thread from different process ( because threads from different processes require a more complicated process context switch ) . during the thread switching , the cpu must save all of the current thread 's execution data to memory , and load another thread 's execution data from memory . since reading and writing from memory requires some latency , we can define the thread switching latency as the amount of time needed to complete this operation . there is no virtual memory switching required in a thread switch , unlike a process switch . other pages . - process switching latency - context switching
