L'incoronazione di Poppea     l'incoronazione di poppea ( ) is an opera in three acts by claudio monteverdi . the libretto is by giovanni francesco busenello . the first performance was in the teatro santi giovanni e paolo , venice in 1643. it was the last opera that monteverdi composed . most operas in the early 17th century were about mythological stories or stories from the christian religion . this story , however , is about something that happened in the history of ancient rome . it is about the evil emperor nero and how he married poppea . the gods still play a part in the opera , especially cupid . although the opera is called `` the coronation of poppea '' we do not actually see any coronation ceremony . monteverdi was an experienced composer when he wrote this and the opera has some of his best music . the orchestra is only a small group of instruments : strings , recorders , cornetts ( an old kind of trumpet ) , percussion , harp , lutes and gambas . the music does not divide sharply between recitative ( narrating music ) and aria ( set songs ) , but flows gently from one type to the other .
