Biblical manuscript     a biblical manuscript is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the bible . they vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the jewish scriptures to huge polyglot codices containing both the hebrew bible ( tanakh ) and the new testament , as well as other works . the aleppo codex ( `` c. '' 920 ad ) and leningrad codex ( `` c. '' 1008 ad ) were the oldest hebrew language manuscripts of the tanakh . the 1947 find at qumran of the dead sea scrolls pushed the manuscript history of the tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices . before this discovery , the earliest extant manuscripts of the old testament were in greek in manuscripts such as codex vaticanus and codex sinaiticus . out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at qumran , 220 are from the tanakh . every book of the tanakh is represented except for the book of esther ; however , most are fragmentary . notably , there are two scrolls of the book of isaiah , one complete ( 1qis ) , and one around 75 % complete ( 1qis ) . these manuscripts generally date between 150 bc to 70 ad .
