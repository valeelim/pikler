The Last Judgement (Michelangelo)    the last judgement ( michelangelo ) the last judgment is a mural by michelangelo on the altar wall of the sistine chapel in vatican city . it took nine years to complete . michelangelo began working on it thirty years after finishing the ceiling of the chapel . the work spans the entire wall behind the altar of the sistine chapel . it was painted between 1534 and 1541. the last judgment shows the second coming of christ and the apocalypse . the souls of humans rise and descend to their fates , as judged by christ surrounded by his saints . there was a dispute regarding `` the last judgment '' between cardinal carafa and michelangelo : michelangelo was accused of immorality and obscenity , because he had painted naked figures , with their genitals well visible . the cardinal said that this could not be tolerated inside the most important church of christianity . a censorship campaign was lauched , known as the `` fig-leaf campaign '' . carafa and monsignor sernini ( mantua 's ambassador ) launched the campaign to remove the frescoes . when the pope 's own master of ceremonies , biagio da cesena , said `` it was mostly disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures , exposing themselves so shamefully , '' and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather `` for the public baths and taverns , '' michelangelo worked the cesena 's semblance into the scene as minos , judge of the underworld ( far bottom-right corner of the painting ) . it is said that when cesena complained to the pope , the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell , so the portrait would have to remain .
