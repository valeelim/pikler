Station-to-Station protocol     the station-to-station ( sts ) protocol is a cryptographic ( information-hiding ) key agreement scheme based on the classic diffie-hellman key exchange that provides mutual key and entity ( party ) authentication . in addition to protecting the established key from an attacker , the sts protocol uses no timestamps and provides perfect forward secrecy . it also requires two-way explicit key confirmation , making it an `` authenticated key agreement with key confirmation '' ( acronym : akc ) protocol . sts was originally presented in 1987 in the context of isdn security , finalized in 1989 and generally presented by whitfield diffie , paul c. van oorschot and michael j. wiener in 1992 .
