Block size (cryptography)    block size ( cryptography ) in modern cryptography , symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers . block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits . the length of this bit string is the block size . both the input ( plaintext ) and output ( ciphertext ) are the same length ; the output can not be shorter than the input – this is logically required by the pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible – and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input . the des is using a block size of 64 bits ( 8 bytes ) while the aes is using a block size of 128 bits ( 16 bytes ) . rijndael , supports block sizes of 128 , 192 , and 256 bits , although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the aes standard . a few block ciphers , such as rc5 , support a variable block size . the luby-rackoff construction and the outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher . few ciphers have unusual block sizes , for example the 3-way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits ( 12 bytes ) .
