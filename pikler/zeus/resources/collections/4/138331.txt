Cryptographic hash function     a cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input ( or 'message ' ) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string . the string is called the 'hash value ' , 'message digest ' , 'digital fingerprint ' , 'digest ' or 'checksum ' ) . the ideal hash function has three main properties : 1. it is extremely easy to calculate a hash for any given data . 1. it is extremely computationally difficult to calculate an alphanumeric text that has a given hash . 1. it is extremely unlikely that two slightly different messages will have the same hash . functions with these properties are used as hash functions for a variety of purposes , not only in cryptography . practical applications include message integrity checks , digital signatures , authentication , and various information security applications . a hash function takes a string of any length as input and produces a fixed length string which acts as a kind of `` signature '' for the data provided . in this way , a person knowing the `` hash value '' is unable to know the original message , but only the person who knows the original message can prove the `` hash value '' is created from that message .
