British Rail Class 28     the british rail class 28 ( metropolitan-vickers type 2 ) diesel locomotives , or 'metrovicks ' as they were popularly known , were built as part of the british railways modernisation plan . the locomotives had a co-bo wheel arrangement ( a 6-wheel bogie at one end , a 4-wheel bogie at the other ) â€“ unique in british railways practice though not uncommon in other countries , notably japan . this affected their route availability , due to the different axle loading at each end of the loco , and made maintenance more complicated . the maximum tractive effort of 50,000 lbf was unusually high for a type 2 locomotive but , as there were five ( not four ) driving axles , the risk of wheelslip was minimal .
