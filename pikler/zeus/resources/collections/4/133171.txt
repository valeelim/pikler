Superimposition     in graphics , superimposition is when an image or video is put on top of an already-existing image or video . this is usually done to add to the overall image effect or to hide something ( such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a photograph ) . this technique is used in cartography to produce photomaps by superimposing grid lines , contour lines and other linear or textual mapping features over aerial photographs . superimposition of 2d images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce moiré patterns . superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moiré patterns . the movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image . such optical acceleration is known as moiré speedup ( check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns ) . when superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines , at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moiré patterns , namely line glass patterns ( after leon glass , 1969 ) appear . similarly , when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot glass patterns , namely random dot moiré , appears . when one of the layers embeds complex shapes , such as sequences of symbols forming a text , and another layer contains parallel lines or curves , the superimposition image may gives rise to magnified shapes , called shape moiré patterns .
