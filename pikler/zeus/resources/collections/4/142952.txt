Turriff     turriff is a town and parish in aberdeenshire , scotland . it is approximately 166 feet above sea level . it is known locally as turra in the doric dialect of scots . the name appears to be scottish gaelic in origin , from `` '' torr '' meaning a mound or round hill , or `` tur '' '' meaning a tower . the knights templar appear to have had a base in the area , and a nearby site is still known as `` temple brae '' . early in 1639 , the marquis of huntly assembled his forces here , and thereafter went to kintore in lower aberdeenshire , eventually marching from there to aberdeen itself . the marquis — being informed shortly after his arrival in aberdeen that a meeting of covenanters was to be held in turriff on the fourteenth of february — resolved to disperse them , by occupying the town with 2000 men . the incident was known as the `` first raid of turray '' . other websites . - the turriff and district tourism action group
