Drosophila melanogaster     drosophila melanogaster is a small , common fly found near rotting fruit . it has been in use for over a century to study genetics and lends itself well to behavioral studies . thomas hunt morgan studied `` drosophila '' early in the 1900s . he and his team were the first to discover sex-linkage and genetic recombination , which placed the small fly in the forefront of genetic research . due to its small size , ease of culture and short generation time , geneticists have been using `` drosophila '' ever since . it is one of the organisms whose entire genome is known , and many hundreds of genes have been identified and studied . fruit flies are easily obtained from the wild and most biological science companies carry a variety of different mutations . in addition these companies sell equipment to culture the flies . costs are relatively low and most equipment can be used year after year . the fly 's vision is its most important sense organ . approximately two thirds of the `` drosophila '' brain is dedicated to visual processing . although their ability to distinguish fine detail is worse than that of humans , their ability to time things ( such as flight ) is about ten times better .
