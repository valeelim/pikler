Mermaid     a mermaid is a mythological creature with a female human head and upper body and the tail of a fish . mermaids live mostly in the water , although sometimes they are known to come out of the water and sit on the large rocks above the sea . they say that they would make boats crash with their siren calls . the word is a compound of mere , the old english word for `` sea '' , and maid , a woman . the male equivalent is a merman . much like sirens , mermaids sometimes sing to people and gods and enchant them , distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or run their ships aground . other stories depict them squeezing the life out of drowning men while attempting to rescue them . they are also said to carry humans down to their underwater kingdoms . in hans christian andersen 's the little mermaid , it is said that they forget that humans can not breathe underwater , while others say they drown men out of spite . [ citation needed ] the sirens of greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as mermaid-like ; in fact , some languages use the same word for both bird and fish creatures , such as the maltese word 'sirena ' . other related types of mythical or legendary creatures are water fairies ( e.g. , various water nymphs ) and selkies , animals that can transform themselves from seals to humans .
