Languages of Singapore     there are many languages spoken in singapore . the reason is that singapore has a multi-ethnic society . the singapore government recognises four official languages : english , malay , mandarin , and tamil . the national language is malay , while english is mainly used as the business and working language . the colloquial patois spoken on the streets is a creole called singlish amongst the locals , but is also known amongst academics in linguistics as singapore colloquial english . english was introduced to singapore by the british in 1819 , when the british established a port , later a colony , on the island . english had been the administrative language of the colonial government , and when singapore gained self-government in 1959 and independence in 1965 , the local government decided to keep english as the working language . the use of english as a common language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in singapore . in schools , students are also required to take a mother tongue class , where they are either taught mandarin chinese , malay or tamil .
