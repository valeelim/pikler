Manichaeism     manichaeism ( in modern persian `` āyin e māni '' ) was one of the major iranian gnostic religions . originally it came from sassanid persia . most of the original writings of the founding prophet mani ( syriac , , c. ad 210–276 ) have been lost , but many translations and fragmentary texts have survived . manichaeism was big between the third and seventh centuries . at its height it was one of the most widespread religions in the world . manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as china and as far west as the roman empire . manichaeism appears to have died out before the sixteenth century in southern china . the original six sacred books of manichaeism were written in syriac aramaic . they were soon translated into other languages to help spread the religion . as they spread to the east , the manichaean writings passed through middle persian , parthian , sogdian , and ultimately uyghur and chinese translations . as they spread to the west , they were translated into greek , coptic , and latin . the spread and success of manichaeism were seen as a threat to other religions , and it was widely persecuted in christian , zoroastrian , and later , islamic areas .
