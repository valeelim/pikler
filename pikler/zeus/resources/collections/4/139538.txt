Mérindol     mérindol is a commune of 1,923 people ( 2006 ) . it is in the region provence-alpes-côte d'azur in the vaucluse department in the south of france . the town has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters . it does not rain very often and snow is rare . protected by the luberon , a mountain range , the town is sheltered from the mistral , a cold dry wind that blows from the north . the town was first built on a hill which was easy to defend . after the town was destroyed in 1545 , it was rebuilt on the plain , near the river . a ferry was in use to cross the durance river in the year 1240. mérindol was abandoned , probably because of plague , in the 15th century . in the late middle ages , louis ii of provence sold the land to the lords of abacus-cental and rocca sparviera . they moved in farming families from piedmont . the farmers were followers of pierre vaudes ( peter waldo ) . they were part of a group , known as the vaudois or waldensians , who had separated from the catholic church in 1170. they believed in a simple life based on a line in the gospel of matthew . this put them in opposition to the rich and powerful church . in 1530 , a dominican priest , jean de roma , began a campaign against the vaudois because he said they were heretics . his gangs attacked the town and burnt many houses and killed many of the people .
