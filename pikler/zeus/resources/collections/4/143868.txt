Sino-Tibetan languages     the sino-tibetan languages form a language family composed of , at least , the chinese and the tibeto-burman languages , including some 250 languages of east asia . they are second only to the indo-european languages in terms of their number of speakers . a few scholars , most prominently christopher beckwith and roy andrew miller , argue that chinese is not related to tibeto-burman . they point to an absence of regular sound correspondences , an absence of reconstructable shared morphology , and evidence that much shared lexical material has been borrowed from chinese into tibeto-burman . in opposition to this view , scholars in favor of the sino-tibetan hypothesis such as w. south coblin , graham thurgood , james matisoff , and gong hwang-cherng have argued that there are regular correspondences in sounds as well as in grammar . references . - matisoff , james ( 2000 ) . `` on 'sino-bodic ' and other symptoms of neosubgroupitis '' . `` bulletin of the school of oriental and african studies '' 63 ( 3 ) :356-369 .
