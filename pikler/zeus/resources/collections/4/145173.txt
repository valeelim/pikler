Languages of Pakistan     english is the official language of pakistan . urdu is the national language despite not being a native language or being the mother tongue of any native group in the country . there are also provincial languages , balochi language , pashto , saraiki , sindhi and punjabi , and one state language ( kashmiri language ) . pakistan is heir to one of the most ancient civilzations in the world along with iraq and egypt , and it is only to be expected that its languages , too , have ancient roots . these primary languages have not been used in the domains of power because the rulers of these regions were generally foreigners . but the foreigners , whether the persians , greeks , arabs , turco-mongols as well as the british , have all enriched the indigenous languages so that their vocabulary is multilingual and varied . as the people of these areas converted to islam , arabic and persian words influenced and became part of their identity , and remain so . in a sense , it is their very presence , as well as the arabic-based scripts of all 75 pakistani languages , which gave them a cultural unity . linguistically , pakistan faces two directions : india , because the roots of its languages are dravidian as well as indo-aryan ; and the middle east , because its scripture and vocabulary owe very much so to arabic and based on farsi , for e.g . the national anthem is a highly persianized form of urdu .
