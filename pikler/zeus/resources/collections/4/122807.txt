Micropædia     the 12-book micropædia is one of the three parts of the 15th edition of `` encyclopædia britannica '' , and the other two being the one-book `` propædia '' and the 17-book `` macropædia '' . the name comes from the word `` micro '' and `` encyclopaedia '' . micro means small and so , the micropaedia is a small encyclopedia . the micropaedia has articles that are very short , the articles are found in small strips . it is the opposite of the macropaedia , which has articles that are very long . the `` micropædia '' was introduced in 1974 with 10 books having 102,214 short articles , all of them are less than 750 words . in the 15th edition , many articles were put together , with about only 65,000 articles in 12 volumes . in general , the 750-word limit is still used and most articles are only 1-2 paragraphs ; however , a few longer articles can be found in the 2007 `` micropædia '' , such as the internet ones , which takes up a full page . with some exceptions , the 65,000 articles of the `` micropædia '' have no bibliographies and no named contributors . it is supposed to be for fast-checking to know only the main things about the topic , and as a guide to the 700 longer articles of the `` macropædia '' . people use it to know just a little , but the macropaedia is used to know in detail .
