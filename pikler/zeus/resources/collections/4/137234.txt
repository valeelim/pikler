Hadron     a hadron , in particle physics , is any subatomic ( smaller than the atom ) particle or antiparticle which is made of quarks . quarks are fundamental particles which among other properties have an electrical charge and a name ( e.g . 'up ' , 'down ' , 'strange ' ) . the electrical charge of a single quark is always a fraction ( e.g . 2/3 ) . quarks combine to make a hadron of integer charge , for example , the charges of two 'down ' quarks and one 'up ' quark combine like this -1/3 -1/3 +2/3 = 0 to make a `` neutrally '' charged `` neutron '' . quarks do not appear alone , they exist in groups and are held together by the strong nuclear force . the word to describe the different types of quarks is `` flavours . '' according to the current standard model there are 6 flavours of quarks . there are two known ways quarks can combine , to give the two categories of hadrons : - baryons , which are made of three quarks . - mesons , which are made of one quark and one anti-quark . hadrons are also characterized by being affected by the strong nuclear force , which holds them tightly together over a short distance . at the center of an atom is a nucleus ( a cluster of protons and neutrons ) .
