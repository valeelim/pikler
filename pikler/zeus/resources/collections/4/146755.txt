Flageolet     a flageolet is an old woodwind instrument . it belongs to the end-blown flute family . it started to be used in the 16th century for folk music . soon there were two kinds : the french kind and the english . the french flageolet had four holes in the front and two in the back . the english flageolet had six holes in the front . the flageolet is quite similar to the recorder . in the 18th century it changed because a narrow mouthpiece made of ivory or bone was added at the top . this led into another section which bulged out . there was a soft sponge at the end of this . sometimes this instrument was called the `` flautino '' . the piccolo developed from it . another instrument that developed from it was the tin whistle . henry purcell and george frideric handel both wrote pieces for it . small versions of this instrument , called bird flageolets were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing . the illustrated encyclopedia of musical instruments ; isbn 3-8331-2195-5 other websites . - flageolets.com â€“ information about the flageolet ]
