Stigmata     stigmata are marks on a person 's body , that are like the wounds jesus got from being crucified . they supposedly happen to other religious people like saint francis of assisi , as well as jesus . the marks include nail holes in the hands and feet , as if the person had been crucified , but without that having happened . those who believe say that actual nails were not used . the holes just appear as a miracle . those who do not believe say it is not a miracle . they have other ways to explain those stories .
