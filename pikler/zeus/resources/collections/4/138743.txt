Discriminant     in algebra , the discriminant of a polynomial that is equal to zero with real or complex coefficients is a certain expression in these coefficients of the polynomial if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root ( for example , a root with multiplicity greater than one ) in the complex numbers . for example , the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial if the discriminant is larger than zero , then there are two distinct real numbers . if the discriminant is equal to zero , then there are two repeating real numbers , i.e . exactly one real number . if the discriminant is smaller than zero , then there are two distinct complex numbers .
