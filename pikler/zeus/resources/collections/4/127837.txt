Medes     the medes were an ancient iranian people who lived in the northwestern portions of present-day iran . this area was known in greek as media or medea they entered this region with the first wave of iranian tribes , in the late second millennium bc ( at the end of the bronze age ) . by the 6th century bc , the medes were able to make their own empire . it stretched from southern shore of the black sea and aran province ( in modern azerbaijan ) to north and central asia , afghanistan , and pakistan . the medes had many tributary states , including the persians , who eventually took over the median empire as part of the achaemenid persian empire . the medes are credited with the foundation of the first iranian empire , the largest of its day until cyrus the great established a unified iranian empire of the medes and persians , often referred to as the achaemenid empire . modern scholars question whether a median empire even existed . it is argued that even if it existed , it must have been just a `` political alliance '' among highland neighbors of the assyrians . the alliance might include armenia in southeastern anatolia , sagartians in modern northern iraq , and the actual medians in the area between what is today hamadan-kirmanshah in cental zagros . neither cuneiform sources , archaeological evidence , or biblical accounts , support herodotus , who claimed there really was a median empire .
