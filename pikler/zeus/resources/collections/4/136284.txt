Router     a router is a computer whose software and hardware are customized to move data between computer networks . they are responsible for making sure traffic between computers gets where it needs to go . they do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called routing protocols . routers generally contain a specialized operating system , ram , nvram , flash memory , and one or more processors , as well as two or more network interfaces . they come in a variety of sizes from something you could hold in your hand to something too large for one person to lift . if you have an internet connection you probably have a router somewhere that your computer sends data to . this is the first router your computer will connect to in order to get to the internet . it is also known as a default gateway ( because it is your gateway to the internet ) . by convention the gateway has the lowest ip address ( like a phone number for a computer ) in the subnet ( a group of addresses ) . anytime you make a connection ( such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org ) your computer looks up the ip address using the look-up service called dns ( domain name service ) . once the destination address has been found your computer connects to your gateway router . the gateway then sends data to a router at your isp ( internet service provider ) , that router can be said to be part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination .
