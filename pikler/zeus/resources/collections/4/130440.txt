Masoretic Text     the masoretic text is a copy of the hebrew bible that was written by the masoretes between the 6th and 10th centuries . the masoretic text is an authority because it is the source for most translations of the hebrew bible or the old testament . before the first century ce , there were some small differences between copies of the hebrew bible . during first century ce , jewish bible specialists agreed on the same words , a process called standardisation . between about 100 and 300 ce , a group of jewish bible specialists called the tannaim copied this hebrew bible . then between about 300 and 500 ce , another group of jewish bible specialists called the amoraim continued the work of the tannaim . the masoretes then continued the amoraim 's work for the next 500 years . the masoretes were very careful when they copied the bible . when they thought there was a mistake in the work of the amoraim or the other specialists , they wrote a note in the side of the book , rather than change the book . after they copied a book , they counted the verses , words and letters in each book to make sure there were no mistakes .
