Smilodon     smilodon was a genus of saber-toothed cat . there were three species . `` smilodon gracilis '' ( or `` s. fragilis '' ) was the ancestral , smaller , species ( 2.5 to 0.5 million years ago ) . `` smilodon populator '' ( 1 mya to 10 kya ) was a large , heavy species from eastern south america . it was 1.2 m high at the shoulder , 2.1 m ( 83 in ) long on average . with an estimated weight of 220 to 400 kg , it was among the heaviest known felids . its upper canines reached 28 cm ( 11 in ) and protruded up to 17 cm ( 6.7 in ) out of the upper jaw . `` smilodon fatalis '' ( or `` s. californicus '' ; 1.6 mya to 10,000 years ago ) was the famous cat known from the rancho la brea tar pits in los angeles . the tar , a bit like asphalt , has yielded about a million bones of late pleistocene mammals , of which 162,000 bones are from `` smilodon '' , representing perhaps 1200 individuals . the cat was about the size of a female lion , but weighed more , perhaps 200 kg . it was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders . `` smilodon '' is most famous for its relatively long canines , which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats , at about long in the largest species `` smilodon populator '' . those of `` s. fatalis '' reached their full size in 18 months at a growth rate of 7 mm/month . these canine teeth were slender and had fine serrations . they were fragile and could not have bitten into bone . therefore , the cats did not use their long teeth to take down prey . only when their prey was subdued did they use their teeth .
