Dissipation     in physics , dissipation includes the concept of a dynamical system where `` important mechanical modes '' , such as waves or oscillations , lose energy over time , typically due to the action of friction or turbulence . the lost energy is converted into heat , raising the temperature of the system . such systems are called dissipative systems . for example , a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate . the dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave : an atmospheric wave , for instance , may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass , and at higher levels due to radiative cooling . in computational physics , a numerical dissipation is also known as `` artificial dissipation '' or `` artificial diffusion '' or `` numerical diffusion '' . they all mean this : when the pure advection equation -- which , by definition , `` is free of dissipation '' -- is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous ( similar ) to a diffusional process , the method is said to contain 'dissipation ' .
