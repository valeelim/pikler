Stop error screen     a stop error screen is a screen that a device shows when it has an error it can not fix and has to stop . these screens are usually called screens of death because the device can not recover from the error and the operating system or firmware has to close . the screens are usually color-coded such as a windows computer showing a blue screen of death ( bsod ) or an xbox showing a green screen of death when they have errors . if its settings tell it to , the computer will do a `` core dump '' and save data to a disk file , or `` dump file '' , for later , to help an expert fix the problem . these screens are usually caused by problems in device drivers . they can also be caused by hardware errors , such as bad ram or power supplies , overheating of the inside of the system , or hardware which is run at higher rates than the limits . this is called overclocking . these errors were in all the windows operating systems since windows 3.1. the first bsods were seen when starting windows 1.0 and windows 2.0 , and had random data , mess , shown with a blue screen , hence the name .
