Triple DES     in cryptography , triple des is a block cipher created from the data encryption standard ( des ) cipher by using it three times . triple des is also known as tdes or , more standard , tdea ( triple data encryption algorithm ) . when it was discovered that a 56-bit key of des is not enough to protect from brute force attacks , tdes was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm . the use of three steps is essential to prevent meet-in-the-middle attacks that are effective against double des encryption . in general tdes with three different keys ( 3-key { k , k , k } tdes ) has a key length of 168 bits : three 56-bit des keys ( with parity bits 3-key tdes has the total storage length of 192 bits ) , but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits . another version , called two-key tdes ( 2-key tdes ) , uses k = k , thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits . however , this mode can be taken advantage of through certain chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks and so tdes is treated by nist to have only 80 bits of security .
