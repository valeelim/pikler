Cell     in biology , the cell is the basic structure of organisms . all cells are made by the division of other cells . the environment outside the cell is separated from the inside of the cell by the cell membrane . inside some cells , parts of the cell stay separate from other parts . these separate parts are called organelles ( like small organs ) . they each do different things in the cell . examples are the nucleus ( where dna is ) , and mitochondria ( where usable energy is created ) . there are two basic kinds of cells : prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells . prokaryotes , bacteria and archaea , are simple cells that have no cell nucleus . they do have bacterial microcompartments . eukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell . they are larger than prokaryote cells : they can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume . eukaryotes store their genetic information ( dna ) on chromosomes in the cell nucleus . organisms ( living things ) which are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes .
