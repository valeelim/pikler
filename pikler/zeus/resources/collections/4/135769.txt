Peregrine falcon     the peregrine falcon ( falco peregrinus ) is a cosmopolitan bird of prey in the family falconidae . it can also be known just as the peregrine , and was once called the `` duck hawk '' in north america . in pakistan it is officially the military iconic symbol of the paf and the unofficial territory bird of gilgit-baltistan . the peregrin is a crow-sized falcon , with a blue-grey back , barred white underparts , and a black head and `` moustache '' . it can go at up to 322 km/h ( 200 mph ) in a dive , which means it is the fastest animal in the world . as with other bird-eating raptors , the female is bigger than the male . there are 17â€“19 subspecies recorded , and each varies slightly in appearance and where they live . there is disagreement over whether the distinctive barbary falcon is a subspecies of the peregrine or just a different species . the use of certain pesticides , especially ddt was not good for the animals . it could be shown that in areas where ddt was used , the thickness of the shells of their eggs was reduced . this caused a dramatic decline in their numbers , in certain countries . since the use of ddt has been forbidden in many countries , their numbers are increasing again . this recovery was helped because their nesting places were protected in many countries ; some countries also bred these falcons in captivity and released them into the wild .
