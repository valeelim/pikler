Instruction (computer science)    instruction ( computer science ) in computer science , an instruction is a single operation of a processor defined by the processor instruction set . the size or length of an instruction varies widely , from as little as 4-bits in some microcontrollers to many as multiples of a bytes in some very long instruction word ( vliw ) systems . most modern processors used in personal computers , mainframes , and supercomputers have instruction sizes between 16 and 64 bits . in some architectures , especially reduced instruction set computers , instructions are of fixed length , typically corresponding with that architecture 's word size . on traditional architectures , an instruction includes an opcode specifying the operation to be performed , such as `` add contents of memory to register '' , and zero or more operand specifiers , which may specify registers , memory locations , or literal data . the operand specifiers may have addressing modes determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields . in vliw architectures , which include many microcode architectures , multiple simultaneous operations and operands are specified in a single instruction .
