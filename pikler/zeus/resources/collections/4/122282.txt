Neodymium     neodymium is a chemical element that has the symbol nd on the periodic table . it has the atomic number 60 which means it has 60 protons in an atom . neodymium can be combined with other elements like iron and boron to create the very strong neodymium magnet , these magnets can lift up to 1000 times their own weight . neodymium is a metal that forms a coating of oxide around itself when it is placed in air . it is usually used as neodymium magnets for hard disk drives . though neodymium is called a rare earth metal , it is quite common , as common as nickel , cobalt or copper . like every metal , neodymium is very shiny . it is a solid that melts at 1,024 degrees celsius , or 1,875 degrees fahrenheit . neodymium is in a group of other elements called lanthanides , which are like each other in how they behave . when neodymium is dropped into water , it slowly changes into neodymium hydroxide , if the water or the neodymium itself is hot enough , the change is much faster , and the neodymium may explode . in the air , if the neodymium is hot enough , it can catch fire . like every other metal , neodymium usually wants to get rid of its electrons , so the compounds it forms are usually with elements that want electrons , as oxygen does .
