Hesperocallis     hesperocallis is a genus of flowering plants that includes a single species , hesperocallis undulata , the desert lily , found in the desert areas of the southwest of north america . `` hesperocallis '' has traditionally been classified in liliaceae but until recently its relationships have been unclear . other classifications have included it in hemerocallidaceae or funkiaceae . in 1972 , hamilton traub created the family hesperocallidaceae with `` hesperocallis '' as the sole included genus . the apg ii system includes it in the family asparagaceae in the order asparagales in the monocots clade but allows for the optional segregation of hesperocallidaceae as a monophyletic family when several other families are likewise segregated . recent molecular systematic studies have confirmed a close relationship with `` agave '' and its inclusion in family agavaceae has been recommended ( pires et al . 2004 ) .
