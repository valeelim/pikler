Oryx     the oryx ( also called the sabre antelope ) is a fast-running hoofed mammal that lives in dry regions of africa and asia ( including the arabian peninsula ) . they inhabit steppes ( sparse grasslands ) , semi-deserts , and deserts . these antelopes congregate in herds of 8 to 60 oryx . newborn calves can run with the herd within minutes of their birth . oryxes have a life span of about 20 years . some people think that the unicorn of legend was based upon the oryx . many types of oryxes ( including the arabian oryx and the scimitar-horned oryx ) are endangered species , mostly because of overhunting and disease . the oryx is an herbivore ( a plant-eater ) . it eats grasses , shrubs and roots , spending most of its time grazing . oryx are ruminants ; they swallow their food without chewing it . after a while , they regurgitate a partly-digested `` cud '' which they chew and then swallow for the last time . this desert animal can go for weeks without water ; it gets much of its water from the plants it eats .
