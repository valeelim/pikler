Betelgeuse     betelgeuse , or betelgeux is a large red supergiant star in the constellation orion . it is the ninth-brightest star in the night sky , and second-brightest in orion . betelgeuse is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.2 and 1.2. this is the widest range of any first-magnitude star . it is also one of the largest and most luminous observable stars . its distance from earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light-years , with a mean absolute magnitude of about âˆ’6.02 . less than 10 million years old , betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass . it is moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km/s , creating a shock wave over 4 light-years wide . betelgeuse is in a late stage of stellar evolution . it will rapidly go through its life cycle before exploding as a type ii supernova sometime in the next million years . an observation by the herschel space observatory in january 2013 showed that the star 's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium .
