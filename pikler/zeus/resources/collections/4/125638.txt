Variable star     a variable star is a star that is sometimes brighter or dimmer . most stars have only very small differences in brightness , like the sun . but some stars can vary hugely . there are generally two types of variable stars : - a star being eclipsed , where the changes in brightness are from perspective , are called extrinsic variables . for example , in a solar eclipse the moon gets between the sun and earth . binary star systems sometimes show eclipses , as do planetary systems with giant planets . - stars whose brightness actually changes are called intrinsic variables . the stars get bigger and smaller over time . some pulsate at a constant rate , some do not . all of them change the rate at which energy is put out , which changes their appearance to us . there are a number of different types of variable stars . - intrinsic variable stars : variation caused by changes in the physical properties of the stars themselves . three subgroups : - pulsating variables : stars whose radius expands and contracts as part of their natural evolutionary ageing processes .
