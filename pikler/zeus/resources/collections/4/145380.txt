Modular arithmetic     modular arithmetic , sometimes also called clock arithmetic , is a way of doing arithmetic with integers . much like hours on a clock , which repeat every twelve hours , once the numbers reach a certain value , called the `` modulus '' , they go back to zero . people talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures . for instance , the chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old . the modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by carl friedrich gauss . modular arithmetic can be used to show the idea of congruence . two integers , `` a '' and `` b '' , are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when both are divided by the positive integer `` n '' . congruence can be written this way : the number `` n '' is called the modulus . another definition of congruence , that means the same thing but is sometimes more useful , is that the two integers are congruent modulo n if the difference ( `` a '' - `` b '' ) is an integer multiple of `` n '' . that is , if `` n '' is a factor of ( `` a '' - `` b '' ) , then `` a '' and `` b '' are congruent mod `` n '' .
