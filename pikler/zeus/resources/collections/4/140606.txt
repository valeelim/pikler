Multiplexer     in electronics , a multiplexer or mux ( `` occasionally the term mul-dex is also found , for a combination multiplexer-demultiplexer '' ) is a device that selects one of many analog or digital input signals and outputs it into a single output line . this process is termed : multiplexing . an electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource , for example one a/d converter or one communication line , instead of having one device per input signal . an analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output . a digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches , with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel . the selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command ( number ) it receives . in electronics , a demultiplexer ( or demux ) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines , which is connected to the single input . a multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end .
