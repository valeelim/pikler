Triode     a triode is a type of vacuum tube . it differs from a vacuum tube diode , which has only two electrodes , by having a third electrode , called the grid between the cathode and anode . when the cathode is heated , it gives out electrons . these electrons are then absorbed by the anode . this process makes an electric current , which is controlled by the grid . the addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier . lee de forest invented this device in 1908 from his original two-electrode audion of 1906. the triode incorporates the key principle of amplification . the name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes ( for example , diodes , tetrodes , pentodes , etc . ) not only can the triode perform amplification , it can also work as part of an oscillator ( making waves ) and detecting waves . it is used in radios , however , since the 1960s , the transistor has mostly replaced it . it is an ancestor of the transistor . it is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers .
