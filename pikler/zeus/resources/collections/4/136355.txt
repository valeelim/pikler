Advanced Encryption Standard     in cryptography , the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) , which is also known as rijndael , is a block cipher algorithm used as an encryption standard by the u.s. government . it has been looked at a lot and is now used all over the world , as was the case with its predecessor , the data encryption standard ( des ) . aes was announced by national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) as u.s. fips pub 197 ( fips 197 ) on november 26 , 2001 after a 5-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before rijndael was selected as the most suitable . it became effective as a standard may 26 , 2002. as of 2008 , aes is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography . it is available by choice in many different encryption packages . this marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher algorithm approved by nsa for top secret information . this cipher algorithm was developed by two belgian cryptographers , joan daemen and vincent rijmen , and submitted to the aes selection process under the name `` rijndael '' , a portmanteau of the names of the inventors . ( rijndael is ) .
