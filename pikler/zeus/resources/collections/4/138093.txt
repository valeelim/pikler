Carnivorous plant     carnivorous plants are plants which get nutrients from trapping and eating animals . they are often called insectivorous plants , because they usually trap insects . since they get some of their food from animals , carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin , or poor in nutrients . this is true for soils with little nitrogen , such as acidic bogs and rock outcrops . charles darwin wrote the first well-known book on carnivorous plants in 1875. this ability of plants to catch animals is true carnivory . there are more than twelve genera in five families . these include about 625 species that attract and trap prey , produce digestive enzymes , and use their nutrients . in addition , there are more than 300 species in several genera that show some but not all of these characteristics . these are usually called `` protocarnivorous plants '' . insectivorous plants have leaves that are made like pitchers or bladders which catch insects . today , five different ways of trapping are known
