Brute force attack     in cryptanalysis , a brute force attack is a method of breaking a cryptographic system by trying a lot of possibilities using fast computers ; for example , a large number of the possible keys in a key space to decrypt an encrypted message . the theoretical possibility of a brute force attack is recognized by the cryptographic system designers , they work to make the cryptographic system very improbable for computers to break using brute force attack . for that reason , one of the definitions of `` breaking '' a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack . the selection of an appropriate key length depends on how much it will be difficult to break it using a brute force attack . by obfuscating the data before encryption , brute force attacks are less effective and more difficult to determine . the brute force attack can be used with a dictionary attack .
