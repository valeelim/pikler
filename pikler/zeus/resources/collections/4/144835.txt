Piet Mondrian     piet mondrian ( 7 march 1872 – 1 february 1944 ) was a dutch modern artist of the de stijl group . his early paintings show abstract landscapes in post-impressionist and cubist style . he painted in an increasingly abstract style , until he finally achieved the style which made him famous . by 1920 , he adopts a totally abstract motif , with an irregular checkerboard drawn with black lines , and with the spaces paints mostly white or sometimes in the primary colors of blue , red and yellow . this style is geometric abstraction with primary color . mondrian painted about 250 of these geometric abstracts , from 1917 to 1944. mondrian called his style “ neoplasticism ” . escaping in 1940 from a europe at war , mondrian spent the last four years of his life in new york city . his paintings of that time express exuberance at city life . in his final painting , `` broadway boogie woogie '' ( 1942/43 ) , the checkerboard lines , previously black , are now painted blue , gray , red and yellow . the yellow was apparently inspired by new york ’ s yellow cabs .
