United States metropolitan area     metropolitan statistical areas ( msa ) are large metropolitan areas of the united states as defined by the office of management and budget . these areas are urban areas with a lot of people . an earlier version of the msa was the `` standard metropolitan statistical area '' ( smsa ) . msas are used for official purposes . msas are made up of counties and for some county equivalents . in new england , because of the greater importance of towns over counties , similar areas are based on town units . these are called new england city and town areas ( nectas ) . msas are created around a central urban area â€”an areawhere there are a lot of people . the counties with the urbanized area are known as the central counties of the msa . other nearby counties ( known as outlying counties ) can be a part of the msa if these counties have strong social and economic connections to the central counties . aome areas within these outlying counties may actually be rural areas . the population estimates for some metro areas are not always agreed upon . in some cases , different sources give numbers of people which differ by millions . the definitions used for the last u.s. census differed from those for previous censuses . this makes it hard to compare official information from different dates . msa boundaries do not stretch into canada or mexico . this can affect the number of people in several cities . for example , detroit , buffalo , el paso and san diego are often much larger than their msa figures .
