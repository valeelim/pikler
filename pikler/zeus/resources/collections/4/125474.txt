Anaconda     the anaconda or green anaconda ( `` eunectes murinus '' ) is the one of biggest snakes in the world . it is a non-venomous boa species from south america . it is the largest , heaviest , and second longest known living snake ( behind the reticulated python ) . the term `` anaconda '' usually means this species . this giant snake ( which is called the water boa ) lives in swampy areas of tropical south america . it spends a lot of time in shallow water , hidden from unsuspecting prey . anacondas give birth to live young ; 20 to 40 baby snakes are born at one time . the largest specimens measured 17.1 feet long and weighed 215 pounds . all snakes are carnivores ( meat-eaters ) . anacondas mostly hunt at night . anacondas kill by constricting ( squeezing ) the prey until it can no longer breathe . sometimes they drown the prey . like all snakes , they swallow the prey whole , head first . the anaconda 's top and bottom jaws are attached to each other with stretchy ligaments , which let the snake swallow animals wider than itself . snakes do not chew their food , they digest it with quite strong acids in the snake 's stomach . anacondas eat pigs , deer , caiman ( a type of crocodilian ) , birds , fish , rodents ( like the capybara and agouti ) , and other animals . after eating a large animal , the anaconda needs no food for a long time , and rests for weeks . the young ( called neonates ) can care for themselves soon after birth , including hunting ( but are pretty much defenseless against large predators ) . they eat small rodents ( like rats and mice ) , baby birds , frogs and small fish .
