Driveshaft     a driveshaft , drive shaft , driving shaft , propeller shaft , or cardan shaft is a part of a machine that takes power from the engine or motor to a place where useful work can be done . most engines or motors create power as torque by making something rotate . this can be from an internal combustion engine ( as in a car ) , water driving a water wheel , or gas or water going through a turbine . this rotating power is called torque . the load that is turned creates torsion and shear stress . drive shafts need to be strong enough to take this stress . a light drive shaft will more efficiently move the power to the load , so there needs to be a balance between strength and weight . most automobiles today use drive shafts to deliver power from the engine to the wheels . most cars made today are front wheel drive ( the front wheels have the power to move the car ) . in this case , the drive shafts are between the transaxle and each front wheels . in rear wheel drive cars , there are drive shafts between the differential and each rear wheel . there is also a drive shaft running the length of the car , from the transmission up front to the differential in the back - in british english this is not called a drive shaft , but a propeller shaft , or prop-shaft , and the drive shafts may be called half shafts ( since there are two that make one axle ) .
