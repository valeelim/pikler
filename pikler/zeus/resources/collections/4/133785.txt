Nuremberg Laws     the nuremberg laws is the name for three ( historically : two laws ) that were set into practice in germany in 1935 , and that were valid until 1945. they are named after the city of nuremberg where the legislative assembly met . they were : - `` gesetz zum schutze des deutschen blutes und der deutschen ehre '' ( often called `` blutschutzgesetz '' , law concerning the protection of german blood and honour ) . this law made it illegal for jews to marry non-jews . it also made it illegal for these people to have sex with each other . the law provided for long prison terms for the people who did not obey it . strangely enough , these were only for men , women could go away without prison term ( if they told about it ) . - `` reichsb√ºrgergesetz '' this law basically said that only people of german or closely-related blood could become citizens - in other words : jews ( and some others ) could not . all jews employed by the government had to quit their job . they also lost their right to vote . - `` reichsflaggengesetz '' strictly speaking this is not one of the nurenberg laws . it was published with the others though . it made the swastika the official flag of germany .
