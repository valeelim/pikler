Functional illiteracy     functional illiteracy means that a person is not able to read , write , and do math well in regular life . someone who is fully illiterate can not read , write , or do math at all . such people have perhaps never learnt how to read or write ; perhaps they did not need to . a person who is functionally illiterate is different - at some point in their lives , these people were taught reading and writing skills . for different reasons , adults who are functionally illiterate try to avoid writing and reading as much as possible . that way , a person who is functionally illiterate may be able to write their name , but it is very difficult for them to write more than a few sentences . these people have trouble functioning in modern society : when they are confronted with printed materials they can not perform simple tasks such as filling out a form , understanding a contract , following written instructions , reading a newspaper article , traffic signs , consulting a dictionary , or understanding a bus schedule .
