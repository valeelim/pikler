Locality of reference     locality of reference is a phenomenon that can be seen in computer science . it says that the same value , or the place where it is stored is accessed often . there are two different kinds of locality of reference : - `` temporal locality '' : if a value is referenced , there is a high probability it will be referenced again a short time from now - `` spatial locality '' : a value is stored in a certain location in storage ( memory , disk.. ) . if this location is referenced , it is very probable that locations that are physically close to it will be referenced as well . there are many reasons why locality of reference occurs : - `` predictability '' : well-written programs only behave in a predictable way . - `` structure of the program '' : often programs act on several items , one at a time . this item will be accessed more than once as computation or processing is done . - `` linear data structures '' : programs may have loops that act on arrays or lists . they reference an item by its index in the array or list .
