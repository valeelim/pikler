British Rail Class 168     the class 168 `` clubman '' is a diesel multiple-unit ( dmu ) train used by chiltern railways for intercity services between london and the midlands . they were built in several batches from 1997 onwards . the first batch of units was classified 168/0 under tops and bore a large resemblance , both visually and in terms of electrical design , to the class 165 units previously built by brel at york . this is because they were based on plans originally drawn up by network southeast and thus can be considered to be networker turbos . subsequent builds , classified 168/1 and 168/2 , were given the newer style cab and a new design of wiring and thus are part of the turbostar family of trains .
