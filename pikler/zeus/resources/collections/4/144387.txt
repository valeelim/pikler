Id, ego, and super-ego    id , ego , and super-ego the id , ego , and super-ego are ideas created by sigmund freud . they are three concepts used to explain the way the human mind works . freud describes the human mind as interaction of id , ego , super-ego . the ego , and to some extent the super-ego , is conscious or on the surface . the id remains unconscious . together they make up the personality . according to this model of the psyche , the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends ; the ego is the organized , realistic part ; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralising role . the id , ego and super-ego are functions of the mind , `` not '' parts of the brain . they do not correspond one-to-one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience . the id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present . the id is governed by the 'pleasure principle ' . early in the development of his theory freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id . after the tragedy of world war i , however , freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id . so , he proposed thanatos , the death instinct . thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind . obviously , the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts . by adding thanatos , he could describe more mental phenomena . his idea of id had wide influence .
