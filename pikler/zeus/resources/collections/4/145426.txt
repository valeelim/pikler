Megabat     megabats are also called old world fruit bats . they are the suborder megachiroptera , family pteropodidae of the order chiroptera ( bats ) . these fruit bats are flying mammals that live in dense forests in africa , europe , australia , and asia . there are about 166 species of fruit bats . fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes . these bats live in huge colonies , known as `` camps . '' these nocturnal ( most active at night ) animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet . as fruit bats fly from plant to plant getting food , they also pollinate the plants they visit . in addition , they disperse the plants ' seeds as they eat . many plants , including some avocados , dates , mangos , and peaches , are dependent on these bats for either pollination or seed dispersal . fruit bats mostly eat fruit juice and flower nectar . they chew the fruit , then spit out the seeds , peel , and pulp . fruit bats , like other megachiropteran bats , use the sense of smell to find their food , fruit and/or nectar . although they have large eyes and can see well , fruit bats do not use sight as their primary sense . fruit bats eat other things too .
