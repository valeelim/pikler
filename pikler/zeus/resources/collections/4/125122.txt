Pakistani English     pakistani english , is the type of the english language as it is spoken in pakistan . it is recognised as one of the official languages of the country . although british rule in south asia lasted for almost two hundred years , the areas that are now pakistan were some of the last places to be taken over by the british . punjab ( which included the khyber pakhtunkhwa province ) was captured in 1849 , sindh a few years before ; while balochistan was never fully taken over by the british . this meant that english had less time to become part of local culture . however , in 1947 , when pakistan became independent , english ( along with urdu ) became pakistan 's official language - this was written into law in 1973. pakistani english has many similarities with indian english , but since independence there have been some very obvious differences . these include words and phrases not used in india , as well as accents . foreign companies find accent naturalisation easier in pakistan than in india . however , like indian english , pakistani english has preserved many phrases that are now considered old in britain .
