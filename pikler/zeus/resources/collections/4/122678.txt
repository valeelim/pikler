Knights Templar     the poor fellow-soldiers of christ and of the temple of solomon ( latin : `` pauperes commilitones christi templique salomonici '' ) , commonly known as the knights templar or the order of the temple ( french : ordre du temple or templiers ) , were among the most famous of the western christian military orders . the organization lasted for two centuries in the middle ages . it was founded after the first crusade of 1096 , with its original purpose to ensure the safety of the many christians who made the pilgrimage to jerusalem after it was taken over . it was officially endorsed by the roman catholic church around 1129 , and became a favored charity by many christians and grew fast in membership and power . templar knights wore white mantles quartered by a red cross and were among the most skilled fighting units of the crusades . those members of the order that did not fight managed a large economic infrastructure throughout christendom , innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking , and building many fortifications throughout the mediterranean and the holy land .
