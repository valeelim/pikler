Evolutionary algorithm     in computer science , especially in artificial intelligence , evolutionary algorithms are a kind of algorithm that simulate evolution to optimise something . each generation of solution is subjected to some kind of fitness function ; those that `` survive '' are then recombined in some way to make the next generation of solution . this is done until a certain level of fitness is reached , or a determined number of generations have been used .
