Polarity     in physics polarity describes an attribute , that can usually have two values : - an electric charge has a polarity of either positive or negative . - a voltage has a polarity , in that it could be positive or negative ( with respect to some other voltage , such as the one at the other end of a battery or electric circuit ) . - a magnet has a polarity , in that one end is the `` north '' and the other is the `` south '' . - the spin of an entity in quantum mechanics has a polarity - positive or negative . - polarized light has waves which all line up in the same direction . chemical polarity is a feature of chemical bonds , where two different atoms in the same molecule have different electronegativity . as a result , the electrons in the bond are not shared equally by the two atoms . this causes an asymmetrical ( polar ) electric field . molecular covalent bonds can be described as polar or nonpolar . entire molecules can also be described as polar .
