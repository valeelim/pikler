Web color     web colors are colors used in designing webpages , and the ways for describing and listing those colours . there are several ways to chose colors for parts of webpages . colors may be listed as an rgb `` triplet '' ( a set of three numbers ) in hexadecimal format ( a `` hex triplet '' ) . rgb triplet can make 16,777,216 different colors . many common colors can also be chosen by their common english names . often a color tool or other graphics software is used to create color values . the first versions of mosaic and netscape navigator used the x11 color names as the base for their color lists . this was because they both started as x window system applications . each web color has its own definition , srgb . this relates to the chromaticities of a single phosphor set , a given transfer curve , adaptive whitepoint , and viewing conditions . these have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions . even without color management , the colors created are fairly close to the given values . however , user agents can be different in the fidelity with which they show the colors . better user agents use color management to create better color fidelity . this is important for web-to-print applications .
