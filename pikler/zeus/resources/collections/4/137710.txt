Classified information     classified information is sensitive information to which access is restricted by law or regulation to particular classes of people . a formal security clearance is required to handle classified documents or access classified data . the clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation . there are typically several levels of sensitivity , with differing clearance requirements . this sort of hierarchical system of sharing information among a group of people is almost used by every national government . the operation of assigning the level of sensitivity to data is called data classification . the purpose of classification is to protect information from being used to damage or cause danger to national security . classification formalizes what constitutes a `` state secret '' and deals with different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause if it reached the wrong hands . certain non-government organizations and corporations also have classified information , normally rather referred to as trade secrets .
