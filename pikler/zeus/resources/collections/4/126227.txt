Flat Earth     the idea of a flat earth is that the surface of the earth is flat ( a plane ) . belief in a flat earth is found in the oldest writings . early mesopotamian maps showed the world as a flat disk floating in the ocean . this was a common belief until the classical greeks began to discuss the earth 's shape about the 4th century bc . eratosthenes ( 276 â€“194 ) calculated the circumference of the earth quite well . from then on , few educated people ever believed in its being flat . people first started having the thought that the earth is round in around 6th century bc . then , aristotle proved the earth was round in around 330 bc . the large-scale shape of the earth only matters when considering large distances . therefore in the ancient world only sailors , astronomers , philosophers , and theologians would have cared about the earth 's large-scale shape . the following authors argued for a spherical or ball shaped earth : king alfred of the anglo-saxons , hildegard von bingen , thomas aquinas , snorri sturluson , marco polo , dante alighieri , christopher columbus
