Serpent (cipher)    serpent ( cipher ) serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) contest after rijndael . serpent was designed by ross anderson , eli biham , and lars knudsen . serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128 , 192 or 256 bits . the cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words . each round applies one of eight 4-bit by 4-bit s-boxes 32 times in parallel . serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel , using 32 1-bit slices . this maximizes parallelism , but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on des . serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other aes finalists choosing a larger security margin : the designers estimated 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack , but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future progress in cryptanalysis . the serpent cipher has not been patented . it is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone .
