Eugène Delacroix     ferdinand victor eugène delacroix ( 26 april 1798 – 13 august 1863 ) was a french romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the french romantic school . delacroix 's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the impressionists , while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the symbolist movement . a fine lithographer , delacroix illustrated various works of william shakespeare , the scottish writer sir walter scott , and the german writer johann wolfgang von goethe . in contrast to the neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival ingres , delacroix took for his inspiration the art of rubens and painters of the venetian renaissance , with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form . dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity , and led him not to the classical models of greek and roman art , but to travel in north africa , in search of the exotic . friend and spiritual heir to théodore géricault , delacroix was also inspired by byron , with whom he shared a strong identification with the `` forces of the sublime '' , of nature in often violent action .
