Greek numerals     greek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the greek alphabet . they are also known by the names `` milesian numerals '' , `` alexandrian numerals '' , or `` alphabetic numerals '' . in modern greece , they are still in use for ordinal numbers , and in much of the same way that roman numerals are in the west ; for ordinary ( cardinal ) numbers , arabic numerals are used . at first , before it was used more , the greek alphabet , linear a and linear b had used a different system with symbols for 1 , 10 , 100 , 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula : | = 1 , – = 10 , ◦ = 100 , ¤ = 1000 , ☼ = 10000. the earliest alphabet-related system of numerals used with the greek letters was a set of the acrophonic attic numerals , operating much like roman numerals ( which derived from this scheme ) , with the following formula : ι = 1 , π = 5 , δ = 10 , πδ = 50 , η = 100 , πη = 500 , χ = 1000 , πχ = 5000 , μ = 10000 and πμ = 50000. the acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system , sometimes called the ionic numeral system , from the 4th century bc . each unit ( 1 , 2 , … , 9 ) was assigned a separate letter , each tens ( 10 , 20 , … , 90 ) a separate letter , and each hundreds ( 100 , 200 , … , 900 ) a separate letter . this requires 27 letters , so the 24-letter greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters : fau ϝ , ( also used are stigma ϛ or , in modern greek , στ ) for 6 , qoppa ϟ for 90 , and sampi ϡ for 900. to distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the `` keraia '' ( greek `` —insect antenna '' ) , a symbol similar to an acute sign ( unicode u+0374 ) .
