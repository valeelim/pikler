Tramway track     tramway tracks are used on tramways or light railways . grooved rails ( or girder rails ) are normally used to let the trams run on streets . this is called `` street-running '' . like normal rail tracks , tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails . tram rails can be placed in several surfaces . standard rails can be put on sleepers like railway tracks , or with grooved rails on concrete sleepers into street surfaces ( pavement ) for street running . another environmentally-friendly or ecologically-friendly alternative is to lay tracks into grass turf surfaces . this is known as `` grassed track '' ( or `` track in a lawn '' ) . it was first used in liverpool in 1924 .
