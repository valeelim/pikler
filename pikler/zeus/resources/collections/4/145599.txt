Fin whale     the fin whale ( `` balaenoptera physalus '' ) is a huge baleen whale . it is the second largest animal on earth ( the blue whale is the biggest ) . this whale is sometimes called the `` greyhound of the sea '' because of its fast swimming speed ; it can swim up to 23 mph ( 37 km/hr ) in short bursts . the fin whale is also called the finback , finner , razorback , common rorqual , and herring whale . the fin whale is a streamlined whale that is found worldwide ; it is most common in the north atlantic . there are three separate populations of fin whales , one in the north pacific , one in the north atlantic , and one in the southern hemisphere ; they do not interbreed . many groups of fin whales migrate between feeding grounds and breeding grounds . this whale usually swims in pods of 3-7 whales but larger groups ( up to 300 animals ) may form at rich feeding grounds . fin whales are filter feeders that eat plankton ( tiny crustaceans like krill and copepods ) and small fish from the water . they have very fine grey-black baleen that traps very small particles of food . each side of the upper jaw has 270-470 baleen plates .
