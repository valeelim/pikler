Voice over Internet Protocol     voice over internet protocol ( or voip ) is a term used for a number of protocols that are used to carry `` voice data '' over packet switched networks . beforehand , telephony used a dedicated line , that was allocated to a call , during the time of that call . this was known as pstn ( or `` public switched telephony network '' ) . using voip will reduce costs , as the `` dedicated line '' for telephony ( and fax ) is no longer needed . there are a number of technical problems that must be solved first , though : - carrying voice data needs a service guarantees ( mostly in the form of `` throughput '' , and `` response time '' ) . not having this will result in a loss of signal ( or in `` hiccups '' ) - most telephony network provide the possibility to operate a phone , even when the power is lost in the area . this is done so that emergency calls can still be made . voip usually does not provide this possibility . - the lan is now used both for voice and data , and becomes a single point of failure . if there are problems with the lan , this can also affect voip calls .
