Firmware     in computing , firmware is a computer program that is `` embedded '' in a hardware device and is an essential part of the hardware . it is sometimes called embedded software . an example is a microcontroller , a part of the microprocessor that tells the microprocessor what actions to take . it can also be a larger program stored on flash memory , or uploaded onto existing hardware by a user . as its name suggests , firmware is somewhere between hardware and software , connecting the two worlds . it can mean slightly different things to different people , especially as stand-alone electronic devices become more like computers . like software , it is a computer program which is run by a microprocessor . but it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it . a computer can have both firmware and software . the firmware is permanently stored in the computer , such as the bios , and can not be easily changed or added to . software , even the os , can be replaced by reformatting the hard drive . software includes the applications that a person operating a computer sees , like a web browser or a word processor . sometimes a device driver is called firmware , since it is needed to run that piece of hardware , like a printer or a video card . the device driver is on the main part of the computer and can be easily updated ( if an update exists ) .
