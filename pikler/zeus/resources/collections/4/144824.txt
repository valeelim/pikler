Snell's law    snell 's law snell 's law is the scientific law of the refraction of light or other waves . in optics , snell 's law is about the speed of light in different media . the law states that when light passes through different materials ( for example from air to glass ) the ratio of sines of the incidence ( incoming ) angle and the refraction ( outgoing ) angle does not change : with each formula_2 as the angle measured from the normal of the boundary , formula_3 as the velocity of light in the respective medium ( si units are meters per second , or m/s ) . formula_4 is the refractive index of the medium . the index of refraction of a vacuum is 1 and the velocity of light in a vacuum is formula_5 . when a wave passes the material where the index of refraction is n , the velocity of the wave becomes formula_6 . snell 's law can be proved by fermat 's principle . fermat 's principle states that `` light travels along the path which takes the least time '' . the idea has a long history . the problem had the attention of hero of alexandria , ptolemy , ibn sahl , and huygens . ibn sahl actually discovered the law of refraction . in `` trait√© de la lumiere '' , 1678 , huygens showed how snell 's law of sines could be explained by , or derived from , the wave nature of light .
