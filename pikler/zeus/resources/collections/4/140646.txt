Minimal instruction set computer     minimal instruction set computer ( misc ) is a processor architecture with a very small number of basic instruction operations and corresponding opcodes . as a result of this is a smaller instruction set , a smaller and faster instruction set decode unit , and faster operation of individual instructions . the disadvantage is that smaller instruction set always have more sequential dependencies , reducing instruction-level parallelism . other pages . - complex instruction set computer ( cisc ) - reduced instruction set computer ( risc ) - very long instruction word ( vliw ) other websites . - forth misc chip designs - seaforth-24 - the latest multi-core misc design from chuck moore
