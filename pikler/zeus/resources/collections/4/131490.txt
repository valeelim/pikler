Book of Ezra     the book of ezra is a book of the bible in the old testament and hebrew tanakh . the words that start nehemiah 1:1 , `` the words of nehemiah son of hacaliah '' , shows that ezra and nehemiah were at first two different works . however , they were put together as one in the earliest hebrew manuscripts . josephus and the jewish talmud talk about the book of ezra but not a different book of nehemiah . the oldest manuscripts of the septuagint also treat ezra and nehemiah as one book . origen ( a.d. 185â€“253 ) is the first writer to treat the books as different works . he called them i ezra and ii ezra . in translating the latin vulgate , jerome called nehemiah the second book of esdrae ( ezra ) . the english translations by wycliffe ( 1382 ) and coverdale ( 1535 ) also called ezra `` i esdras '' and nehemiah `` ii esdras '' . the same separation first came out in a hebrew manuscript in 1448 .
