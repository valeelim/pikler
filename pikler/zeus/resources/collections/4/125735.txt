Glenn Seaborg     glenn theodore seaborg ( april 19 , 1912 - feb. 25 , 1999 ) was an american chemist . he was born in ishpening , michigan . he won the 1951 nobel prize in chemistry with edwin m. mcmillan . in 1980 , he changed several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the lawrence berkeley laboratory . his experimental technique , using nuclear physics , was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atom . seaborg 's techique would have cost too much money to make of gold , but his work is the closest to the mythical philosopher 's stone . seaborg worked at the manhattan project during world war ii . he studied the chemical properties of plutonium as a part of the secret war research . he served as chairman of the atomic energy commission and was a professor at the university of california , berkeley . seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements : plutonium , americium , curium , berkelium , californium , einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , nobelium and element 106 , which was named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living . he also developed more than 100 atomic isotopes . early in his career , seaborg was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and developed many isotopes of elements that helped to diagnose and treat diseases . for example , he studied iodine-131 , which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease . he developed the actinide concept which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table . seaborg also proposed the placement of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series .
