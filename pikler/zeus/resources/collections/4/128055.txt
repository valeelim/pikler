Reed-Solomon error correction     reed-solomon error correction is an error-correcting code . it works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data . the polynomial is evaluated at several points , and these values are sent or recorded . sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined . as long as it receives `` many '' of the points correctly , the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a `` few '' bad points . reed-solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications , for example in cds , dvds and blu-ray discs , in data transmission technologies such as dsl & wimax , and broadcast systems such as dvb and atsc . reed-solomon codes are block codes . this means that a fixed block of input data is processed into a fixed block of output data . in the case of the most commonly used r-s code ( 255 , 223 ) â€“ 223 reed-solomon input symbols ( each eight bits long ) are encoded into 255 output symbols . - most r-s ecc schemes are systematic . this means that some portion of the output codeword contains the input data in its original form .
