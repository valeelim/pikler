Kenneth Freeman     kenneth `` poppi '' freeman ( d. may 13 , 1985 ) was a street vendor from philadelphia , pennsylvania who sold newspapers along with billy cook . he is known for being an important suspect in the mumia abu-jamal case ( the murder of daniel faulkner ) . cynthia white , a key witness , said that freeman was present , but did not name him . at the time of the crime , freeman was a front passenger in billy cook 's volkswagen . in two different lineups done to determine the killer , cynthia white picked him . billy cook , the brother of abu-jamal ( wesley cook ) , claimed later that freeman personally confessed to him as being armed and shooting faulkner . arnold beverly , in an affidavit where he confessed to the murder , named `` another guy '' as a shooter . some witnesses testified that they saw a man with a green army jacket going away from the crime scene . billy cook said that kenneth freeman was wearing a green army jacket . freeman was reportedly in germany in the army , and usually wore the jacket . one important contradiction is the fact that cynthia white picked freeman out of a lineup as the killer , but later changed her testimony to fit the prosecution 's story . this can be explained by her admission that police bribed her to do so , so that she could legally work as a prostitute . that leads to another important inconsistency , which is that yvette williams , someone who white knew personally , said that white told her that she did not see the actual killer , which means it was not possible for her to identify freeman as the killer , unless he confessed to her personally .
