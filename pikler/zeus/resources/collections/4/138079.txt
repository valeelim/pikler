Space-time tradeoff     in computer science , a space-time or time-memory tradeoff is a way of solving a problem or calculation in less time by using more storage space ( or memory ) , or by solving a problem in very little space by spending a long time . most computers have a large amount of space , but not infinite space . also , most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation , but not forever . so if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory , a space-time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly . or , if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have , you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory . the most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table . this means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down . one way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table , which will let you find answers very quickly , but will use a lot of space . another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything , which uses very little space , but might take a long time .
