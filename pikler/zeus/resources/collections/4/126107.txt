Menstrual cycle     the menstrual cycle is a process that human women go through about every 28 days . during this time , the women 's ovaries create a mature ovum ( egg ) . then the woman 's body prepares for pregnancy by thickening the walls of the uterus . if the woman does not become pregnant during this time , the egg and the lining of the uterus come out of the woman 's body during menstruation . the menstrual cycle process is controlled by four major hormones : fsh ( follicle stimulating hormone ) ; lh ( luteinising hormone ) ; estrogen ; and progesterone . these hormones prepare the uterus to receive a fertilized egg and control its development . the menstrual cycle has three stages : the follicular stage , ovulation , and the luteal ( or premenstrual ) stage . the cycle will stop if the woman gets pregnant ( if a fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus ) . this stage is the start of the menstrual cycle , and is counted as day one of the cycle . this stage starts when the amount of progesterone and estrogen in a woman 's blood drop . this causes the endometrium - the thick lining of the uterus - to leave the woman 's body through menstruation . it will appear as bleeding from the vagina . this stage lasts from 4â€“6 days .
