Hyderabad State     hyderābād and berar ( , ) under the nizams , was the largest princely state in the erstwhile indian empire . the berar region of present day vidarbha in maharashtra was merged with the central provinces in 1903 , to form central provinces and berar . hyderabad state was located in south-central india from 1724 until 1948 , ruled by a hereditary nizam . during partition of british india in 1947 , the nizam of hyderabad declared his intentions of not joining either newly formed india or pakistan . sensing trouble , india launched operation polo which resulted in the absorption of hyderabad into the indian union , in 1948. the forebears of the asaf jahi dynasty came to india from samarkand , in central asia , but the family actually originated from baghdad . in 1724 , the mughal governor of the deccan , asaf jah , nizam ul-mulk , qamar ud-din khan , established himself as an independent ruler of deccan . hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to that of the state he had created . the first nizam 's successors became closly allied to the british colonialists , frequently assisting them in subduing their enemies , the maratha dynasty , tipu sultan of mysore , and the french . in later years , the nizam 's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns undertaken by the british indian army . large numbers of his troops took part in the first and second world wars . these contributions earned for the nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful emperor .
