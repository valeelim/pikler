Lorentz force     lorentz 's law is a law discovered by the dutch physicist hendrik antoon lorentz . lorentz 's law defines force that acts on moving charged particles in an electromagnetic field . force consists of magnetic force and electric force . f = qe ( electric force ) if the charge is positive , the direction of the electric force is equal to direction of electric field . f = qv*b ( magnetic force ) the direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule . if charged particles move with velocity v in an electric field e and a magnetic field b f = qe + qv*b f : force ( vector ) q : charge ( scalar ) e : electric field ( vector ) v : velocity of particle ( vector ) b : magnetic field ( vector ) - is vector cross product . using this law , j.j. thomson measured mass-to-charge ratio .
