Kirchhoff's circuit laws    kirchhoff 's circuit laws in 1845 , german physicist gustav kirchhoff described two laws about electrical circuits.. these laws are generalizations of ohm 's law . kirchhoff 's circuit laws are very useful in solving circuit problems . kirchhoff 's current law is also known as kirchhoff 's first law and kirchhoff 's junction law . this law states that 'the sum of current into a junction equals the sum of current out of the junction ' . this is the same as kirchhoff 's junction law . in a junction , the electric charge 's sum preservation law is applied . if the entering value of the current is i2 and i3 , this current splits into the current of i1 and i4 . then the equation ( i1 + i4 = i2 + i3 ) is satisfied . the right picture gives an example . this kirchhoff 's first law is that charge is not destroyed or created in a junction point . this is based by an electric charge preservation law . kirchhoff 's voltage law is also known as kirchhoff 's second law , a closed circuit law , and kirchhoff 's loop law . the algebraic sum of the voltage ( potential ) differences in any loop must equal zero . ( this circuit is a closed circuit )
