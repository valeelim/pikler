Daily Mirror     the daily mirror is a british newspaper . it was founded on 2 november 1903. the `` daily mirror '' was launched on 2 november 1903 by alfred harmsworth ( later lord northcliffe ) as a newspaper for women , run by women . hence the name : he said , `` i intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides ... to be entertaining without being frivolous , and serious without being dull '' , and also invited men to read it . it cost one penny . it was not an immediate success . in 1904 , he decided to turn it into a pictore newspaper , changing the masthead to `` the daily illustrated mirror '' and made hamilton fyfe editor who then fired all the women journalists . this name ran from 26 january to 27 april 1904 ( issues 72 to 150 ) , then reverted to `` the daily mirror '' . the first issue did not have advertisements on the front page as previously , but instead news text and engraved pictures ( of a traitor and an actress ) , with the promise of photographs inside . two days later , the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added : `` a paper for men and women '' . this combination was more successful : by issue 92 , the guaranteed circulation was 120,000 copies and by issue 269 , it had grown to 200,000 :
