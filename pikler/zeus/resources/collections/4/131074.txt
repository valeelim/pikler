Electronegativity     electronegativity , symbol Ï‡ , is a chemical property that says how well an atom can attract electrons towards itself . the electronegativity of an atom is influenced by the atom 's atomic number and the distance between the atom 's valence electrons ( the outermost electrons that take part in chemical bonding ) and its nucleus . it was first theorised by linus pauling in 1932 as part of his valence bond theory , and is related to other chemical properties . generally , electronegativity increases from the bottom-left to the upper-right of the periodic table ; this is known as a periodic trend . there are many ways to calculate the electronegativity of an atom . the most common way of calculation is the one suggested by linus pauling , and it gives the relative pauling scale . this scale gives elements dimensionless quantities ( values ) between 0.7 to 3.98 , with hydrogen being at 2.20. the opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity ; the measure of how well an atom gives away electrons .
