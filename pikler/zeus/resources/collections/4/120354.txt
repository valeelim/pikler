Necronomicon     the necronomicon is a fictional book of magic created by the horror writer h. p. lovecraft . it is a greek-sounding word commonly translated as `` book of dead names '' . it is pronounced `` neck-ro-nom-ih-kon '' . like most of his ideas , the `` necronomicon '' came to lovecraft in his dreams . lovecraft let his friends write stories about the `` necronomicon '' . eventually , fake `` necronomicon '' s were written . according to lovecraft , the `` necronomicon '' was written in the eighth century by a crazy arabian man named abdul alhazred . alhazred ( who was also fictional ) practiced evil magic . he assembled a collection of evil spells into a manuscript ( a book with loose pages and no cover ) which he called `` al azif '' . lovecraft said this as an arabian phrase for a scary sound , like a scream . later , the original manuscript was translated into greek . it was given the title `` necronomicon '' . olaus wormius ( a real person ) then translated the greek version into latin . john dee ( also real ) translated the `` necronomicon '' into english . lovecraft liked to mix in real people and places in his fiction . this made the stories seem more real . some people were fooled into thinking what he wrote was true .
