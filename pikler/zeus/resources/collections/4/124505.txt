Polaris (star)    polaris ( star ) polaris ( alpha ursae minoris ) is the pole star or north star . it is the brightest star in the constellation ursa minor . it is almost straight above earth 's north pole . because of this , when it is seen from earth , it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky . many years ago , sailors in the northern hemisphere used polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving . there are some interesting facts about polaris . the first is that it is part of a triple star system . it has a very close dwarf binary , and a larger star , polaris b , which orbits 2,400 au away . the main polaris a star is a giant with 4.5 times the mass of the sun . it is a classic cepheid variable , the closest to us in the whole milky way . polaris b can be seen even with a modest telescope . it was found by william herschel in 1780 using one of the most powerful telescopes of the time : his own reflecting telescope . the nearby dwarf star , ab , was predicted in 1929 , but only seen quite recently . the dwarf orbits as close to a as uranus is to our sun .
