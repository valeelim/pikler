Kabul River     kabul river , or kabal river ( ) , is a river that rises in the sanglakh range in afghanistan , separated from the watershed of the helmand by the unai pass . it is the main river in the eastern part of afghanistan . it flows 700 km before joining the indus river near attock . it passes through the cities of kabul , chaharbagh , jalalabad , and ( flowing into pakistan some 30 km north of the khyber pass ) nowshera . the major tributaries of the kabul river are the logar , panjshir , kunar and alingar and bara rivers . the kabul river itself is little more than a trickle for most of the year , but swells in summer due to melting snows . its largest tributary is the kunar river , which starts out as the mastuj river , flowing from the chiantar glacier in chitral , pakistan and once it flows south into afghanistan it is met by the bashgal river flowing from nurestan . the kunar meets the kabul near jalalabad . in spite of the kunar carrying more water than the kabul , the river continues as the kabul river after this confluence , mainly for the political and historical significance of the name .
