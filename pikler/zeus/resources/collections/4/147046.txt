British Rail Class 29     the british rail class 29 consisted of 20 diesel locomotives which were rebuilt from the north british class 21. the original license-built man engines of the class 21s had proved unreliable , so in 1963 locomotive d6123 was sent to paxman 's colchester works to receive a new paxman ventura v12 engine . a further 19 were re-engined in 1964-1965 at polmadie works , with other changes made at the same time . this included the fitting of four-character headcode displays in the nose ends . after rebuilding , they returned to service from eastfield depot in glasgow . although these offered more power and much improved reliability over the original class 21s , they did not survive much longer , due to their small class size and the use of a non-standard high-speed diesel engine . d6108 was withdrawn in may 1969 and scrapped by mcwilliams of shettleston in 1971 , while the other 19 were withdrawn between april and december 1971 and scrapped at br 's glasgow works in 1971-72. no class 21 or class 29 locomotives survive today .
