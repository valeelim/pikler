Digital signal processor     a digital signal processor ( dsp or dsp micro ) is a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing , generally used in real-time computing . digital signal processing algorithms require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data . signals are converted from analog to digital , manipulated digitally , and then converted again to form digital to analog , as shown in the diagram . many digital signal processing applications have real-time constraints ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some time constraint . the microarchitecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications . other pages . - digital signal controller other websites . - dsp processor - core-based wireless system design - microcontroller.com - dsp engineering magazine - introduction to dsp - processor tutorial - improv systems homepage - analog devices homepage
