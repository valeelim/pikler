Kilik Pass     kilik pass ( el . 4827 m./15,837 ft. ) , 30 km to the west of mintaka pass is a high mountain pass in pakistan . the two passes were , in ancient times , the two main access points into the upper hunza valley ( also called gojal valley ) from the north . this was the shortest and quickest way into northern kashmir from the tarim basin , and one that was usually open all year , but was extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot . from tashkurgan one travelled just over 70 km south to the junction of the minteke river . heading some 80 km west up this valley one reached the mintaka pass , ( and 30 km farther , the alternative kilik pass ) , which both led into upper hunza from where one could travel over the infamous rafiqs or `` hanging passages '' to gilgit and on , either to kashmir , or to the gandharan plains . laden animals could be taken over the mintaka and kilik passes into upper hunza ( both open all year ) , but then loads would have to be carried by coolie ( porters ) to gilgit ( an expensive and dangerous operation ) . from there , cargoes could be reloaded onto pack animals again and taken either east to kashmir and then on to taxila ( a long route ) , or west to chitral which provided relatively easy access to either jalalabad , or peshawar via swat .
