The Replacements (band)    the replacements ( band ) the replacements were an american rock band . they began in minneapolis , minnesota , in 1979 , and are best known for being early pioneers of alternative rock . the replacements became popular locally after playing live for the first time . this was because of tommy stinson 's young age . he was still 13. he had learned to play bass guitar at 11 . early shows were good but soon because impossible to control . the band became known for their rowdy , angry , and often drunken live shows . they often came up on stage too intoxicated to play . they were banned permanently from `` saturday night live '' after performing drunk before a national television audience on january 18 , 1986. as one critic said , the band could quite often be `` mouthing profanities into the camera , stumbling into each other , falling down , dropping their instruments , and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were . '' the replacements — when sober — got critical praise for their live shows . part of the suspence of seeing the replacements play , was that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play . it was not unusual for the group to play entire sets of cover versions , ranging anywhere from bryan adams 's `` summer of '69 '' to dusty springfield 's `` the look of love '' to led zeppelin 's `` black dog .
