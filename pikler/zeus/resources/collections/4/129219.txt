Shelf life     shelf life is how long food can be kept safely . food can not be kept forever . after a certain time it will go bad . after this time it is no longer safe to eat it . shelf life also used for drugs , drinks and other things that can go bad . in some countries , a `` best before '' , `` use by '' or `` freshness date '' must be put on packaged foods . shelf life is the length of time that food can be stored . during this time , the quality of the food does not change , if it is kept under normal conditions . frozen food that is not stored in the fridge or freezer will go bad earlier , for example . most of these labels do not guarantee the safety of food . they should only be used as a guide . shelf life is different from `` expiration date '' . shelf life is linked to food quality , expiration date to food safety . a product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe , but quality is no longer guaranteed . in most food stores , shelf life is controlled by using stock rotation . this means moving products with the earliest sell by date to the front of the shelf , so that most shoppers will pick them up first and so getting them out of the store . this is important , as stores can be fined for selling out of date products . most shops , if not all , will have to mark such products down as wasted , leading to a loss of profit .
