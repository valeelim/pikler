Cerium     cerium is a chemical element with an atomic number of 58. this means that the nucleus of cerium has 58 protons in it . the atomic mass of cerium is 140.12. the chemical symbol of cerium is ce and it is a member of the lanthanide group . cerium is a grey , shiny or lustrous metal . at room temperature cerium is a solid . it melts and becomes a liquid at 798c and boils and becomes a gas at 3424c . it burns in air to form a compound with one cerium atom and two oxygen atoms . 0.0046 % of the earth 's crust is cerium which means that it is quite common - more common than tin and lead and nearly as common as zinc cerium was first found in sweden in 1803 by berzelius and hisinger and klaproth in germany . because it is very reactive , it was not purified until 1875 in washington dc . cerium was named after the asteroid or minor planet ceres which was first seen two years earlier in 1801. cerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes . its most common use is as the 'flint ' in a lighter , because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal . cerium is sometimes used in alloys because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant . cerium is also used in special glass , ceramics and self-cleaning ovens .
