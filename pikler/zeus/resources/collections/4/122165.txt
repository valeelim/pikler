Parody mass     a parody mass is a musical setting of the mass that uses melodies from other musical works . this kind of mass was popular in the 16th century . `` parody '' in this sense does not mean `` parody '' in the modern meaning of the word . it is not about poking fun at something . a parody mass is one that borrows musical material . the music might be borrowed from a chanson or motet , usually one by another composer . at that time there was nothing shameful about using other composer 's tunes . today it would be called plagiarism ( stealing other people 's ideas ) . the parody mass was very popular during the renaissance : palestrina wrote about 50 parody masses . some examples of early parody masses include the `` missa malheur me bat '' , `` missa mater patris '' , and `` missa fortuna desperata '' by josquin desprez . by the middle of the 16th century , a large number of masses composed used the parody technique .
