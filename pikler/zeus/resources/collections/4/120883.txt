Nocturnes (Debussy)    nocturnes ( debussy ) nocturnes is a piece of music for orchestra by the french composer claude debussy . there are three movements . a female chorus also sings in the last movement . debussy finished writing `` nocturnes '' on 15 december 1899. the three movements each have a title . they are : - i . `` nuages '' ( `` clouds '' ) - ii . `` fêtes '' ( `` festivals '' ) - iii . `` sirènes '' ( `` sirens '' ) a large portion of debussy ’ s music , including his nocturnes , is inspired by the works of the impressionist painters . the word nocturne ( from the latin `` nocturnus '' ) usually describes a piece that is inspired by the night . however , debussy 's nocturnes do not follow this patter ; rather , they capture the way light is shown in impressionist paintings . 'nuages ' is about the clouds in the sky and the way they move slowly in grey colours with a little white . 'fêtes ' is a very lively picture of a group of people having a celebration and dancing . a procession is heard arriving . the music of the procession gradually gets louder , mixes with the music of the dancing , then it gradually dies away as the procession disappears into the distance .
