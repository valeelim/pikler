Pietro Cavallini     pietro cavallini , ( c.1250 â€“ c.1330 ) was a painter who lived and worked in rome in italy in the late medieval period . he may have also worked in naples . he is thought of as one of the greatest painters of his day , but has never been as well known as giotto from florence , who was alive at the same time . this is probably because only two pictures by cavallini still exist . one of them is a mosaic in the church of santa maria in trastevere . the other is a fresco in the nearby convent of santa cecilia in trastevere . ( `` in trastevere '' means `` in the part of the rome that is across the tiber river '' . ) the fresco at santa cecilia 's is a large picture of the last judgement with jesus sitting between rows of saints . unfortunately , the room , which was quite tall , had a new level added , and the floor cut across the fresco . it is in ruins , but the parts that remain show that cavallini was trying to make the figures that he painted look solid and three-dimensional like the frescos of ancient rome . pietro cavallini probably influenced the artists who travelled from rome to work at the basilica of st francis of assisi . it is not known if he painted any of the frescos there .
