Diprotodon     diprotodon was the largest marsupial that ever lived . it existed from about 1.6 million years ago until extinction some 46,000 years ago . so it lived through most of the pleistocene epoch . diprotodon looked like a rhino without a horn . its feet turned inwards like a wombat â€™ s , giving it a pigeon-toed appearance . it had strong claws on the front feet , so it may have been able to dig up roots to eat . footprints of its hairy feet have been found , so we know it had fur like a horse rather than being bald like a rhino . diprotodon is found in sites all over australia , but not in tasmania . female skeletons have been found with babies located where the mother 's pouch would have been . the largest specimens were hippopotamus-sized : about from nose to tail , standing tall at the shoulder and weighing about . other websites . - australia 's lost kingdom on `` diprotodon optatum '' - regional council of goyder page on the genera - museum victoria on the diprotodontids - description of price 's research
