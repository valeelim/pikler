Control engineering     control engineering is the engineering field that focuses on mathematical modeling of systems of a various nature , analyzing their dynamic behavior , and using control theory to create a controller that will cause the systems to behave in a desired manner . modern control engineering is closely related to electrical , electronic and computer engineering , as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques . and as engineering is developing , control engineering is often wanted . in most of the cases , control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems . for example , in an automobile with sail control the machine 's speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor 's spin power accordingly . also recently , control system is used in nanotechnology . and the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control . for example , we can change chemical process fast and easily . many developments were invoked by this process control . like this , control engineering has a lot if fields that include science , finance management , and even human action .
