Motte-and-bailey     a motte-and-bailey is a kind of castle , or fortification . many of them were built in the 11th and 12th century around europe . these structures were made on a hill ( that was often artificial ) . on this hill , a keep of wood or stone was built . this was easy to build , and the materials were readily available and cheap . however , this meant they were easy to burn down . also wood rots when it gets wet so the structure does n't often last long and need lots of repairing . they used to be made out of wood but as time went by different types of castles made of stone became more common as they were much stronger . these were surrounded by a ditch and protected with a stone wall . motte and bailey castles appeared in england after the norman conquest of 1066. motte and bailey castles were a common feature in england by the death of william the conqueror in 1087. their construction was the start of what was to become a massive castle building programme in england and wales . motte and bailey castles have been around for 8 centuries and are part of today 's history .
