British Uganda Programme     the british uganda programme was a plan to give a piece of east africa , owned by the british , to jewish people to live in . the plan was made to help the jews in russia to find somewhere to live after the pogroms . the offer was first made by british colonial secretary joseph chamberlain to theodore herzl 's zionist group in 1903. he said he would give them 5,000km of the mau plateau , kenya . the idea was brought up during zionist congress at its sixth meeting in 1903 in basel . many people disagreed with it . in the end the motion passed by 295 to 177 votes . the plateau 's high elevation gave it a low temperature , which was good for the european people . however , it was filled with lions and other dangerous animals . this problem made the zionists politely refuse the offer for the land . other websites . - jewish virtual library on uganda proposal
