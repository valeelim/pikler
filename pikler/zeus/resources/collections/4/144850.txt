Stellar classification     in astronomy , stellar classification is a way of grouping stars by temperature . star temperature can be measured by looking at its spectrum , the type of light that the star shines . stars are also grouped into spectral types or classes by color . in general , a star 's temperature determines its color , from red to blue-white . spectral types are named with a letter : `` m '' , `` k '' , `` g '' , `` f '' , `` a '' , `` b '' and `` o '' . `` m '' stars are the coldest stars and `` o '' stars are the hottest . the closest star to the earth , the sun , is a class g star . the harvard classification system is a one-dimensional classification scheme . stars vary in surface temperature from about 2,000 to 40,000 kelvin . physically , the classes indicate the temperature of the star 's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest , as is done in the following table : note : the conventional color description describe only the peak of the stellar spectrum . however , the actual apparent colors the eye sees are lighter than the conventional color descriptions .
