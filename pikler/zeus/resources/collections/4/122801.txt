Propædia     the propædia is the first of three parts of the encyclopaedia britannica , the other two being the 12-volume `` micropædia '' and the 17-volume `` macropædia '' . the `` propædia '' is supposed to be a book that organizes the things in the britannica , and a guideline to the index of the other two parts . it was introduced in 1974 with the 15th edition of the encyclopedia to replace the index , but when many people complained , britannica put the index back in two books in 1985. the core of the `` propædia '' is its outline of knowledge , which is supposed to give people a classification of what we know , but the `` propædia '' also has some parts listing the staff members , advisors and contributors to all three parts of the `` britannica '' . the propaedia can be used by a student who wants to know what there is to know , before even finding out about it . once the student finds out what he needs to know , he will then find out about the thing itself . the `` outline '' has ten parts , each with an essay to introduce the part . below is the table of the ten parts .
