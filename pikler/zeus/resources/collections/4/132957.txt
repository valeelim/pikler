Alcoholic drink     an alcoholic drink is a drink that contains 0.5 % or more ethanol . in chemistry there is a whole class of substances known as alcohols . the alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is known as ethanol or `` grain alcohol '' . grain alcohol is generally made through a process called fermentation . in fermentation , bacteria change sugar to make ethanol or vinegar . other kinds of alcohol are usually harmful to drink , so the only kind of alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is grain alcohol . since most people do not have to use any other kind of alcohol except ethanol , they will use the word `` alcohol '' to mean only ethanol . sometimes people also use the world `` alcohol '' to talk about any drink containing ethanol , such as whiskey , vodka , or gin . fermenting grain can only make a drink that is 20 % alcohol . to get higher amounts of alcohol in drinks , distillation is used . this allows to get substances that are made of alcohol to about 80-85 % ( certain kinds of rum used for cooking are at 70â€“80 % alcohol ) . when beverages are sold , the amount of alcohol is listed as alcoholic proof rather than percentage .
