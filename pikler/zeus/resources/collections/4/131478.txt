Song of Songs     the song of songs is a book of the hebrew bible or tanakh , and also in the old testament of the christian bible . it is one of the five `` megillot '' ( scrolls ) . the song of songs is also known as the song of solomon or as canticle of canticles . it is known as `` aisma '' in the septuagint , which is short for ῏αισμα ᾀσμάτων , `` aisma aismatôn '' , `` song of songs '' in greek . verse 1 seems to show that the author is solomon , since it says that it is `` solomon 's song of songs '' , but this could also just mean a song `` for '' or `` about '' solomon . so , who the author of song of songs was is still an often-discussed question . if solomon wrote it , it was probable that it was written in around the tenth century b.c . when solomon was king . in fact , the mention of the cities of tirzah and jerusalem so close together ( 6:4 ) has been used to say that it was written before king omri ( 885-874 b.c . ) , even though people still do not know exactly why tirzah was talked about . however , many have also said that the language in the song of songs is proof of it being written much later .
