N-type semiconductor     an n-type semiconductor is created by adding pentavalent impurities like phosphorus ( p ) , arsenic ( as ) , or antimony ( sb ) . a pentavalent impurity is called a donor because it is ready to give a free electron to a semiconductor . the impurities are called dopants . the purpose of doing this is to make more charge carriers , or electrons available in the material for conduction . in n type semiconductors the number of electrons is more than the holes , so electrons are measured as majority charge carriers and holes are referred as minority charge carriers semiconductor materials like silicon and germanium have four electrons in their outer shell ( valence shell ) . all the four electrons are used by the semiconductor atom in forming bonds with its neighbouring atoms , leaving a low number of electrons available for conduction . pentavalent elements are those elements which have five electrons in their outer shell . when pentavalent impurities like phosphorus or arsenic are added into semiconductor , four electrons form bonds with the surrounding silicon atoms leaving one electron free . the resulting material has a large number of free electrons .
