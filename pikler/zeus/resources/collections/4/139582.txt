Internet Key Exchange     internet key exchange ( ike or ikev2 ) is the protocol used to set up a security association ( sa ) in the ipsec protocol suite . ike uses a diffie-hellman key exchange to set up a shared session secret , from which cryptographic keys are derived . public key techniques or , alternatively , a pre-shared key , are used to mutually authenticate the communicating parties . ike builds upon the oakley protocol . ike was originally defined in november 1998 by the internet engineering task force ( ietf ) in a series of publications ( request for comments ) known as rfc 2407 , rfc 2408 , and rfc 2409 . - rfc 2407 defined the internet ip security domain of interpretation for isakmp . - rfc 2408 internet security association and key management protocol ( isakmp ) - rfc 2409 defined the internet key exchange ( ike ) ike was updated to version two ( ikev2 ) in december 2005 by rfc 4306. ikev2 has been further expanded by rfc 4301 ( security architecture for the internet protocol ) through rfc 4310 ( dns security extensions mapping for the epp ) . more rfcs are being added all the time as the need arises to further develop the features of the protocol .
