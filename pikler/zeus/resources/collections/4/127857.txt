Ploidy     - wheat : 6 sets ( `` hectaploid '' ) - certain sturgeons : 8 sets ( `` octoploid '' ) - strawberries : 8 sets ( `` octoploid '' ) - plumed cockscomb ( a plant , `` celosia argentea '' ) : 12 sets ( `` dodecaploid '' ) - bryophytes : body has one set ; sporophyte has two sets . sex cells ( gametes ) are almost always haploid . if the reproductive stage ( adult ) is polyploid , then the gametes will have half the ploidy number of chromosomes . there are some variations of ploidy which are not discussed here . some plant species with certain types of polyploidy do not use sexual reproduction , but survive with asexual methods . polyploidy occurs in cells and organisms when there are more than two paired ( homologous ) sets of chromosomes . most organisms are normally diploid , meaning they have two sets of chromosomes â€” one set inherited from each parent . polyploidy may occur due to abnormal cell division . it is most commonly found in plants , but it does sometimes happen in animals . some estimates suggest that 30-80 % of living plant species are polyploid , and many lineages show evidence of ancient polyploidy ( paleopolyploidy ) in their genomes . huge increases in angiosperm ( flowering plants ) diversity have coincided with the timing of ancient genome duplications shared by many species . 15 % of angiosperm and 31 % of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase .
