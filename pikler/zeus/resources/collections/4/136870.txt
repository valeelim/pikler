Muslim conquests     the first arab muslim conquests ( 632â€“732 ) , ( , fatah , literally `` opening '' , ) also referred to as the islamic conquests or arab conquests , began after the death of the islamic prophet muhammad . he established a new unified political polity in the arabian peninsula which under the following rashidun and umayyad caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of arab power well beyond the arabian peninsula in the form of a vast muslim arab empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest india , across central asia , the middle east , north africa , southern italy , and the iberian peninsula , to the pyrenees . the arab conquests brought about the collapse of the sassanid empire and a great territorial loss for the byzantine empire . though spectacular , the arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight . the sassanid persian and byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another . this prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile arab raiders operating from the desert . moreover , many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires , for example jews and christians in persia and monophysites in syria , were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the arab invaders , largely because of religious conflict in both empires .
