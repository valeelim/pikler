Murray Bookchin     murray bookchin ( january 14 , 1921 – july 30 , 2006 ) was an american libertarian socialist , political and social philosopher , speaker and writer . for much of his life he called himself an anarchist , although as early as 1995 he privately renounced his identification with the anarchist movement . a pioneer in the ecology movement , bookchin was the founder of the social ecology movement within libertarian socialist and ecological thought . he was the author of two dozen books on politics , philosophy , history , and urban affairs as well as ecology . bookchin was a radical anti-capitalist and always asked the decentralisation of society . his writings on libertarian municipalism , a theory of face-to-face , grassroots democracy , had an influence on the green movement and anti-capitalist direct action groups such as reclaim the streets . his criticisms of `` new age '' greens such as charlene spretnak contributed to the divisions in the american green movement in the 1990s . bookchin was the first to use the term `` libertarian municipalism '' , to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the state with a confederation of free municipalities . libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers — the municipal confederations and the nation-state — can not coexist .
