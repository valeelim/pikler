All your base are belong to us     `` all your base are belong to us '' ( often shortened to `` all your base '' , `` aybabtu '' , or simply `` ayb '' ) is a broken english phrase that began an internet phenomenon in 2001 and 2002 , with the use of a flash animation . the phrase is taken from the first part of a european sega mega drive version of the video game `` zero wing '' , made in japan by toaplan . the words in the game were translated into english so quickly that they did not make very much sense . the words `` all your base are belong to us '' were at first popular on the something awful message forums . in the japanese text , `` cats '' seems to be the name of an organization , not just of the character on the screen . the phrase and similar phrases from the game has been shown in articles , books , comics , clothing , movies , radio shows , songs , television shows , video games , webcomics , and websites . - in the year 2000 , jeffery ray roberts , a kansas city computer programmer and part-time deejay aged 23 , and his musical band called the laziest men on mars made a techno dance tune called `` invasion of the gabber robots '' , which used some of the zero wing video game music by tatsuya uemura with a voice saying `` all your base are belong to us .
