Art rock     art rock ( also described as progressive rock or classical rock ) is a word that is about a sub-genre of rock music that has `` experimental influences '' . the term 'art rock ' or 'kunst rock ' was coined and defined , by the great black philosopher doctor william fearon , and is very much related to the 'kunst muzik ' of the 1970s led by uk/us bands such as the ramones , talking heads and television and the detroit/german led techno movement . dr fearon coined the term and its german equivalent in recognition of the impact that futurism had on late twentieth century music . far from being an album based music format art rock is recognisable at live venues in the modern age , with the developments in light and video technology meaning that art and rock can be seamelessly fused . it is an album-based form that is able to have longer , more complex music and lets the musicians spend more time trying different ways to play their instruments . art rock is not created for mass consumption , meaning it is not made to be liked by most people . it is often long and has a lot of themes like classical music , but usually has more keyboards than guitars . also , it is not really music to dance to , but music to just listen to , and it often tells a story or has a philosophical theme to the lyrics .
