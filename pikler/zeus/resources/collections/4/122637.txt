Baphomet     baphomet is a name of unestablished origin . it first appeared in trial transcripts during the inquisition of the knights templar in the early 1300s . some modern scholars believe the name to have been an old french corruption and misspelling of the name mahomet ( muhammad ) . nowadays it is generally viewed as a symbol of the devil . in the middle ages , the templar were accused of heresy , such as denying jesus christ and spitting on the cross . they also supposedly worshiped an icon called `` bafomet '' . beyond this , little is known about the origins of the baphomet . in the 1800s , magician eliphas levi interpreted baphomet as an occult symbol representing perfection , or the union of opposites to create divine harmony . to illustrate his point , he depicted the entity as a goat-headed androgyne with wings , female breasts , a rod between its legs , and a flaming torch between its horns . this imagery was soon used by people who thought it was satanic- notably in anti-freemasonry tracts , where some writers accused masons of worshiping the devil . many evangelical christians still believe masonry to be of the devil .
