OpenOffice Base     openoffice base is the database module released with openoffice version 2.0 and later . currently it is based on the hsqldb database engine written in java . the hsqldb developers have suggested only 76 % of the target has been met in the 1.8.0 release , which is the version that was integrated ( merged ) with ooo 2.0. they have been asking for contributions to complete all the feature targets , since the inner database engine is an independent project with no outside funding . openoffice users , however , can choose to connect to an external full-featured sql database such as mysql , postgresql and even oracle through odbc or jdbc drivers . openoffice base can then act as a gui frontend for sql views , table design and query . in addition , openoffice has its own form wizard to create dialog windows for form filling and updates . starting with version 2.3 , base will offer report generation based on pentaho software . released under the terms of the apache license , base is free software .
