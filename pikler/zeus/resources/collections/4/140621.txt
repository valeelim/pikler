Very long instruction word     very long instruction word or vliw which refers to a cpu architecture designed to take advantage of instruction level parallelism ( ilp ) but at minimum level of hardware complexities . ( alternatively , variable length instruction word or vliw a refers to a cpu instruction ( instruction set ) designed to load ( or copy ) a literal value count of inline machine code to the on-chip ram for higher speed cpu decoding . ) a processor that executes every instruction one after the other ( i.e . a non-pipelined scalar architecture ) may use processor resources inefficiently , leading to poor performance . the performance can be improved by using micro-architectural design techniques that use ilp including : - instruction pipelining where the execution of multiple instructions can be partially overlapped ; where each instructions is divided into series of sub-steps ( termed : micro-operations ) . - superscalar execution in which multiple execution units are used to execute multiple instructions in parallel .
