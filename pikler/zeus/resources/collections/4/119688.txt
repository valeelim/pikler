Spreadsheet     a spreadsheet is a computer program that imitates a paper worksheet . it shows a large sheet ( like a sheet of paper ) that has many cells in a grid of rows and columns . users can put words or numbers into the cells , to make headings and store information ( usually numbers ) . you can also move the grid lines around so that some cells are bigger than others , and change the color or size of text/font , the same way font/text is changed in a word processor . you can even put pictures in the worksheets , make multiple pages , and print out their results on real paper . the primary reason most people use spreadsheets is for automatic calculations . spreadsheets can be designed to add up the items/amounts on a bill , calculate sales tax , and even calculate income tax . a user can add and subtract the numbers here , even if the numbers are not next to each other . this means the computer does all the math , and people only need to give the correct information . another strength of spreadsheets , is that they can produce diagrams , like graphs and pie-charts , based on the data the user enters . sometimes the numbers make more sense when the computer turns them into a picture .
