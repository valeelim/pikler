Feistel cipher     in cryptography , a feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers , named after the german ibm cryptographer ; it is also commonly known as a feistel network . a large set of block ciphers use the scheme , including the data encryption standard ( des ) . the feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar , even identical in some cases , requiring only a reversal of the key schedule . therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved . feistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier . feistel networks and similar constructions are product ciphers , and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations , such as : - bit-shuffling ( often called permutation boxes or p-boxes ) - simple non-linear functions ( often called substitution boxes or s-boxes ) - linear mixing ( in the sense of modular algebra ) using xor
