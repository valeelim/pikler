Troy     troy was a city in north-west asia minor . it was the center of the trojan war , as told in eight long epic poems , six from the epic cycle , and two written by homer , the `` iliad '' and the `` odyssey '' . today it is the name of an archaeological site , the location of homeric troy , in hisarlik in anatolia , close to the seacoast in what is now Ã§anakkale province in northwest turkey , southwest of the dardanelles . unesco has listed the archaeological site of troy as a world heritage site . troy as seen in homer 's account is probably true in part . however , it is wrong to think his account is historically exact . with that warning , this is a summary of events leading up to the trojan war , mostly derived from the iliad . troy was a powerful kingdom in the mediterranean sea , and thrived under the long rule of king priam . his many sons , including the valiant , strong , unbeatable hector , and paris , a creative character who was not a strong fighter but a passionate man , are the best known in the troy myth .
