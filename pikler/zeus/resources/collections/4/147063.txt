British Rail Class 42     british railways ' ( br ) type 4 `` warship '' class diesel-hydraulic locomotives were introduced in 1958. it was apparent at that time that the largest centre of expertise on diesel-hydraulic locomotives was in germany . the western region of british railways ( in view of post-world war ii sensibilities ) negotiated a licence with german manufacturers to scale down the german federal railway 's `` v200 '' design to suit the smaller loading gauge of the british network , and to allow british manufacturers to construct the new design . the resultant design bears a close resemblance both cosmetically and in the engineering employed . they were divided into two batches : examples built at br 's swindon works were numbered in the series d800 to d832 and from d866 to d870 , had a maximum tractive effort of 52,400 pounds force and are the british rail class 42 of this article . 33 others , d833-865 , were constructed by the north british locomotive company and became british rail class 43. they were allocated to bristol bath road , plymouth laira , newton abbot and old oak common .
