Poison dart frog     poison dart frog is the common name of a group of frogs in the family dendrobatidae . they are native to central and south america . unlike most frogs , these are active during the day . they often have brightly-coloured bodies , which act as warning colouration . although all dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic in the wild , levels of toxicity vary greatly from one species to the next , and from one population to another . many species are critically endangered . blue poison dart frogs are poisonous because they eat ants and other small insects that have toxins in their bodies . if an animal eats the frog , it will become very sick . many poison dart frogs secrete alkaloid toxins through their skin . alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation , and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day . about 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs . the most toxic of poison dart frog species is `` phyllobates terribilis '' . it is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons , but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items , such as ants , centipedes and mites â€“ the diet-toxicity hypothesis . because of this , captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations . nonetheless , the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid-containing diet .
