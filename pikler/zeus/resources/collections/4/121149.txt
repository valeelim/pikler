Shyok River     the shyok river is a river flowing through disputed area ladakh and the northern areas of pakistan ( ghanche district ) . shyok river ( a tributary of the indus ) originates from the rimo glacier , one of the tongues of siachen glacier and becomes very wide at the confluence with the nubra river ( a tributary of shyok , originating from siachen glacier ) . the alignment of the shyok river is very unusual , originating from the rimo glacier it flows in a se direction and at joining the pangong range it takes a nw turn and flows parallel to its previous path . the shyok flowing in a wide valley suddenly enters a narrow gorge after chalunka and then joins the indus at skardu ( pakistan ) . the nubra river originating from the siachen glacier also behaves like the shyok , before tirit the se flowing river takes a nw turn on meeting the river shyok . the similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of palaeo fault lines trending nw-se in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers . the importance of the indus river and the shyok rivers is in the deposition of a huge thickness of quaternary sediments a treasure trove for geology researchers .
