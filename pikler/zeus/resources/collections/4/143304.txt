Axon     the axon is the part of a neuron that sends the signal . axons are long , thin and tendril-like . axons are much like a highly developed dendrite . the axon carries an electrical signal from the cell body ( soma ) to the synapse . there the signal passes to other neurons or to muscle fibers . an axon can be over a meter long in humans . or even longer in longer animals like elephants and whales . the electrical signal of an axon is made by ions that flow in and out of the cell in a chain reaction producing an electric impulse called an action potential . the speed at which the signal travels depends on how thick the axon is , and how much insulation it has . insulation is provided by specialized cells called myelin that wrap around the axon . together this insulation is called the myelin sheath . the axon was discovered by otto deiters .
