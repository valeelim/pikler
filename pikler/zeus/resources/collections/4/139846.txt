Chloroform     chloroform ( also called trichloromethane ) is a chemical substance . it is an organic compound . chloroform is one of the intermediate substances that occur in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene , better known as `` teflon '' . chloroform is used as a solvent . in the 19th century , it was a widely used anaesthetic . the first who reported to have produced chloroform was the french chemist eugène soubeiran , in 1831. soubeiran took acetone and ethanol , and used bleach powder for the reaction . the american physician samuel guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its `` deliciousness of flavor . '' independently , justus von liebig also described it . chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by jean-baptiste dumas . chloroform is produced by mixing methane and chlorine at a temperature of 400 to 500°c . in this reaction , the result is a mix of chloromethane , dichloromethane , trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane . the four compounds get then separated with a distillation .
