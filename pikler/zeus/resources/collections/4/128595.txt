Galois field     in abstract algebra , a finite field or galois field is a field that contains only finitely many elements . finite fields are important in number theory , algebraic geometry , galois theory , cryptography , and coding theory . the finite fields are completely known . finite fields were named galois fields to honor Ã©variste galois .
