Premature birth     premature birth is when a baby is born before the normal end of pregnancy . in humans , a pregnancy normally lasts for about nine months . on average , a pregnancy lasts for 266 days . babies who are born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy ( calculated from the last menstrual period ) are said to be `` premature '' . in the united states , about twelve percent of the babies are born prematurely ( that is about one in every eight babies ) . in 2003 , there were over 490,000 premature births . worldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to get . in developing countries , there is often no professional medical care for these babies . this makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was . for this reason , the world health organization tracks rates of low birth weight instead . in 2000 , 16.5 percent of babies born in developing countries were of low birth weight . it is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery . the risk of having a problem ( called a `` complication '' ) is higher in shorter pregnancies . babies born prematurely die more often in their first year of life than others . most such deaths occur in the first month of life , which is called `` neonatal mortality '' .
