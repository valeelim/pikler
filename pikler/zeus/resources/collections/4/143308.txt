Alessandro Volta     count alessandro giuseppe antonio anastasio volta ( 18 february 1745 â€“ 5 march 1827 ) was a lombard physicist known especially for the development of the first electrical cell in 1800. he was born in como in lombardy , italy . volta worked on the electrophorus that makes a static electric charge in 1775. volta also studied what we now call capacitance , developing separate means to study both electrical potential v and charge q , and discovering that for a given object they are proportional . this may be called volta 's law of capacitance , and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt . around 1791 he began to study `` animal electricity '' . in this way he discovered volta 's law of the electrochemical series , and the law that the electromotive force ( emf formula_1 ) of a galvanic cell . in 1800 , he invented the `` voltaic pile '' , an early electric battery , which made a steady electric current . it is credited as the first electrochemical cell . in honor of his work in the field of electricity , napoleon made him a count in 1810. a museum in como , the voltian temple , has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments . in 1881 , an important electrical unit , the volt ( v ) , was named in his honor . there have also been innovations and discoveries named after alessandro volta including the chevy volt , and the volta crater on the moon .
