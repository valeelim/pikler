MIT License     the mit license is a free software license that was created at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) . it is a permissive license , meaning that it allows programmers to put the code in proprietary software on the condition that the license is given with that software , and gpl-compatible , meaning that the gpl permits programmers to combine and redistribute it with software that uses the mit license . according to the free software foundation , the mit license is more accurately called the x11 license , since mit has used many licenses for software and the license was first written for the x window system . software that use the mit license include expat , putty , mono development platform class libraries , ruby on rails , cakephp , twisted , lua 5.0 onwards and the x window system , which the license was written for . some software are dual licensed under the mit license , such as older versions of the curl library , which allowed recipients to choose either the mozilla public license or the mit license .
