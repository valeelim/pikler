RC6     in cryptography , rc6 is a symmetric-key block cipher derived from rc5 . rc6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size , a variable key size , and a variable number of rounds . rc stands for `` rivest cipher '' , or alternatively , `` ron 's code '' . in 1997 , the nist announced a competition to choose a successor to data encryption standard ( des ) to be known as advanced encryption standard ( aes ) . rc6 was derived from rc5 to meet the competition requirements , and was selected as one of the `` five finalists '' of the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) competition , but was not selected as a standard . in order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels , rc6 allows choices for the block size : 32 bits ( for experimentation and evaluation purposes only ) , 64 bits ( for use as a replacement for des ) , and 128 bits ( intended for aes ) . the number of rounds can range from 0 to 255 , while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size . rc6 is very similar to rc5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel rc5 encryption processes . however , rc6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in rc5 and the use of four b/4-bit working registers ( see splitting of plaintext blocks in feistel cipher ) instead of two b/2-bit registers as in rc5 ( b is the block size ) . integer multiplication is used to increase the diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increased. < br > the reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for optimization on 32-bit cpus . the default block size of rc5 was 64 bits , while the default block size of the aes is 128 bits . rc5 has only two working registers . it uses 32-bit operations when dealing with 64-bit blocks and 64-bit operations when dealing with 128-bit blocks , so four working registers are required to build the aes architecture using only 32-bit operations .
