Acronis True Image     acronis true image is a program to make disk images . it is made by acronis . true image can create an image of a disk while it is running microsoft windows or linux , or offline by booting from cd/dvd , usb flash drives , pxe , or other bootable media . as a disk imaging solution , true image can restore the previously captured image to another disk , effectively replicating the structure and contents to the new disk , also allowing partition resizing if the new disk is of different capacity . file systems supported by software : - ntfs - fat16 - fat32 - ext2 - ext3 - reiserfs - reiser4 - linux swap in addition to the officially supported filesystems , acronis true image also provides raw sector backup and restore options for all other filesystems . 'raw ' mode provides support for a file system that is corrupt , or that is not officially supported , by capturing a complete image of all sectors on the disk . this method results in a larger image file as it is not able to compress , resize , or selectively restore files on the unrecognized filesystem .
