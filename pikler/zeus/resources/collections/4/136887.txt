Key space     in cryptography , the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible keys that can be used to initialize the cryptographic algorithm . for example , if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of 10 bits , then its key space is the set of all binary strings of length 10 bits ; i.e . we have key space of size 2 = 1024. to avoid attackers from guessing the key using a brute-force attack , the key space is usually designed to be very large . another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be `` flat '' , having no or very few weak keys . the block cipher rijndael/aes uses a key of up to 256 bits , resulting in a key space containing about 2 which is over 1.1579 Ã— 10 keys . this makes it `` computationally infeasible '' to check each possible key by brute force . in the des block cipher , a 56-bit key is used , resulting in a relatively small key space of size 2. the rot13 cipher is only designed to prevent people from accidentally reading messages ( e.g . movie plot details ) . as there is no key , the key space is therefore empty .
