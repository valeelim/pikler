Tritheism     tritheism is the belief that there are three distinct , powerful gods , who form a triad . generally three gods are believed to have separate powers and separate supreme beings or spheres of influence but working together . in this respect tritheism differs from dualism , which typically envisages two opposed divine powers in conflict with one another . ironically , there is no group that claims to believe in or teach tritheism ; the term is solely used as an accusation against others , somewhat similar to the usage of the word `` cult '' , in accusing a group of holding an alternate or distorted view of the christian doctrine of trinity . the main branches consider tritheism heretical .
