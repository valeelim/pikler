Flag of the United Kingdom     the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland uses as its national flag the royal banner known as the `` union flag '' or , popularly , `` union jack '' . the design today of the union flag comes from the union of ireland and great britain in 1801. it has the red cross of saint george ( patron saint of england ) , edged in white , on top of the cross of saint patrick ( patron saint of ireland ) , which are on the saltire of saint andrew ( patron saint of scotland ) . its correct measurements are 1:2 ( i.e . the bottom is twice as long as the sides ) . however , the british armed forces sometimes use a 3:5 version , where two of the red diagonals are cropped . the union jack has a legacy for flags , and some of the former colonies of britain have this design on their own flags ( i.e . australia , fiji , hawaii , some provinces of canada , etc . ) .
