Mercury-in-glass thermometer     the mercury-in-glass thermometer was invented by daniel gabriel fahrenheit in amsterdam ( 1714 ) . it is a bulb containing mercury attached to a glass tube of narrow diameter . the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb . the volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature . the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column up the tube . the space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure , a partial vacuum . mercury can not be used to measure temperatures lower than -39˚c ( as mercury freezes at that point ) or temperature higher than 356.7˚c ( the boiling point of mercury ) . mercury has been replaced largely by alcohol for use in thermometers , as alcohol is cheaper and safer than mercury .
