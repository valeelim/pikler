Bayreuth Festspielhaus     the bayreuth festspielhaus ( `` bayreuth festival theatre '' ) is an opera house in the town of bayreuth , germany . the german opera composer richard wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly . he had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed , and he thought that there was no opera house in germany that was good enough for performances of his operas . today it is still the place where every year there is a festival , the bayreuth festival , which is dedicated only to the operas of richard wagner . king ludwig ii of bavaria was a great admirer of richard wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built . wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted . work on the building started on 22 may 1872 ( wagner 's birthday ) , and it was ready four years later when , for the first time , all four operas which make up the cycle called `` der ring des nibelungen '' ( `` the ring of the nibelung '' ) , were performed .
