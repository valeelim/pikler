Dudipatsar Lake     dudiptsar lake or dudipat lake is a lake in pakistan . it is in the extreme north of kaghan valley . it is about a four-hour drive from the chief town naran . the word `` dudi '' means white and `` sar '' means lake . the lake was named because it reflects the white color of snow on the mountain peaks around it . the lake 's water is greenish blue and very cold . the lake used to have a lot of trout . now there are n't as many because of illegal fishing using dynamite and nets . this lake is very little visited by people . getting to the lake takes four to six hours of tough hiking and trekking . the earthquake on october 8 , 2005 in north pakistan made it more difficult to get to the lake . however , the government of pakistan decided on march 14 , 2006 to take all steps to restore tourism of the kaghan valley . that includes building new tourism spots and rebuilding previously destroyed ones . dudipatsar is close to another major lake , lake lulusar , which is the main contributory to the kunhar river that runs through kaghan valley . the whole area is private property but declared national park by government of pakistan .
