Thermocouple     thermocouple , tc for short , is a device that converts heat directly into electricity . a thermocouple can also work in reverse - using an electric current to transform into heat as well as cold . imagine that two wires made of different types of metal are connected at one end . if the junction of the two wires is heated , electricity will flow through the wire . electrons , when heated , will begin to cross the junction on their own . because of the different properties of the different metals , the electrons will lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy , just like a ball rolling over a hill to a lower area . although the voltage created by a thermocouple is very small ( in the millivolt range ) , many thermocouples can be hooked together to make a larger voltage . this is called a thermopile . thermocouples do not only generate electricity from heat . they can also generate heat from electricity , and even cold from electricity , as a refrigerator . if two different wires are connected at both ends , and some voltage source makes current flow through the loop , one junction will get hot and the other junction will become cold . the electrons at the hot junction are gaining kinetic energy as they cross the junction . this is why they make the metal hot . the electrons at the cold junction are losing kinetic energy as they cross the junction . this is why they make the junction cold .
