Free Software Foundation     the free software foundation ( fsf ) is a non-profit corporation founded by richard stallman on 4 october 1985 to support the free software movement , a movement which tries to promote the universal freedom to distribute and modify computer software without restriction . the fsf was started in the commonwealth of massachusetts , united states of america . from its founding ( when it started ) until the 1990s , fsf 's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the gnu project . since the mid-1990s , the fsf 's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community . the fsf holds the copyrights on many important pieces of the gnu system , such as the gcc . as a copyright holder , it has the power to enforce the gnu general public license ( gpl ) when copyright infringement occurs on that software . while other copyright holders of other software systems used the gpl as their license , fsf was the only organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software licensed under the gpl until harald welte created gpl-violations.org in 2004 .
