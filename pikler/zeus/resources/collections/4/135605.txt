Nation state     the nation state is a certain form of state that has a territory where mainly one nation is located . the state is a political entity ( the government , etc . ) ; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity . the term `` nation state '' means that the two are on the same territory , and this distinguishes the nation state from the other types of state , which existed before . clear examples of nation states include : - iceland : although the inhabitants are ethnically related to other scandinavian groups , the national culture and language are found only in iceland . there are no cross-border minorities— the nearest land is too far away . - japan : japan is also traditionally seen as a good example of a nation-state , although japan includes minorities of ethnically distinct ryūkyū peoples , koreans , chinese , and on the northern island of hokkaidō , the indigenous ainu minority ; see also japanese demographics . - portugal : although surrounded by other lands and people , the portuguese nation has occupied the same territory for almost 900 years . a long time ago , portugal was formed from groups of people that used to be separate . they all passed through and settled in the area that later became portugal . they include : native iberian peoples , celts , ancient mediterraneans ( greeks , phoenicians , romans ) , germanic peoples like the suebi and the visigoths , invading berbers and arabs , and jews .
