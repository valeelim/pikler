Weak key     in cryptography , a weak key is a key which when used with a specific cipher , makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way , and simplifies breaking ( cracking ) the ciphertext . weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall key space , which means that if someone generates a random key to encrypt a message , it is a rare condition that weak keys will cause a security problem . however , it is considered a good design for a cipher to have no weak keys ( `` quality chiper '' ) . a cipher with no weak keys is said to have a `` flat '' , or `` linear '' , key space . examples of 128-bits weak keys . - all zeros ( 0x0000000000000000 ) - all ones ( 0xffffffffffffffff ) - alternating '1 ' + '0 ' ( 0x0101010101010101 ) - alternating 'f ' + 'e ' ( 0xfefefefefefefefe ) - alternating 'e ' + '1 ' ( 0xe1e1e1e1f0f0f0f0 ) or ( 0x1e1e1e1e0f0f0f0f )
