Known-plaintext attack     the known-plaintext attack ( kpa ) is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext and its encrypted version ( known as ciphertext version ) then he can use them to expose further secret information after calculating the secret key . encrypted file archives such as zip are very prone to this attack . for example , an attacker with an encrypted zip file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the `` known-plaintext '' . then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive . classical ciphers are typically susceptible to known-plaintext attack . for example , a caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely . related pages . - chosen-plaintext attack - ciphertext-only attack
