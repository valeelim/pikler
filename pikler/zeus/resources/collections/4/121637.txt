The Royal Society     the royal society is a society for science and scientists . it was founded in 1660 by charles ii . it is the oldest society of its kind still in existence . a royal charter , on 15 july 1662 , created `` the royal society of london '' . lord brouncker was the first president , and robert hooke was curator of experiments . the reigning monarch has always been the patron of the royal society since its foundation . the motto of the royal society is `` nullius in verba '' ( latin : = nothing in words ) . this shows the society 's commitment to establishing scientific truth through experiment rather than by quoting authority . although this seems obvious today , the philosophical basis of the royal society differed from previous philosophies such as scholasticism , which established scientific truth based on deductive logic , concordance with divine providence and the citation of such ancient authorities as aristotle . the members of the society are called fellows of the royal society , and put the letters frs after their names . they are elected by existing fellows . all other posts , such as the secretary and president , are also by election .
