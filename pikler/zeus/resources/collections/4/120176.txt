Sahelanthropus     sahelanthropus tchadensis is a fossil hominid . from evidence at the fossil site in chad in the african sahel , it is thought to have lived about 7 million years ago . the split of the line into humans and chimpanzees ( known as `` human-chimpanzee divergence '' ) probably happened between 6.3 and 5.4 million years ago . this can be seen from genetic data . because the fossil is older than this spilt , its status is unclear . the first fossil found is known as `` touma誰 '' today . some fossils , a cranium ( skull ) , five pieces of jaw , and some teeth , make up a head that has features that are like both modern and primitive humans . the braincase is only 340 cm続 to 360 cm続 in volume , about the same as chimpanzees . it is much less than the human volume of about 1350 cm続 . the teeth and structure of the face are very different from homo sapiens . the cranium found is damaged , it is very distorted , so no 3d computer reconstruction has been made . there are no bones other than parts of the skull . it is unknown if `` sahelanthropus tchadensis '' was bipedal ( walked on two legs ) . the placement of the foramen magnum suggests they were , though . its canine wear is similar to other miocene apes .
