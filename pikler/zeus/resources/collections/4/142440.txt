Griffith's experiment    griffith 's experiment griffith 's experiment , was an experiment done in 1928 by frederick griffith . it was one of the first experiments showing that bacteria can get dna through a process called transformation . griffith used two strains of `` pneumococcus '' . these bacteria infect mice . he used a type iii-s ( smooth ) and type ii-r ( rough ) strain . the iii-s strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host 's immune system . this means that the host will die . the ii-r strain does not have that protective shield around it and is killed by the host 's immune system . in this experiment , bacteria from the iii-s strain were killed by heat , and their remains were added to ii-r strain bacteria . while neither harmed the mice on their own , the blend of the two was able to kill mice . griffith was also able to get both live ii-r and live iii-s strains of `` pneumococcus '' from the blood of these dead mice . he concluded that the type ii-r had been `` transformed '' into the lethal iii-s strain by a `` transforming principle '' that was somehow part of the dead iii-s strain bacteria .
