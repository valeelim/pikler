Fire triangle     the fire triangle is used to show the rule that a fire needs three things to burn . these things are heat , fuel , and oxygen . if one of these three is removed , the fire will be put out . in the middle of the fire triangle there is also a chemical reaction . without heat , a fire can not begin . if fire becomes cool enough , it will not keep burning . heat can be removed by using water . this only works on some types of fire . separating burning fuels from each other can also reduce the heat . in forest fires , burning logs are separated and placed into safe areas where there is no other fuel . turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the heat source , but other fuels may have caught fire . they will continue burning until the firefighters deal with them and their fire triangles . without oxygen , a fire can not start . oxygen may be removed from a fire by covering it in some way . some foams and heavy gases ( for example , carbon dioxide ) are often used for this . the fire can also be closed off away from a source of oxygen . once all the oxygen in the closed off area is used by the fire , it will go out if it can not get more oxygen because it needs oxygen .
