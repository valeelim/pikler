Jirga     a jirga ( sometimes spelt jirgah ) ( pashto / ) is a tribal meeting of elders . the meeting makes decisions by consensus . it is mainly the pashtun people who have theses meetings - but other people who live near the pashtun also have these meetings to settle disputes . they are most common in afghanistan and among the pashtun in pakistan near its border with afghanistan . the meeting is usually made to help solve a dispute between two people . the people involved in a dispute usually begin by finding a mediator , choosing someone who is trusted to fairly solve the problem . the mediator can be a religious leader , a local notable , or someone who is known for helping to settle disputes . the mediator hears from the two sides , and then forms a jirga of community elders , taking care to include supporters of both sides . after listening to both sides the jirga then comes to a decision . when the decision has been made the mediator then announces it . the jirga 's decision has to be accepted .
