Kakapo     the kakapo ( `` strigops habroptilus '' ) is the only parrot which can not fly . it lived in grassland , scrubland and coastal regions of new zealand , but is now so rare they can only be seen on protected offshore islands . kakapo means 'night parrot ' in the maori language . kakapos are most active at night ( nocturnal ) , and like to be alone . to keep other kakapos out of their territory , they make a 'skraaarking ' sound . the kakapo can live for about 60 years . kakapo are herbivores . they eat roots , seeds , leaves , bugs , small pine cones , fruit , and flowers . unlike other parrots , male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound . there are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid . the eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree . the female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks . she only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food . kakapo had no natural enemies on the islands of new zealand were they live , and lost the ability to fly . at one time there were many kakapo . now only about 150 kakapo still live in new zealand . it is a critically endangered species . the decrease in the number of kakapo is mostly from predatory animals ( for example , cats , dogs , stoats , ferrets , and rats ) that settlers brought with them to new zealand . the kakapo was also eaten by maori and european settlers .
