OpenOffice Calc     openoffice calc is the spreadsheet part of the openoffice software package . calc is similar to microsoft excel , with almost the same abilities . calc is capable of opening and saving spreadsheets in microsoft excel 's file format . it provides a number of features not present in excel , including a system which automatically defines a series for graphing based on the layout of the user 's data . calc is also capable of writing spreadsheets directly as pdf files . the default file format for openoffice calc version 2.x or 3.x can be set to either microsoft excel 's native file format or the open document format ( odf ) . calc also supports a wide range of other file formats , for both opening and saving files . just like the entire openoffice package , calc can be used on many operating systems , including mac os x , microsoft windows , linux , freebsd and solaris . available under the apache license , calc is free software . calc can store a maximum of 65,536 rows with 1024 columns in each sheet , with a maximum of 256 sheets . there is a way to increase these limits , but it is only suitable for odf and text-based formats , as there is a risk of data turning unusable for binary formats such as microsoft excel 's file format .
