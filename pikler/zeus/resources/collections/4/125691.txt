Yasin Valley     the yasin valley is a high mountain valley in the hindu kush mountains , in the northwest region of gilgit in the northern areas of pakistan . yasin is separated from the ishkoman valley by a high mountain pass . to reach yasin one must take the karakoram highway north from islamabad , and then turn left to reach gupis in ghizar . after gupis , one continues northwest to reach the yasin valley . yasin valley has a spectacular natural beauty . yasin was originally ruled by the khushwakhte dynasty , a collateral line of the katur dynasty of chitral . the rajas of yasin were great warriors and fought against the sikhs and the dogras of kashmir , but this house eventually lost power and the ownership of yasin changed hands several times between the rule of the mehtar of chitral , and the maharaja of kashmir . although not highly or densely populated , yasin was of strategic importance because it leads to a high mountain pass , to yarkhun in chitral , and then to broghol pass , the wakhan corridor of afghanistan , and into tajikistan . thus , yasin could have formed an invasion route from czarist russia into british india .
