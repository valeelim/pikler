Abnormal psychology     abnormal psychology is a part of psychology . people who study abnormal psychology are psychologists . they are scientists that investigate the mind using the scientific method . different cultures tend to have different ideas of how strange ( abnormal ) any behaviour is considered . this tends to change over time within cultures , so people that live in a country at one time in history might consider abnormal what people who live in the same country consider normal years before before or years later . abnormal psychology is often used to understand or to treat people with mental disorders to make life better for them . this is because abnormal behaviour is often defined as when someone is not able to change how they behave to fit different settings . this is often also used to define some mental disorders . when someone can not change their behaviour to fit the people and situations around them when they need to , it can cause suffering , and the person may be uncomfortable when around people . their behaviour can be unreasonable and hard to understand . their behaviour can even be dangerous .
