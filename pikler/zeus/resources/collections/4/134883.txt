Flag of Hawaii     the flag of hawaii ( hawaiian : ka hae hawai ªi ) is the official flag of hawaii as a u.s. state , as it was kingdom , protector government , republic , and territory . it is the only state flag of the united states to have the union flag of the united kingdom on it . the field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands . a ninth stripe was once shown , meaning the island of nihoa . the color of the stripes , from the top down , has this pattern : white , red , blue , white , red , blue , white , red . the colors were standardized in 1843 , although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used . there are a lot of reasons for the earliest history of the flag of hawaii . one said how king kamehameha i flew a british flag , given to him by british explorer captain george vancouver as a token of friendship with king george iii . other visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor . an adviser to kamehameha noted that the union flag could draw hawaii into international problems as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the united kingdom , and he quickly lowered the union flag over his home . while argued as historically correct , one report of events that followed stated that in order to please american interests during the war of 1812 , a flag of the united states was raised over kamehameha 's home only to be removed when british officers in the court of kamehameha powerfully objected to it . this account then explains why the resulting flag of hawaii was a deliberate combination of the two nations ' flags .
