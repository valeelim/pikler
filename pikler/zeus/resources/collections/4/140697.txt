Child pornography     child pornography is material showing children in erotic poses or having sex . it is usually graphic material in the form of drawings , photographs or video , but can be in writing as well . child pornography that involves real children is a record of child sexual abuse . usually , these children are shown or described as being in different stages of undress , with some clothes off , or completely naked . child sexual abuse happens in different ways in the making of child pornography , with the most critical way being the actual molestation . another way is that , when the act is captured with a camera it makes the abuse worse for the child , just knowing that the event is being recorded for possible future abuse – including extortion ( blackmailing ) and sharing , out of the victim 's control . linked to that is many of the reasons to why that recording is then – in itself – seen as abuse . one important part of those reasons , is that the recording makes the abuse possible to go on even longer than the direct damage upon the child ,
