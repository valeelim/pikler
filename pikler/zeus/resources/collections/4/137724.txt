MacGuffin (cipher)    macguffin ( cipher ) in cryptography , macguffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by bruce schneier and matt blaze at a fast software encryption workshop . it was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure , known as generalized unbalanced feistel networks ( gufns ) . schneier and blaze based macguffin on des , their main change was spliting the des 64 bits data block into two unequal halves in the feistel network , 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function , whose output is xored with the other 16 bits of the data block . macguffin 's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself . since macguffin is a feistel network , decryption is easy ; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse . the algorithm was experimental , intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced feistel networks . the cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly , so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by vincent rijmen and bart preneel . they also tried attacking macguffin with different s-boxes , taken directly from des . this version was slightly stronger .
