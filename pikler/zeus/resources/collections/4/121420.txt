Scottish Fold     the scottish fold ( sometimes called coupari by canadian breeders ) is a breed of cat . its distinctive ear fold is caused by a particular gene . first known as flops , for their `` floppy '' ears , scottish fold became the breed 's name in 1966. scottish folds with long hair are known by a number of names . for example , it is called the highland fold by the acfa , aace , and ufo ; the scottish fold longhair by the tica , ncfa , aca , cca , and cfa ; and the longhair fold by the cff . the very first scottish fold was a long-haired barn cat with white fur , called susie . she was found in 1961 at a farm near coupar angus in perthshire , scotland . susie 's ears had an unusual fold in the middle , making her look like an owl . when susie had kittens , two of them were born with the distinctive folded ears . one was owned by william ross , a nearby farmer and cat-lover . ross registered the breed with the governing council of the cat fancy in great britain and started to breed scottish fold kittens with the help of pat turner . the breeding program ended up with 76 kittens in the first three years , 42 with folded ears . they suspected that the ear mutation was from a dominant allele . this means that if one parent has straight ears , and one parent has folded ears , half of the kittens will be folds .
