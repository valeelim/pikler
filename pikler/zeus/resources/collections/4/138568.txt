Embedded system     an embedded system is a computer that has been built to solve only a few very specific problems and is not easily changed . in contrast , a general-purpose computer can do many different jobs , and can be changed at any time with new programs for new jobs . an embedded a computer , often there is no keyboard or monitor or mouse . but like any computer it has a processor and software , input and output . the word `` embedded '' means it is built into the system . it is a permanent part in a bigger system . for example , the controller embedded in an elevator tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors , based on buttons that are pushed . a decoder is embedded in a satellite television set-top box to read a signal from the dish and send something that a tv understands . often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time . this is called real-time computing . if a set-top box got interrupted to do another task , you would see a bad picture on the tv , for example . a general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else , it is not real-time .
