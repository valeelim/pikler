NOT gate     a not gate ( also often called inverter ) is a logic gate . each not gate has only one input signal . logically with not gates , the input and the output swap , so if you input `` 1 '' it outputs as `` 0 '' ; likewise if you input `` 0 '' it outputs as `` 1 '' . generally , actual not gates with a voltage below 0.5v is `` 0 '' , and a voltage of 4â€“5v is `` 1 '' . the inverter can be made of a discrete transistor with other components , or several inverters may be packaged in an integrated circuit . there are three symbols for the not gate : other websites . - the not gate on all about circuits
