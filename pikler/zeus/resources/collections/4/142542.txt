Galvanometer     a galvanometer is a type of ammeter . it is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current . it is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection , through a limited arc , in response to electric current flowing through its coil . the term has been expanded to , include uses of the same mechanism in recording , positioning , and servomechanism equipment . the most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument , often called a meter . it is used to measure the direct current ( flow of electric charge ) through an electric circuit . the d'arsonval/weston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet . the coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale . a tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position . when a direct current ( dc ) flows through the coil , the coil generates a magnetic field . this field acts against the permanent magnet . the coil twists , pushing against the spring , and moves the pointer . the hand points at a scale indicating the electric current . careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform , so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current . a useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer , so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation .
