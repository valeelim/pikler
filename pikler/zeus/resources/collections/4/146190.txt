Dirty paper coding     in telecommunications , dirty paper coding ( dpc ) is a good way to send digital data through a channel that is subject to some interference that is known to the sender . the sender does precoding of the data so as to cancel the effect of the interference . costa asked the following question : when costa asked his question , the shannon–hartley theorem ( and the more general noisy-channel coding theorem ) was well known . the shannon–hartley theorem tells us that , all else being equal , a paper sent along a path that picks up less dirt can reliably deliver more information than another paper sent along a path that picks up more dirt . people have also thought up many ways of dealing with such dirt added after the message is written—see error detection and correction for details . most people expected that the same thing would happen when dirt is added to the paper before the message was written—the more dirt , the less information can be reliably sent . in 1983 , costa showed the surprising result that we can send just as much information on such a dirty piece of paper as we can when writing on a clean sheet of paper , and gave a way to get that capacity .
