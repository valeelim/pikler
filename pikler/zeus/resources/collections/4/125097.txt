Flying disc     a flying disc is a flat round object with a thick rim . the rim make the disc easier to grip and throw , and also keeps the disc from turning over as it flies . detailed throwing instructions are below , but the basic goal is to throw the disc while also making the disc spin . also mentioned below is a flying ring , made under the brand name aerobie . although these designs are very different , they both use air resistance in the same way to fly . unlike the aerobie , flying discs are used in both ultimate frisbee and disc golf . the frisbee brand of flying disc is rarely used in official competition in either game , which is why the team sport of ultimate frisbee is officially called simply `` ultimate . '' still , as `` kleenex '' was once a word used to mean `` facial tissue , '' `` frisbee '' is still broadly used as a synonym for a flying disc . the aerobie superdisk is an alternative design of flying disc that , although somewhat differently shaped , still has very similar properties to the conventional disc . it has less air resistance . because there is less resistance to motion , the aerobie discs can fly farther than the conventional disc . the aerobie flying ring has minimal drag and holds the world record for the longest flight by a human-thrown projectile . however , due to the lack of a rim , the aerobie is less suited to angled , curved flights and air-bouncing .
