Native Command Queuing     native command queuing ( ncq ) is a technology designed to increase performance of sata hard disks on computers . it can do this under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which it executes the read and write requests it received . this can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement and resulting in better performance ( and slightly decreased wear of the drive ) for workloads where multiple read/write requests are outstanding at the same time . this situation most often occurs in server-type applications . however , the current ( as of 2004 ) technology actually slows down hd access in certain applications , like games and sequential reads and writes , because of the added latency induced by ncq logic . native command queuing was preceded by parallel ata 's version of tagged command queuing ( tcq ) . ata 's attempt at integrating tcq was constrained by the requirement that ata host bus adapters use isa bus device protocols to interact with the operating system . the resulting high cpu overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for tcq .
