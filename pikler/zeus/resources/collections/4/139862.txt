Floating point unit     a floating point unit ( fpu ) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers . typical operations are addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , and square root . some systems can also perform more advanced functions as exponential or trigonometric functions calculations , however in most modern processors these functions are done with software library routines , not by hardware . in most modern general purpose cpus , one or more fpus are integrated inside the cpu ; however many embedded microcontrollers , especially older designs , do not have hardware support for floating point operations . in the past , some systems as the intel 8086 have implemented floating point via a coprocessor that is controlled by the cpu rather than as an integrated unit . most modern computers have integrated fpu hardware ; but not all . in the absence of an fpu , many fpu functions can be emulated , which saves the added hardware cost of an fpu but is significantly slower .
