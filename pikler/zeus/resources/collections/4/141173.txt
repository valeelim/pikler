RC5     in cryptography , rc5 is a simple symmetric-key block cipher . designed by ronald rivest in 1994 , rc5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size , a variable key size , and a variable number of rounds . `` rc '' stands for `` rivest cipher '' , or alternatively , `` ron 's code '' . in order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels ; rc5 has a variable block size ( 32 , 64 or 128 bits ) , variable key size ( 0 to 2040 bits ) and variable number of rounds ( 0 to 255 ) . the original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits , a 128-bit key and 12 rounds . a key feature of rc5 is the use of data-dependent rotations ; one of the goals of rc5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive . rc5 also consists of a number of modular additions and exclusive or ( xor ) s. the general structure of the algorithm is a feistel-like network . the encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code . the key schedule , however , is more complex , expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of `` nothing up my sleeve numbers '' . the simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made rc5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts .
