Tiktaalik     tiktaalik is a genus of extinct fish . this sarcopterygian ( lobe-finned ) fish from the later devonian has many features similar to those of tetrapods ( four-legged animals ) . `` tiktaalik '' lived about 375 million years ago . it is part of the transition between fish such as `` panderichthys '' , known from fossils 380 million years old , and early tetrapods such as `` acanthostega '' and `` ichthyostega '' , known from fossils about 365 million years old . its mixture of basal fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers , neil shubin , to call `` tiktaalik '' a 'fishapod ' . this , and other species like it , prove that legs started to develop before these animals were land-based . they were shallow-water carnivorous fish , or fishapods . `` tiktaalik '' was therefore a transitional fossil , and an example of mosaic evolution . related pages . - tetrapod
