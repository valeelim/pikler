Siamang     the siamang ( `` symphalangus syndactylus '' ) is a tailless , black furred gibbon native to the forests of malaysia , thailand , and sumatra . it lives in trees , that 's why it is called arboreal . the siamang is the largest of the lesser apes . it can grow to be twice the size of other gibbons . siamangs grow to about 1 m in height , and weigh up to 23 kg . the siamang is the only species in the genus symphalangus . the siamang is different form other gibbons . in siamangs , two fingers on each hand are fused together , that 's where the name `` syndactylus '' is from . siamangs have large `` gular sacs '' . these can be found in both males and females . the gular sac is a throat pouch that can be inflated to the size of its head . this allows the siamang to make loud resonating calls or songs . there may be two subspecies of the siamang . if so , they are the nominate sumatran siamang ( `` s. s. syndactylus '' ) and the malaysian siamang ( `` s. s. continentis '' , in peninsular malaysia ) . otherwise , the malaysian individuals are only a population . the siamang is the only gibbon which occurs sympatrically with other gibbons ; its two ranges are entirely within the combined ranges of the agile gibbon and the lar gibbon .
