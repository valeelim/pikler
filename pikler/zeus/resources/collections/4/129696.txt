Interstate 82     interstate 82 ( sometimes called i-82 ) is a long interstate highway in the states of washington and oregon . the road goes from interstate 90 and u.s. route 97 in ellensburg , washington southeast through yakima , washington , the tri-cities of washington , and umatilla , oregon before ending at interstate 84 in hermiston , oregon . since i-82 is north of interstate 84 , it breaks the rules for interstate numbering . this happened because when interstate 80n was renumbered to interstate 84 in 1980 , interstate 82 became north of interstate 84. the renumbering was part of a project to remove interstates that have letters within their numbers . the highway goes over selah creek on a bridge called the fred g. redmon bridge . when this bridge was opened on november 2 , 1971 it was the longest concrete arch bridge in north america . the bridge is 549 feet long when it goes above the creek . in 1999 , the state of oregon wanted to make interstate 82 longer . they planned three different roads , but all of them were not chosen . the freeway also has a spur route , interstate 182 , which connects interstate 82 to richland , washington and pasco , washington .
