Director of Central Intelligence     the office of united states director of central intelligence ( dci ) was established by u.s. president harry truman on january 23 1946 with admiral sidney souers occupying the position . the dci was coordinating intelligence activities among and between the various united states intelligence agencies , also called the american intelligence community . until april 2005 , the dci also served as de-facto director of the central intelligence agency and was often referred to colloquially as the `` cia director . '' after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and the subsequent investigation by the 9/11 commission , a movement grew to re-organize the intelligence community . that movement prompted the creation , on april 21 , 2005 , of the office of the director of national intelligence ( dni ) , in whose purview was the job portfolio that had been performed previously by the director of central intelligence . the latter position then ceased to exist .
