Life expectancy     life expectancy is how long a person is expected to live . it is based on many factors such as country and life style including smoking , diet , and exercise . there are great changes in life expectancy between different parts of the world , mostly caused by differences in public health , medical care and diet . much of the excess mortality ( higher death rates ) in poorer nations is due to war , not enough food , and medical conditions or diseases ( aids , malaria , etc. ) . over the past 200 years , countries with black or african populations have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by other peoples . even in countries with a majority of white people , such as usa , britain , ireland and france , black people tend to have shorter life expectancies than their white counterparts ( although the statistics are often not analysed by race ) . for example , in the u.s. white americans are expected to live until age 78 , but african americans only until age 71 .
