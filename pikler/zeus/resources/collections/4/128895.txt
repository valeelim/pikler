Interference     in physics , interference is the effect of wave functions . a single wave can interfere with itself , but this is still an addition of two waves ( see young 's slits experiment ) . two waves always interfere , even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable . something that happens when two or more waves are in the same space . sometimes the peak of one wave joins with the peak of another wave , so the resulting peak is twice as high . sometimes the peak of one wave falls into the trough of another wave , and the surface is then flat . when waves add their effects , it is called positive interference , or constructive interference . when one wave subtracts from the effects of the other , it is called negative interference , or destructive interference . if two people pushed on a car in the same direction , they would move the car better than either one alone . that would be positive interference . if two people of equal strength pushed the car from opposite directions , then it would not be moved by either of them . that would be negative interference .
