Diffie-Hellman key exchange     the diffie-hellman key exchange is a way for people to secretly share information . when two people want to use cryptography , they often only have an insecure channel to exchange information . martin hellman , whitfield diffie and ralph merkle developed a protocol that allows this information exchange over an insecure channel . the resulting protocol has become known as diffie-hellman key exchange . sometimes it is called diffie-hellman key agreement , diffie-hellman key establishment , diffie-hellman key negotiation or exponential key exchange . using this protocol , both parties agree on a secret key . they use this key to encrypt their communication using a symmetric-key cipher . the scheme was first published by whitfield diffie and martin hellman in 1976. diffie-hellman key agreement itself is an `` anonymous '' ( non- '' authenticated '' ) key-agreement protocol , it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols , and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in transport layer security 's short-lived modes .
