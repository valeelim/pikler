Session key     a session key is a single-use symmetric key used for encrypting all messages in one communication session . a closely related term is traffic encryption key or tek , which refers to any symmetric key that is used to encrypt traffic messages . typically teks are changed frequently , in some systems daily and in others for every message . session keys introduce complexities in a cryptosystem . however , they also help with some real problems , which is why they are used . there are two primary reasons for using session keys : - first , several cryptanalytic attacks are made easier as more ciphertext encrypted with a specific key is available . by limiting the number of messages encrypted using a single key , those attacks are made more difficult . - second , many otherwise good encryption algorithms require that keys be distributed securely before encryption can be used . all symmetric secret key algorithms have this undesirable property . there are other algorithms which do n't require secure distribution of secret keys , but they are too slow to be practical for encrypting long messages ( see public-key cryptography ) . by using one of these `` asymmetric '' algorithms to distribute an encrypted secret key for another , faster , symmetric-key algorithm , it 's possible to improve overall performance considerably .
