Java Virtual Machine     a java virtual machine ( jvm ) is a set of computer software programs and data structures which use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts . the model used by a jvm accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as java bytecode . java virtual machines operate on java bytecode , which is normally ( but not necessarily ) generated from java source code ; a jvm can also be used to implement programming languages other than java . the jvm is an important component of the java platform . because jvms are available for many hardware and software platforms , java can be both middleware and a platform in its own right â€“ hence the expression `` write once , run anywhere . '' the use of the same bytecode for all platforms allows java to be described as `` compile once , run anywhere '' , as opposed to `` write once , compile anywhere '' , which describes cross-platform compiled languages . references . - `` clarifications and amendments to the java virtual machine specification , second edition '' includes list of changes to be made to support j2se 5.0 and jsr 45
