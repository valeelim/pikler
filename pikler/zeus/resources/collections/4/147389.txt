Light rail     light rail or light rail transit ( lrt ) is a form of urban rail public transportation . generally it can carry less people and has a lower speed than heavy rail/metro systems , but it can carry more people and has a higher speed than street-running tram systems . the term is normally used to refer to rail systems with rapid transit-style features that usually use electric rail cars operating mostly in private rights-of-way separated from other traffic but sometimes , if necessary , mixed with other traffic in city streets . modern light rail technology is highly flexible in how it can be used , and whether any given system is considered a true rapid transit system or not depends on its implementation . related pages . - rapid transit - subway - tram
