Red giant     a red giant is a giant star that weighs about one-half to ten times as much as our sun . red giants get their name because they appear to be colored red and they are very large . many red giants could fit thousands and thousands of suns like ours inside of them . aldebaran , arcturus , betelgeuse and mira are red giants . right now , our sun is a main-sequence star , not a red giant . however , five billion years from now , scientists believe our sun will become a red giant . it will be about 200 times wider than it is now . it will become so big it will swallow up mercury , venus and possibly the earth . all new stars change hydrogen to helium through nuclear fusion . this makes a lot of energy ( e.g . light and heat ) . in a normal star , like our sun and all other main-sequence stars , this change happens at the very center of the star . sooner or later , almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium . this causes the nuclear reaction to stop . the center will start to get smaller due to the star 's gravity . this makes the layer just outside the center get hotter . this layer still has hydrogen . this hydrogen will fuse to make helium .
