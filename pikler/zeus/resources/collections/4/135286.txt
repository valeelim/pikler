Chang'an     chang'an was the capital of ancient china of more than ten dynasties in chinese history . chang'an literally means `` perpetual peace '' in classical chinese . during the xin dynasty , the city was renamed `` constant peace '' ; yet after its fall in the year 23 ad , the old name was restored . during the ming dynasty , the name was changed to its present name xi'an , meaning `` western peace '' . the imperial city of chang'an during the han dynasty was in northwest of today 's xi'an . during the tang dynasty , the area to be known as chang'an included the area inside the ming xi'an fortification , plus some small areas to its east and west , and a major part of its southern suburbs . the tang chang'an was 8 times the size of the ming xi'an . during this time chang'an was one of the largest and most populous cities in the world . around 750 a.d. chang'an was called a `` million people 's city '' in chinese records , while modern estimates put it at around 800,000–1,000,000 within city walls . in 710 , the grid of japan 's capital city at heijō-kyō was planned to mirror the grid of chang'an . in 794 , the plan of the new capital at heian-kyō also mirrored the chang'an design .
