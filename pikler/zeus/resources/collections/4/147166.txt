British Rail Class 85     the british rail class 85 is an electric locomotive built during the early 1960s , as part of br 's policy to develop a standard electric locomotive . five prototype classes ( 81-85 ) were built and evaluated , which eventually led to the development of the class 86 locomotive . the locomotives of class 85 were originally fitted with germanium rectifiers which were eventually replaced by silicon rectifiers . forty of these locomotives were built from 1961-64 by br at doncaster works . the class were used to haul trains on the then newly electrified west coast main line , from birmingham , to crewe , manchester piccadilly , liverpool and later preston . by 1965 , electrification had spread south to london euston . under the earlier br classification , the type was given the designation al5 ( meaning the 5th design of 25 kv ac locomotive ) , and locomotives were numbered e3056-e3095 . in 1968 , this was changed to class 85 , when br introduced a new computer numbering system . from 1971 onwards , locomotives were progressively renumbered into the 85001-040 series . fifteen locomotives were converted for freight only use , numbered in the 85/1 series . these locomotives were restricted to 80 mph .
