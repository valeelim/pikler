Simultaneous multithreading     simultaneous multithreading , acronym smt , is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar cpus with hardware multithreading . smt permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern computer architectures . multithreading is similar in concept to multitasking but is implemented at the thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors . in processor design , there are two ways to increase on-chip parallelism with less resource requirements : 1. superscalar technique : which tries to increase instruction level parallelism ( ilp ) by executing multiple instructions at the same time ( termed : simultaneously ) ; by `` simultaneously '' dispatching instructions ( termed : instruction dispatching ) to multiple redundant execution units built inside the processor . 1. chip-level multithreading ( cmt ) technique : using thread level parallelism ( tlp ) in order to executes instructions from multiple threads within one processor chip at the same time .
