The Final Cut (album)    the final cut ( album ) the final cut is the twelfth studio album by pink floyd . it was recorded at various studios in the uk from july to december 1982. it is the final pink floyd studio album with the band 's bassist and primary songwriter roger waters . the album is predominantly the work of waters . it is the only pink floyd album on which the credit for writing every song is given to waters alone . keyboardist rick wright had been fired by waters during the recording of `` the wall '' , so this is the only pink floyd album on which wright does not participate at all . meanwhile , david gilmour sings lead vocals on only one of the album 's twelve songs , the rest being sung entirely by waters . during the recording of `` the final cut '' , there was a lot of tension between waters and the other members of the band , particularly gilmour , who now says that he does n't like most of the album . for these and other reasons , it is sometimes regarded as a roger waters solo album rather than a true pink floyd album .
