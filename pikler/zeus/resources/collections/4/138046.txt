Ordered pair     in mathematics , an `` ordered pair '' is a collection of two objects , where one of the objects is first ( the `` first coordinate '' or `` left projection '' ) , and the other is second ( the `` second coordinate '' or `` right projection '' ) . an ordered pair where the first coordinate is formula_1 and the second coordinate is formula_2 is usually written formula_3 ( sometimes it is written formula_4 ) . if formula_1 is different from formula_2 , then the ordered pair formula_3 is different from the ordered pair formula_8 - this is why it is called `` ordered '' . if formula_9 and formula_10 are two ordered pairs , then the `` characteristic '' or `` defining '' property of ordered pairs is : this means that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if : the first coordinates of the pairs are equal , and also the second coordinates of the pairs are equal . there are many mathematical definitions of `` ordered pair '' which have this property . the definition given here is the most common one : kazimierz kuratowski was the first person to make this definition .
