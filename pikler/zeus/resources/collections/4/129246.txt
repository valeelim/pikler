KWord     kword is a free word processor , a part of the koffice project and of the k desktop environment . the text-layout scheme in kword is based on frames , making it look like adobe framemaker . these can be placed anywhere on the page , and can include text , graphics and embedded objects . each new page is a new frame , but the text is able to flow through kword â€™ s ability to link frames together . the use of frames means that complex graphical layouts can be achieved easily in kword . kword was created as part of the koffice project in 1998 using some ideas from framemaker such as the frames approach . the first author said that the application and its code were not the best since it was his first object-oriented application . in 2000 the kword application was created in a way that made it very hard to fix problems and nobody was working on the problems anymore . there had not been any official release of the application in all this time . in the same year a new maintainer started working on the application and over the duration of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 they worked to fix any problems in the code of the application .
