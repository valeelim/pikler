Zeroth law of thermodynamics     the zeroth law of thermodynamics says that if a change to the temperature ( t ) from one object ( for example 'a ' ) changes the temperature of another object ( 'b ' ) , and a change to the temperature of 'b ' changes the temperature of 'c ' ( a third object ) , then a change to the temperature of 'a ' will mean a change to the temperature of 'c ' . heat naturally flows from areas that are hot to areas that are cold . more simply : it is called the zeroth ( 0 ) law of thermodynamics because it was discovered after the others , but people thought it was more important so they wanted to give it a number before the other laws . other pages . - first law of thermodynamics - second law of thermodynamics - third law of thermodynamics
