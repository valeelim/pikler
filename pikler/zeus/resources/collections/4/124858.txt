Pakistan Movement     the pakistan movement ( also called tehrik-e-pakistan , ) was a political movement which was active during the first half of the 20th century . at that time , british india belonged to great britain . in british india , most people were hindu , and only very few were muslim . the people who made the movement feared they would lose their liberty when the english left . they therefore wanted to create a separate state . this struggle was organised by the all india muslim league party and resulted in the partition of the british empire in india . the movement was led by quaid-e-azam muhammad ali jinnah . other important leaders were nawab muhammad ismail khan , raja amir ahmed khan of mahmudabad , sir sikandar hayat khan , nawabzada liaquat ali khan , fatimah jinnah , amjadi bano begum , sir abdullah haroon , khawaja nazimuddin , huseyn shaheed suhrawardy , sardar shaukat hayat khan , chaudhry khaliquzzaman , a.k . fazlul huq , aurangzeb khan , qazi muhammad isa and abdur rab nishtar the first person who had the idea of a separate state was not allama iqbal as is reckoned generally . he only forwarded the theory onwards in his speech in 1930. it was a prevailing idea that has its origins in united provinces of indian . people like sir syed ahmed khan and others had thought about a separate state there much earlier . from 1901 onwards , many other muslim scholars had also been proposing the idea of a separate muslim state within the subcontinent.choudhary rahmat ali later proposed the name pakistan in his pakistan declaration in 1933. people like muhammad ali jinnah maintained their belief in religious unity . religious hostilities between hindus and muslims gave the movement a stronger backing .
