Keystream     in cryptography , a keystream is a stream of random or pseudorandom characters that are combined with a plaintext message to produce an encrypted message ( the ciphertext ) . the `` characters '' in the keystream can be bits , bytes , numbers or actual characters like a-z depending on the usage case . usually each character in the keystream is either added , subtracted or xored with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext , using modular arithmetic . keystreams are used in the one-time pad cipher and in most stream ciphers . block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams . for example , the ctr mode ( also known as integer counter mode ( icm ) ) is a block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher . in this simple example we will use only the english alphabet of 26 characters from a-z , therefore we will not encrypt numbers , commas , spaces and other symbols . as we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25 .
