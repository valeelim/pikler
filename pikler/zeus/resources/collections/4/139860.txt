Arithmetic logic unit     in computing , an arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations . the alu is a basic building block of the central processing unit ( cpu ) of a computer , even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such as timing . now , modern microprocessors , microcontrollers and cpus have very powerful and very complex alus . furthermore , more recent cpus may contain up to more than 4 alus ( see superscalar cpus ) . mathematician john von neumann proposed the alu concept in 1945. related pages . - fpu - execution unit other websites . - a simulator of complex alu in matlab
