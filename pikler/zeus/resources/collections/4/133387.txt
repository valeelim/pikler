Self-injury     self-injury ( si ) or self-harm ( sh ) occurs when a person hurts his or her body on purpose . this kind of harm is not suicidal behaviour . many self-harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive . however , in some cases the self-harm becomes so bad it can lead to death , and those who self-harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not . there are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves , though it is often hard to find an exact cause . sometimes , the self-harm helps relieve unbearable emotions , or feelings of unreality or numbness . self-harm is often a symptom of other problems . these problems may include physical abuse , sexual abuse , or eating disorders . self-harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism . studying the causes of self-injury can be difficult or inaccurate , because many self-harmers try to hide their injuries . self-injury is a general term that includes many different types of deliberate harm to the body . there are many things that can be considered self-harm . if someone works their body too hard , for example , this can be seen as a mild form of self-injury . in other mild cases , a self-harmer may purposely pick off scabs to keep cuts or scratches from healing . compulsive hair-pulling ( trichotillomania ) and compulsive skin-picking ( dermotillomania ) are impulse control disorders which are also mild forms of self-harm .
