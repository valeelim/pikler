Electronic engineering     electronic engineering is a discipline that investigates all kinds of situations related to electricity and magnetism . electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as ; the transfer of information using radio waves , the design of electronic circuits , the design of computer systems , and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto-pilots and other embedded systems . the term electronic engineering started to emerge in the late 1950s . before the second world war , electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering ' . at that time , studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree . later , as consumer devices started to be developed , the field broadened to include modern tv , audio systems , hi-fi and later computers and microprocessors . in the mid to late 1950s , the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name 'electronic engineering ' , which then became a stand alone university degree subject . fundamental studies of the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of how such systems will work . today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided design programs when designing electronics ( electronic systems ) .
