Eratosthenes     eratosthenes of cyrene ( 276 –194 ) was a third century bc greek mathematician , geographer and astronomer . he was head of the library of alexandria from 240 until his death : this was the most important library of the ancient world . according to the suda , his contemporaries nicknamed him `` beta '' , ( the second letter of the greek alphabet ) , because he was the second best in the world in almost any field . eratosthenes was a friend of archimedes , who also lived and worked in alexandria . archimedes was the greatest mathematician and inventor of the age , so perhaps the beta nickname was not unjust . the works eratosthenes wrote are known to us only indirectly : the great library was destroyed , and no copies survived . strabo ( ~63–24 ) wrote about geography in antiquity . he tells us that the works of eratosthenes were `` on the measurement of the earth '' and `` geographica '' . eratosthenes made several remarkable discoveries and inventions . he was the first person to calculate the circumference of the earth ( with remarkable accuracy ) , and he invented a system of latitude and longitude . he calculated the tilt of the earth 's axis ( again with remarkable accuracy ) ; he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day . he created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era . eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology ; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of troy .
