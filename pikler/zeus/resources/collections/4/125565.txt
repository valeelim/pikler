Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol     extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) ( formerly named jabber ) is a protocol for instant messaging . it is inspired by xml . it is different to most protocols because it is an open standard . this means that anybody who has a domain name and an internet connection can run their own server . most of the software and the clients are open source . other software such as google talk and the gizmo5 use the xmpp protocol . it has been installed on thousands of servers across the internet . there are over five hundred million users who use software based on the protocol . clients include pidgin and ichat . jeremie miller started the jabber project in 1998. the first major public release was in may 2000. this early software was the basis of xmpp . it was a competitor to simple , which was based on the sip protocol . in august 2001 , the jabber software foundation ( jsf ) was started . the main role of the jsf was to manage the xml protocols for xmpp by documenting them . as well as this , the organisation was to co-ordinate the many companies that were using the xmpp technology .
