Closure (computer science)    closure ( computer science ) in computer science , a closure is a function that has an environment of its own . inside this environment , there is at least one bound variable . closures were first used in programming languages such as ml and lisp . when a closure is used more than once , the bound variables stay the same in between . anonymous functions are sometimes wrongly called closures . this is probably because most languages that have anonymous functions also have closures and it 's common for programmers to learn about both at the same time . closures and anonymous functions are similar but have important differences . computer scientists worked out how closures should work in the 1960s and programmers were first able to use them in the scheme programming language . since then , many languages have been designed to support closures . function objects are sometimes also called closures . closures are normal in languages where functions are first-class values , meaning they can be moved around in the program like other variable types : returned by functions , bound to a variable name , etc . for example , take a look at the following scheme function :
