Input/output     in computing , input/output , or i/o , refers to the communication between a digital processing system ( such as a computer or an embedded system ) , and the outside world â€“ possibly a human , another processing system or a device . inputs are the signals or data received by the system , and outputs are the signals or data sent from it . i/o devices are used by a person ( or other system ) to communicate with the digital processing system . for instance , keyboards and mice are considered input devices of a computer , while monitors and printers are considered output devices of a computer . devices for communication between computers , such as modems and network cards , typically serve for both input and output . note that the description of a device as either input or output depends on how it is viewed . mouses and keyboards take as input physical movement that the human user outputs and convert it into signals that a computer can understand . the output from these devices is input for the computer . similarly , printers and monitors take as input signals that a computer outputs . they then convert these signals into representations that human users can see or read . ( for a human user the process of reading or seeing these representations is receiving input . )
