Mosasaur     mosasaurs were large , predatory marine lizards of the upper cretaceous . the first fossil mosasaur , `` mosasaurus hoffmanni '' , was found in the netherlands in 1776. it was named in 1822 by w.d . conybeare . the type specimen was found in a chalk quarry in maastricht , holland . it was found by a german army surgeon , johann hoffmann , who collected fossils for the haarlem museum . during a struggle for ownership , the skeletal parts went to the museum , whilst the skull stayed with the owner of the land , who refused to let anyone see it . the true identity of the monster was decided correctly by the french anatomist georges cuvier . in 1795 french troops were outside maastricht , and cuvier arranged for the large skull to be saved when they stormed the town . the skull duly went to cuvier in paris , because he was the leading comparative anatomist of the day . he recognized the skull as that of a giant lizard , from its teeth and skull bones , though not until 1808 , and by then the son of a dutch professor , adriaan camper , had already had the same idea . the discovery of the specimen was important in another way , because it helped to convince cuvier that extinction of some species was a fact . cuvier later came up with a catastrophism-type theory .
