Block cipher     in cryptography , a block cipher is a symmetric key cipher which operates on a groups of bits of fixed length , called `` blocks '' , using an exact transformation . during encryption , a block cipher algorithm might take ( for example ) a 128-bit block of plaintext as input , and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext . the exact transformation is controlled using a second input â€” the secret key . decryption is similar : the decryption algorithm takes , in this example , a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key , and output the original 128-bit block of plaintext . one of the early block cipher designs was the data encryption standard ( des ) , developed at ibm and published as a standard in 1977. a successor to des , the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) ; also using block cipher , was adopted in 2001 .
