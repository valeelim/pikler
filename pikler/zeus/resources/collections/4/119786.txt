Amendment     an amendment is a formal or official change made to a law , contract , constitution , or other legal document . it is based on the verb to amend , which means to change . amendments can add , remove , or update parts of these agreements . they are often used when it is better to change the document than to write a new one . contracts are often amended when the market changes . for example , a contract to deliver something to a customer once a month can be amended if the customer wants it delivered once a week . usually , everyone involved in the contract must agree to the amendment before it goes into effect . most contracts are written with rules about amendments , like if they are allowed , who must agree to them , and when they go into effect . constitutions are often amended when people change their minds about what the government should do . some of the most famous constitutional amendments are the first amendment to the united states constitution which added the freedom of speech , religion , press , and protest , and the third amendment to the constitution of ireland , which let ireland join the european union . constitutional amendments usually must be approved by both the parliament or legislature and a referendum - a vote by all citizens in a country .
