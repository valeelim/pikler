Chosen-ciphertext attack     a chosen-ciphertext attack ( cca ) is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information , at least in part , by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key . when a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack , implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts ( i.e. , avoid providing a decryption scheme ) . this can be more difficult than it appears , as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks . additionally , some cryptosystems ( such as rsa ) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them . this permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed . a better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack , including ( among others ) rsa-oaep , cramer-shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption . chosen-ciphertext attacks , like other attacks , may be adaptive or non-adaptive . in a non-adaptive attack , the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance , and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts . in an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack , the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively , that is , depending on the result of prior decryptions .
