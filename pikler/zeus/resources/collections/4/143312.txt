Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz     friedrich august kekule von stradonitz ( also august kekulé ) ( 7 september 1829 – 13 july 1896 ) was a german organic chemist . kekulé was born in darmstadt , the son of a civil servant . after graduating from secondary school , in 1847 he entered the university of giessen , with the intention of studying architecture . after hearing the lectures of justus von liebig he decided to study chemistry . following his education in giessen , he took further doctorate fellowships in paris ( 1851-52 ) , in chur , switzerland ( 1852-53 ) , and in london ( 1853-55 ) , where he was decisively influenced by alexander williamson . in 1858 , he was hired as a full professor at the university of ghent . in 1867 , he was asked to work at the university of bonn . there he studied carbon organic compounds and benzene . he suggested a benzene ring structure . kekulé 's most famous work was on the structure of benzene . in 1865 kekulé published a paper in french suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds . the next year he published a much longer paper in german on the same subject . the empirical formula for benzene had been long known , but its highly unsaturated structure was challenging to determine . archibald scott couper in 1858 and joseph loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings , but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years , and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure .
