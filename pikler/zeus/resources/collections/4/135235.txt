Laurales     the laurales are an order of flowering plants . they are a basal group of dicots . they are related to , and sometimes included in , the magnoliales . the order includes 85-90 genera from seven families of trees and shrubs . most of the species are tropical and subtropical , though a few genera reach the temperate zone . the best known species in this order are those of the lauraceae ( for example bay laurel or `` laurus '' , cinnamon or `` cinnamomum '' , avocado or `` persea '' , and `` sassafras '' ) , and the spice bush or `` calycanthus '' of the calycanthaceae . the earliest lauraceous fossils are from the cretaceous . it is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology . indeed , at present no one trait is known which would unify all the members of laurales . this used to cause much argument among botanists about the correct limits of the order . the presently classification is based on recent molecular and genetic analysis .
