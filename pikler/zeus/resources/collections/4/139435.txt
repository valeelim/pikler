Out-of-order execution     in computer engineering , out-of-order execution , oooe , is a technique used in most high-performance microprocessors to make use of cycles that would otherwise be wasted by a certain type of costly delay . most modern cpu designs include support for out of order execution . the key concept of ooo processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of delays ( termed : `` stalls `` ) that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable . ooo processors fill these `` slots '' in time with other instructions that are ready , then re-order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal . the way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order , in the processor they are handled in data order ( the order in which the data , operands , become available in the processor 's registers ) . fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output ; the processor itself runs the instructions which seems as if in random order .
