Italian Mare Nostrum     italian mare nostrum was the name given during world war ii , by benito mussolini and his fascist propaganda to the mediterranean sea , under the domination of the kingdom of italy . the mediterranean was called `` mare nostrum '' ( latin for `` our sea '' ) during the centuries of the roman empire , an empire that fascism intended to recreate after the conquest of ethiopia in 1936. mussolini wanted to re-establish the greatness of the roman empire and believed that italy was the most powerful of the mediterranean countries after world war i. he declared that `` the twentieth century will be a century of italian power '' and created one of the most powerful navies of the world in order to control the mediterranean sea . however , the nation that really dominated the mediterranean in 1940 was the united kingdom , as the british had strong naval bases in gibraltar , malta and cyprus . the british also controlled the suez canal , along with the french ; the `` french third republic '' had a relatively powerful navy , and controlled the african maghreb . only after the conquest of greece and yugoslavia , in april 1941 , mussolini started to talk about an italian dominated mediterranean sea .
