Thread (computer science)    thread ( computer science ) a thread in computer science is short for a `` thread of execution '' . threads are a way for a program to divide ( termed `` split '' ) itself into two or more simultaneously ( or pseudo-simultaneously ) running tasks . threads and processes differ from one operating system to another but , in general , a thread is contained inside a process and different threads in the same process share same resources while different processes in the same multitasking operating system do not . threads are lightweight , in terms of the system resources they consume , as compared with processes . sources . - david r. butenhof : `` programming with posix threads '' , addison-wesley , isbn 0-201-63392-2 - bradford nichols , dick buttlar , jacqueline proulx farell : `` pthreads programming '' , o'reilly & associates , isbn 1-56592-115-1 - charles j. northrup : `` programming with unix threads '' , john wiley & sons , isbn 0-471-13751-0 - mark walmsley : `` multi-threaded programming in c++ '' , springer , isbn 1-85233-146-1 - paul hyde : `` java thread programming '' , sams , isbn 0-672-31585-8
