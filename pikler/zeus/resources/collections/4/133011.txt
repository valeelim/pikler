Thales     thales of miletus , about 624 bc – 546 bc , was a pre-socratic greek philosopher . he was from miletus in asia minor . many , notably aristotle , regard him as the first philosopher in the greek tradition . according to bertrand russell , `` western philosophy begins with thales '' . thales attempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to mythology and was tremendously influential in this respect . almost all of the other pre-socratic philosophers follow him in attempting to provide an explanation of ultimate substance , change , and the existence of the world—without reference to mythology . those philosophers were also influential , and eventually thales ' rejection of mythological explanations became an essential idea for science . he was also the first to define general principles and set forth hypotheses . as a result he has been called the `` father of science '' , though maybe democritus is more deserving of this title . in mathematics , thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore . he is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed . also , thales was the first person known to have studied electricity .
