Pre-Socratic philosophy     the pre-socratic greek philosophers were active before socrates . the popular usage of the term come from hermann diels ' work `` die fragmente der vorsokratiker '' ( `` the fragments of the pre-socratics '' , 1903 ) . most of what we know about the pre-socractic philosophers come from quotations by later philosophers and historians . while most of them produced significant texts , none of the texts have survived in complete form . the standard reference works in english are : - gompertz , theodor 1901 . `` the greek thinkers : a history of ancient philosophy . volume 1 : the beginnings '' . london : murray . - guthrie w.k . 1962 . `` a history of greek philosophy . volume 1 : the earlier presocratics and the pythagoreans '' . cambridge university press . the fundamental idea which motivated most of the presocratics ( as they are called ) is naturalism . this is the idea that questions about life and the world can be answered without using myths , and that `` the natural world is the whole of reality '' . with the greeks we see rational thought and scientific reasoning emerge from the mists and myths of a pre-scientific age , not suddenly , but slowly and gradually .
