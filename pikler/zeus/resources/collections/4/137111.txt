USB hub     usb is an international standard of technology for connecting peripherals to computers and other devices that support it . an interface where a usb device can be connected is called a port . a usb hub is a special device which allows adding more usb ports . the additional ports share one usb connection to the computer ; for this reason , each of them can not carry as much data as a direct usb connection can . a hub may be bus-powered , which means it gets all its electrical power from the computer . this makes simple wiring , but it can not give full power to its peripherals . a self powered hub has its own power cord , and can give full power to peripherals that need it . there are different versions of the usb standard ; main difference between the version is the maximum speed that is supported . the usb standard also defines different types of usb plugs . a usb hub is a normal usb device , which was built for a given version of the standard . certain models may support different versions of usb , while others may not . as an example : usb 3.0 can can transfer payload data at up to 4 gbits per second.usb 2.0 is limited to a transfer rate of 280 mbits per second . connecting an usb 3.0 device to the computer using an usb 2.0 hub will limit the transfer rate to that of usb 2.0 .
