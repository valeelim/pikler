Solar wind     the solar wind is wind from the sun . it is a stream of charged protons , electrons and plasma shot out of the sun . the wind is shot out at hypersonic speed , so fast that it can travel the whole length of the solar system , nearly 1 light year and create the heliosphere . the particles are dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft . the earth 's magnetic field absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the aurora , the northern lights and southern lights . a disturbance in the solar wind is called a solar storm . sometimes it causes a geomagnetic storm . such a storm in 1989 brought down the quebec electric power grid putting the entire province in darkness . the largest recorded geomagnetic storm was in september 1 â€“ 2 , 1859. if we were to have another as strong as that one it is estimated it would cause up to 2 trillion dollars damage . solar wind also causes the tail of a comet . when the comet is close enough to the sun that the heat evaporates some of the comet 's ice , the motion of the solar wind causes the resulting water vapor and space dust to stream away from the comet . because it is blown by the solar wind , the comet 's tail does not trail behind it , but always points directly away from the sun .
