Limit of a function     in calculus , a branch of mathematics , the limit of a function is the behavior of a certain function near a selected input value for that function . limits are one of the main calculus topics , along with derivatives , integration , and differential equations . the definition of the limit is as follows : the notation for the limit above is read as `` the limit of formula_1 as formula_3 approaches formula_4 is formula_2 . '' imagine we have a function such as formula_10 . when formula_11 , formula_1 is undefined , because formula_13 . therefore , on the cartesian coordinate system , the function formula_10 would have a vertical asymptote at formula_11 . in limit notation , this would be written as : for the function formula_10 , we can get as close to formula_18 in the formula_3-values as we want , so long as we `` do n't '' make formula_3 equal to formula_18 . for instance , we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001 , but never 0. therefore , we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_19 , but without reaching it . the left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number , and the right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number . for instance , in the function formula_10 , since the limit for formula_3 is 0 , if formula_30 , it approaches the limit from the right . if we instead choose -1 , we say it approaches the limit from the left .
