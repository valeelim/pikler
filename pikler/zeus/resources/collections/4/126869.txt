Virtual machine     a virtual machine is a program on a computer that works like it is a separate computer inside the main computer . the program that controls virtual machines is called a hypervisor and the computer that is running the virtual machine is called the host . the hypervisor controls how the virtual machine can access memory , hard drive space , and other resources on the host computer . virtual machines can be created through software known as virtualization software ( such as vmware workstation and virtualbox ) . there are many reasons to run a virtual machine : - it is a simple way to run more than one operating system on the same computer . - a very powerful server can be split into several smaller virtual machines to use its resources better . - it can help with security . if the virtual machine is affected by a virus , the host operating system is unaffected . - a virtual machine can be completely emulated , such as java . this lets a program run on different types of computer without having to be converted into a code specific for it . they can communicate even though the programming languages are not the same .
