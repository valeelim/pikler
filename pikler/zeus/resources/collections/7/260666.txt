Tony Miles     tony miles ( anthony john miles , 23 april 1955 – 12 november 2001 ) was an english chess grandmaster . in 1973 miles won the silver medal at the world junior chess championship at teesside , his first important event against international competition . he won the title next year in manila . miles entered the university of sheffield to study mathematics , but dropped out to concentrate on chess . in 1976 , miles became the first ever fide grandmaster born in the united kingdom , narrowly beating raymond keene to the title . other english players had been acknowledged as true grandmasters in the past . howard staunton , the 19th century world champion , was obviously a grandmaster . joseph blackburne was also regularly described as a grandmaster . naturalised german-born jacques mieses was awarded the gm title in 1950 ; and jonathan penrose was awarded the title retrospectively . for his achievement , miles won a £5,000 prize . miles had a string of good results in the late 1970s and 1980s , and his success was a factor in the growth of strong british players shortly after miles became a gm . miles won games against a number of former world chess champions , including vasily smyslov , mikhail tal , and boris spassky . in 1980 at the european team championship in skara , he beat reigning world champion anatoly karpov with black using the extremely unorthodox opening 1. e4 a6 ! ? , the so-called english defence . miles beat karpov again three years later in bath in a game that was part of the bbc 's `` mastergame '' series , but it was never shown on television due to a technicians ' strike . however , over their careers , karpov won most of the other encounters .
