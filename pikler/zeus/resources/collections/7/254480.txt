Foxtrot     the foxtrot , or `` slow foxtrot '' , is an english ballroom dance which developed from american band music . it is now one of the international standard ballroom dances . all ballroom dance competitions controlled by the world dance council include the foxtrot . all the standard ballroom dances had their origins abroad , but were adapted and modified by english dancers into their modern style . the waltz came from germany around 1810. the tango came from argentina . the foxtrot and quickstep were greatly influenced by american music . an american dance called the boston arrived in england about 1903. this had fairly slow , gliding steps . it is a characteristic of the foxtrot that in the basic steps , unlike the other dances , the feet slide past each other rather than coming together . the boston seems to have been the first dance to move the feet in this way . the boston also was the first ballroom dance to be done with feet parallel ( rather than turned out , as in ballet ) . the boston , like much else , was finished off by the first world war . crowded dance floors in wartime left no room for it , and new musical imports arrived from america .
