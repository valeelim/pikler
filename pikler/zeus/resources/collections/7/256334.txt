Gondwana     gondwana , formerly called gondwanaland , was a southern supercontinent . it formed when pangaea broke up , starting 180 million years ago ( mya ) , in the early middle jurassic . the pangaean global supercontinent was complete 250 million years ago . then it split into two smaller supercontinents , which were about the same size . the northern part of pangaea became laurasia , and the southern part became gondwana . over time , gondwana drifted south , while laurasia moved north . gondwana included most of the landmasses in today 's southern hemisphere , including antarctica , south america , africa , madagascar , australiaâ€“new guinea , and new zealand . it also included arabia and the indian subcontinent , which have now moved entirely into the northern hemisphere . gondwana itself began to break up in the mid-jurassic period , about 170 million years ago . gondwana was named by an austrian scientist , eduard suess . he named the supercontinent after the gondwana region of central northern india . the name comes from the sanskrit word `` gondavana , '' which means `` forest of the gonds . '' ( the gonds are a group of people who live in the gondwana area in india . )
