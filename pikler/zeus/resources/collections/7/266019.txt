Chlorine dioxide     chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound ( a thing made when two or more chemical elements attach to each other ) . its chemical formula is clo . the cl means 1 chlorine ion and the o2 means two oxide ions . the chlorine is in its +4 oxidation state . that means that when the chemical compound was made , four electrons were taken from the chlorine and given to the oxygens . it is a yellowish gas . it has a bad smell . it can explode easily . it reacts ( has chemical reactions with ) many other chemicals . it explodes when it is more than 15 % concentration in air . when light is shined on it , it can explode . it dissolves easily in cold water . it is made by oxidation ( the pulling of electrons away from ) of sodium chlorite by chlorine gas . it can also be made by reduction ( giving electrons to ) of sodium chlorate in an acidic solution . there are some reducing agents ( chemicals that reduce another chemical ) that can be used . methanol ( an alcohol ) , sulfur dioxide ( a gas made by burning sulfur ) , hydrochloric acid ( a common acid ) , or hydrogen peroxide can be used .
