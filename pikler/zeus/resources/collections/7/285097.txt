Type 2 diabetes     diabetes mellitus type 2 ( or adult-onset diabetes ) is a metabolic disorder where high levels of blood sugar occur . left untreated , it can cause heart attacks , strokes , blindness and kidney failure . normally , blood sugar level is regulated by insulin , but in type 2 diabetes this does not work properly . insulin is a hormone which tells the muscle and fat cells of the body to take up sugar from the blood . if there is too much sugar in the blood for a long period of time , the muscle and fat cells start to ignore insulin . as a result , sugar stays in the blood and is not taken up , leading to a high blood sugar . this situation is different from diabetes mellitus type 1. in this case , the islet cells , which make insulin in the pancreas , have been destroyed by the body , and as a result there is no insulin . diabetes type 1 usually occurs in children or young adults , whilst diabetes type 2 usually occurs in older people . however , recently childhood obesity has led to some young adults and teenagers developing type 2 diabetes . type 2 diabetes makes up around 90 % of cases of diabetes , while type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes make up the other 10 % .
