Bain-marie     a bain-marie ( or water bath ) is a piece of equipment used in science , industry , and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures , or to keep materials warm over a period of time . the bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes , sizes , and types , but traditionally is a wide , cylindrical , usually metal container made of three or four basic parts : a handle , an outer ( or lower ) container that holds the working liquid , an inner ( or upper ) , smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked , and sometimes a base underneath . under the outer container of the bain-marie ( or built into its base ) is a heat source . typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid . the smaller container , filled with the substance to be heated , fits inside the outer container , filled with the working liquid ( usually water ) , and the whole is heated at , or below , the base , causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed . the insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching .
