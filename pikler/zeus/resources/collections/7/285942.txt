Green River Formation     the green river formation is an eocene rock formation on the eastern side of the rocky mountains . it records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes . its fine fossils make this a lagerst√§tte , a place of exceptional preservation . the various fossil beds of the green river formation span a 5 million year period , dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago ( mya ) . during this period the climate moved from the moist early eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-eocene . the sediments are deposited in very fine layers , in pairs : a dark layer from the growing season , and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter . each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year . the sediments of the green river formation present a continuous record of six million years . the mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm , with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm . the sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day green river , a tributary of the colorado river . the formation is in three separate basins around the uinta mountains of northeastern utah :
