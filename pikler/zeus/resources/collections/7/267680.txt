Shimane Prefecture     shimane prefecture is part of the san'in area . san'in means `` the shady side of the mountains '' . there is a mountain range separating shimane and neighboring tottori from hiroshima and okayama . that means that the weather here is much wetter than further to the south . the area of shimane prefecture includes the old provinces of iwami province , izumo province , and oki province . the history of shimane starts with japanese mythology . in these myths , the shinto god ōkuninushi lived in izumo , an old province in shimane . izumo shrine honors this god . later on in the kamakura period , the kamakura shogunate forced emperor gotoba and emperor godaigo into exile on oki island . emperor godaigo got away from oki and successfully fought back against the shogunate . during the muromachi period , many clans fought over this area because there was a lot of silver . the kyogoku clan controlled izumo and oki . however , after the ōnin war , the amago clan in gassan-toda castle increased in power , and the masuda clan controlled iwami . iwami ginzan silver mine was in between amago clan territory and masuda clan territory , so there were many battles between these lords for the large amount of silver . however , in 1566 mori motonari conquered izumo , iwami , and oki . after over 30 years of mori control , in 1600 horio yoshiharu entered izumo and oki after the battle of sekigahara which mori lost . horio yoshiharu decided to move and build matsue castle instead of gassan-toda . the castle was completed soon after yoshiharu 's death . later in 1638 , the grandson of tokugawa ieyasu , matsudaira naomasa entered the castle because the horio clan had no heir . matsudaira 's family ruled until the end of the han system .
