Absorption     absorption is a condition in which something takes in another substance . it is a physical or chemical phenomenon or process , in which atoms , molecules , or ions enter in the inner part ( called `` bulk '' ) of a gas , liquid , or solid material . this is a different process from adsorption . molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the volume of the material , instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the surface of the material . a more general term is `` sorption '' , which covers absorption , adsorption , and ion exchange . other meanings of `` absorption '' are : - biology : entry of substances through the skin or other boundaries such as the intestine or cell membrane . - pharmacology : release of drugs into the blood . - physics : receiving of electromagnetic radiation by a material .
