Umbrella insurance     umbrella insurance protects all items of economic value and future income . it is also known as a type of liability insurance . a liability is a legal debt or obligation . the umbrella refers to how the policy shields insured assets . it covers damages caused by you and your dependents . people who have large sums of money usually have this type of insurance because they have high premiums . premiums are the total cost of the policy . it guarantees you higher liability limits . it provides additional limits of coverage if you are at risk of being sued . the umbrella policy is there to fill the gaps in other insurance policies . where one policy does not cover , the umbrella policy picks up where it doesn â€™ t cover . the umbrella policy covers all insurances such as house , car , etc . the umbrella policy covers in increments of 1,000,000 dollars . so if you had car insurance that only covered 200,000 dollars , the coverage would then be 1,200,000 dollars . the same goes for home owners insurance , if you had 500,000 dollars in coverage the total coverage would become 1,500,000 dollars in coverage .
