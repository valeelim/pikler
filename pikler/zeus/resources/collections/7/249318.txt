Voice (grammar)    voice ( grammar ) voice in grammar is about the way subject and object work in a sentence . - active voice : `` jane chose the furniture '' . - passive voice : `` the furniture was chosen by jane '' . the distinction only applies where the verb is transitive , since only a transitive verb comes with an object . for example : `` we enjoyed the trip '' is transitive and in active voice . `` the trip was enjoyed by us '' is transitive and in passive voice . `` she hurried home '' is not transitive and so has no voice . but if `` she hurried the children home '' , that 's transitive and active voice .
