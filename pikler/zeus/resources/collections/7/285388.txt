Williams pear     the williams ' bon chretien pear , commonly called the williams pear , or bartlett pear in the u.s. and canada , is the most commonly grown variety of pear in most countries outside asia . it is a summer pear , not as tolerant of cold as some varieties . it is often eaten raw , but holds its shape well when baked , and is a common choice for canned or other processed pear uses . the williams pear is thought to date from 1765 to 1770 from the yard of an aldermaston , england , schoolmaster named mr. stair or mr. wheeler , giving rise to the now-obscure names aldermaston pear and stairs pear . a nurseryman named williams later acquired the variety , and introducing it to the rest of england , which is why the pear became known as the williams pear . however , the pear 's full name is williams ' bon chretien , or `` williams ' good christian . '' in 1799 james carter imported several williams trees into the united states , and they were planted on the grounds of thomas brewer in roxbury , massachusetts . the massachusetts estate was later acquired by enoch bartlett of dorchester , massachusetts . unaware of their origin , bartlett named the pears after himself and introduced the variety into the united states . it was not realized that bartlett and williams pears were the same until 1828 , when new trees arrived from europe . by that time the bartlett variety had become vastly popular in the united states , and they are still generally known as bartlett pears in the u.s. and canada , although there are about 150 other names worldwide .
