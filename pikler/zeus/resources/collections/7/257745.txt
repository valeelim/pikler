Lovely Rita     `` lovely rita '' is a song by the beatles performed on the album `` sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band '' , written and sung by paul mccartney , although as with all mccartney-written beatles songs it is credited to lennon/mccartney . it is about a female parking attendant and the narrator 's love for her . the term `` meter-maid '' was largely unknown in the uk prior to the song 's release . it is american slang for a female traffic warden , now officially known by the gender-neutral term parking attendant . according to some sources , the song emanates from when a female traffic warden named meta davis gave a parking ticket to mccartney outside abbey road studios . instead of becoming angry , he accepted it with good grace and expressed his feelings in song . when asked why he had called her `` rita '' , mccartney replied , `` well , she looked like a rita to me '' . recording began on 23 february 1967. using a four-track recorder , this first performance featured harrison 's guitar on track 1 , lennon 's guitar on track 2 , ringo 's drums on track 3 , and mccartney 's piano set on track 4. the band later added lead vocal , bass , and a three-part backing vocal section . by 21 march , the final mono mix was completed and a month later , the stereo mix was done .
