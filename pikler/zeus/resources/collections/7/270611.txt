Roman Senate     the roman senate was the longest-lasting institution in ancient rome . it began in the first years of the city , which was supposedly founded in 753 bc . it survived the kings , the roman republic ( 509 bc–27 bc ) , the roman empire ( 27 bc–395 ad and the fall of the western roman empire ( 395–476 ad ) . the senate started as an advisory council of elders . the word `` senate '' came from 'senex ' meaning `` old man '' . the senate reached its peak in the middle republic , when it was the most powerful body in rome . the senate lost much of its power in the first period of the empire , known as the `` principate '' . after diocletian , when the centre of government was moved out of rome , the senate became just a municipal body . the influence of the old idea lived on , and constantine ii set up a senate in constantinople . the senate passed decrees called `` senatus consultum '' , which were advice from the senate to a magistrate ( senior official ) . they usually were obeyed in practice . through such advice , the senate directed the magistrates , especially the roman consuls ( the chief magistrates ) in their handling of military conflicts .
