Data loss     data loss is an event that happens when a file , program , or a piece of information is lost . when data is updated , it may change , and this may not be data loss . data loss also does not occur when the data is unavailable for some time only , for example because the server it is stored on can not be reached . when this server can be reached again , the data will again be there . there are some common causes to data loss . data loss can sometimes be prevented by creating a backup copy . a backup copy may contain an older version of a file , which can make data loss less severe . if certain information used by the system is lost , the system may stop working . getting the system working again and restoring the data from a backup copy may take a long time . sometimes a file or folder is accidentally ( not meant to be done ) deleted . most of the time users have a special `` recycling '' bin to recover from , but the loss of system files can stop the system from working . sometimes the system could have run low on battery power and shut off automatically while saving or loading data , corrupting it .
