Roman Wales     roman wales is the area of modern wales that was under roman empire control . roman wales was an area of south western britannia under roman empire control from the first to the fifth century ad . romans considered it to be part of `` roman britannia '' . south east wales was fully made roman at the beginning of the fifth century . up to and during the roman occupation of britain , the native inhabitants of iron age britain spoke `` brythonic '' languages ( a sub-family of the celtic languages ) and were regarded as britons ( or brythons ) . the area of modern wales was divided among a number of tribes , of which the silures in modern south-east wales and the ordovices in central and northwest wales were the largest and most powerful . these two tribes were the ones who put up the strongest force to the roman invasion : mona ( the island of anglesey ) was only conquered by gnaeus julius agricola in 78 ad . the first attack on the celtic tribes of what is now wales was made under the legatus publius ostorius scapula about 48 ad . ostorius first attacked the deceangli in the north-east , who appear to have surrendered with little resistance . he then spent several years campaigning against the silures and the ordovices . their resistance was led by caratacus , who had fled what is now southeast england when it was conquered by the romans . he first led the silures , then moved to the territory of the ordovices , where he was defeated by ostorius in 51 ad . caratacus fled to the brigantes , whose queen handed him over to the romans .
