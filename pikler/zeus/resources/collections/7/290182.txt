Rough-skinned newt     the rough-skinned newt ( `` taricha granulosa '' ) is a north american newt known for its strong poison . juveniles live on land for four or five years after metamorphosis . adults are amphibious , and live in water and on land . eggs are laid in water . they can be found especially after there has been a lot of rain . many newts make toxin in their skin to avoid predation , but the rough-skinned newt is especially poisonous . toxicity is generally experienced only if the newt feels threatened , although sometimes skin irritation can be experienced after touching it . the toxin that the rough-skinned newt makes can either paralyze or kill a human . recently , a drunk 29-year-old man in coos bay , oregon , died after swallowing a rough-skinned newt for a dare . throughout much of the newt â€™ s range , the common garter snake ( `` thamnophis sirtalis '' ) is resistant to the newt 's toxin . in several populations , these snakes successfully prey upon the newts . toxin resistant garter snakes are the only known animals today that can eat a `` t. granulosa '' newt and survive .
