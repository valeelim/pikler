Albert Roussel     albert charles paul marie roussel ( 5 april 1869 - 23 august 1937 ) was a french composer . roussel spent seven years as a midshipman . he only turned to music as an adult . but he then became one of the most important composers of the years between the two world wars . his earlier music came from the impressionism of debussy and ravel . he turned more towards neoclassicism with his later music . albert roussel was born in tourcoing ( `` nord '' `` department '' of france ) . his earliest interest was not music . it was mathematics . he spent some time in the french navy . in 1889 and 1890 he served on the crew of the frigate `` iphigénie '' . these travels were significant to his later career as a composer . this is because many of his musical works would reflect his interest in far-off and interesting places . after roussel left the navy in 1894 , he began to study music with eugène gigout . he continued his studies until 1908 at the schola cantorum ( one of his teachers there was vincent d'indy ) . while he studied , he would also teach at the schola . his fellow students were erik satie and the young edgard varèse .
