Tritylodont     tritylodonts were small to medium-sized mammal-like cynodonts . they varied in size from a rabbit to a beaver . they were the last family of the non-mammalian synapsids . one of the last cynodont lines to appear , the family tritylodontidae descended from a `` cynognathus '' -like cynodont . their teeth had three cusps ( bumps ) which gave them their name . the tritylodonts were herbivorous , chewing through vegetation , such as stems , leaves , and roots . tritylodonts have no canine teeth , just incisors and cheek teeth . the jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards , shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth . they were the longest surviving of all the non-mammalian therapsids . they appeared in the latest triassic period , and persisted through the jurassic until the middle of the cretaceous . this shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids , even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaurs ' feet , so to speak . it is very clear that the tritylodonts were warm-blooded . the tritylodont fossils were found in the americas , south africa , and eurasia . they may have managed to live worldwide , including antarctica .
