Electron transport chain     electron transfer chains ( etc ) are the cellular mechanisms used for getting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis . they also occur in redox reactions , such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration . in aerobic respiration , each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of atp being produced by the etc . this is by far the most productive part of respiration . the electron transport chain consists of a series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule . the underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy ( energy available to do work ) of the reactants and products . any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will happen . atp synthase is an enzyme found among all domains of life . it is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient . this is the result of the series of redox reactions . what the electron transport chain does is produce this gradient . the free energy is used to drive atp synthesis .
