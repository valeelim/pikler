Geotechnical engineering     geotechnical engineering is an important subset of civil engineering dealing with engineering performance of earth materials . geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil and rock mechanics to determine : - subsurface conditions and materials ; - relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials ; - stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits ; - risks posed by site conditions ; to design : - earthworks ; - structure foundations ; and to monitor : - site conditions ; - earthwork and foundation construction . foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations . retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls .
