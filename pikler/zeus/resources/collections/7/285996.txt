Microvillus     microvillus ( plural microvilli ) is a very tiny hair-like membrane in the body . the microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell . in humans , the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area . they are good for absorbing things and for secreting things . they are found in many places in a human body including the ear , the tongue , the nose and the intestines . on a tongue , the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain . these signals are interpreted by the brain , and tells the brain what things taste like . over time , as a person tastes more and more things , the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information . this databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes , and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities . in the intestines , the microvilli are able to absorb ( take ) nutrients from the digested food for the body to use .
