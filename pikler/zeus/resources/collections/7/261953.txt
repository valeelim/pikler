Inline-four engine     the inline-four engine or straight-four is an internal combustion engine with all four cylinders . all four cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft . it can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel and natural gas . the single bank of cylinders may be in a vertical direction ( straight up ) , or at an angle . when the cylinders are mounted at an angle , it is sometimes called a slant-four . when listed as an abbreviation , an inline-four engine is listed either as i4 or l4 ( for `` longitudinal '' ) . l4 is often used to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter i. the inline-four layout is a mechanically simple engine . it has a natural basic engine balance . it is smoother than one , two , and three cylinder engines . this makes it popular for economy cars . it does have a problem with secondary engine balance . this causes minor vibrations in smaller engines . these vibrations become worse as engine size and power increase . the more powerful engines used in larger cars use different an engine layout to avoid this problem .
