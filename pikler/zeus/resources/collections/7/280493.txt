Northwest Highlands     the northwest highlands are the northern third of scotland , which is separated from the grampian mountains by the great glen . the caledonian canal , which extends from loch linnhe in the west , via loch ness to the moray firth in the north splits this area from the rest of the country . the highlands are formed on lewisian gneiss , the oldest layers of rock in scotland . there are impressive rock islands of dark red or gray torridonian sandstone which stick up out of the gneiss . some of the peaks , such as beinn eighe and canisp , are topped with light gray or white cambrian quartzite . the city of inverness , known as the `` capital of the highlands '' , is by far the largest settlement in the region . it is the administrative centre for the highland council area . this area 's climate varies with altitude . it has wet , warm summers , average under 17c ( 62.6f ) . the winters are mild at low altitude but become snowier and colder with higher elevation . mountains may have up to 6 months of snow . naturally the area would be a vast birch , pine and montane shrub forest , such as those surviving in glen affric . snow may lie from more than a month to 105 days , but not at coastal or very low altitudes .
