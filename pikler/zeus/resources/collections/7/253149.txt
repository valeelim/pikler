Saturation (chemistry)    saturation ( chemistry ) the term saturation in chemistry is used in several ways : 1. saturation is the point at which a solution of a substance can dissolve no more of that substance . this point of maximum concentration , the `` saturation point '' , depends on the temperature of the liquid as well as the chemical nature of the substances involved . if a change in conditions ( e.g . cooling ) means that the concentration is higher than the saturation point , the solution has become 'supersaturated ' . 1. in organic chemistry , a saturated chemical compound has no double bond or triple bond or ring . in saturated hydrocarbons , every carbon atom is attached to two hydrogen atoms , except those at the ends of the chain , which have three hydrogen atoms . 1. in biochemistry , the term saturation refers to the fraction of total protein binding sites that are occupied at any given time . applies to enzymes , and molecules like haemoglobin . 1. in organometallic chemistry , an unsaturated complex has fewer than 18 valence electrons and thus is susceptible to oxidative addition or coordination of an additional ligand . unsaturation is characteristic of many catalysts because it is usually a requirement for substrate activation .
