Damselfly     damselflies are insects in the order odonata . damselflies are similar to dragonflies , but in a separate suborder , the zygoptera . there are 20 families of damselfly . the wings of most damselflies are held along , and parallel to , the body when at rest . there are also damselfly families in which the wings are held open , as in the true dragonflies ( anisoptera ) . damselflies are also usually smaller , weaker fliers than dragonflies , and their eyes are well separated , by more than their own diameter . another distinction is that their forewings and hindwings look similar ; this is not the case in the true dragonflies . like dragonflies , damselflies can not walk , but only land . their life cycle is also similar . they have incomplete metamorphosis , with an aquatic nymph which is carnivorous , as is the adult . they are often brilliantly coloured , but when they land on a bush , out of direct sunlight , they are not easy to see . they land and close their wings at the same instant . they have eyes which detect movement well , and they fly off if anything moves nearby . thus , although they are fragile and highly coloured , they are not easily caught by predators .
