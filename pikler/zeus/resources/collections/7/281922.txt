Oedema     oedema ( also spelled edema ) is swelling caused when fluid leaks out of the body 's capillaries . ( the capillaries are the body 's smallest blood vessels . ) the fluid builds up and gets trapped in the tissues around the leaking blood vessels . this causes swelling . if there is enough swelling , edema can be seen from outside of the skin . edema can happen in any part of the body . however , it is easiest to see in the arms and legs , including the hands , ankles , and feet . edema in the arms and legs is called `` peripheral edema '' . `` pulmonary edema `` is fluid in the lungs . pulmonary edema is dangerous because having fluid in the lungs makes breathing difficult . if pulmonary edema gets bad enough , a person can drown in the fluid . edema in the abdomen is called `` ascites . '' some of the signs and symptoms of edema are : - swelling or puffiness right under the skin - skin that looks stretched or shiny - changes in skin color - aching arms and legs - stiff joints - weight gain or weight loss - blood pressure and pulse rate that are higher than normal
