Baryon     baryons are composite subatomic particles made of three quarks . the most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons which make up most of the visible matter in the universe . electrons ( the other major component of the atom ) are leptons . since all quarks have a spin of 1/2 , a baryon will always have a spin of either 1/2 or 3/2 ( the spins can cancel out ) . the 3/2 spin baryons are extremely unstable , and only live for 10 seconds . after that , they will jump down to a lower energy state by releasing photons containing energy . these 3/2 spin baryons are known as higher energy resonances . the lowest energy state of a baryon is a simple 1/2 spin . all particles with 1/2 spin ( or 3/2 spin ) are called fermions , and obey fermi-dirac statistics . this means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time . this is not true for the other type of subatomic particle , called a boson . more than one boson -- like a photon -- can exist in the same point in space at the same time .
