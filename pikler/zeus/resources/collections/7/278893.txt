Mantis shrimp     mantis shrimps are crustacean stomatopods . they are not actually shrimps , but members of the order stomatopoda . there are about 400 species . they are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed . they hold their body in a manner like that of a praying mantis , and have large , complex eyes . some species can be 30 cm long . they are highly coloured , and live in shallow tropical and subtropical habitats such as coral reefs . each species has one of these two methods of attack - `` spearers '' are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips , used to stab and snag prey . - `` smashers '' , on the other hand , have a club as an appendage , and a simpler spear . the spear is quite sharp and used in fights between their own kind . the club is used to bludgeon and smash their prey . both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey , and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves . in smashers , these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness , and hit their prey with the speed of a bullet . this is one of the fastest responses known to man .
