Struggle for existence     the struggle for existence is a natural history [ metaphor ] . it refers to the competition between living things to survive . this , and the similar phrase `` struggle for life '' , were used over 40 times by charles darwin in the `` origin of species '' , and the phrase is the title of chapter 3 of the `` origin '' . darwin got the idea from his reading of the 6th edition of thomas malthus ' `` essay on the principle of population '' , and alfred russel wallace also used the phrase regularly . the idea is actually much older , and many natural historians have noted the competition between animals . generally speaking , they have been interested in the competition between species . malthus was probably the first to think about the struggle for resources between members of one species â€“ the human species . darwin first heard about malthus in letters from his sister fanny , while he was voyaging on hms `` beagle '' . fanny told him malthus ' ideas were being promoted by harriet martineau , an early feminist writer . later on , back in london , darwin met martineau over dinner , and put a lot of thought into the ideas of malthus . the number of humans could double in 25 years . if they did not , it was because of competition for resources , such as food , or because wars and disease became more common .
