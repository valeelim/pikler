Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici    anna maria luisa de ' medici anna maria luisa de ' medici ( 11 august 1667 – 18 february 1743 ) was the last of the house of medici . a patron of the arts , she gave the medici 's large art collection ( including the contents of the uffizi , palazzo pitti and medici villas ) which she inherited upon her brother gian gastone ’ s death in 1737 , and her palatine treasures to the tuscan state , on the condition that none of it be removed . anna maria luisa was the only daughter of cosimo iii de ' medici , grand duke of tuscany , and marguerite louise d'orléans , a niece of louis xiii of france . on her marriage to elector johann wilhelm ii , she became electress palatine , and , patronised a lot of musicians . as johann wilhelm had syphilis , the union with anna maria luisa produced no children . in 1713 cosimo iii altered the tuscan laws of succession to allow the accession of his daughter , and spent his final years canvassing the european powers to agree to recognise this statute . however , in 1735 , as part of a territorial arrangement , the european powers appointed francis stephen of lorraine as heir , and he duly ascended the tuscan throne in her stead . after the death of johann wilhelm , anna maria luisa returned to florence , where she enjoyed the rank of first lady until the accession of her brother gian gastone de ' medici , who banished her to the villa la quiete .
