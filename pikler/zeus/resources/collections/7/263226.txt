Cobalt(II) fluoride    cobalt ( ii ) fluoride cobalt ( ii ) fluoride , also known as cobaltous fluoride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cof . it contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state . it also contains fluoride ions . it is a reddish crystalline solid . it only dissolves a little in water . the hydrate ( type with water molecules attached ) can dissolve in water . it can dissolve in acid . it can react with hydrogen at to make cobalt and hydrogen fluoride . it can be made by reacting anhydrous ( without any water molecules attached ) cobalt ( ii ) oxide or cobalt ( ii ) chloride with a stream of hydrogen fluoride . this reaction makes the anhydrous form . the hydrated ( with water molecules attached ) form is made by reacting any cobalt ( ii ) compound with hydrofluoric acid . when fluorine is reacted with cobalt at a high temperature , it makes both cobalt ( ii ) fluoride and cobalt ( iii ) fluoride . it is used as a catalyst . it can be used as a source of the fluoride ion in dentist care . it is used in lenses . related pages .
