When I'm Sixty-Four    when i 'm sixty-four `` when i 'm sixty-four '' is a love song by the beatles , written by paul mccartney ( credited to lennon/mccartney ) and released in 1967 on their album `` sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band '' . according to ian macdonald , the song was `` aimed chiefly at parents , and as a result got a cool reception from the group 's own generation . '' the song is sung by a young man to his lover , and is about his plans of growing old together with her . although the theme is aging , it was one of the first songs mccartney wrote , when he was sixteen . the beatles used it in the early days as a song they could play when the amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off . both george martin and mark lewisohn thought that mccartney may have thought of the song when recording began for `` sgt . pepper '' in december 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year . lennon said of the song , `` paul wrote it in the cavern days . we just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee ' and 'vera , chuck and dave ' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us . '' in his 1980 interview for `` playboy '' he said , `` i would never even dream of writing a song like that . ''
