Systole     systole is the last stage of a heart beat . it happens right after diastole , when the heart refills with blood . during systole , the heart 's two ventricles contract ( squeeze ) . ( the ventricles are the largest parts of the heart , which pump blood to the body and lungs . ) during systole , the heart muscle gets an automatic electrical signal that tells the heart to contract ( squeeze ) . this makes the blood flow out of the heart . above the ventricles are smaller chambers ( sections ) of the heart called atria . they contract ( squeeze ) during the last part of diastole , and send blood down to the larger , lower ventricles . the atria have valves that close after this so blood can not flow backward into the atria . when the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed , the ventricles contract . so , the atria and ventricles contract in sequence . the left and right atria feed blood into the ventricles . then , the left and right ventricles contract . the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs , and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body . this is why we have a pulse .
