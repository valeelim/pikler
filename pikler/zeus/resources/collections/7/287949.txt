Stratigraphy     stratigraphy is a branch of geology which studies rock formations called strata ( layers ) . it is important in the study of sedimentary and layered vocanic rocks . the subject was established by nicolaus steno whose book `` de solido '' contained these principles : 1 . `` law of superposition '' : layers above were laid down after layers below . 1 . `` principle of original horizontality '' : layers horizontal when they were laid down . 1 . `` principle of lateral continuity '' in layers of sediment . each stratum extended horizontally until some obstacle stopped it . william smith first used stratigraphy for a practical purpose in the 1790s and early 19th century . smith , nicknamed `` strata smith '' , made the first geological map of england . he understood that fossils could be used identify the same strata in different places . he took samples and mapped the positions of the strata , noted the vertical extent of the strata , and drew cross-sections and tables of what he saw . smith amassed a huge collection of fossils in strata he had examined . his most significant finding was :
