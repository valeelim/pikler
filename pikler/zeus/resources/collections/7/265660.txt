Oystercatcher     the oystercatcher is a species of bird that lives around europe and asia . they usually eat shellfishes that are found on beaches and mud . the eurasian oystercatcher uses its sharp bill to open the shells of oysters and mussels . it cuts the muscle between the two halves of the shell together , or it crashes the shell against a rock and eats the oyster inside . the oystercatcher has the heaviest bill ( = beak ) of any living wader . they have `` resource polymorphism '' : they have some different beak types , and each type is used for a different kind of feeding . unusually , the polymorphism is not genetically determined . it seems individuals are able to change their beak to suit their food . they do , of course , inherit an ability to adapt their feeding behaviour . `` stabbers '' work by jabbing their bill tips between the valves of a mussel 's shell . `` hammerers '' open mussel shells by banging down on them ; some hammerers only break the dorsal side , others only break the ventral side . still others feed on worms , and they have narrow , tweezer-like bill tips .
