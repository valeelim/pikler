William James     william james ( 1842â€“1910 ) was an american psychologist and philosopher . he was an original thinker in physiology , psychology and philosophy . his major work was a twelve-hundred page book which gave us such ideas as the `` stream of thought '' . william was the brother of the novelist henry james . james was a pragmatist . he defined true beliefs as those that prove useful to the believer . truth is verifiable ( can be tested ) when thoughts and statements correspond with actual things , and also `` hang together , '' or cohere , as pieces of a puzzle might fit together . these 'truths ' are confirmed by the observed results putting them into practice . james held a world view in line with pragmatism , declaring that the value of any truth depended on its use to the person who held it . the world is a mosaic of diverse experiences that can only be understood through `` radical empiricism '' . radical empiricism , not related to the everyday scientific empiricism , asserts that the world and experience can never be halted for an entirely objective analysis . the mind of the observer and simple act of observation will affect the outcome of any empirical approach to truth . the mind , its experiences and nature , can not be separated . james 's emphasis on diversity as the default human condition has kept a strong influence in american culture , especially among liberals . james 's description of the mind-world connection , which he described as a `` stream of consciousness '' , had a direct and significant effect on avant-garde and modernist literature and art .
