Government of Australia     the commonwealth of australia is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy . the commonwealth of australia was formed in 1901 when the six self-governing british colonies , agreed to join together as one nation . these colonies became the six states of australia . the written agreement is the australian constitution . this was written at a constitutional convention and voted for by the people of the colonies . the way the australian government is organized can be looked at in two ways . the first is federalism which organizes the way powers are distributed between the australian government and the state governments . the second is separation of powers into legislative , executive and judiciary branches of government . the constitution supports the separation of powers in the way it sets out the roles of the branches of government . section 1 of the australian constitution sets up a democratic legislature , the bicameral parliament of australia . this is the queen and two houses , the senate and the house of representatives . section 51 of the constitution sets out the commonwealth government 's legislative powers and gives certain powers and responsibilities ( known as `` heads of power '' ) to the federal government . all remaining responsibilities are kept by the six states . each state has its own constitution , so that australia has seven sovereign parliaments , none of which can take over the powers of any other . the high court of australia rules on any arguments between the commonwealth and the states , or among the states , about their powers .
