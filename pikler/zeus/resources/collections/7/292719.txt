Automobili Turismo e Sport     ats ( automobili turismo e sport , which roughly translates in english to `` tourism and sports cars '' ) was an italian car maker and briefly , a constructor in formula one . the team ran in f1 in 1963 , and made cars from 1963 to 1965. the company was founded by carlo chiti and giotto bizzarrini , intended to compete directly with ferrari . the two most well-known cars were the ats 2500 gt , a sports car , and the tipo 100 , a formula one car , which was a virtual copy of the ferrari 156 , which was a formula one car in 1961. unfortunately , with the cars being frequently withdrawn and technical problems through the season , the f1 team was shut down after 1963. in fact , out of the 10 entries ats qualified for ( five races , two cars per race ) , only two cars were classified at the end of the race , albeit very slow , with giancarlo baghetti being classified at 23 laps down ( 23 laps behind the eventual race winner , jim clark ) . by contract , phil hill ( with no relation to graham hill ) finished seven laps down .
