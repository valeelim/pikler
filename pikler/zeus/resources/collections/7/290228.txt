Mosaic evolution     in mosaic evolution some characters in a transitional form are basal , while others are remarkably advanced . apparently , evolutionary change takes place rapidly in some body parts or systems without simultaneous changes in other parts . another definition is the `` evolution of characters at various rates both within and between species '' . its place in evolutionary theory comes under long-term trends or macroevolution . evolution from a basal ( early ) form to a derived ( later ) form takes place in stages . modules ( groups of characters ) change semi-independently of each other . they change at different times , so producing a mosaic of primitive and derived traits . these changes play a leading role in major evolutionary transitions . it may involve speciations producing a series of species , only a few of which would be found as fossils . by its very nature , the evidence for this idea comes mainly from palaeontology . it is not claimed that this pattern is universal , but it is common . there are now a wide range of examples from many different taxa .
