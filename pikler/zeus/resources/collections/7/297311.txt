Castorocauda     castorocauda was a genus of small , semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the jurassic period , about 154 million years ago . its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the daohugou beds of inner mongolia . `` castorocauda '' was highly specialized , with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers , otters , and the platypus ( convergent evolution ) . it is the earliest animal found with fur . `` castorocauda '' is one of the near-mammals in a group called the docodonta . although `` castorocauda '' was not a crown group mammal , it is important in the study of how mammals evolved . it was the first find with an almost complete skeleton . also it is not a `` small nocturnal insectivore '' . - it was larger than most mesozoic mammaliaform fossils about from its nose to the tip of its tail , and may have weighed . - it is the earliest absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur . previously the earliest was `` eomaia '' , a crown group mammal from about 125m years ago . - it had aquatic adaptations including flattened tail bones and remnants of soft tissue between the toes of the back feet , suggesting that they were webbed . previously the earliest known semi-aquatic mammaliaforms were from the eocene , about 110 million years later .
