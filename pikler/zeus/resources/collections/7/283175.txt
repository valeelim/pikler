Shapiro delay     the shapiro time delay is a physics experiment . it is one of the four classic solar system observations or experiments which test general relativity . radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would if the mass of the object were not present . the time delay effect was first noticed in 1964 , by irwin i. shapiro . shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction : bounce radar beams off the surface of venus and mercury , and measure the round trip travel time . when the earth , sun , and venus are most favorably aligned , shapiro showed that the expected time delay , due to the presence of the sun , of a radar signal traveling from the earth to venus and back , would be about 200 microseconds , well within the limitations of 1960s era technology . the first tests , performed in 1966 and 1967 using the mit haystack radar antenna , were successful , matching the predicted amount of time delay . the experiments have been repeated many times since then , with increasing accuracy .
