Vertebrate brain     the vertebrate brain is the main part of the central nervous system . in vertebrates ( and most other animals ) the brain is at the front , in the head . it is protected by the skull and close to the main senses of vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . as an animal moves forward , its senses collect data about the surroundings , and that data goes directly to the brain . brains are extremely complex . the brain controls the other organs of the body , either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones and neurotransmitters . muscular action allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment ; hormones and the autonomic nervous system make slower changes in the body . in vertebrates , the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking . however , sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain . the structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same . at the same time , during the course of evolution , the vertebrate brain has undergone changes , and become more effective . in so-called 'lower ' animals , most or all of the brain structure is inherited , and therefore their behaviour is mostly instinctive . in mammals , and especially in man , the brain is developed further during life by learning . this has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment . the capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex .
