LGBT rights in Pakistan     there are few to no lgbt rights in pakistan . since 6th of october in 1860 , it has been illegal to participate in homosexual acts ( to have sexual contact with a person of the same gender ) . unlike in the neighboring country of india , this law has not yet been repealed ( or gotten rid of ) . homosexuality is also thought of as a taboo vice in pakistan . the major religions in pakistan do not approve of homosexuality . because of this , many people in the country are against homosexuality and other forms of alternative sexual orientation . pakistan is officially an islamic republic . however , in reality , pakistan is largely secular ( non-religious ) . it mainly has anglo-saxon laws which were inherited from the british . more and more , there are trends ( or patterns ) of liberalization ( becoming more liberal ) in the country . globalization and social tolerance are also increasing . because of this , public gay parties have been taking place in the country , and these parties have been thriving for a number of years .
