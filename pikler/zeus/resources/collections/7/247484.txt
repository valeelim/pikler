ELIZA     eliza is an early program able to process natural language . eliza operated by processing users ' responses to `` scripts '' . the most famous script was called doctor . it was a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist . eliza did n't know much about thought or emotion . however , doctor sometimes provided conversation like a human . eliza was written at mit by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966. when the person used words that were not in the very small list , doctor might say , for example , responding to `` my head hurts '' , `` why do you say your head hurts ? '' the response to `` my mother hates me '' might be `` who else in your family hates you ? '' eliza was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques , but was taken seriously by several of its users , even after weizenbaum explained to them how it worked . it was one of the first chatterbots in existence . implementations . - using java , and based very closely on weizenbaum 's published description of the program : http : //www.chayden.net/eliza/eliza.html
