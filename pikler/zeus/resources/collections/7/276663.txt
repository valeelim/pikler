Banyan     a banyan ( or 'banian ' ) is a kind of fig . it usually starts life by growing on another plant as an epiphyte . its seeds germinate in the cracks and crevices on a host tree , or on other structures like buildings and bridges . `` banyan '' usually means the indian banyan or `` ficus benghalensis '' . it is the national tree of both the republic of india and bangladesh . however , the term actually includes all figs which share their epiphytic life cycle . they are put in the subgenus urostigma . the seeds of banyans are dispersed by fruit-eating birds . the seeds germinate and send down roots towards the ground . these roots may envelop ( cover ) part of the host tree or building structure , from which they get the casual name of strangler fig . a number of tropical forest species grow by strangling . there are other examples in the genus `` ficus '' that competes for light . any `` ficus '' species showing this habit may be termed a strangler fig . the leaves of the banyan tree are large , leathery , glossy green and elliptical in shape . like most of the fig-trees , the leaf bud is covered by two large scales . as the leaf develops the scales fall . young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge .
