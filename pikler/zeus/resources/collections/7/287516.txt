Freckle     freckles are clusters of concentrated melanin that are most often visible with a fair skin complexion . freckles are predominantly found on the face , although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun , such as the shoulders . they are an inherited trait , caused by variation in the mc1r gene that is involved in the determination of red hair , fair skin , and freckles . freckle formation is triggered through exposure to sunlight . two types of melanin , the red pheomelanin and the black eumelanin , are present in human skin . eumelanin protects against sunlight . people with red hair have mostly pheomelanin in their hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin . this may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight .
