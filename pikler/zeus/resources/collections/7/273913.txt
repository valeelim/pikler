Toll road     a toll road ( also called a turnpike , toll highway , or express toll route ) is a road for which vehicles must pay a fee to use , called a `` toll '' . toll roads are there in part to control the number of people using it . they may be built to allow some users to travel faster and avoid traffic congestion , speeding up traffic . in the past , tolls were collected to give income to governments or landowners . today , tolls can be considered a form of tax which pays for the cost of road construction and maintenance that are not charged on those who do not use that road . there are many types of toll roads . tolls might be charged to use a bridge , tunnel , or highway . on some roads , the amount of money you pay depends on how far along the road you go , and/or whether you are driving a car , motorcycle , bus , or truck . on other roads , you pay the same amount no matter how far you go or what you drive . there are also many ways tolls can be collected . in the first toll roads , you had to stop at a booth along the road and pay the toll to a person , called a `` collector '' . depending on the road , you might have to do so when you get on , when you get off , or both . because many vehicles may be waiting to pay the toll , the area around `` toll plazas '' , which are a bunch of booths blocking the whole road , can be crowded . recently , there are roads that have `` electronic toll collection '' , which makes use of computer chips and rfid technology to identify drivers and charge their tolls on their bank accounts .
