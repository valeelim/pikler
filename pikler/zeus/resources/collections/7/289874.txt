Persian and Urdu     the persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages of the greater middle east , central asia , and south asian regions , including urdu . following the turko-persian mahmud of ghazni 's ghaznavid conquest of south asia , a hybrid language of turkish , arabic and persian and local dialects began to form , one that would eventually be known as urdu . this language was called `` zaban-e-ordu '' ( 'language of the army ' ) to distinguish it from persian , the court language , and was later shortened to just urdu . it grew from the interaction of persian and turkic speaking muslim soldiers and the native peoples . under persian influence from the state , the persian script and nasta'liq form of cursive writing was adopted , with additional figures added to accommodate the indic phonetic system . the national anthem of pakistan is highly persianized . urdu is a morpho-syntax/grammatically an indic language , written in the perso-arabic script , and contains literary conventions and specialised vocabulary largely from persian . some grammatical elements peculiar to persian , such as the enclitic `` ezƒÅfe '' , and the use of the `` takhallus '' , were readily absorbed into urdu literature both religious and secular .
