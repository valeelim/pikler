Zoraptera     zoraptera is a order of insects , is one of the least diverse and most poorly understood of insect lineages . zoraptera are minute , hemimetabolous insects superficially resembling barklice ( psocoptera ) or termites ( isoptera ) . individuals are generally less than 3 mm in total body length , exclusive of their antennae , and are gregarious . overall , zorapterans are quite homogenous in their morphology and tend to be off-white ( mostly nymphs ) to brown in color . individuals of each species occur in two morphs : eyed and winged forms that then shed their wings after dispersal or blind and apterous forms that predominate in colonies .
