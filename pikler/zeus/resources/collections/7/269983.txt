Cauchy distribution     the cauchy-lorentz distribution ( after augustin-louis cauchy and hendrik lorentz ) is a continuous probability distribution . as a probability distribution it is usually called a `` cauchy distribution '' . physicists know it as a `` lorentz distribution '' . it is used in spectroscopy to describe the spectral lines found there , and to describe resonance . the cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a `` pathological '' distribution . both its mean and its variance are undefined .
