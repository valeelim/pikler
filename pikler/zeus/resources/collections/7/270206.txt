Theoretical particle     theoretical particles are particles that have been assumed or predicted to exist by scientists , but have not been proven in any experiment . some , like the tachyon , probably do n't exist , since they violate several laws of physics . however , many are still believed to exist . all supersymmetric particles ( such as a sfermion ) are theoretical . supersymmetrical particles are often abbreviated with an `` s '' in front of the particle name , like a sfermion . particles found in antimatter are not theoretical particles because they `` have '' been found in numerous experiments . a list of theoretical particles . supersymmetrical particles . - sfermion - slepton - squark - smuon particles that disobey laws of physics . - tachyon particles that require an incredible amount of energy to create . - higgs boson - z boson other hypothetical particles . - sterile neutrino - graviton - glueball - pentaquark
