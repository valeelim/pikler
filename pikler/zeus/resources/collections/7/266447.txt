Semimetal     a semimetal or a metalloid is a chemical element . metalloids are elements that have the propeties of both metal and non-metal elements . it might be shiny , but brittle . it might be dull , but conducts electricity . the most common semimetal is silicon . silicon has electrical conductivity between metals and nonmetals . it is a semiconductor . an approximate way to classify metalloids is to look at the periodic table of elements . see the double diagonal line : top left boron and aluminium , bottom right polonium and astatine . those diagonals are the metalloids . some metalloids are not semimetals , and some semimetals are not metalloids .
