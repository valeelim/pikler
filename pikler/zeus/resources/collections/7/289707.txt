Celestial sphere     in astronomy and navigation , the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere ( `` ball '' ) of a very large unspecified size . the earth and the spere have the same centre : they are `` concentric '' . they also rotate upon the same axis . all objects in the sky can be thought of as projected ( `` drawn , written '' ) upon the celestial sphere . this imaginary sphere is a very practical tool for positional astronomy . the equator divides the earth into the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere . similarly , the celestial sphere is divided by projecting the equator into space . this divides the sphere into the north celestial hemisphere and the south celestial hemisphere . one can also locate the celestial tropic of cancer , celestial tropic of capricorn , north celestial pole , and south celestial pole . the earth rotates from west to east around its axis in slightly less than 24 hours . the celestial sphere and all objects on it appear to rotate from east to west around the celestial poles in the same time . this is the diurnal motion ( `` daily motion '' ) . this is why stars will rise in the east and set in the west , ( unless a star is circumpolar ) . on the next night a particular star will rise again , but with our normal clocks running a 24-hour 0-minute cycle , it will do so slightly less than 4 minutes earlier . by the following night the difference will be 8 minutes , and so forth with every following night ( or day ) .
