Tyndale Bible     the tyndale bible generally refers to the body of biblical translations by william tyndale . tyndale ’ s bible is credited with being the first english translation to come directly from hebrew and greek texts . the term `` tyndale 's bible '' is not strictly correct , because tyndale never published a complete bible . prior to his execution tyndale had only finished translating the entire new testament and roughly half of the old testament . the chain of events that led to the creation of tyndale ’ s new testament started in 1522. it was in this year that tyndale illegally acquired a copy of martin luther ’ s german new testament . tyndale was inspired by luther ’ s work and immediately set out to imitate luther ’ s work but in english . he made his purpose known to the bishop of london at the time cuthbert tunstall . however tunstall rejected tyndale ’ s offer of creating an up-to-date modern english bible . after this rejection tyndale moved to the continent and ended up in hamburg where he completed his new testament in 1524 .
