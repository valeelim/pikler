Claystone     a claystone is a mudrock which does not split easily . in order for a rock to be a claystone , it must be up to half ( 50 % ) clay , whose particles measure less than 1/256 of a millimeter . there are 35 recognized clay mineral species on earth , they make muds stick together ( 'cohesive ' ) , or able to flow ( 'plastic ' ) . clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks . most materials in nature are clay minerals , but quartz , feldspar , iron oxides , and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral . for a size comparison , a clay-sized particle is 1/1000 of a sand grain . this means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity , thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement . the formation of clay is well understood , and can come from soil , volcanic ash , and glaciation . ancient mudrocks are another source , because they weather and disintegrate easily .
