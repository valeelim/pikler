Xanthan gum     xanthan gum is a polysaccharide ( a complex form of sugar ) . it is added to certain foods , such as salad dressings , to make them thicker . it is also added to cosmetics to keep the ingredients from separating . to make xanthan gum , workers deliberately add a kind of bacterium , `` xanthomonas campestris '' , to glucose or sucrose . they let the mixture ferment for a while , and then add isopropyl alcohol to separate the polysaccharide from the mixture . they dry the polysaccharide , grind it into a powder , then add it to a liquid . the xanthan gum is then ready to use . allene rosalind jeanes and her research team at the united states department of agriculture first discovered xanthan gum . the team was studying many biopolymers to see whether some of them were useful , and how they could be used . the kelco company was the first company to produce xanthan gum in the early 1960s . at that time , kelco called xanthan gum by its brand name , kelzan . later , in 1968 , xanthan gum was tested and declared safe to be used in food . the usa , canada , europe , and many other regions and countries now accept xanthan gum as a safe food additive .
