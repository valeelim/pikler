Elastic collision     an elastic collision is when two objects collide and bounce back with little or no deformation . for example , two rubber balls bouncing together would be elastic . two cars hitting each other would be inelastic , as the cars crumple , and do not bounce back . in a perfectly elastic collision ( the simplest case ) , no kinetic energy is lost , and so the kinetic energy of the two objects after the collision is equal to their total kinetic energy before the collision . elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms ( heat , sound ) . the other rule to remember when working with elastic collisions is that momentum is conserved . consider two particles , indicated by subscripts 1 and 2. let `` m '' and `` m '' be the masses , `` u '' and `` u '' be the velocities before the collision and `` v '' and `` v '' be the velocities after collision . since it is an elastic collision , the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision .
