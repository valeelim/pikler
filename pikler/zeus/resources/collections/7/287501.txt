Steampunk     steampunk is a style of fiction having to do with a semi-fictional world where old machinery from the victorian 19th century is still being used . technologies that were new or important to the victorians , such as steam power , clockwork or electricity , are big themes in steampunk . important influences on steampunk are the victorian `` scientific romances '' , the first science fiction novels . authors like jules verne and h.g . wells are still very popular . modern novels often cross-over with goth and vampire themes . the fictional style has become an active 'scene ' where steampunks dress in costume and attend meetings or conventions . this costume is a large part of the scene . many steampunks spend lots of time sewing their own outfits , or collecting accessories such as hats and goggles . the `` maker '' movement involves many people who are both makers and steampunks . they make contraptions , fanciful devices as either art or a pretended function . some of these contraptions are as large as cars , buses or even a steam-powered mobile house .
