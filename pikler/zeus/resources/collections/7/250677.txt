Dung beetle     dung beetles are beetles that feed partly or only on the dung of mammals . they are a kind of scarab beetle . all these species belong to the superfamily scarabaeoidea , and most of them to the family scarabaeidae . the subfamily scarabaeinae alone has more than 5,000 species . there are dung-feeding beetles in other related families , such as the geotrupidae ( the 'earth-boring dung beetles ' ) . many dung beetles , known as `` rollers '' , roll dung into balls , which are used as a food source or brooding chambers . other dung beetles , known as `` tunnelers '' , bury the dung wherever they find it . a third group , the `` dwellers '' , neither roll nor burrow : they simply live in dung . they are often attracted by the dung burrowing owls collect . dung beetles are not a single taxonomic group : dung feeding is found in a number of beetle families . the behaviour probably evolved more than once . - coleoptera ( order ) , beetles - scarabaeoidea ( superfamily ) , scarabs ( most families in the group do not use dung )
