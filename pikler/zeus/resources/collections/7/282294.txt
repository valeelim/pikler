Conodont     conodonts are an extinct class of the phylum chordata . they are now regarded as vertebrates , though the issue is still a live one . for many years conodonts were known only from their feeding apparatus , which fossilises well . this is because most of the conodont animal was soft-bodied , so everything but the teeth were not fossilised in normal circumstances . it was not until early 1980s that the conodont teeth were found with trace fossils of the host organism . it came from the lower carboniferous lagerst√§tte near edinburgh , scotland . the 'teeth ' , called conodont 'elements ' , are very common in the fossil record , and have been used in biostratigraphy . they are also used as palaeothermometers . this is because under higher temperatures the phosphate undergoes colour changes , which are measured with the `` conodont alteration index '' . this has made them useful for petroleum exploration in rocks dating from the cambrian to the upper triassic . eleven fossil imprints of conodont animals are known . they depict an eel-like creature with 15 or , more rarely , 19 elements forming a bilaterally symmetrical array in the head . this array was a feeding apparatus different from the jaws of modern animals .
