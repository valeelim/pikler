Pelorosaurus     pelorosaurus conybeari is the name given to a few sauropod dinosaur bones from the lower cretaceous period , about 138â€“112 million years ago . bones of `` pelorosaurus '' have been found in england and portugal . it was a brachiosaur , with front legs that were longer than its hind legs . the name has been challenged , and has been the subject of long-lasting dispute . some palaeontologists prefer the name cetiosaurus brevis . the taxonomic status of `` pelorosaurus '' is as a result very problematic . technically , `` cetiosaurus brevis '' is its type species . the position of `` pelorosaurus '' is further undermined by the fact that several researchers hold that the genus is a `` nomen dubium '' ( 'doubtful name ' ) . `` pelorosaurus '' was one of the first dinosaurs described , and the naming procedures were not so well-developed at the time . its life-style is assumed to be similar to other brachiosaurs , eating from the higher branches of tall conifer trees .
