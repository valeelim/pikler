One-party state     a one-party state is a form of government where the country is ruled by a single political party , meaning only one political party exists and the forming of other political parties is forbidden . some countries have many political parties that exist , but only one that can by law be in control , which is called a one-party dominant state . in this case opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed , but have no real chance of gaining power . for example , in china all power is vested in the communist party of china . other parties are allowed to exist only if they accept the leading role of the communist party . the soviet union from 1922-1991 , nazi germany from 1933-1945 , italy under benito mussolini from 1922-1943 , and various eastern bloc states are some the best known examples of one-party states in history . some one-party states are considered dictatorships and called a police state or a military dictatorship , if a secret police force or the military is used to keep a dictator in power through force .
