Antimony trioxide     antimony trioxide , also known as antimony ( iii ) oxide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is sbo . it has antimony and oxide ions in it . it has antimony in its +3 oxidation state . antimony trioxide is a white solid . it is the most common antimony compound . it does not dissolve in water . it reacts with oxidizing agents to make antimony pentoxide and with reducing agents to make antimony or stibine . it reacts with concentrated acids to make antimony ( iii ) salts and dissolves in strong bases . antimony trioxide is found in two minerals , valentinite and senarmontite . valentinite is a white mineral that is sometimes pale yellow . antimony trioxide is made when antimony is made . stibnite is heated with air to make antimony trioxide . it is separated from arsenic by the boiling of the arsenic trioxide before the antimony trioxide boils . antimony trioxide can also be made by a two step process . stibnite is burned in air with calcium chloride to make calcium sulfate and antimony trichloride , which is reacted with water to make antimony trioxide .
