Photocatalysis     photocatalysis is using light as a catalyst to increase the rate of a photoreaction . most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system . light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds . for example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight . when light breaks the chemical bonds , free radicals are produced . a free radical is a molecule , atom or an ion that needs an electron . the free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions . photo- is a prefix showing that light is involved . photolysis is when light cuts ( breaks bonds ) of a molecule . in a chemical reaction there are reactants also called reagents that you begin with . once the reaction takes place you have products . in the example below methane ( ch ) and oxygen ( o ) are the reactants and carbon dioxide ( co ) and water ( ho ) are the products . `` ch + 2o â†’ co + 2ho '' catalysis is using a catalyst to change the rate of a chemical reaction . for the reactants to become the products the reaction must overcome an energy barrier . this energy barrier is known as the activation energy ( e ) . for example , when you lit the methane gas you are providing the activation energy to burn ( react ) .
