Quango     quango is an acronym used especially in the united kingdom and the republic of ireland . quangos are arms-length bodies funded by government departments but not run by them . they are given power and paid for by government departments . they were invented because most government departments do two rather different jobs . one is to make policy about how the country should be run , as indicated by laws passed in parliament . this is called administration . their other task is to run or operate the policies in action . examples would be : to run the prison system , to collect taxes , to guard the country 's borders , and so on . quangos were invented to do the second type of task . they are supposed to do some practical job better than a government department could . of course , if they fail , the fault is theirs , rather than the government department 's . the acronym is spelt out in various ways : • `` quasi non-governmental organisation '' , • `` quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation '' , • `` quasi-autonomous national government organisation ''
