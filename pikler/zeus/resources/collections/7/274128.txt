Bismuth(III) oxide    bismuth ( iii ) oxide bismuth ( iii ) oxide , also known as bismite and bismuth trioxide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is bio . it has bismuth and oxide ions in it . the bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state . bismuth ( iii ) oxide is a pale yellow solid . it does not dissolve in water . it dissolves in acids to make other bismuth ( iii ) salts . when it is electrolyzed , it makes a bright red solid , bismuth ( v ) oxide . it has several different crystal structures that have been studied . it reacts with rare earth metal oxides and the products are being studied . bismite is the mineral form of bismuth ( iii ) oxide . it is an ore of bismuth . its mohs hardness is 4.5 to 5 and its specific gravity is quite high , around 8 or 9. it is made when bismuthinite is oxidized . it was first found in nevada in 1868. it can be made by reacting sodium hydroxide with a bismuth ( iii ) salt such as bismuth ( iii ) chloride . it can also be made by igniting powdered bismuth metal . another way of making it is to react bismuth nitrate ( made by dissolving bismuth in nitric acid ) with concentrated sodium hydroxide .
