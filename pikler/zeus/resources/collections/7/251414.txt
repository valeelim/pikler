Blood and soil     blood and soil is an idea that started in the 19th century . it looks at a person 's blood , to see where they come from , and who their ancestors were . it also looks at the soil a person is working on , to make a claim that they should indeed work and occupy that land . in the nineteenth century , the idea was linked to racism and to nationalism . one of the first to use `` blut und boden '' , or `` blood and soil '' was oswald spengler in his book `` der untergang des abendlandes '' . in the book , spengler talks about the `` struggle of blood and soil about the inner form of a relocated species of animal and man '' . walther darr√© took the phrase and established the link . in his book `` neuadel aus blut und boden '' ( new nobility from blood and soil ) he tries to show the relation between economic and agrarian policies , as well as racial ones . another idea of the blood and soil ideology comes from lamarckism : the ethnic characteristics of a population are linked to the geographical regions it inhabits ; only in this region will it be able to fully live up to its potential .
