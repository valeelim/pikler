Myelin     myelin is a substance that forms the coating of axons in the brain and the rest of the central nervous system . this coating is also known as the myelin sheath . it is a substance made of about 80 % lipid and 20 % protein . its main function is to speed the relay of electricity messages in the nervous system . it is milky white and slippery in appearance and texture , giving rise to the term `` white matter '' in the brain . myelin is an important part of proper neural function . in later life , a process called demyelination can occur , causing poor neural function . demyelination may be a cause of alzheimer 's disease . multiple sclerosis happens when myelin is damaged .
