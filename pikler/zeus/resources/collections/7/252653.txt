Peak oil     peak oil is the idea that at some point an oil well , an oil field , a country , or the world , will be producing the most crude oil it can ever produce at one time . after this point , less oil will be produced and therefore people will have to use less oil because it will cost more money . many scientists and governments are concerned about what will happen when there is less oil to go around . the first person to come up with this idea was m.k . hubbert in the 1950s and 1960s , who said that a graph of oil production looks like a curve ( which we now call hubbert 's curve ) . hubbert drew a graph in 1956 that predicted that the united states would reach its peak oil in the early 1970s . the united states did indeed reach its peak oil in the early 1970s . it is unclear as to when the world 's peak oil will happen , though many scientists agree that it was reached in the early 2000s or will be reached before 2020. for example , the international energy agency ( iea ) has said that peak oil may have happened in 2006 .
