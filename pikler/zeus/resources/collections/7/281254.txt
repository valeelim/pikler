Network port     a network port is a number that identifies one side of a connection between two computers . computers use port numbers to determine to which process or application a message should be delivered . as network addresses are like street address , port numbers are like suite or room numbers . any program may use any port , though some port numbers have a standard use and some programs may be limited in which ports they can use for security reasons . firewalls often block access to ports based on the network address and port of the source or destination computer , or the program using the port ( if the firewall is running on the same computer ) .
