One-child policy     the one-child policy ( or family planning policy ) is a policy introduced in the people 's republic of china in the year 1979. mao had thought that a bigger population resulted in a stronger country , but of course they faced a lot more problems . china had went above carrying capacity and there was not enough resources for everyone . in 1979 , the policy was introduced . after the second world war , the chinese population grew quickly . the policy was introduced to control population growth and says that chinese families should only have one child . there are several exceptions to this rule . if a couple wants to have more than one child , they must pay money to the government . in some places in china , couples were able to get a permit so they would not have to pay the fee . because most families would not be able to afford the fee , women were often forced to have an abortion.there were severe punishments for those who had a second child . however , if the first child were to be a female , the couple can try to have a second child , in hopes for a male child . many poor people in china had to back 'backstreet abortions ' which were very dangerous !
