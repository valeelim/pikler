Basin (geology)    basin ( geology ) a geological basin is a large low-lying area . it is often below sea level . geological basins are one of the two most common places inland which collect sediment ( the other is lakes ) . the type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent . the geology is of interest to oil prospectors , hydrologists and palaeontologists . causes . 1. one cause is stretching of the lithosphere ( crust + upper mantle ) . examples : north sea ; nevada basin ; death valley ; red sea . 1. overthrusting of a continental plate , at a plate boundary , causes the plate to flex . part goes up , and part goes down . the downward part becomes a `` foreland basin '' . examples : the ebro basin next to the pyrenees in spain ; the molasse and po river basins next to the alps . 1. rifting can cause basins , as with the dead sea rift . starting around 16 million years ago in the miocene , and continuing into the present , a large part of the north american plate has been stretched by being pulled apart . the result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust ; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years . geologists call this region the basin and range province .
