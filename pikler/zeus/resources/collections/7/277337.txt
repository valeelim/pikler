Charophyceae     the charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants . their exact rank is the matter of some debate . some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes . others classify charophyceae as a class under division charophyta , with chlorophyta remaining a distinct division . there are also other possibilities . the consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants ( embryophytes ) . many of the complex plant traits related to sexual reproduction evolved first in charophyceans . analysis of cpdna ( chloroplast dna ) shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans , before the zygnematales diverged from the lineage that lead to coleochaetales , charales , and the land plants . groups generally included within the charophyceae are : - mesostigmatales - klebsormidiales - zygnematales - desmidiales - charales - coleochaetales
