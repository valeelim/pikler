Habitat destruction     habitat destruction is when a habitat is no longer able to support the plants , animals , or other organisms that live in it . when this happens , the organisms could die . some might move to other places . habitat loss can happen naturally . wildfires can destroy plants that animals need to live in or to eat . lava flows from volcanoes can do the same thing . habitat loss can also be caused by the actions of people . for example , when trees are cut down , birds who nested in the trees can no longer live there . clearing grassland to make habitats for people can take away habitat for other animals . some natural habitats are protected by laws , for example national parks .
