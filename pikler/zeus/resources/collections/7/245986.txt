Planck constant     the planck constant ( planck 's constant ) links the amount of energy a photon carries with the frequency of its electromagnetic wave . it is named after the physicist max planck . it is an important quantity in quantum physics . the planck constant has dimensions of physical action : energy multiplied by time , or momentum multiplied by distance . in si units , the planck constant is expressed in joule seconds ( j⋅s ) or ( n⋅m⋅s ) or ( kg⋅m⋅s ) . the symbols are defined here . in si units the planck constant is about j·s . scientists have used this quantity to calculate measurements like the planck length and the planck time . between 1670 and 1900 scientists discussed the nature of light . some scientists believed that light consisted of many millions of tiny particles . other scientists believed that light was a wave . in 1678 christiaan huygens wrote the book `` traité de la lumiere '' ( `` treatise on light '' ) . he believed that light was made up of waves . he said that light could not be made up of particles because light from two beams do not bounce off each other .
