Irrational number     an irrational number is defined to be any number that is the part of the real number system that can not be written as a complete ratio of two integers . an irrational number can not be fully written down in decimal form . it would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point . these digits would also not repeat . irrational numbers often occur in geometry . for instance , if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter , the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters . this is an irrational number . in decimal for it is written as 1.414213 ... mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number . one well known irrational number is pi . this is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter . this number is the same for every circle . the number pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323â€¦ .
