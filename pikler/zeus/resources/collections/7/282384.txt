Brillat-Savarin cheese     brillat-savarin is a soft , white-crusted cow 's milk cheese with at least 75 % fat in dry matter ( roughly 40 % overall ) , named after the 18th century french gourmet jean anthelme brillat-savarin . the cheese was created in the 1930s by cheese-maker henri androuët . brillat-savarin is produced all year round , mainly in normandy . it comes in 12–13 cm wheels and approximately 4 cm thick , and is aged for one to two weeks . it is also available as a fresh cheese ( non affine ) that resembles rich cream cheese . it is a triple cream brie that is creamy and faintly sour . it goes well with medjool dates and also champagne . because of its creaminess combined with its brie aroma and slight sharpness , it has been described as `` dairylea for grownups '' or `` what dairylea tastes like in heaven '' . pairing with red wines is difficult , as any mushroominess or `` mouldy '' taste will bring out the tannins of the wine . brillat-savarin is also quite salty when ripe , which may disturb the taste of red wine . it does pair well with pale ale and champagne . the carbonation wipes the fattiness from the palate and the malts enhance the creaminess of the cheese .
