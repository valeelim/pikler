Heliosphere     the heliosphere is a bubble in space `` blown '' into the interstellar medium ( the hydrogen and helium gas that fill the galaxy ) by the solar wind . although electrically neutral atoms from interstellar volume can pass through this bubble , almost all of the material in the heliosphere comes from the sun itself . for the first ten billion kilometres of its radius , the solar wind travels at over a million kilometres per hour . as it begins to drop out with the interstellar medium , it slows down before finally stopping altogether . the point where the solar wind slows down is the termination shock ; the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is called the heliopause ; the point where the interstellar medium , travelling in the opposite direction , slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the bow shock . the solar wind is made of particles , charged ( ionized ) atoms from the solar corona , and fields , in particular magnetic fields . as the sun rotates once in about 27 days , the magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral . differences in the sun 's magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in the earth 's magnetosphere .
