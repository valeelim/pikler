Dot product     in mathematics , the dot product is an operation that takes two vectors as input , and that returns a scalar number as output . the number returned is dependent on the length of both vectors , and on the angle between them . the name is derived from the centered dot `` · '' that is often used to designate this operation ; the alternative name scalar product emphasizes the scalar ( rather than vector ) nature of the result . the dot product contrasts ( in three dimensional space ) with the cross product , which produces a vector as result . the dot product of two vectors a = [ `` a '' , `` a '' , ... , `` a '' ] and b = [ `` b '' , `` b '' , ... , `` b '' ] is defined as : where σ denotes summation notation ( the sum of all the terms ) and `` n '' is the dimension of the vector space . in dimension 2 , the dot product of vectors [ a , b ] and [ c , d ] is ac + bd . the same way , in a dimension 3 , the dot product of vectors [ a , b , c ] and [ d , e , f ] is ad + be + cf . for example , the dot product of two three-dimensional vectors [ 1 , 3 , −5 ] and [ 4 , −2 , −1 ] is
