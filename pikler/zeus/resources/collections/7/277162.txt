Cline     in biology , a cline , or 'ecocline ' , describes a series of connected populations in a species . these populations show a continuous gradient of traits and genetics . the term was coined by the english evolutionary biologist julian huxley in 1938. he defined a cline as a species whose members fall into a series of sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area . clines consist of forms of a species that show gradual phenotypic and/or genetic differences over a geographical area . the reason for these differences is that the environment is somewhat different in different parts of the range . populations become adapted to the situation in their areas , but this adaptation is limited by gene flow between neighbouring sub-species . genetically , clines result from the change of allele frequencies within the gene pool of the species in question .
