Antonine Wall     the antonine wall is a stone and turf fortification built by the romans across the midlands of scotland , between the firth of forth ( near modern edinburgh ) and the firth of clyde ( near glasgow ) . the antonine wall is part of the unesco world heritage site called `` frontiers of the roman empire '' . it shares this listing with hadrian 's wall and the german wall known as the limes germanicus . it was the northernmost frontier barrier of the roman empire . it spanned about 39 miles ( 63 km ) , and was about ten feet ( 3 m ) high and fifteen feet ( 5 m ) wide . there was a deep ditch on the north side . the barrier was the second of two `` great walls '' created by the romans in britannia . its ruins are less visible than the better known hadrian 's wall to the south . construction began in ad 142 at the order of roman emperor antoninus pius , and took about twelve years to complete . pressure from the caledonians may have led antoninus to send the empire 's troops farther north . the wall was protected by sixteen forts with a number of small fortlets between them ; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the military way . the soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the barbarians in a number of decorative slabs , twenty of which still survive .
