Thermoregulation     thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to control its body temperature within certain limits , even when the surrounding temperature is different . this is an aspect of homeostasis : the keeping of a constant internal environment . so-called warm-blooded animals control the temperature of their body at quite a high level . this ability is called endothermy . all mammals and birds are endotherms ( homeotherms or homoiotherms ) . the basic source of the heat is chemical energy from the body 's metabolism . they have a number of temperature-control devices : 1. when they are cold they can do things to make themselves warmer . for example , they `` shiver '' , or shake , or run about , or move into a warmer place . this is because all movement by animals creates heat from the chemical reactions of respiration . so polar bears do not freeze because their metabolism produces heat , and movement produces more heat . during hibernation bears exist several degrees lower that they do in active life . of course , warm-blooded animals have thermal insulation : hair , feathers , or in water blubber ( thick fat ) . these adaptations help keep heat energy inside the animal .
