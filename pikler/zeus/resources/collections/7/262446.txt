Phosphorus(III) iodide    phosphorus ( iii ) iodide phosphorus ( iii ) iodide , also known as phosphorus triiodide , is a chemical compound . it is made of phosphorus and iodide ions . it contains phosphorus in its +3 oxidation state . its chemical formula is pi . it is a red solid . it is very unstable and a powerful reducing agent . it reacts violently with water . the reaction with water makes phosphorous acid and hydrogen iodide . it is used in making chemicals . some think that it is too unstable to be stored , but it can be stored and can be bought . phosphorus ( iii ) iodide is made by reacting iodine with white phosphorus dissolved in carbon disulfide . it is dissolved in carbon disulfide because it does not dissolve in water . it can also be made by reacting phosphorus ( iii ) chloride with hydrogen iodide or some other iodide . it reacts with alcohols such as methanol to make `` alkyl iodides '' such as methyl iodide . many times phosphorus ( iii ) iodide is made in the reaction . the alkyl iodides are used in many chemical reactions . related pages .
