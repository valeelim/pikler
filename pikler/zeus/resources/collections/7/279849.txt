Sporangium     a sporangium ( pl : `` sporangia '' ) is an enclosure in which spores are formed . it can be a single cell or multicellular . all plants , fungi , and many other lineages form sporangia at some point in their life cycle . sporangia can produce asexual spores by mitosis , but in nearly all land plants and many fungi , sporangia are the site of meiosis , and produce genetically unique haploid spores . in flowering plants the sporangium tissue ( except the epidermis ) that produces the female spores is also called the nucellus .
