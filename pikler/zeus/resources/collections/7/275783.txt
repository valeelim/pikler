Benoît de Maillet     benoît de maillet ( saint-mihiel , 12 april 1656 – marseille , 30 january 1738 ) was a well-travelled french diplomat and naturalist . he was french consul general at cairo , and overseer in the levant . he formulated an evolutionary hypothesis to explain the earth and its contents . maillet 's geological observations convinced him that the earth could not have been created in an instant because the features of the crust indicate a slow development by natural processes . he also believed that creatures on the land were ultimately derived from creatures living in the seas . he believed in the natural origin of man . maillet made the first reasonable estimate of the earth 's age based on evidence . he thought the earth must have developed by slow , natural forces . he studied geology in the field . he could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea . he hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an indian philosopher , to avoid conflict with the catholic church . his work stayed in manuscript until after his death , when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it . now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts .
