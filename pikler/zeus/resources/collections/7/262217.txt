Song thrush     the song thrush ( usually thrush , `` turdus philomelos '' ) is a member of the passerine songbird family turdidae . it breeds across much of eurasia . it is also known in english dialects as throstle or mavis . the song thrush has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts , and has three recognised subspecies . its distinctive song , which has repeated musical phrases , has frequently been referred to in poetry . the song thrush breeds in forests , gardens and parks , and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern europe , north africa and the middle east ; it has also been introduced into new zealand and australia . although it is not threatened globally , there have been serious population declines in parts of europe , probably due to changes in farming practices . the thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four or five dark-spotted blue eggs . it is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an `` anvil '' on which to smash snails . like other perching birds ( passerines ) , it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey .
