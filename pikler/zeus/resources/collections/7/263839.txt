Crow     crows form the genus corvus in the family corvidae . they are medium to large sized birds , carnivores and scavengers . the genus includes the crow ( carrion crow or hooded crow ) , the rook , jay , jackdaw , the magpie and the large common raven . the genus has 40 or so members on all temperate continents except for south america , and some islands . the `` corvus '' makes up a third of the species in the corvidae . crows appear to have evolved in asia from corvid stock which had evolved in australia . the collective name for a group of crows is a `` flock '' or , more poetically , a `` murder '' . some crow species not only use tools but also make tools . crows are now thought to be , with parrots , among the world 's most intelligent birds . they have a brain size ( adjusted for body size ) as large as some apes . the jackdaw and the european magpie have a `` nidopallium '' about the same relative size as the equivalent neocortex in chimpanzees , and significantly larger than is found in the gibbon . a story of how a girl fed crows , and in return they brought her tiny gifts , shows what the birds are capable of .
