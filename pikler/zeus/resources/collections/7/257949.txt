Electroplating     electroplating is the coating of an object with a metal . it is done by immersing the object and a bar of the metal in a solution containing the metal ions . electric current is then applied ; the positive goes to the metal and the negative goes to the object . the metal bar dissolves in the solution and plates out on the object , forming a thin but durable coating of metal . it is often used to gold-plate objects for decoration or to stop corrosion . normally the metal becomes fragile , and is only used for display .
