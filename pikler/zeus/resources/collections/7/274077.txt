Metric time     metric time is a way of measuring how long a period of time is using the metric system . the metric system uses the second as a main unit of time . there are periods of time that are based on the second but shorter . they are named with metric prefixes . some of these are kiloseconds and milliseconds . other units of time , like the minute , hour , and day , are accepted for use with the modern metric system , but are not part of it . the metric system was first used in france in 1795. it had units for length , area , dry volume , liquid capacity , weight or mass , and even amounts of money , but not for time . decimal time of day had been first used in france two years earlier , but was set aside at the same time the metric system was started , and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units . james clerk maxwell and elihu thomson ( through the british association for the advancement of science - baas ) came up with the centimetre gram second system of units ( cgs ) in 1874 .
