Ossicles     the ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body . they may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles . they are in the auditory system of all mammals . they are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth ( cochlea ) . the absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness . the ossicles are , in order from the eardrum to the inner ear ( from superficial to deep ) , the malleus , incus , and stapes . the terms mean hammer , anvil , and stirrup . - the malleus ( hammer ) connects with the incus and is attached to the tympanic membrane ( eardrum ) , from which vibrational sound pressure motion is passed . - the incus ( anvil ) is connected to both the other bones . - the stapes ( stirrup ) connects with the incus and is attached to the membrane of the `` fenestra ovalis '' , the elliptical or oval window or opening between the middle ear and the inner ear . studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary , which is part of the lower jaw . these are ossified ( turned into bone ) portions of cartilage -- called meckel 's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw . as the embryo develops , the cartilage hardens to form bone . later in development , the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area . the structure is known as the middle ear , and is made up of the incus , stapes , malleus , and tympanic membrane . these correspond to the quadrate , prearticular , articular , and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates .
