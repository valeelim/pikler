J/ψ particle     j/ψ mesons ( pronounced jeɪ/saɪ , english jay/sigh ) are subatomic particles made of one charm quark and one charm antiquark . mesons are a family of composite particles which are made of one quark and one antiquark . the discovery of j/ψ mesons was huge because it revealed the existence of the fourth known quark of the time , the charm quark . j/ψ mesons were used in an attempt to learn more about quark-gluon plasmas , but no conclusive results were found . the name j/ψ comes from the chosen names from the two labs that found them , one of which chose the letter j , while the other chose the greek letter ψ ( psi ) .
