Creodont     the creodonta are an extinct order of mammals which lived from the palaeocene to the miocene epoch . they are distant relatives of the carnivora . creodonts were the dominant group of carnivorous mammals from 55 to 35 million years ago ( mya ) in the ecosystems of africa , eurasia and north america . they competed with the mesonychids and the entelodonts and ultimately outlasted them . in oligocene africa , they were the dominant predatory group . at last , they lost ground to the carnivora . the carnivora are the only group to survive today . the last creodont genus went extinct 8 million years ago , and modern carnivores now occupy their ecological niches . the first creodont fossils were in the palaeocene , about 60 million years ago ( mya ) , and the last `` dissopsalis '' , perhaps 8 mya . so , the creodonts lasted for at least 50 million years . creodonts show various adaptations to their carnivorous life-style , and show convergent evolution with modern carnivores . they share , for example , the carnassial shear , a modification of teeth that sliced meat like scissors .
