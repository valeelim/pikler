Notochord     the notochord is a flexible , rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates . it forms the axis of the embryo . in some chordates , it persists throughout life as the main support down the length of the body . in most vertebrates it is replaced by the vertebral column . the notochord is found ventral ( underneath ) the neural tube ( future spinal cord ) . notochords were the first `` backbones '' in chordates . notochords were advantageous to primitive fish-ancestors : they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment , but flexible enough to allow movement . embryos of vertebrates have notochords , and develop the vertebral column later .
