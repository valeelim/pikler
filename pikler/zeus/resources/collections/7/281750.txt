Antelope     antelope is a term for many even-toed ungulate species . this is not a strict taxonomic term ; they are not a clade . antelope is a 'wastebasket taxon ' in the family bovidae . it includes the old-world species which are not cattle , sheep , buffalo , bison , or goats . antelope are found mostly in africa below the sahara , and parts of asia . no antelope are native to north america : the pronghorn is a member of the family antilocapridae , another family . true antelope have horns which are unbranched and never shed , while pronghorns have branching horns , and shed annually . there are 91 species of antelope , most of which are native to africa , in about 30 genera . a group of antelope is called a herd . species of forest , woodland , or bush tend to be sedentary , but many of the plains species undertake huge migrations . these migrations enable grass-eating species to follow the rains and therefore their food supply . the gnus and gazelles of east africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals .
