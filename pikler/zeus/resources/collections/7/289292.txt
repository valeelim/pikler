Radiation hardening     radiation hardening is the designing of electronic parts and systems so they can withstand the damage done by ionizing radiation . such radiation occurs in outer space and when flying at high altitudes in the van allen radiation belts . they also occur in nuclear explosions , and near nuclear reactors and other sources of radiation . there are many techniques which can achieve hardening . the mram , magnetoresistive random access memory , is proposed as the solution to long-lasting electronic memory . this is the heart of radiation resistance , because if the system memory is undamaged , the system can be rebooted .
