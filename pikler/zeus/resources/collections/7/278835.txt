Rotes Rathaus     the red city hall ( ) is the town hall of berlin , in the mitte borough on rathausstraße near alexanderplatz . it is the home to the governing mayor and the government ( the senate of berlin ) of the federal state of berlin . the landmark building got its name from the red clinker bricks with which it is covered . the rathaus was built between 1861 and 1869 in the style of the north italian high renaissance by hermann friedrich waesemann . it was modelled on the old town hall of toruń , now in poland , while the architecture of the tower is reminiscent of the cathedral tower of notre-dame of laon in france . it replaced several individual buildings dating from the middle ages and now fills an entire city block . the building was heavily damaged by allied bombing in world war ii and rebuilt to the original plans between 1951 and 1956. the `` neues stadthaus '' , which survived the bombing and had been the head office of the berlin city fire insurance company in parochialstraße was the temporary city hall for the post-war city government for all four sectors of berlin until september 1948. following that time , it housed only those of the soviet sector . the reconstructed rotes rathaus , then in the soviet sector , served as the town hall of east berlin , while the rathaus schöneberg in schöneberg borough was seat of the west berlin senate . after german reunification , the administration of reunified berlin officially moved into the rotes rathaus on 1 october 1991 .
