Oh! Darling    oh ! darling `` oh ! darling '' is a song of the beatles written by paul mccartney ( credited to lennon/mccartney ) and is the fourth song on the `` abbey road '' album . mccartney later said , `` when we were recording 'oh ! darling ' i came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear . i wanted it to sound as though i 'd been performing it on stage all week . '' in a 1980 interview with `` playboy '' magazine , john lennon said , `` 'oh ! darling ' was a great one of paul 's that he did n't sing too well . i always thought i could have done it better—it was more my style than his . he wrote it , so what the hell , he 's going to sing it . '' george harrison described the song as `` a typical 1950s–'60s-period song because of its chord structure . '' after an early attempt at this song on 27 january 1969 during the `` let it be '' sessions , lennon announced , `` just heard that yoko 's divorce has just gone through '' , after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song , singing `` i 'm free at last '' instead of a part of the lyric .
