Artivism     artivism combines art and activism . artivism developed since the berlin wall collapsed while the anti-globalization and antiwar protests emerged and proliferated . in most of the cases artivists attempt to push political agendas by the means of art and especially , but not only street art . protesting against the war in vietnam , american `` hippies '' could use poetry , songs , sittings and other non traditional demonstration techniques . in 1993 , act up-paris put a gigantic pink condom on the concord obelisk . it was land art in a way . and it rose interest in france about vih infection risks . in mexico the `` intergalactic '' anonymous chiapas mouvement used `` phony icons '' , like sub-commander marcos to attract attention from the media . in some cases , in paris in 2003 for instance , artivists were arrested for acts of political art that verged on property destruction . a typical short term goal of artivists is to reclaim public space , especially by subvertising or destroying ads in urban areas or city transportation systems . nevertheless , artivists engage in different media like the internet not only for actions which could be described as hacktivism .
