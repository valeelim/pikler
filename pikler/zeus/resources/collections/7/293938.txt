Fukushima nuclear disaster     the fukushima nuclear disaster is a series of ongoing equipment failures , reactor meltdowns , and releases of radioactive materials at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant , following the t≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami on march 11 , 2011. the plant has six separate nuclear reactors maintained by the tokyo electric power company ( tepco ) . the accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the 1986 chernobyl disaster , but more complex as all reactors are involved . at the time of the quake , reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance . the remaining reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake , but the entire plant was flooded , including low-lying generators and electrical switchgear in reactor basements and external pumps for supplying cooling seawater . the connection to the electrical grid was broken . all power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat . there was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1 , 2 , and 3 ; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1 , 3 , and 4 ; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2 ; fires broke out at reactor 4. despite being initially shutdown , reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat . spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped .
