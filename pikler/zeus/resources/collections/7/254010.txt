AIDS orphan     an aids orphan is a child who became an orphan because at least one of their parents died of aids . ( an orphan is a child with no parents . ) the joint united nations programme on hiv/aids ( unaids ) , the world health organization ( who ) and the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , use the term `` aids orphan '' to talk about children whose mothers died of aids before the child 's 15th birthday , whether the child 's father is still alive or not . because of this , some people say that 80 % of all `` aids orphans '' still have one parent who is still alive . there are 70,000 new aids orphans a year . people in the past have guessed that by the year 2010 , over 20 million children would be aids orphans . because most people who get aids are people who have sex , most people who die of aids are people who make most of their family 's money ( because most people who have sex are old enough to work ) . this means that many aids orphans need help from their country 's government to live , and need money . this happens a lot in africa especially .
