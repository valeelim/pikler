Electrical impedance     electrical impedance is the amount of opposition that a circuit presents to current or voltage change . the two main ways to write an impedance are : 1. with the resistance `` r '' ( real part ) and the reactance `` x '' ( imaginary part ) , for example formula_1 1. with a magnitude and a phase ( the size formula_2 and the angle formula_3 ) , for example formula_4 ( 1.4 ohm at 45 degrees ) the impedance and the resistance are quite similar : in the case of resistance , a resistor resists any current going through it . the higher the resistance , the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current . the formula is : formula_5 , where v is the voltage , r is the resistance , and i is the current . in the case of impedance , an inductor resists changes to the current and the capacitor resists changes to the voltage . the key difference between resistance and impedance is the word `` change '' , the rate of change affects the impedance . usually the `` change '' is expressed as a frequency , the number of times per second the current or voltage change direction . the formulas are :
