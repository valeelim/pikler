Aliens of the Deep     aliens of the deep is a 2005 documentary movie , directed in part by james cameron and filmed in the imax 3d format . it was produced by walden media and buena vista pictures . cameron worked with nasa scientists to explore the mid-ocean ridges , under water chains of mountains in the atlantic and pacific oceans that are home to some of the planet 's more unusual forms of life . cameron joins up aboard the russian research ship , `` akademik mstislav keldysh '' , with a group of nasa scientists , as well as some russian marine biologists , to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the atlantic and pacific . the vents have their own unique ecosystem , which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms , swarms of blind white crabs , and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of `` seeing '' water that is heated by the vents . these creatures do not need sunlight like other organisms , and instead get their energy from the vents . they are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water . because of this , the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond earth might look like . as some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem , these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take .
