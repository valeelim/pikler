Matthew (ship)    matthew ( ship ) the matthew was a caravel sailed by john cabot in 1497 from bristol to north america , presumably newfoundland . after a voyage which had got no further than iceland , cabot left again with only one vessel , the `` matthew '' , a small ship ( 50 tons ) , but fast and able . the crew consisted of only 18 people . the `` matthew '' departed either 2 may or 20 may 1497. she sailed to dursey head ( latitude 51Â°36n ) , ireland , from where she sailed due west , expecting to reach asia . however , landfall was reached in north america on 24 june 1497. his precise landing-place is a matter of much controversy , with cape bonavista or st. john 's in newfoundland the most likely sites .
