Nephron     nephrons are tiny tubules ( miniature tubes ) which make up the smallest working part of the kidney . in other words , they are the smallest level where the kidney removes waste , excess salt and excess water . each nephron starts in the cortex of the kidney , then goes into the medulla of the kidney , before coming back to the cortex , then goes through the medulla into the pelvis . in the pelvis , the nephrons join up with the ureter . in humans , a normal kidney has between 800,000 and 1.5 million nephrons .
