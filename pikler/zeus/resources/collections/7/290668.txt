Incertae sedis     in taxonomy , the term incertae sedis ( abbreviated inc . sed . ) is used for a taxon when its broader relationship to other taxa is unknown . the first person who used the term in botany was probably antoine-laurent de jussieu . in his book `` genera plantarum '' of 1789 he listed a few `` plantae incertae sedis '' . reasons why a taxon might be classified as `` incertae sedis '' include : - the description is not detailed enough to permit a clear classification . - a scientific publication about a taxon does not focus on its classification . the taxon is labeled `` incertae sedis '' , because the authors of the publication do not want to `` guess '' where the taxon belongs . - different researchers may have different opinions of where a taxon should be classed . until the conflicts are resolved , the taxon is classed as `` incertae sedis '' .
