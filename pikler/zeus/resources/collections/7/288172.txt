Baldwin apple     the baldwin apple is a bright red winter apple , very good in quality , and easily shipped . it was for many years the most popular apple in new england , new york , and for export from america . according to local tradition , the apple was found near wood hill by william butters ( 1665-1746 ) , son of will butter , first white settler in what is now wilmington , massachusetts . william butters raised the tree in his yard , near the present baldwin apple monument `` ( pictured ) '' . according to s. a. beach 's `` apples of new york '' , the baldwin originated soon after 1740 as a chance seedling on the farm of mr. john ball of wilmington , massachusetts , and for about 40 years thereafter its cultivation was confined to that immediate neighborhood . the farm eventually came into the possession of a mr. butters , who gave the name `` woodpecker '' to the apple because the tree was frequented by woodpeckers . the apple was long known locally as the `` woodpecker '' or `` pecker '' . it was also called the `` butters '' . deacon samuel thompson , a surveyor of woburn , massachusetts , brought it to the attention of col. loammi baldwin of the same town . baldwin grew the apple and spread it across eastern massachusetts . from col. baldwin 's interest in the variety it came to be called the baldwin .
