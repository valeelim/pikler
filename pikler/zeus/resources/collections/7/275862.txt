Frame-dragging     frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic , and particles in it will exchange energy with it . in the scientific world , `` elastic '' means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object ( which will cause it to bend ) and then remove the force , the object will return to its original shape and energy state . also , space is referred to as spacetime , which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time . this basically means that whenever space is affected , time is affected . frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity , strong force , and wave-particle duality ( how things like electrons can act like waves and particles at the same time ) . in frame dragging , particles spin , and this spin has energy in it . ( it is important to note that this is not quantum physics spin , but an actual angular momentum spin ; the particles are actually spinning ) . since spacetime is elastic in this theory , it can absorb the energy ( spin ) of the particle . this would slow down the spin of the particle .
