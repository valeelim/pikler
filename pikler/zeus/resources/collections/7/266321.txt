Galileo thermometer     a galileo thermometer or galilean thermometer is a thermometer that uses the density of liquids to measure temperature . the thermometer was invented by galileo galilei , who had noticed that the density of a liquid changes with temperature . the thermometer is made of a glass container , filled with a liquid . inside , there are other containers , usually with other liquids . when the temperature changes , so does the density of the `` container '' liquid . as a consequence , the smaller containers may fall to the floor , or rise to the surface . usually , such thermometers are calibrated , to either 2° or 1° . the temperature is then that of the bulb with the lowest temperature , floating above . now , galileo thermometers are used mainly for decoration rather than for measuring temperature , although you can still read the temperature off them .
