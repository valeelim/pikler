Praetorian Guard     the praetorian guard was a force of bodyguards used by roman emperors . the title was first used for the guards of generals in the roman republic . their commander , the praetorian prefect , was often an important figure in the political scheming in rome . the guard was dissolved by emperor constantine i in the fourth century ad . the term `` praetorian '' derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a roman army in the fieldâ€“the `` praetorium '' . it was a habit of many roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person . this elite group of roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry . in time , this cohort came to be known as the `` cohors praetoria '' , and various notable figures possessed one , including julius caesar , mark antony and augustus ( octavian ) . as caesar discovered with the 10th legion `` equestris '' , a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field . when augustus became the first ruler of the roman empire in 27 bc , he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also . thus , from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces , augustus recruited the praetorian guard .
