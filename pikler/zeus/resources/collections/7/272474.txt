Skimboarding     skimboarding is a form of shallow water surfing . when the waves at shallow water were poor , surfers would often attempt to surf in shallow breaking water . this led to the making of smaller , lighter boards , named skimboards for the way they allow the user to skim across the surface of the water . lifeguards were quick to adopt these new boards and used skimboarding as a way to quickly move up and down the beach in shallow water . skimboarding has progressed and is now a recognized sport . competitions are held each year around the world and produce large amounts of revenue for the market interested in this sport . these competitions also allow skimboarders to exhibit maneuvers that technology , evolution and skill have made possible .
