Phosphor     a phosphor is a chemical compound that emits light when it is exposed to light of a different wavelength ( i.e . color ) . phosphors do not contain the chemical element phosphorus , which can be made to glow a different way . this sometimes causes confusion . phosphors are used in many types of lighting , including fluorescent bulbs where they change the ultraviolet light produced by excited mercury vapor into visible light . the chemistry of phosphors varies greatly depending on what the phosphor is to be used for . phosphors include 'glow in the dark ' materials that can be found in novelties , toys , and emergency safety lighting for buildings . they are used in the screens of older style cathode ray tube televisions to make visible light from an electron beam . they can also be used to visibly detect ionizing radiation . light-emitting diodes are devices that often use phosphors to obtain a particular color or color temperature . related pages . - light bulb - light - neon lamp
