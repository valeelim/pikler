Death mask     a death mask is a wax or plaster cast made of a person ’ s face after their death . death masks may be mementos of the dead , or be used for creation of portraits . it is sometimes possible to tell if paintings have been copied from death masks , because shape of the face is changed by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold . in some cultures a death mask may be a clay or other item placed on the face of the dead person before burial rites . the best known of these are the masks used by ancient egyptians as part of the mummification process , such as tutankhamon ’ s burial mask . in the 17th century in some european countries , it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased , displayed at state funerals . during the 18th and 19th centuries they were also used to keep a record the faces of unknown bodies . this is now done with photographs . phrenologists and ethnographers also used both death masks and life masks ( taken from living people ) for scientific and pseudoscientific purposes .
