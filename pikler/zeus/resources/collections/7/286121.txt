Ball and socket joint     a ball and socket joint ( enarthrosis , spheroidal joint ) is a joint in which the ball-shaped surface of a bone fits into the cup-like indentation of another bone . this type of joint allows the bone to move in a 360° angle—with more freedom than other joints . examples of this type of joint occur : - in the hip , where the rounded head of the femur ( ball ) rests in the cup-like acetabulum ( socket ) of the pelvis . - in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder , where the rounded head of the humerus ( ball ) rests in the cup-like glenoid fossa ( socket ) of the shoulder blade .
