Tammar wallaby     the tammar wallaby ( `` macropus eugenii '' ) are a small species of wallaby from australia . they were the first macropods to be seen by europeans . francisco pelsaert , captain of the batavia , saw them when the ship was wrecked on the abrolhos islands in 1629. he said they looked like hopping cats . there are three sub-species of tammar wallaby : - `` m. e. eugenii '' from mainland south australia . - `` m. e. derbianus '' from western australia . - `` m. e. decres '' , the darma or dama wallaby , from kangaroo island , south australia . the name tammar comes from the word `` tamma '' , meaning sheoak . the wallaby lives under sheoak plants . tammar wallabies became extinct on mainland south australia in the 1930 's . extinction has been caused by habitat destruction , hunting , and foxes . in 1998 a small population of south australian wallabies was found living on kawau island near auckland , in new zealand . this group had been established by former south australian governor , sir george grey in 1862 as part of his own private zoo . in new zealand these wallabies were seen as a pest , and scientists have been studying ways to get rid of them . 85 wallabies were taken back to south australia . after extensive fox controls at innes national park , 10 wallabies were released in november 2004. another 36 were released in june 2005. these first releases were tracked with radio collars . another group has been put into a captive breeding program at monarto zoo .
