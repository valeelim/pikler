Vim     vim ( vi improved ) is a text editor that is common on many unix-based operating systems . vim is primarily used by programmers . vim is widely popular because it allows users to do many functions on a document ( save , search , scroll , etc . ) by pressing as few keys as possible . however , the counterargument to this made by people who do n't like vim is that many of these keystrokes are confusing and do n't make sense . there is an internet turf war between programmers that prefer vim and programmers that prefer emacs , another common text editor .
