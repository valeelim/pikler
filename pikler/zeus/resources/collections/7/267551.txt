Mountain pass     in a group of hills or mountains , a pass is a path for crossing a mountain . it is usually a saddle point between two higher areas . many of the world 's mountain ranges have always made travel difficult so passes have been important throughout history in trade , war and migration . a pass has the general form of a saddle between two mountains . they are often found just above the source of a river , making a sort of `` bridge '' over to the headwaters of another river . passes may be very short , with steep slopes to the top of the pass , or valleys of many kilometers . roads and railways have been built through passes . some high and rugged passes may have tunnels dug underneath to let traffic move faster . the top of a pass is often the only flat ground in the area so it is often a good site for buildings . for countries whose borders lie on a mountain range , the pass is often part of the border . as well as making travel easy between valleys , passes also provide a route between two mountain tops so it is common for tracks to meet at a pass ; this often makes them good routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor .
