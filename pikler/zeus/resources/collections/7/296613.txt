Main battle tank     a main battle tank ( mbt ) , also called a battle tank , is a tank that is used as the most powerful combat vehicle in modern armies . they were made to replace the medium , medium and heavy tanks used in world war ii with just one tank . lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight . light tanks are still used in some armies that do not need large guns . mbt 's are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles . they also get help from observation or attack aircraft . medium tanks were the earliest mbts . mbts started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks . heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks . the nuclear weapon threat and other anti-tank weapons in the cold war made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat . weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor .
