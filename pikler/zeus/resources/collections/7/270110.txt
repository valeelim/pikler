List of North American dinosaurs     this is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from north america . north america has a rich dinosaur fossil record with great diversity of dinosaurs . this may not mean the dinosaurs were more diverse or abundant ; it may be because substantial resources have been devoted to the north american fossil record . the middle jurassic is the only poorly represented time period in north america , although several middle jurassic localities are known from mexico . footprints , eggshells , teeth , and fragments of bone representing theropods , sauropods , and ornithopods have been found , but none of them are diagnostic to the genus level . the upper jurassic of north america , however , is the exact opposite of the middle jurassic . the upper jurassic morrison formation is found in several u.s. states , including colorado , utah , wyoming , montana , new mexico , oklahoma , south dakota , and texas . it is notable as being the most fertile single source of dinosaur fossils in the world .
