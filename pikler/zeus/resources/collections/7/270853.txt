Araucaria     araucaria is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family araucariaceae . there are 19 species in the genus , with a scattered distribution . they are found in new caledonia ( where 13 species are endemic ) , norfolk island , eastern australia , new guinea , argentina , chile , and southern brazil . the present populations are relicts , and of restricted distribution . they are found in forest and shrubland , in exposed sites . these tall trees are living fossils , dating back to early in the mesozoic era . fossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the cretaceous period . by far the greatest diversity exists in new caledonia , due to the island 's long isolation and stability . araucaria are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem , reaching a height of 30â€“80 m. the horizontal , spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle-like leaves . in some species , the leaves are narrow and shaped like a lance , barely overlapping each other , in others they are broad and flat , and overlap broadly .
