Proposition     a proposition is a term in philosophy and logic . it is a sentence which says something is true or false . the sentence must be a meaningful statement . it must be possible to decide whether the proposition is true or not . it is possible to express the same proposition in many ways , because a proposition is concerned with meaning , not with the mode of expression . two meaningful declarative sentences express the same proposition if and only if they mean the same thing . this defines `` proposition '' in terms of synonymity . for example , `` snow is white '' ( in english ) and `` schnee ist wei√ü '' ( in german ) are different sentences , but they say the same thing , so they express the same proposition . in aristotelian logic , a proposition is a particular kind of sentence , one which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject . aristotelian propositions take forms like `` all men are mortal '' and `` socrates is a man '' . in logical positivism , a proposition whose truth value can not possibly be decided is meaningless . this would include ( in their opinion ) statements about deities .
