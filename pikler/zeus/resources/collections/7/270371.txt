Computer freezing     many modern computers have operating systems that permit several applications or programs to run at the same time . each running program uses one or more so-called `` processes '' , that 's why this situation is generally known as multiprocessing . at times it can happen , that a process stops responding to user input ; the user sees when the computer stops responding to inputs , or it becomes very slow . different causes can cause this scenario : the most frequent are deadlock , race conditions or the system simply having too much to do . in many cases , the only solution is to terminate the processes , which cause so much load . many gui-based operating systems have programs that allow the user to tell the operating system to terminate a process . there may also be command-line programs that do this . when the operating system terminates a process , all unsaved data of the process will be lost . in the case where the operating system detects such a situation , it may show a bsod .
