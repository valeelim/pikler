Copper(II) carbonate    copper ( ii ) carbonate copper ( ii ) carbonate , also known as cupric carbonate , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cuco . it contains copper in its +2 oxidation state . it also contains carbonate ions . copper ( ii ) carbonate is a blue-green solid . it is made when copper is in air for a long time and turns green . the other part of that coating is copper ( ii ) hydroxide . it dissolves in acids to make carbon dioxide and a copper salt . it breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide and copper ( ii ) oxide . it can be made by leaving copper ( ii ) hydroxide in air , which makes copper ( ii ) carbonate . it can also be made by reacting copper sulfate and sodium carbonate . this makes sodium sulfate in solution . copper ( ii ) carbonate can be used to kill algae . it is also used as a pigment . it can irritate the skin . it is toxic since it dissolves in stomach acid to make copper ions in solution , which can be absorbed . related pages . - copper ( i ) chloride - copper ( ii ) chloride
