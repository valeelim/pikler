Remagen     remagen is a town in germany in rhineland-palatinate , in the district of ahrweiler . it is about a one hour drive from cologne , just south of bonn , the former capital of west germany . it is on the river rhine . there is a ferry across the rhine from remagen every 10â€“15 minutes in the summer . remagen has many historic buildings , churches , castles and monuments . cars are banned from the big pedestrian zone which has plenty of shops . overlooking the west bank of the rhine just north of the city centre is a church called the `` apollinariskirche '' . it has an observation deck that is only open to parishioners on sundays . walkers reach the church via a dirt track that passes a series of roadside monuments . one for each of the fourteen stations of the cross . the church grounds contain an outdoor crypt and an abbey . further down the river is one of the many castles along the river rhine , perched even higher than the apollinariskirche . the roman empire built a border fort at rigomagus ( or ricomagus ) , west of the rhine . this was about 12 miles north of the site of the first bridge ever built across the rhine ( at neuwied ) .
