Gauge boson     gauge bosons are carrier particles for three of the four fundamental forces . in the standard model of particle physics , there are four kinds of gauge bosons . the three gauge bosons are as follows : 1. w and z bosons , which carry the weak force 1. gluons , which carry the strong force 1. photons , which carry the electromagnetic force the only remaining fundamental force that has no known gauge boson is gravity . the theoretical gauge boson for gravity is called a graviton . all gauge bosons are bosons , which simply means that two or more of them can exist in the same place at the same time , unlike fermions . it also means that gauge bosons have a spin of 0 or 1. gauge bosons are thought to interact with the higgs field . this theoretical field is believed by many scientists to be responsible for why some gauge bosons – like w and z bosons – have mass , while others – such as photons – do not have mass .
