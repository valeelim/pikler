Concentrate     a concentrate is a special form of a substance , where one of the base components is mostly removed . the most common case is the removal of the solvent from a solution : fruit juice concentrate will have most of the water removed . the benefit of this is that the concentrate takes up less volume , and weighs less than the original solution . this can save transportation costs . when needed , the solvent can simply be added again .
