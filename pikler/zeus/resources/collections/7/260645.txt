Don't Bother Me    do n't bother me `` do n't bother me '' is the first song written by george harrison to appear on an album by the beatles . it was on the group 's `` with the beatles '' album in the uk , released in 1963 , and on their `` meet the beatles ! '' album in the u.s. , released in 1964. harrison wrote the song while sick in bed at a hotel room in bournemouth , england , where the beatles were playing some shows during the summer of 1963. harrison never regarded it highly , saying , `` it was a fairly crappy song . i forgot all about it completely once it was on the album . '' he considered it an exercise in whether he could write a song , later saying , `` at least it showed me that all i needed to do was keep on writing , and then maybe eventually i would write something good . '' harrison received a writing credit for two earlier songs , `` in spite of all the danger '' ( mccartney/harrison ) and `` cry for a shadow '' ( harrison/lennon ) . both were recorded by the beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995 's `` anthology 1 '' compilation . `` do n't bother me '' is considered harrison 's first song by most ( including the composer himself ) .
