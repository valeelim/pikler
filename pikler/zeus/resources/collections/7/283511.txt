Warming center     a warming center is a place where people can go to stay warm and dry when it is rainy or wet outside . they are like homeless shelters , except that they are only open when the weather is bad . their main goal is to make sure that nobody is left out in the cold . many people die from being wet and cold , every year . sometimes when it is windy , trees fall on them . sometimes people get frostbite if it is very cold . but the main thing that people worry about is called hypothermia - that 's when the body temperature gets too low . it can be fatal . when it is cold and windy , the wind chill factor makes it worse . if people are old , drinking , or homeless , things can get very bad very fast if the weather goes bad . these things are all called risk factors . the level of risk goes way up making it more likely that they will become sick or maybe even die out in the cold . scientists study these `` risk factors '' and put them all together with numbers . that kind of study is discussed below ; it is called a `` vulnerability index '' .
