Breccia     breccia is a type of rock formed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained matrix . the matrix may be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments . rocks formed by sticking together pieces of previous rocks ( clasts ) are called clastic rocks . there are two types of clastic rock : conglomerates and breccias . what divides these two categories is the amount of rounding . the particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded , whereas in breccias they are angular . a breccia may have a variety of different origins , as indicated by the named types including sedimentary breccia , tectonic breccia , igneous breccia , impact breccia and hydrothermal breccia . the basic sequence is as follows . sediment is laid down in the sea , and is gradually transformed into sedimentary rock . after a long period of time something violent happens to the rock , breaking it up into many jagged pieces . later the pieces are cemented together by another deposition , forming a new sedimentary rock . this is a breccia . on examination , the rock is seen to include fragments of the original rock .
