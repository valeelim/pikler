Ultramarine     ultramarine is a blue pigment , and the name of a blue colour . the pigment is found naturally . it is ground down from a mineral called lazurite , the main component of lapis lazuli . the colour is due to the presence of sâˆ’3 anions ( trisulfur ) . synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine , since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more uniform than natural ultramarine and therefore diffuse light more evenly . artificial , like natural , ultramarine has a magnificent blue colour . since it is not affected by light or contact with oil or lime , it is used in painting . a small addition of zinc-white ( zinc oxide ) causes the colour to become less vivid ( ~bright ) . synthetic ultramarine , invented in the 1820s , is very cheap . it is largely used for wall painting , the printing of paperhangings and calico . it is also used to correct the yellowish tinge found in things meant to be white , such as linen , paper , etc . bluing or `` laundry blue '' is a solution of synthetic ultramarine ( sometimes , prussian blue ) that is used for this purpose when washing white clothes . large amounts are used in making paper , especially the kind of pale blue writing paper popular in britain . during world war i , the raf painted the outer roundels with a colour based on ultramarine blue . this became bs 108 ( 381c ) aircraft blue . it was replaced in the 1960s by a new coluor based on phthalocyanine blue , bs110 ( 381c ) roundel blue .
