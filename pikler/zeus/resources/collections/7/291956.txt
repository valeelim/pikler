Hoverfly     hoverflies , sometimes called 'flower flies ' or 'syrphid flies ' , are the insect family syrphidae . as their common name suggests , they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers . the adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen , while the larvae ( maggots ) eat a wide range of foods . in some species , the larvae are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams . in other species , the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects . aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year . hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests , and can be used in biological control . some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators . about 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described . hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except antarctica . hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps . they are a classic example of batesian mimicry . the batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf 's clothing : it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting , but in reality it is good to eat . hover flies look roughly like little wasps , and their warning colouration is well-known to birds .
