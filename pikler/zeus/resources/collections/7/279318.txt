Urbi et Orbi     urbi et orbi ( `` to the city of rome and to the world '' ) was a standard opening of proclamations in imperial rome . now `` urbi et orbi '' refers to a papal address and apostolic blessing that is addressed to the city of rome and to the entire world from the apostolic palace in the vatican . usually they are only given at christmas and easter , but also the first speech of a new pope is urbi et orbi , and sometimes one is given to special gatherings of pilgrims in rome and during holy years the blessing after the speech is given in latin , and usually many other languages too . catholics who listen to the blessing , either because they are present at the vatican or because they are listening to the radio or television broadcasts , have their sins forgiven because the blessing includes a plenary indulgence .
