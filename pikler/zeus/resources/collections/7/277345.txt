Extremism     political views and ideas which are far from the mainstream are called extremist . such views often violate common moral standards . as an example , a group that wants to replace a democratic form of government with a totalitarian one is almost always considered extremist . political or religious fundamentalism as well as fanaticism can also be seen as extremist . what is seen as extremist varies by country . people who support that muslim women should wear a burqa may be seen as extremist in france , but such an opinion may not be extremist in afghanistan or saudi arabia .
