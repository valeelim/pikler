Bel and the Dragon     the tale of bel and the dragon is from chapter 14 of the book of daniel . this chapter , along with chapter 13 , is referred to as deuterocanonical , in that it is not universally accepted among christians as belonging to the bible . the story is typically not included in protestant bibles . it is believed by some scholars to have been written in the late 2nd century bc and accounted apocryphal by protestants . the chapter is formed of three independent narratives , which place the culture-hero daniel at the court of cyrus , king of the persians : `` when king astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors , cyrus the persian succeeded to his kingdom . '' there daniel `` was a companion of the king , and was the most honored of all his friends '' ( 14:1 ) . the narrative of bel ( 14:1â€“22 ) is a folk tale ridiculing worship . in it , the king asks daniel `` do you not think that bel is a living god ? do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day ? '' daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children , who entered through a secret door when the temple 's doors were sealed . the priests and their wives and children are killed , and daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of bel and the temple . this version has been cited as an ancestor of the `` locked room mystery '' .
