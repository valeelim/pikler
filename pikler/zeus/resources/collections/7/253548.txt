Badwater Basin     badwater basin is a basin in death valley national park , death valley , california . the water which goes into it does not flow into any ocean . badwater basin is the lowest point in north america , at below sea level . mount whitney , the highest point in the 48 states , is only 76 miles west of the basin . badwater basin has a small natural pool of undrinkable water next to the road . the water comes from a spring . it is called 'badwater ' because people can not drink the water . this is because so much salt has built up from the basin . the pool does have animals and plants living there , including pickleweed , insects , and the badwater snail . the pool is not actually the lowest point of the basin . the lowest point is several miles to the west , the exact point which is lowest changes . however , the salt flats are dangerous to travel across ( in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud ) , therefore the sign states that the lowest point is at the pool , where people can see it . some people say that it is the lowest point in the western hemisphere , but this is not true . the lowest point is actually laguna del carb√≥n in argentina at -105 meters ( -344 feet ) .
