Ballistics     ballistics is a science about the motion of projectiles ( flying objects ) , mainly about bullets which are fired from guns . this science shows us the path and behavior of projectiles . gun ballistics may be divided into the following four categories . - `` internal ballistics '' is about the motion of projectile inside barrel ( tube part of gun ) . this motion depends on the pressure of gas , which come into being by burning gunpowder . pressure depends on ( is connected ) amount of gunpowder in bullet , type of gunpowder , size of pieces of gunpowder , free space behind a bullet and outside temperature . this motion also depends on size and weight of bullet . the most important number from internal ballistics for performance is a muzzle velocity ( projectile speed from the front edge of barrel ) . - `` transition ballistics '' is a science about behavior and changes in the nearest distance from the barrel . it study effect of gases going from a barrel behind a bullet , which are faster than bullet . these gases can negatively ( badly ) effect ballistic path .
