Elephant shrew     elephant shrews , also called sengi , are any of 16 species of rat-sized african mammals named for their long , tapered , and flexible snout ( proboscis ) . all have slim bodies , slender limbs , and very long hind legs and feet . although they resemble shrews , they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order macroscelidea . long thought to be related to shrews , they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews although this was not known or even widely believed until the 1990s . elephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day . their ears and eyes are large , and , when alarmed , they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain , sometimes leaping over obstacles . when foraging , they move along the pathways , using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey , which consists of small insects ( especially ants and termites ) , other arthropods , and earthworms . gestation lasts two months , and litters contain one or two well-developed young .
