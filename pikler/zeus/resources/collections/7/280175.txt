Fingal’s Cave    fingal ’ s cave fingal 's cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of staffa , in the inner hebrides of scotland , part of a national nature reserve owned by the national trust for scotland . it is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns . these are part of the same ancient lava flow as the giant 's causeway in northern ireland and those of nearby ulva . in both cases , the cooling surface of the mass of hot lava cracked in a hexagonal pattern in a similar way to drying mud cracking as it shrinks . these cracks slowly extended down into the mass of lava as it cooled and shrank to form the columns , which were later exposed by erosion . the breakup of pangaea separated the two parts of the same rock formation . the size of the cave , and its naturally arched roof , and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves , give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral . the cave 's gaelic name , uamh-binn , means `` cave of melody . '' romantic composer felix mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote `` die hebriden '' ( in english , `` hebrides overture opus 26 '' , commonly known as `` fingal 's cave overture '' ) , inspired by the weird echoes in the cave . mendelssohn 's overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination . other famous 19th-century visitors included author jules verne ; poets william wordsworth , john keats , and alfred , lord tennyson ; and romantic artist j.m.w . turner , who painted `` staffa , fingal 's cave '' in 1832. queen victoria also made the trip .
