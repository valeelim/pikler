Dental formula     a dental formula is a summary of a mammal 's teeth . almost all mammals have four kinds of teeth : 1. incisors 1. canines 1. premolars 1. molars teeth numbers and form have adapted to different feeding methods . over time , different mammal groups have evolution of distinct dental features , in the number and type of teeth , and in the shape and size of the chewing surface . the number of teeth of each type is written as a dental formula for one side of the mouth , or quadrant , with the upper and lower teeth shown on separate rows . the number of teeth in a mouth is twice that listed as there are two sides . in each set , incisors ( i ) are indicated first , canines ( c ) second , premolars ( p ) third , and finally molars ( m ) , giving i : c : p : m. so for example , the formula 2.1.2.3 for upper teeth indicates 2 incisors , 1 canine , 2 premolars , and 3 molars on one side of the upper mouth . the deciduous dental formula is notated in lowercase lettering preceded by the letter d : e.g . di : dc : dm . an animal 's dentition for either deciduous or permanent teeth can thus be expressed as a dental formula , written in the form of a fraction : i.c.p.m / i.c.p.m .
