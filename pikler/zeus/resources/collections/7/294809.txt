ISO 3166     iso 3166 is a standard made by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) and it uses short codes to name all countries and some other places . people from all over the world can use the same codes ; this is helpful because different languages have different names for many countries . for example , the country english-speakers call `` spain '' is called `` espa√±a '' by spanish-speakers . the iso 3166 has three codes for spain : es , esp , and 724. no other country has any of these codes .
