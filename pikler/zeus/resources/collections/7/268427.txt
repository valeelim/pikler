John Flamsteed     john flamsteed frs ( 19 august 1646 â€“ 31 december 1719 ) was an english astronomer . he was the first astronomer royal , appointed in 1675. flamsteed calculated the solar eclipses of 1666 and 1668. he was responsible for several of the earliest recorded sightings of the planet uranus , which he mistook for a star and catalogued as '34 tauri ' . the first of these was in december 1690 , which remains the earliest known sighting of uranus by an astronomer . flamsteed is also remembered for his conflicts with isaac newton , the president of the royal society at the time . flamsteed was refusing to publish work commissioned by the king , so in 1712 newton and edmond halley published a preliminary version of flamsteed 's `` historia coelestis britannica '' . they did so `` without crediting the author '' . some years later , flamsteed managed to buy many copies of the book , and publicly burnt them in front of the royal observatory . however , the numerical star designations in this book are still used and are known as flamsteed designations .
