Man's Place in Nature    man 's place in nature evidence as to man 's place in nature is an 1863 book by thomas henry huxley , in which he gives evidence for the evolution of man and apes from a common ancestor . it was the first book devoted to the topic of human evolution , and discussed much of the anatomical and other evidence . backed by this evidence , the book said that evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life . in the 18th century linnaeus and others had classified man as a primate , but without drawing evolutionary conclusions . it was lamarck , the first to develop a coherent theory of evolution , who discussed human evolution in this context . robert chambers in his anonymous `` vestiges '' also clearly made the point . the book came five years after charles darwin and alfred russel wallace announced their theory of evolution by means of natural selection , and four years after the publication of darwin 's `` origin of species '' . in the `` origin '' darwin had deliberately avoided tackling human evolution , except for a sentence : `` light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history '' . darwin 's sequel came eight years later , with `` the descent of man , and selection in relation to sex '' ( 1871 ) .
