Eyeborg     an eyeborg or eye-borg is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors . it is mostly used by blind people or by people with color blindness . it works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person , and converts them into musical notes . the first eyeborg was made in england in 2003 by adam montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist neil harbisson . the invention won a british award in innovation ( submerge 2004 ) and a european award in content tools and interface design ( europrix 2004 ) . in 2007 , peter kese , a software developer from slovenia , made further developments to the eyeborg by increasing the number of colors to 360 and adding color intensity through different volume levels . matias lizana , a student from universitat polit√®cnica de catalunya is currently developing the eyeborg into a smaller chip as part of his final year project . the new chip will allow users to hear colors in stereo and to embed the device . other websites .
