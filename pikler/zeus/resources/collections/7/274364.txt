Amoebiasis     amoebiasis , also known as amebiasis or entamoebiasis , is an intestinal infection caused by amoebas of the `` entamoeba '' group . the infection is usually caused by `` entamoeba histolytica '' . the infection is normally got when someone drinks water with the parasite in it . in some cases , the parasite lives in a person 's large intestine and does not cause any symptoms . symptoms vary from serious to none at all . there may be abdominal pain , mild diarrhoea , bloody diarrhoea or severe colitis with tissue death and perforation . this last complication may cause peritonitis . people affected may develop anaemia due to loss of blood . amoebiasis is usually transmitted by water contaminated with faeces . it can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects . infection is spread by ingesting the cyst form of the parasite . this tough and semi-dormant structure is found in faeces . since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water , it is often endemic in parts of the world with poor sanitation ( such as m√©xico , central america , western south america , south asia , and western and southern africa ) .
