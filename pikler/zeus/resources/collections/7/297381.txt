Crevichon     crevichon is an islet off herm , immediately to the north of jethou , in the channel islands according to dr s.k . kellett-smith , it means `` island of crabs , crayfish or cranes '' . like many names in the channel islands it is norman language in origin . a thousand years ago , the water level was ten feet lower , so there were many more of the animals the island was named after . the island is about 212 by 168 metres ( 696 by 551 ft ) at its widest . its area is less than three hectares . the distance to jethou is about 215 metres ( 705 ft ) . a 16th century drawing of the islet , now in the british museum , shows crevichon as apparently a wooded islet . prof. john le patourel , in `` the building of castle cornet '' said that in 1566 , iron and hammers were taken to `` creavissham '' , and the island quarried for the castle . the quarry has been used since then , but this has made the island much smaller , and less visible . as a result , a fifteen-foot marker was built on the top . crevichon may have provided the granite for the steps of st. paul 's cathedral in london .
