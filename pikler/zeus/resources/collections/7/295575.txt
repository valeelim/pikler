Occluded front     an occluded front is a weather pattern . they bring cold weather and leave cold weather.it happens when a cold front joins with a warm front . for example , if the warm front is already there and the cold front comes along , the cold front is heavier than the warm front so will push it up . the warm front slides over the cold one . when the cold front catches up to the a warm front , the warm air is pushed up into the air . this is an occluded front . cloud and rain form along the occluded front until temperatures become equal as the cold and warm air mix .
