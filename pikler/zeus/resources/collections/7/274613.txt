Zhuyin     zhuyin fuhao , often shortened as zhuyin and commonly called bopomofo , is a type of sound-based writing for the chinese language . in chinese , `` bo '' , `` po '' , `` mo '' and `` fo '' are the first four of the conventional ordering of available syllables . as a result , the four syllables together have been used to refer to many different phonetic systems . for chinese speakers who were first introduced to the zhuyin system , `` bopomofo '' means `` zhuyin fuhao '' . the zhuyin characters are represented in typographic fonts as if drawn with an ink brush ( as in regular script ) . they are encoded in unicode in the bopomofo block , in the range u+3105 ... u+312d . after the overthrow of china 's last emperor during the xinhai revolution in 1911 , the new government in china created zhuyin to help the common people read more easily . however , the chinese communist party , including mao zedong himself , wanted to ban writing chinese characters altogether and replace them with the latin alphabet . when the people 's liberation army defeated the kuomingtang ( the founding party of the republic of china ) in 1949 and sent them off to exile in taiwan , the use of zhuyin dropped in mainland china , due to the cpc 's interest of using the latin alphabet for writing chinese phonetically . however , zhuyin is still widely used in taiwan as it is used to type chinese on computer and phone keyboards .
