Heinrich event     heinrich events occurred during the coldest point of `` bond cycles '' in which many icebergs were discharged into the north atlantic and melted . evidence for this can be found in the north atlantic sediment cores which show poorly sorted , angular and contain rocks . these were originally in the icebergs but dropped to the bottom of the ocean when the icebergs melted . heinrich events are a possible trigger to the onset of mini ice ages which follow a long period of thaw . an example might be the younger dryas , a brief cold period from about 12.8 thousand years ago to about 11.5 thousand years ago . the younger dryas stadial is thought to have been caused by the collapse of the north american ice sheets , although rival theories have been proposed .
