Terracotta     terracotta is a red clay-based baked ceramic , usually unglazed . its uses include vessels , water and waste water pipes and surface embellishment in building construction , along with sculpture such as the terracotta army and greek terracotta figurines . the term is also used to refer to items made out of this material and to its natural , brownish orange color , which varies considerably . clay is partially dried and cast , molded , or hand worked into the desired shape . after thorough drying , it is placed in a kiln , or atop combustible material in a pit , and then fired . after pit firing the hot ware is covered with sand to cool , and after kiln firing the kiln is slowly cooled . when unglazed , the material will not be waterproof , but it is suitable for in-ground use to carry pressurized water ( an archaic use ) , for garden ware , and sculpture or building decoration in tropical environments , and for oil containers , oil lamps , or ovens . most other uses such as for table ware , sanitary piping , or building decoration in freezing environments require that the material be glazed . terracotta , if uncracked , will ring if lightly struck , but not as brightly as will ware fired at higher temperature , which is called stoneware . the fired material is weak compared to stoneware .
