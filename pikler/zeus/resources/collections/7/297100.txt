Paulo Freire     paulo freire ( september 19 , 1921 - may 2 , 1997 ) was an educator born in brazil . he developed new ideas about education for the oppressed - people who have been trodden down . paulo freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as plato , but also from modern marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers . in fact , in many ways his `` pedagogy of the oppressed '' ( 1970 ) may be best read as an extension of , or reply to , frantz fanon â€™ s `` the wretched of the earth '' ( 1961 ) , which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern ( rather than traditional ) and anti-colonial ( not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer ) . in `` pedagogy of the oppressed '' ( 1970 ) , freire , talks about the oppressors-oppressed distinction , seeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society : the oppressor and the oppressed . freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction , which stems back to a least hegel in 1802 , and has since been reprised by many authors including engels , marx , lenin , gramsci , simone weil and others .
