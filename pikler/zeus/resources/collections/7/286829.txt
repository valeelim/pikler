Therocephalia     therocephalians ( 'beast-heads ' ) are an extinct group of theriodonts . they lived from the middle permian into the triassic 265—245 million years ago , about 20 million years . the therocephalians are named after their large skulls . their skulls , with the structure of their teeth , suggest that they were successful carnivores . like other non-mammalian therapsids , therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles . in fact therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts , which gave rise to the mammals . this relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features , possibly including whiskers and hair . there remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny , anatomy , and physiology of therocephalians . the fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the karoo of south africa , but have also been found in russia , china , and antarctica . early therocephalian fossils discovered in middle permian deposits of south africa support a gondwanan origin for the group , which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world . although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great permian–triassic extinction event , a few representatives of the subgroup ( called eutherocephalia ) survived into the early triassic and continued to diversify .
