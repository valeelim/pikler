Karl von Frisch     karl ritter von frisch ( 20 november 1886 – 12 june 1982 ) was an austrian ethologist who received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1973 , jointly with niko tinbergen and konrad lorenz . his work was on the communication and senses of the european honey bee . he was the first to translate the meaning of the waggle dance . by doing the dance when they come back to the hive , honey bees indicated where they have found nectar , and other details . his theory was disputed by other scientists and greeted with skepticism at the time . only recently was it definitively proved to be an accurate theoretical analysis . sense of smell : frisch discovered that bees can distinguish various blossoming plants by their scent , and that each bee is “ flower constant ” . polarization pattern : light scattered in a blue sky forms a pattern of partially polarized ultraviolet light . this depends on the position of the sun , and is invisible to human eyes . each lens unit of a compound eye has a uv receptor , and a uv filter oriented differently in each of these units , so a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern . a small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day . this provides not only directional but also information on the time of day .
