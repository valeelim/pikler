Lithium chloride     lithium chloride is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is licl . it contains lithium and chloride ions . lithium chloride is a colorless solid . it makes a bright red color in a flame . it absorbs water , unlike other alkali metal chlorides . it also dissolves more easily in water than other alkali metal chlorides . lithium chloride can be made by igniting lithium and chlorine , but it is difficult because the reaction is violent . this makes the anhydrous ( without water attached ) form . another way is mixing lithium oxide , lithium hydroxide , or lithium carbonate with hydrochloric acid . this makes the hydrate ( water attached to the molecule ) . the hydrous form can be dried to the anhydrous form by heating it with hydrogen chloride gas . lithium chloride is used to make lithium metal . lithium chloride is melted and electrolyzed . this makes liquid lithium metal . it is used to dry air . it is also used as a flux for aluminium . it can be used in making organic compounds . it can be used to color flames red .
