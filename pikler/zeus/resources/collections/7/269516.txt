Regular expression     a regular expression ( abbreviated regexp or regex ) is a way to describe sets of characters using syntactic rules . many programming languages use or support regular expressions . a regular expression is then used by a special program or part of a programming language . this program will either generate a parser that can be used to match expressions or it will match such expressions itself . a regular expression processor is used for processing a regular expression statement in terms of a grammar in a given formal language , and with that examines a text string . a few examples of what can be matched with regular expressions : - the sequence of characters `` car '' appearing consecutively in any context , such as in `` car '' , `` cartoon '' , or `` bicarbonate '' - the sequence of characters `` car '' occurring in that order with other characters between them , such as in `` icelander '' or `` chandler '' - the word `` car '' when it appears as an isolated word - the word `` car '' when preceded by the word `` blue '' or `` red ''
