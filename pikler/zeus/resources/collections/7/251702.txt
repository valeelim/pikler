Constitution of the United Kingdom     the constitution of the united kingdom is a set of laws and rules in the united kingdom that governs how the country is organized and the basic rights and freedoms of the people . the uk 's constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries ' are . in fact , the uk 's constitution is not completely written down at all . some of it can be found in writing , starting with the magna carta of 1215 and the bill of rights act 1689 and including more modern acts of parliament . other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence . because of this , some people say that the united kingdom has a `` de facto '' or `` unwritten '' constitution . using the word `` unwritten '' is a problem , because most british laws and rules are written as statutes , or court judgments , the law of equity and in various treaties . most of these laws come from the parliament of the united kingdom . because most of the constitution is written down in this way , it is not technically correct to call it `` unwritten '' or `` '' de facto '' '' . however , these words are still used . the constitution of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is even more different to most other constitutions in that it is just a normal set of laws , and not a `` higher '' law that the government can not easily change . the constitution has no more authority than any other law in the uk , and the government can change it just by passing a new act .
