Attempted Italian colonization of America     an attempted italian colonization in america was done in 1608 by the grand duke of tuscany , ferdinando i. the italian colonization of the americas was limited to an aborted attempt by the grand duke of tuscany to create a colony in south america in the early 1600s . in 1608 , ferdinando the first of tuscany organized an expedition under captain robert thornton , in order to explore northern brazil and the amazon river and prepare for the establishment of a settlement in northern coastal south america , which would serve as a base to export brazilian wood to renaissance italy . ferdinando the first , grand duke of tuscany , oversaw the only italian attempt to create a colony in the americas . when thornton returned to tuscany a year later , he found ferdinando i dead , and his successor cosimo ii uninterested in the establishment of a colony . thornton was ready to sail back to the area between the rivers orinoco and amazon in the summer of 1609 with italian settlers from livorno and lucca , but the project was scrapped .
