Lymington Branch Line     the lymington branch line is a short line running between brockenhurst and lymington pier . the line is operated by south west trains . there is a station in between called lymington town . the short length of track between lymington town and lymington pier has a line speed of 20mph . the two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail-fans . unit 1497 `` freshwater '' was painted in british rail white and blue while 1498 `` farringford '' was painted in br green . the units were given names of places on the isle of wight as they only ran on this line . until 22 may 22 2010 they were the only emu slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in britain . the line is now operated by 158/9 sprinter units . this means the 750volt dc electric has no longer got a use . this may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines . the reason for this is that `` 450 units '' have 4 cars which are too long for lymington town station . and south west trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit . the only solution then is to use dmu 3 car sprinter units .
