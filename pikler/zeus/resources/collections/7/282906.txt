Adaptive immune system     the adaptive immune system is made of specialized cells and processes which kill pathogens or prevent their attack . the adaptive immune system is switched on by the evolutionarily older innate immune system . this older system is non-specific , whereas the adaptive system is tailored to specific targets . whereas the innate immune system is found in all metazoa , the adaptive system is only found in vertebrates . it is thought to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates . the adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens . the system mounts stronger attacks each time a particular pathogen is encountered . it is `` adaptive '' immunity because the body 's immune system prepares itself for future challenges . the immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defences . in simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism . if a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non-specific response . innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals .
