Christian metal     christian metal , also known as 'white metal ' , is a form of heavy metal music which a christian band makes to praise jesus . christian metal is typically performed by professed christians , sometimes principally for christians who listen to heavy metal music . it is often produced and distributed through various christian networks . christian metal bands exist in all the subgenres of heavy metal music , and the only common link between most christian metal bands are the lyrics . the christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in , regularly providing a christian take on the subject matter . it has been argued that the marginal yet transnational christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and christian identity , and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive alternative or counterbalance to secular metal music which is known for its generally dark and negative message . christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelism to the wider heavy metal music scene , and was pioneered by the american resurrection band and swedish jerusalem . los angeles ' stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s , otherwise the genre was mostly ignored by the mainstream . california 's tourniquet and australia 's mortification led the movement in the 1990s . the metalcore groups underoath , demon hunter , as i lay dying , and norma jean ( dubbed by revolver magazine as `` the holy alliance '' ) brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 21st century , achieving ranks in the billboard 200 .
