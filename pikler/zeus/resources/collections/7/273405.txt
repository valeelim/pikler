Karst     karst is a geological system of rocks where water has eroded ( dissolved ) the bedrock . if it is very extensive , karst can be a geographical or topographical feature . it is classed as a badland if it difficult to travel through the environment , which it often is . almost always , karst is formed in carbonate rocks , such as limestone or dolomite . since carbonate sedimentary rocks are very common , karst areas occur all over the world . many karst regions display distinctive surface features , with sinkholes being the most common . however , karst surface features may be absent where the soluble rock is `` mantled '' ( covered ) , such as by a non-soluble rock strata on top of the carbonate strata . some karst regions include thousands of caves , and the water is generally underground . the world 's largest karst area is the nullarbor plain , part of the area of flat , almost treeless , dry country of southern australia . it is on the great australian bight coast with the great victoria desert to its north . it is the world 's largest single exposure of limestone bedrock , and occupies an area of about . at its widest point , it stretches about from east to west across the border region between south australia and western australia .
