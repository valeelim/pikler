Mahakala     mahakala is a dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the upper cretaceous of 80 million years ago . it is based on a partial skeleton found in the gobi desert , mongolia . `` mahakala '' was a small dromaeosaur , about 70 centimeters long ( 28 in ) . its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early troodontids and avialans . however , its short forearms rule it out of the alialae . despite its late appearance , its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur . its small size , and the small size of other basal deinonychosauria , suggests that small size came before flight in birds . although this individual was small , comparable in size to `` archaeopteryx '' , `` caudipteryx '' , and `` mei '' , it was close to adulthood . this genus can be distinguished from other paravians ( dromaeosaurs , troodonts , and birds ) by details of the ulna , thighbone , ilium , and tail vertebrae . it had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe , with an expanded claw . `` mahakala '' also had very short forelimbs compared to other dromaeosaurs .
