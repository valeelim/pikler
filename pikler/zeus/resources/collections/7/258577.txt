Dromornis     dromornis is a genus of fossil flightless birds . it lived in australia from the late miocene to the early pliocene . this means early humans never met this animal . `` dromornis '' had a huge beak and jaw capable of great force . it did not have the typical beak and claws of a carnivore , and its life style is not certain . though they looked like giant emus , the `` dromornis '' are more closely related to geese . `` dromornis stirtoni '' was three metres ( 10 feet ) tall and weighed up to half a ton ( 500 kilos ) . it inhabited subtropical open woodland in australia during the late miocene . it may have been partly carnivorous . it was heavier than the moa and taller than `` aepyornis '' . `` d. stirtoni '' had a long neck and stub-like wings , so it was flightless . its legs were powerful , but it was not a fast runner . the bird 's beak was large and immensely powerful , leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks . however , others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore . there were forests and a permanent water supply where the `` dromornis '' birds lived , although the climate was unpredictable .
