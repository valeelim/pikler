V10 engine     a v10 engine , often just called a v10 , is an internal combustion engine with 10 cylinders . the engine has five cylinders on each side called banks . the two banks form a `` v '' -shaped angle . all ten pistons turn a common crankshaft . a v10 engine can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel and natural gas . until recently , v10s had rarely been used for road cars . a v12 runs smoother and is only a little harder to build . a v8 is easier to build and costs less to run . new technology has made the use of v10 engines more practical . dodge designed a v10 for use in trucks . the engine was revised and used in the dodge viper . ford developed a heavy-duty v10 engine for use in their trucks . european car builders later adopted the v10 configuration . high power v10 engines were put into supercars from lamborghini and porsche . bmw and audi then added v10s to their mid-range cars . volkswagen developed a v10 turbodiesel engine . the largest use of the v10 engines has been in formula one racing . alfa romeo made the first modern formula one v10 in 1986 , but it was never used in a race car . later the v10 was introduced by honda and renault before the season . after turbochargers were banned , the v10 engine was often used . v10 engines were the only type used from the 1998 season . v10s were banned for the season and formula one teams started using v8 engines .
