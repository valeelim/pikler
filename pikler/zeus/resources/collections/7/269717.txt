Phosphide     phosphide is an ion . its chemical formula is sometimes p. it does not always have that formula . it is a reducing agent . phosphides ( chemical compounds having the phosphide ion in them ) react with acids to make phosphine gas . sodium phosphide is an example . some phosphides are semiconductors and are not ionic with p ions . they are less reactive . some metals form alloys with phosphorus to make phosphides . if it is ionic , then the phosphorus is in the -3 oxidation state .
