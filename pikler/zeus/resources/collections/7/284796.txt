Degree of unsaturation     degree of unsaturation ( dou ) is a way to figure out how many rings or double bonds are in a molecule . calculation . 1. determine the number of hydrogens that should be present if it was completely single bonded . in other words use the formula 2n+2 ( with n = the number of carbons present . 1. subtract the total from above from the number of hydrogens actually present . 1. take that number and divide it by two . this number is your dou . each degree either equals one ring structure or pi bond . a double bond would have one dou . a triple bond would have a dou of two ( triple bond is one sigma bond with two pi bonds ) . for the below , use the same rules as above , using the definitions below . - silicon counts as a carbon - boron , nitrogen and phosphorus each count as a `` half a carbon '' - halogens ( group 7 ) count as a hydrogen - oxygen , sulfur and selenium ( group 6 ) can be ignored
