Chemical composition     chemical composition refers to the arrangement , type , and ratio of atoms in molecules of chemical substances . chemical composition varies when chemicals are added or subtracted from a substance , when the ratio of substances changes , or when other chemical changes occur in chemicals . chemical formulas show this information . the chemical composition of a substance determines the properties of the substance . this means that the way atoms are put together in something determines the color , density , strength , and other properties of the thing . the chemical composition of a substance determines its ratio of elements , the size of the compound , intramolecular forces , colour , texture etc . chemists can use tests to learn the chemical composition of a substance , including a ph test , flammability test , heavy metal test etc . an example is hydrogen fluoride , or hf , which has 1 hydrogen atom in ratio to every 1 fluorine atom . this substance has strong intramolecular forces of attraction because it is a hydrogen bond .
