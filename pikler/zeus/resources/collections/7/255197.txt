Tracking (education)    tracking ( education ) tracking is the method of placing students according to their ability level in homogeneous classes or learning experiences . students of different abilities ( low , middle , and high ) are assigned to different `` tracks '' of courses and programs ( vocational , general , college-bound , honors , and ap ) . tracking is the term given to this process , and while some teachers believe that tracking makes instruction more manageable , others believe that it is a terribly flawed system . once a student is placed , it may be very difficult to move up from one track to another . the placements may reflect racism , classism , or sexism . many educators charge that the united states relies more on tracking than any other nation in the world . most schools today work hard to avoid using the term `` tracking . '' middle and high schools are taking their cue from elementary schools , where `` ability grouping '' has been in favor . ability grouping sorts students based on capability , but the groupings may well vary by subject . while tracks suggest permanence , ability grouping is more transitory . one year , a student might find herself in a high-ability math group and a low-ability english group . the following year , that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups . school tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping .
