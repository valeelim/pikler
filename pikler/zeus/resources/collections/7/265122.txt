Argument from false premises     an argument from false premises is a line of reasoning which can lead to wrong results . a false premise is an untrue proposition that forms part of the basis of a `` logical syllogism '' . since the premise ( assumption ) is not correct , the conclusion drawn may also be wrong . however , whether or not an argument is `` valid '' depends on whether it is consistent , not whether its premises are true . for example , consider this syllogism : - if the streets are wet , it has rained recently . ( premise ) - the streets are wet . ( premise ) - therefore , it has rained recently . ( conclusion ) this argument is logically valid , but not always true , because the first premise can be false â€“ someone could have hosed down the streets , a street cleaner could have passed , the local river could have flooded , and so on . a simple logical analysis will not reveal the error in this argument , since that analysis assumes that all the argument 's premises are true . for this reason , an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute , or even discuss , than one featuring a normal logical error , as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties .
