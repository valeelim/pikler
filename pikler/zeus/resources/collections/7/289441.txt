Wind engineering     wind engineering studies effects of wind on the buildings and its possible damage or problems to their inhabitants . from the point of structural engineering , it is interested in strong winds , which may cause discomfort , as well as extreme winds , such as in a tornado , hurricane or heavy storm , which may cause widespread destruction . wind engineering needs information from meteorology , fluid dynamics , mechanics , and a number of special engineering disciplines including aerodynamics , and structural dynamics . the tools may also include atmospheric models , atmospheric boundary layer , wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics models . other pages . - earthquake engineering - vibration control other websites . - international association for wind engineering - american association of wind engineering - uk wind engineering society - wind energy technology centre
