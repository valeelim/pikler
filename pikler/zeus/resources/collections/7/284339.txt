Indian Rebellion of 1857     the indian rebellion of 1857 is also called the indian mutiny , the sepoy mutiny , india 's first war of independence or india 's first struggle for independence . it began on 10 may 1857 , as a mutiny of sepoys of the british east india company 's army . sepoys in the presidency of bengal revolted against their british officers . the causes of the mutiny are hard to pin down , and have been much argued about . before the rebellion , there were 50,000 british troops , and 300,000 sepoys serving in the east india company military . the forces were divided into three presidency armies : bombay , madras , and bengal . the make-up of these armies varied from region to region . there were some changes in the terms of their service which may have created resentment . as the east india company expanded , soldiers were now expected to serve in less familiar regions , such as in burma , and also to make do without the `` foreign service '' remuneration they had got previously . another financial grievance stemmed from the general service act , which denied retired sepoys a pension . this applied only to new recruits , but older sepoys suspected that it might bied apply to those already in service . also , the bengal army was paid less than the madras and bombay armies , which increased their fears over pensions .
