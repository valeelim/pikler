Peat     peat , or turf , is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation . peat forms in wetland bogs , moors , mires , and swamps . peat forms when plant material , usually in marshy areas , is inhibited from decaying fully by acidic and anaerobic conditions . it is composed mainly of marshland vegetation : trees , grasses , fungi , as well as other types of organic remains , such as insects , and animal remains . under certain conditions , the decomposition of the latter ( in the absence of oxygen ) is inhibited . peat formed in very wet conditions accumulates faster , and is less decomposed , than that in drier places . this allows climatologists to use peat as an indicator of climatic change . the composition of peat can also be used to reconstruct ancient ecologies by examining the types and quantities of its organic constituents . under the proper conditions , peat is the earliest stage in the formation of coal . the coal measures of the pennsylvanian period were laid down in a gigantic tropical river basin , and later squeezed and heated to form the metamorphic rock we call 'coal ' .
