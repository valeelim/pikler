Grito de Dolores     the grito de dolores ( `` cry of dolores '' ) was the call issued by father miguel hidalgo y costilla , a roman catholic priest , on 16 september , 1810 in the small town of dolores ( therefore the grito `` de dolores '' ) . it is also called the grito de la independencia or the cry of independence against the traditional spanish government , which had become catastrophically distorted by the napoleonic invasion of the peninsula in the preceding two years . hidalgo and a number of criollos were planning to fight the spanish colonial government , but they were betrayed . because he was afraid to get arrested , hidalgo made his brother mauricio and a number of other men with guns go to the sheriff . on the night of 15 september , they made the sheriff set free the pro-independence ( `` people wanting to rule their own land '' ) prisoners . they set eighty free . the next morning , at around 6:00 am , hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung . he made his congregation ( `` people who attended his church '' ) come together . with ignacio allende and juan aldama by his side , he spoke to the people in front of his church . he encouraged them to go against the spanish government . researchers do not agree as to what exactly hidalgo said at the time .
