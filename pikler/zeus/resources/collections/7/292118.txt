Gliding     gliding is when an object or animal goes through the air without active flight . all gliders use an aerofoil to slow their rate of descent . glider planes have wings , and gliding animals have membranes which they stretch out . by using rising air they can prolong their stay in the air . the word 'soaring ' describes this , and is also used for the sport of gliding . air will rise if it is heated by the ground or if it is deflected by mountains . improvements in aerodynamics , in instruments and in the understanding of the weather have allowed flights over great distances at high speeds . the world record distance is now over 3000 km .
