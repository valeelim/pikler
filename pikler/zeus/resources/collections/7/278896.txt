List of rulers of Saxony     this article lists dukes , electors , and kings ruling over territories named saxony from the beginning of the saxon duchy in the 9th century to the end of the saxon kingdom in 1918. the original duchy of saxony was the lands of the saxon people in the north-western part of present-day germany , namely , the modern german state of lower saxony as well as westphalia and western saxony-anhalt , not the modern german state of saxony . early dukes - hadugato ( ruled about 531 ) - berthoald ( ruled about 627 ) - theoderic ( ruled about 743-744 ) - widukind ( ruled about 777-810 ) - abo ( ruled about 785-811 ) hattonid dynasty - banzleib ( 830s ) when the welfs left in 1180 , the duchy of saxony lost a lot of territory . westphalia fell to the archbishop of cologne , while the duchies of brunswick and l√ºneburg remained with the welfs . the ascanian dukes had their base further east , near the elbe , so the name saxony moved towards the east . the post carve-up saxony is therefore sometimes called the `` younger duchy of saxony '' . also the counting of its dukes its mixed up . while the first post carve-up duke is sometimes called bernard iii - because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180 - or bernard i with his great-great-great-great grandson bernard ii being counted second . the second post carve-up duke albert i is already usually counted as the first , although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name , his grandfather albert the bear .
