Pigeonhole principle     the pigeonhole principle explains that when there are ( n ) pigeon-sized holes in a pigeon container , then it 's impossible to fit more than ( n ) pigeons in that container , without having at least one hole containing more than one . the pigeons are used here as an example for anything that can be put into containers or subdivisions . this theorem is important in computer science and mathematics , especially in graph theory . in one suitcase there are 12 blue socks and 18 black socks . if we close our eyes , how many socks must we pull out to be sure we have a pair the same color ? if we think of the colors as 'holes ' or categories , we have 2 holes , so ( n ) = 2. if we pull three socks from the suitcase , at least two of them must be the same color , because 3 is a number greater than 2. so the correct answer here is three .
