Entrepôt     an entrepôt is a trading post where merchandise can be imported and exported without paying a tariff . this is often at a profit . sometimes it is more convenient to sell to an entrepôt than to travel long distances along a trade route . the entrepôt sells the goods at a higher price to others travelling the rest of the route . in modern times customs areas have largely made such entrepôts obsolete . this type of port should not be confused with the modern french use of the word `` entrepôt '' meaning warehouse . entrepôts date back to the middle ages . the vikings established trade routes with entrepôts at dublin , wexford and waterford . an example of a colonial american entrepôt was in rhode island between 1690 and 1765 .
