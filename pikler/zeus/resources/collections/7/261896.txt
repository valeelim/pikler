Littoral zone     the littoral zone refers to that part of a sea , lake or river which is close to the shore . in coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the high water mark , which is rarely under water , to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged . it always includes this intertidal zone and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone . however , the meaning of `` littoral zone '' can extend well beyond the intertidal zone . in oceanography and marine biology , the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf .
