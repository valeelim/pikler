Rotary evaporator     a rotary evaporator ( or rotavap ) is commonly used in chemical laboratories to remove solvents by evaporation . the liquid is put in a round-bottomed flask and placed in the device . the rotavap spins and heats the flask and reduces the pressure inside by creating a vacuum . the vacuum makes the liquid evaporate at a low temperature than normal . the liquid becomes a gas and is collected by cooling it so it condenses into another flask . if there are substances dissolved in the liquid they will be left behind in when it evaporates . if water with salt dissolved in it is evaporated , then pure water and dry salt will be separated . scientists use rotary evaporators to remove the liquid a solid is dissolved in . rotary evaporators are often quicker to use than evaporating basins . they can be used for distillations .
