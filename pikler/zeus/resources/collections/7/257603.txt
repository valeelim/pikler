Star of Bethlehem     the star of bethlehem , also called the christmas star , is a star in the bible and christian tradition that let the magi know that jesus was born , and later helped them go to bethlehem . according to the gospel of matthew , the star made the magi travel to jerusalem . there they met king herod of judea , and asked where the king of the jews had been born . herod 's advisors said that the messiah would be born in bethlehem , a nearby village , because of a prophecy in the book of micah . while the magi were going to bethlehem , they saw the star again . the star stopped above the place where jesus was born . there , the magi saw jesus with his mother , worshipped him and gave costly presents to him . they then returned to their `` own country '' . christians usually think of the star as a miraculous sign to show the birth of the christ . astronomers have thought of many different explanations for the star . a nova , a planet , a comet , an occultation , and a conjunction ( planets coming together ) have all been suggested .
