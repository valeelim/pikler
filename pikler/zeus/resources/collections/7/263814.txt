Mary Quant     mary quant obe ( born 11 february 1934 in blackheath , london ) is a british fashion designer . in 1963 , she won the `` sunday times '' international fashion award , and was chosen as `` woman of the year '' . quant was famous as a designer who invented the miniskirt and hot pants . she was also instrumental in the mod fashion movement , and known for her use of pop art in fashion . born to welsh parents , quant went to blackheath high school , then studied illustration at goldsmiths college . her first employment was as a couture milliner ( hat maker ) . in november 1955 , she teamed up with her husband , alexander plunket greene , and a former solicitor , archie mcnair , to open a clothes shop on the kings road in chelsea called bazaar . bazaar 's best sellers were small white plastic collars to brighten up black dresses or t-shirts . black stretch stockings were also popular . skirts had been getting shorter since about 1958 – a development mary quant thought was practical and liberating , allowing women to run for a bus . the miniskirt , which she is most famous for , became one of the defining fashions of the 1960s . the miniskirt was also developed separately by andré courrèges and john bates , and there is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first . like most fashion , the short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women : the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style and , in quant 's case , gave it a name . mary quant named the miniskirt after her favourite make of car , the mini . she loved the car so much , she had one designed especially for her .
