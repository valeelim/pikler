Interquartile range     the interquartile range ( iqr ) is a number that indicates how spread out scores are and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores . the interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers ( scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores ) as it eliminates them . it is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores . the scores are divided into four equal parts , separated by the quartiles formula_1 and formula_2 , after the scores have been arranged in ascending ( becoming bigger as you go further ) order . the second quartile formula_3 is also known as the median . the interquartile range iqr is then defined as : if we have 20 scores arranged from smallest to largest : we put them into four different groups of five numbers each : : the groups are separated by : hence the interquartile range is : suppose the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92. this number is an outlier . notice that the interquartile range is not affected .
