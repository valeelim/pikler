Rainband     a rainband is an area of rainfall where all the clouds and precipitation are stretched out in a long line or band . rainbands can be stratiform or convective . they are caused by differences in temperature . when seen on a weather radar , the long narrow shape is called a banded structure . rainbands in a tropical cyclone are curved and may even spiral around the center of the cyclone . tropical cyclone rainbands include rain showers and thunderstorms . when this includes an eyewall and the eye , they make a hurricane or tropical storm . the size of rainbands around a tropical cyclone helps to measure the cyclone 's intensity . rainbands that form near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which can produce tornadoes . the shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains . the mountains block the winds which can then form a low-level barrier jet . bands of thunderstorms can form when sea breeze and land breezes meet , if enough moisture is present . sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front , can hide the location of the cold front itself . rainbands in an extratropical cyclone can cause large amounts of rain or snow . behind extratropical cyclones , rainbands can form downwind of large , warmer bodies of water such as the great lakes . if the air is cold enough , these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls .
