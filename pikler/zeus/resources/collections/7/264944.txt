Conflict resolution     conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict . the term `` conflict resolution '' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term `` dispute resolution '' . the terms `` conflict '' and `` dispute '' overlap . as a term , conflict is broader than dispute , more concerned with physical action , and less concerned with verbal arguments . processes of conflict resolution generally include negotiation , mediation , and diplomacy . the processes of arbitration , litigation , and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes , are usually described with the term dispute resolution , although some refer to them as `` conflict resolution '' . conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural background . in western cultural contexts , such as canada and the united states , successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants and problem solving that meet their underlying needs . in these situations , conflict resolvers often talk about finding the `` win-win '' solution , or mutually satisfying scenario , for everyone involved ( see fisher and ury ( 1981 ) , `` getting to yes '' ) .
