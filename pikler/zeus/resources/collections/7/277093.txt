Inflorescence     an inflorescence is a flowering stem . the term is most used for a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem . an inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant ; each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern . sometimes it is just a close bunch of flowers ( e.g . `` antirrhinum '' ) on a `` spike '' . sometimes the inflorescence is so tight it looks like one single flower . what you see as a single daisy is actually made of several hundred tiny flowers packed together . this kind of inflorescence is called a pseudanthium ( `` false flower '' ) . the advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the `` magnolia '' type . - numbers : there may be dozens or even hundreds of flowers in an inflorescence , with many seeds or fruits for each flowering . - pollination : increased pollination is an important bonus . massing flowers together makes them more visible to pollinating insects and birds . - seed or fruit dispersal : dispersal by wind or animals is improved by having the flowers at the top end of a stem .
