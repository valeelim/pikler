Yo-yo effect     the yo-yo effect means people rapidly gaining weight after a diet . other words for this activity are yo-yo dieting or weight cycling . people 's weight can move down and back up like a yo-yo when they follow several diets one after another . a person 's weight after the diet is often higher than it was before dieting . the body needs less energy after losing weight on a diet . people have less fatty tissue and often less muscle after dieting . muscle tissue needs more energy than fatty tissue . reducing the amount of muscle tissue therefore reduces the need for energy . diets also limit the number of calories people take in . at some point , a dieter 's body will change the way it uses energy if there are less calories to burn . the body does this to make sure it survives when less food is available . these changes in the body cause people to gain weight rapidly when they stop dieting and return to their old eating habits . people can avoid the yo-yo effect by changing their diet . if a diet works without the body switching to a more efficient way of using calories , there will be no yo-yo effect . a diet should change the dieter 's eating habits for a long time . new eating habits should not give the body more energy than it needs . at the end of the diet , it also makes sense to raise the number of calories someone eats slowly . exercise and sports can increase the amount of calories burned by the body rather than turned into fat .
