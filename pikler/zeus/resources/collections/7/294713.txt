Civil parishes in England     in england , a civil parish is a unit of local government . civil parishes are the lowest tier of local government , below districts and counties . it is an administrative parish , in comparison to an ecclesiastical ( church ) parish . the parish council can decide to call itself a town , village , neighbourhood or community ; and in a limited number of cases has city status granted by the monarch . civil parishes only cover part of england ; about 35 % of the population . there are currently no civil parishes in greater london , and before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a london borough . the creation of ancient parishes was linked to the manorial system . the parishes often shared the same boundaries as the manor of the local lord . at first the manor was the main unit of local administration and justice in the early rural economy . eventually the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe . responsibilitfor things such as relief of the poor passed from the lord of the manor to the church , but in practice it was administered by monasteries . after the dissolution of the monasteries , the power to charge ( levy ) a rate to fund relief of the poor was given to the parish authorities by the 1601 act for the relief of the poor .
