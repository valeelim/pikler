Innate immune system     the innate immune system defends the host from infections . it includes cells which recognize and respond to pathogens ( germs ) right away . the innate immune system response is not specific : it responds the same way to all pathogens that it recognises . unlike the adaptive immune system , the innate immune system does not give long-lasting immunity against specific infections . innate immune systems give immediate defence against infection , and are found in all plant and animal life . the innate system is the evolutionarily older defense strategy . it is the main immune system found in plants , fungi , insects , and in primitive multicellular organisms . the system is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual 's lifetime . the vertebrate innate immune system : - acts as a physical and chemical barrier to infectious agents . if that fails , then : - gets immune cells ( such as natural killer cells ) to the infection by producing cytokines . - starts the `` complement cascade '' to identify bacteria , activate cells and clear out dead cells .
