Tsunami     a tsunami is a series of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes or volcanic eruptions . a tsunami has a very long wavelength . it can be hundreds of kilometers long . usually , a tsunami starts suddenly . the waves travel at a great speed across an ocean with little energy loss . they can remove sand from beaches , destroy trees , toss and drag vehicles , houses and even destroy whole towns . tsunamis can even be by caused meteorite strikes , though it is very rare . the water often draws back from the seacoast half of the wave period prior to the wave getting to the coast . if the slope of the coast is not deep , the water may pull back for hundreds of metres . people who do not know of the danger will often remain at the shore . tsunamis can not be prevented . however , there are ways to help stop people dying from a tsunami . international and regional warning systems , especially for the pacific ocean , issue alerts before the big waves reach the shore . because an earthquake that caused the tsunami can be felt before the wave gets to the shore , people can be warned to go somewhere safe .
