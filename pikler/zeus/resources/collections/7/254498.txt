Symphony No.8 &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot; (Mahler)    symphony no.8 & quot ; symphony of a thousand & quot ; ( mahler ) symphony no . 8 in e-flat major by gustav mahler ( 1860â€“1911 ) is one of the largest choral works in classical music . it needs a huge orchestra to play it and a huge choir to sing . because so many performers are needed it is often called `` symphony of a thousand '' , but that is not a name that mahler gave to it . mahler worked very hard at it , composing it in quite a short time at maiernigg in southern austria in the summer of 1906. it was the last of mahler 's works that was to be given its first performance in his lifetime . the symphony was given its first performance in munich on 12 september 1910. symphonies are usually pieces of music played just by an orchestra , but beethoven started a tradition of having singing in symphonies : his ninth symphony is the famous one with the ode to joy in the last movement . mahler took up this idea of combining singing with symphony . his symphonies nos 2 , 3 , and 4 all have singing in them . the next three are just for orchestra , but in no . 8 he uses singing again .
