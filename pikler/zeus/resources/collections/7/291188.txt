Roger Sperry     roger wolcott sperry ( august 20 , 1913 â€“ april 17 , 1994 ) was an american neurobiologist and nobel prize winner . he shared the 1981 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with david hubel and torsten wiesel . in 1989 , sperry also received the national medal of science . before sperry 's experiments , some research evidence seemed to indicate that areas of the cerebral cortex were largely interchangeable . in his early experiments , sperry showed that the opposite was true : after early development , circuits of the brain are largely hardwired . that is , they are set with a particular function . sperry 's work was on 'split-brain ' research . in his nobel-winning work , sperry tested ten patients who had undergone an operation developed in 1940 by william van wagenen , a neurosurgeon in rochester , ny . the surgery , designed to treat epileptics with `` grand mal '' seizures , severed ( cut ) the corpus callosum , the area of the brain used to transfer signals between the right and left hemispheres .
