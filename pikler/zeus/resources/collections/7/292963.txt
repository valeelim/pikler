Caspar Wessel     caspar wessel ( june 8 , 1745 â€“ march 25 , 1818 ) was a danish-norwegian mathematician . he was born in jonsrud , vestby , akershus , norway . in 1763 , having completed secondary school , he went to denmark for further studies ( since norway did n't have any university in 1763 ) . in 1778 he acquired got degree of `` candidatus juris '' . in 1794 he was hired as a surveyor ; in 1798 , a royal inspector of surveying . as surveying is related to mathematics , he later studied the geometrical importance of complex numbers . his most important paper , `` om directionens analytiske betegning '' , ( `` on the analytical representation of direction '' ) was published in 1799 by the royal danish academy of sciences and letters . since it was in danish , it was not noticed by many people . later , jean-robert argand and carl friedrich gauss 's paper showed the same results . one of the more important , but missed ideas shown in wessel 's `` om directionens analytiske betegning '' was vectors . wessel 's main thing he wanted to show in the paper was not this , but he felt that the concept of numbers , with length and direction would be needed . wessel 's thoughts on addition was : `` two straight lines are added if we unite them in such a way that the second line begins where the first one ends and then pass a straight line from the first to the last point of the united lines . this line is the sum of the united lines '' . today , the same idea is used when adding vectors .
