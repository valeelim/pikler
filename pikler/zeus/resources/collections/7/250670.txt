Torosaurus     torosaurus ( meaning `` pierced lizard '' ) was a large , quadrupedal , plant-eating ceratopsian dinosaur with three horns on its large head . `` torosaurus '' hatched from eggs and may have lived in herds . `` torosaurus '' lived during the upper cretaceous , about 70â€“65 million years ago , in what is now western north america . it was similar to `` triceratops '' . some had thought that `` triceratops '' was a younger form of `` torosaurus '' . however , latest thinking is that the two are definitely different genera . in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , studies of external features of known specimens decided that shape and development differences mean the two genera are not synonyms . the main problems in the `` one genus '' idea are : 1. a lack of good transitional forms , 1. the apparent existence of authentic `` torosaurus '' subadults , different skull proportions independent of maturation 1. the hole formation at an adult stage is not part of a normal ceratopsian growth sequence .
