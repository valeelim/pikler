Gamma-ray burst     gamma-ray bursts ( grbs ) are flashes of gamma rays from extremely energetic explosions . they have been seen in distant galaxies . they are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe . bursts can last from milliseconds to several minutes , although a typical burst lasts a few seconds . the initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived 'afterglow ' emitted at longer wavelengths ( x-ray , ultraviolet , visible light , infrared and radio waves ) . most grbs are a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova , as a huge rapidly spinning star collapses to form a black hole . a subclass of grbs ( the 'short ' bursts ) seem to come from a different process , perhaps the merger of binary neutron stars . the sources of most grbs are billions of light years away from earth . this suggests the explosions are extremely energetic : a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime . they are very rare ( a few per galaxy per million years ) .
