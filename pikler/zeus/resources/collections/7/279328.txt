Sargon II     sargon ii ( , `` legitimate king '' , reigned 722 – 705 bc ) was an assyrian king . sargon ii became co-regent with shalmaneser v in 722 bc . shalmaneser v died in 722 bc . from then on , sargon ii was the only ruler of assyria . it is not clear if he was the son of tiglath-pileser iii or a usurper unrelated to the royal family . in his inscriptions , he styles himself as a new man and rarely talks about his predecessors . he nevertheless took the name `` sharru-kinu '' ( `` true king '' ) , after sargon of akkad — who had founded the first semitic empire in the region about 16 centuries earlier . `` sargon '' is the biblical form of the name .
