Brachiosaur     brachiosaurs are a family of sauropod dinosaurs , the brachiosauridae . they were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs . as a result , there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family . the largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaur , the `` giraffatitan brancai '' ( formerly `` brachiosaurus brancai '' ) at the museum f√ºr naturkunde in berlin , germany . brachiosaurs first evolved in the middle jurassic , and died out at the end of the lower cretaceous , surviving for about 60 million years . the earliest known brachiosaur may be `` lapparentosaurus '' from the middle jurassic of africa . the giant `` sauroposeidon '' from north america was one of the last brachiosaurs , living just before the end of the early cretaceous period . the name `` brachiosaur '' means `` arm lizard '' , which may sound like a strange name for a four-legged animal . the family brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer `` arms '' ( front legs ) than back legs .
