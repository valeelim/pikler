Mechanical wave     a mechanical wave requires a medium . sound waves , waves in a slinky , and pressure waves are all examples of this phenomenon . sound waves need a physical medium in order to exist ; the slinky waves need the slinky , and the waves in the ocean need the water . like all waves , they have a frequency , period , wavelength and amplitude . mechanical waves are a local oscillation of material . only the energy propagates ; the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position ; the wave travels by jumping from one particle of the medium to another . therefore , mechanical waves transport energy and not material .
