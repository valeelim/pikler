V8 engine     a v8 engine often just called a v8 is an internal combustion engine with 8 cylinders . the engine has four cylinders on each side called banks . the two banks form a `` v '' shaped angle . in most engines , the two banks are at a right angle ( 90° ) to each other , but some engines use a narrower angle . all eight pistons turn a common crankshaft . it can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel , natural gas and alcohol . generally , v8s are only available on more powerful cars , pickup trucks , and suvs . the traditional 90° large v8 engine is generally too wide and too long to fit easily in vehicles with a front-wheel drive layout , so its application is mostly limited to rear-wheel drive cars and trucks . v8s are common in purpose-designed engines for racing cars . they are a common engine configuration in the highest levels of auto racing . the v8 engine is used in the united states where it is required in irl and nascar . v8s engines are also used in australian auto racing , most notably in the v8 supercars . formula one began the 2006 season using v8 engines , which replaced the v10 . formula one made this change to reduce costs and lower power .
