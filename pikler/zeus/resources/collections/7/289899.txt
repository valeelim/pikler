Diagnosis     a diagnosis is an accurate and precise account of the nature or cause of something . medical diagnosis is the best-known field , but diagnosis can be applied to any subject . whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient , a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car . in all cases they replace a vague query , such as `` my car will not start '' , with an exact analysis , such as `` it 's out of petrol '' . notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen . these ideas work even in more subtle cases . a boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum . he asks an expert `` what is this ? '' the expert says `` you mean , apart from it being a beetle ? '' when the boy nods , the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass , or a binocular microscope . chances are , it is a common beetle , and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it . but if it is not known to the expert , a much longer study is needed . large reference books will be consulted ; trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared . a full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species . if the species is unknown , the detailed work of description is needed for publication .
