Henry Benedict Stuart     henry benedict maria clement thomas francis xavier stuart ( 11 march 1725 - 13 july 1807 ) was a roman catholic cardinal , as well as the fourth and final jacobite heir to publicly claim the thrones of england , scotland , and ireland . unlike his father , james francis edward stuart , and brother , charles edward stuart , henry made no effort to seize the throne . after charles 's death in january 1788 the pope did not recognise henry as the lawful ruler of england , scotland and ireland , but referred to him as the cardinal duke of york . he spent his life in the papal states and had a long career in the clergy of the roman catholic church , rising to become the dean of the college of cardinals and cardinal-bishop of ostia and velletri . at the time of his death he was ( and still is ) one of the longest serving cardinals in the church 's history . when he was young , henry 's father made him duke of york ( in the jacobite peerage ) , and that was how he was best known . upon the death of his brother in 1788 henry became known by jacobites , and within his personal entourage , as henry ix of england , although publicly he referred to himself as cardinal-duke of york `` nuncupatus '' .
