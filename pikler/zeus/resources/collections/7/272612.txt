Titanosaur     titanosaurs were a group of large sauropod dinosaurs . together with the brachiosaurs and relatives they make up the larger clade titanosauriformes . they were some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth . titanosaurs included `` saltasaurus '' , `` isisaurus '' , `` argentinosaurus '' and `` paralititan '' . the largest might have weighed up to 90 tonnes ( 100 short tons ) or perhaps even more . they were named after the mythological titans of ancient greece . the titanosaurs were the last great group of sauropods before the cretaceousâ€“paleogene extinction event . they were the dominant herbivores of their time . the fossil evidence suggests they replaced the other sauropods , like the diplodocids and the brachiosaurids , which died out between the upper jurassic and the mid-cretaceous . broadly , their skeleton was similar to earlier sauropods , but with a few key differences . the pelvis ( hip area ) was slimmer than some sauropods , but the pectoral ( chest area ) was much wider . this them a uniquely 'wide-gauged ' stance : their front legs were wider apart , and usually longer than their hind legs . this can be seen very clearly in the `` argentinosaurus '' . as a result , the fossilised trackways of titanosaurs are broader than other sauropods . their vertebrae ( back bones ) were solid ( not hollowed-out ) . their spinal column was more flexible , so they were probably more agile than their cousins and better at rearing up .
