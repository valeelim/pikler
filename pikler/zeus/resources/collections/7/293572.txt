Prosthesis     a prosthesis is a device made to replace a missing human body part . they are used by people who are missing body parts due to accidents , health problems ( amputees ) or being born without them . originally , prostheses were simply pieces of wood ( for example , wooden legs ) , but now they are made of lighter materials . currently available prostheses can help return mobility to those with transtibial ( below the knee ) , transfemoral ( above the knee ) , transradial ( below the elbow ) , and transhumeral ( above the elbow ) amputations . there is still much research to be done before artificial limbs can function with the same versatility as a natural limb ; as a result many of the currently available prosthetic limbs are tailored to a specific activity or need . in para-alpine skiing , the device needs to be made to work like an ankle because the way the ankle moves is very important in skiing . the device for skiing is only used in skiing . people use other prostheses when they are not skiing . prosthetic arms can be designed for climbing as well . private jaco van gass , an amputee veteran , designed a special prosthetic arm with a built in ice pick that he would use to climb mount everest . it also includes a battery pack and heat patch to keep his stump warm .
