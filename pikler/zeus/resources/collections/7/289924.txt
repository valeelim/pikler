Civilian     a civilian is a person who is not a member of a country 's military or any other fighting group . this is what the word means under the laws of war . civilians are the opposite of soldiers , who fight in wars . civilians are protected by international law from being harmed during war . the treatment of civilians during times of war is covered by the fourth geneva convention . prisoners are covered by the third convention . these are based on humanitarian doctrines ( ethical beliefs ) and that most countries follow them as law . civilians have the right to defend themselves . if they participate in other fighting , they are usually called partisans , and they can be tried for war crimes . the modern use of the word also has problems : - many modern wars are civil wars . in a civil war , it can be difficult to make the distinction between the different parties at war , and it can also be difficult to make a difference between a civilian and a soldier . - guerilla warfare and terrorism rely on the fact that the people taking part can not be distinguished from civilians ; they look like civilians , and not like soldiers .
