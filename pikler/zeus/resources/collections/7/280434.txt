Linear equation     in mathematics , a linear equation is a type of equation . in a linear equation , both terms have to be constant . a linear equation is the equation of a straight line . this type of equation is written in the form : y = mx + b or ( y - y1 ) = m ( x - x1 ) where : m = the rate of change , or slope . the slope is how fast the line moves up or down . larger numbers will make the slope steeper . if m is a negative number , then the line will appear to fall or go down the page when read from left to right . if m is a positive number , then the line will appear to climb the page when read from left to right . b = the y-intercept of the function . this is where the function crosses the y - axis of the coordinate plane.the first equation is called slope-intercept form , because in it , the slope ( m ) and y-intercept ( b ) are easily found.the second equation is called point-slope form , because in it , a point on the graph ( x1 , y1 ) and the slope ( m ) are easily found .
