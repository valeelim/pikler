Aegyptosaurus     aegyptosaurus , meaning `` egypt 's lizard '' , is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in africa around 95 million years ago during the upper cretaceous period . like most sauropods , it had a long neck and a small skull . the animal 's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass . its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs such as `` carcharodontosaurus '' and `` spinosaurus '' . `` aegyptosaurus '' was a close relative of `` argentinosaurus '' , a much larger dinosaur that lived in south america at about the same time . this suggests a possible land bridge between africa and south america during the cretaceous period . `` aegyptosaurus '' was discovered and named by a german paleontologist named ernst stromer in 1932. its fossils were found in egypt , niger , and in several different locations in the sahara desert . all known specimens were discovered before 1939. the fossils were stored together in munich , but were destroyed when an allied bombing raid hit the museum in 1944 , during world war ii .
