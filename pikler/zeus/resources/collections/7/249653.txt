Ian Stevenson     ian stevenson , m.d. , was a canadian professor of psychiatry . he worked at the university of virginia , in the area of parapsychology . stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development . he traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3,000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives . stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death , although he never suggested a physical process by which a personality might survive death . stevenson 's research was the subject of jim b. tucker 's `` life before life '' ( 2005 ) . stevenson found that the best evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who , typically between the ages of 2 and 5 , make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born . their statements are often accompanied by behaviour that is unusual for their family but appropriate for the life that the child claims to remember . there is often a `` forgetting of the imaged memories between the ages of 5 and 8 ; a high incidence of violent death claimed in the claimed previous life ; and mention of the mode of death by the subject '' .
