Alternative country     alternative country ( sometimes called alt-country , or americana ) is a type of country music . it has singers or bands that sound very different from mainstream or pop country music . `` alternative country '' has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have influences such as roots rock , bluegrass , rockabilly , americana , honky-tonk , alternative rock , folk rock , or punk . in the 1990s the term `` alternative country '' ( which is like the term alternative rock , which was becoming popular at the same time ) , began to be used to talk about different groups of musicians and singers who did not follow the same traditions of regular country music , and who had a different sound . many of them did not follow the high production values ( such as spending a lot of money in the recording studio ) of the big country music industry at the time , which was mostly based in nashville , tennessee . lyrics in alternative country might be depressing or about social issues , and often from the heart . they do not follow the clich√©s sometimes used by mainstream country musicians as often . in other ways , the sounds of alternative country artists do not always have much in common . they can include traditional american folk tunes , bluegrass , and other types of sounds . it can be music that does not sound like mainstream rock or country . this has become even more confusing with `` alternative country artists '' saying that they do not want to be called alternative country , with more mainstream artists saying they are alternative country , and with people saying that older musicians or musicians from the past are alternative country . `` no depression '' , the most popular magazine about alternative country , said that it covered `` alternative-country music ( whatever that is ) '' .
