Evolutionary developmental biology     evolutionary developmental biology interprets development in the light of evolution and modern genetics . it is called for short 'evo-devo ' . in `` on the origin of species '' ( 1859 ) , charles darwin proposed evolution through natural selection , a theory central to modern biology . darwin recognised the importance of embryonic development in the understanding of evolution : ernst haeckel ( 1866 ) proposed that `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' , that is , the development of the embryo of every species ( ontogeny ) repeats the evolutionary development of that species ( phylogeny ) . haeckel 's concept explained , for example , why humans , and indeed all vertebrates , have gill slits and tails early in embryonic development . his theory has since been largely discredited . a renewed interest in the evolution of development came after the modern evolutionary synthesis ( roughly 1936 to 1947 ) . the conventional view had been that evo-devo had little influence on the evolutionary synthesis , but the following suggests otherwise .
