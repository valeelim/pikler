Hydrofluoric acid     hydrofluoric acid ( hf ) is a solution of hydrogen fluoride in water . its chemical formula is hf . it is a weak acid , but very corrosive and extremely toxic . it can dissolve glass to make hexafluorosilicic acid . if it gets on the skin , it can kill you . it is made by reacting fluorite with sulfuric acid . it is used in the processing of petroleum . it is also used to make various other chemicals containing fluorine , such as teflon ( the coating in a frying pan ) , freon ( the cooling agent in an air conditioner ) , and fluorocarbons ( used as propellants in aerosol cans ) . it is used to clean metals . it is very toxic because it bonds with calcium ions in the body and makes them so they can not be used . as an acid , it can be deprotonated to produce fluorides , which are also the salts of hydrofluoric acid . if someone gets hydrofluoric acid on them , medical attention is necessary , as just small amounts are very toxic . hydrofluoric acid is used by criminals as it is extremely strong and melts muscle and bone yet not ceramic therefor criminals may melt a body in a bath
