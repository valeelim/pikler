Latin honours     latin honours are latin phrases that are used to show how advanced the level at which someone earned an academic degree . the common ranks are : `` cum laude '' ( meaning `` with honor '' ) , `` magna cum laude '' ( `` with great honor '' ) , or `` summa cum laude '' ( `` with highest honor '' ) . this system is mostly used in canada , the united states , and in many european countries . some universities in other countries also use the english translation of these phrases rather than the latin ones . another example is `` egregia cum laude '' , which means `` with outstanding honor '' in english . the `` egregia '' rank was created to recognize students who earned the same grade point average as the `` summa '' honor , but who did so while in a more rigorous honors curriculum ( used by the college of st. benedict and st. john 's university ) .
