Endopterygota     the endopterygota ( or holometabola ) , are insects of the subclass pterygota . they have complete metamorphosis . this means they go through different larval , pupal , and adult stages . the larval and adult stages differ very much in their anatomy and behavior . this is called holometabolism , or complete metamorphism . they are distinguished from the exopterygota ( or hemipterodea ) by the way in which their wings develop . endopterygota ( `` internal winged forms '' ) develop wings inside the body during metamorphosis . the earliest endopterygote fossils date from the carboniferous .
