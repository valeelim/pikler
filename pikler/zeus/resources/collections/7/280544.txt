Parity     in physics , parity is a transformation in which the mirror image of a system ( meaning experiment ) is considered . if the system behaves in the mirror image as it normally would , it is said to respect parity symmetry , usually shortened to `` p symmetry . '' most types of physics respects p symmetry . one type of interaction that often does not respect this symmetry is the weak interaction .
