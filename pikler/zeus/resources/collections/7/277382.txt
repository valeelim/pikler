Viridiplantae     viridiplantae ( 'green plants ' ) are the clade which includes the green algae and land plants . in some classification systems they have been called plantae , by expanding the traditional plant kingdom ( embryophytes ) to include the green algae . adl and colleagues , who produced a classification for eukaryotes in 2005 , used the name chloroplastida for this group , reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll . they rejected the name viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants , as understood traditionally . there are more than 350,000 species of viridiplantae . the monophyletic chlorophyta and charophyta are classified under viridiplantae . a common classification is : - viridiplantae - chlorophyta - streptophyta - embryophyta - charophyta 'green algae ' is not used here because they are definitely not monophyletic . it is just a convenience term for chlorophyta and charophyta together . there are different opinions about the classification . another opinion is that only the charophyceae are closely related to land plants , and that arrangement is simplified as :
