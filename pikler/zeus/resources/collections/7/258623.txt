Bouldering     bouldering is a type of rock climbing . it is climbing without rope and harness . it is climbing heights at which the climber does not usually suffer serious injuries in case of a drop . to protect from injuries there are usually special bouldering mats underneath the climber . it is usually practiced on large natural boulders and in climbing gyms . boulder routes are called `` problems '' , because this style is like solving climbing-problems . the height of boulder problems is rarely higher than 3-5 meters . otherwise the risk of injuries is too high . often other climbers , who stand on the ground , spot the climbers to protect them from hitting the ground with the head or the spine . the equipment used by boulderers is not much . they use special climbing shoes , a bouldering mat , some brushes to clean the grips and sports tape . bouldering was invented in the late 19th century . it has been first documented in france , england and switzerland . it has been practiced for a long time but in the 1930s and 1940s it was practiced for its own sake in fontainebleau in france .
