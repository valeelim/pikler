Colonial Athletic Association     the colonial athletic association ( caa ) is a ncaa conference that play in the ncaa division i. the conference is headquartered in richmond , virginia and features universities and colleges from the eastern united states . the caa was founded in 1979 when the eastern college athletic conference ( ecac ) split its basketball league into several conferences . it was first known as the ecac south basketball league , and became the colonial athletic association in 1985 when it added other sports . these colleges and universities are `` full members '' of the caa , meaning that they play almost all of the sports that the caa sponsors . the caa has run a football conference since the 2007 season . caa football plays in division i fcs ( football championship subdivision ) , the lower of two levels of ncaa division i football . although the caa as a whole dates only to 1979 , the football conference can trace its history to the late 1930s . in 1938 , five schools in new england formed the new england conference . when one of the schools left in 1945 , the other schools joined with two other new england schools to form the yankee conference , which began play in 1947. in 1975 , the yankee conference dropped all sports other than football , and over time many schools outside of new england joined the league . due to changes in ncaa rules in 1997 , the yankee conference merged into the atlantic 10 conference ( a10 ) . after the caa announced plans to start a football league in 2007 , all of the a10 football teams decided to join the caa for that sport .
