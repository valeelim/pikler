Systematics     systematics is one of the main fields in biology . it is closely related to taxonomy . systematics is the study of the diversification of life on the planet earth , both past and present , and the relationships among living things through time . relationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees ( cladograms , phylogenetic trees , phylogenies ) . phylogenies have two components , `` branching order '' ( showing group relationships ) and `` branch length '' ( showing amount of evolution ) . phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits ( anatomical or molecular characteristics ) , and the distribution of organisms ( biogeography ) . systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on earth . `` systematic biology '' and `` taxonomy '' are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably . they were defined as follows : systematics is the field which ( a ) provides scientific names for organisms , ( b ) describes them , ( c ) preserves collections of them , ( d ) provides classifications for the organisms , keys for their identification , and data on their distributions , ( e ) investigates their evolutionary histories , and ( f ) considers their environmental adaptations . taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics ( a ) to ( d ) above .
