Ostracod     ostracods are a class of the crustacea . they are often called seed shrimps because of their appearance . some 65,000 species ( 13,000 of which are living ) have been identified . ostracods are small crustaceans , typically around in size , but varying from to in the case of `` gigantocypris '' . their bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a bivalve-like , chitinous or calcareous valve or `` shell '' . the hinge of the two valves is in the upper ( dorsal ) region of the body . marine ostracods live in the zooplankton . others live in the benthos , on or in the upper layer of the sea floor . many ostracods are also found in fresh water . terrestrial species of `` mesocypris '' are known from humid forest soils of south africa , australia , new zealand and tasmania . they have a wide range of diets , and the group includes carnivores , herbivores , scavengers , and filter feeders . copepods may not be monophyletic . ostracod taxa are grouped into a class based on gross morphology ( what they look like ) . their dna sequence analysis in their mitochondria has been examined . the results are not clear .
