End-Triassic extinction event     the end-triassic extinction event marks the boundary between the triassic and jurassic periods , 199.6 million years ago . however , many of the extinctions occurred before then in the upper triassic . overall , this was one of the major extinction events of the phanerozoic eon . it profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans . at least half of the species now known to have been living on earth at that time went extinct . a whole class ( conodonts : extinct chordates ) ; 20 % of all marine families ; all large crurotarsans ( non-dinosaurian archosaurs ) ; some remaining therapsids ; and many of the large amphibians were wiped out . the event emptied many ecological niches , and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the jurassic period . this event happened in less than 10,000 years , and occurred just before pangaea started to break apart . scientists have suggested several explanations for this event , but all have unanswered challenges : - asteroid impact : no known impact crater has been dated to coincide with the triassicâ€“jurassic boundary .
