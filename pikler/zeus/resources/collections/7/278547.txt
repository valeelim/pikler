Hornblende     hornblende is a complex series of silicate minerals . hornblende is not a recognized mineral in its own right , but the name is used as a general or field term , to refer to a dark amphibole . it is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules ; a calcium-iron-magnesium silicate , an aluminium-iron-magnesium silicate , and an iron-magnesium silicate . hornblende has a hardness of 5–6 , a specific gravity of 2.9–3.4 and is typically an opaque green , greenish-brown , brown or black color . it is most often confused with the minerals augite and biotite mica , both of which are black and can be found in granite . hornblende is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite , diorite , gabbro , basalt , andesite , gneiss , and schist . it is the principal mineral of amphibolites . very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium may be called basaltic hornblende , from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks . the word hornblende is derived from the german `` horn '' and `` blenden '' , to 'blind ' or 'dazzle ' . the term `` blende '' is often used to refer to a brilliant non-metallic luster , for example , zincblende and pitchblende , the ore of uranium .
