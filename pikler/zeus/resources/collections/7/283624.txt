Sweetbread     sweetbreads or ris are culinary names for the thymus or the pancreas glands especially of the calf ( `` ris de veau '' ) and lamb ( `` ris d'agneau '' ) ( although beef and pork sweetbreads are also eaten ) . various other glands used as food have also been called 'sweetbreads ' , including the parotid gland , the sublingual glands , and testicles ( `` cf . '' rocky mountain oyster ) . the `` heart '' sweetbreads are more spherical in shape , and surrounded symmetrically by the `` throat '' sweetbreads , which are more cylindrical in shape . one common preparation of sweetbreads involves soaking in salt water , then poaching in milk , after which the outer membrane is removed . once dried and chilled , they are often breaded and fried . they are also used for stuffing or in pâtés . they are grilled in many latin american cuisines , such as in the argentine asado , and served in bread in turkish cuisine . the word `` sweetbread '' is first known in the 16th century , but the logic behind the name is unclear . `` sweet '' is perhaps used since the thymus is sweet and rich tasting , as opposed to savoury tasting muscle flesh . `` bread '' may come from `` brede '' 'roasted meat ' .
