Snowy River     the snowy river is a major river in south-eastern australia . it starts on the slopes of mount kosciuszko , australia 's highest mountain . it gets its water from the eastern slopes of the snowy mountains in new south wales , and then flows through the snowy river national park in victoria and finally into bass strait . up until the middle of the 20th century , the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried , its wide reach and large rapids . the river 's course and surroundings have not changed very much , as it is protected by the snowy river national park . however its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950 's by the building of the snowy mountains scheme to make hydroelectricity . four large dams were built , at guthega , island bend , eucumbene , and jindabyne , as well as many smaller dams and tunnels . less than 1 % of the river flow , as measured at jindabyne , new south wales , continued to flow down the river . concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river . from 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1 % to 4 % . the agreement planned to increase the flow to 15 % by 2009 and 21 % by 2012 .
