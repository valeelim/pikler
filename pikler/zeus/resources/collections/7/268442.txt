Collective names of groups of like elements     there are areas on the periodic table where elements have similar properties . for example , all of the first column elements ( alkali metals ) are light , very soft , react with water rapidly , make hydroxides that are strong bases , and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds . the second column elements ( alkaline earth metals ) are a little heavier , a little harder , react with water a little less rapidly , made hydroxides that are strong bases , and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds . the other categories are : transition metals , pnictogens , chalcogens , halogens , and noble gases . there are also inner transition metals that are divided into lanthanides and actinides .
