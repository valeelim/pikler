Vibration isolation     vibration isolation is a system of devices to decouple a mechanical or structural object from its vibrating supports . for example , the handles of the saw presented in the right photo are separated from the engine and cutting bar to reduce shaking for the operator . here , the spring mount is a part of this vibration isolation system . when the targeted object is rather heavy ( e.g . building , bridge or the like ) , vibration isolation may be called base isolation . vibration isolation is a branch of protective techniques known as vibration control . from the very beginning , the theory of vibration isolation , in general , and of base isolation , in particular , rested on two pillars : `` heavy damping '' and `` frequency separation '' . unfortunately , nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a `` substructure '' and `` superstructure '' , and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good . other pages . - damping - vibration
