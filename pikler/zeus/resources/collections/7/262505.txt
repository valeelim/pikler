Refrigerant     a refrigerant is a chemical that is found in an air conditioner , a refrigerator , and in other refrigeration equipment . refrigerants can be a liquid or a vapor , depending on their temperature and pressure . most refrigerants in their liquid state will evaporate very fast if at atmospheric pressure , but this depends on the particular refrigerant and its particular boiling point . refrigerants in their vapor state are compressed by a compressor , then cooled by a condenser , where it condenses back into a liquid . the refrigerant is very hot as it leaves the compressor . the refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device , or an expansion device ( there are several types of this part ) where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil . at this point , the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an evaporator , where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it . by the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator , it is all a vapor again , and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again . this is called the refrigeration cycle . this is one example of the use of a refrigerant , as in a residential air conditioning system .
