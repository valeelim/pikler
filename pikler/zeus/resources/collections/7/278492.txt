Manticore     manticores ( from greek `` martikhoras '' , meaning man-eater ) were mythological creatures in greek mythology . they were said to have the body of a lion , a human head , and three rows of teeth similar to sharks . although it changes from story to story , they were also commonly said to have the tail of a dragon or a scorpion . they were also sometimes said to be able to shoot poisonous spines from their tails . when early greeks noticed that someone had gone missing , some viewed this as proof that manticores existed .
