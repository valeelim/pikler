Cattle Egret     the cattle egret ( `` bubulcus ibis '' ) is a cosmopolitan species of heron ( family ardeidae ) found in the tropics , subtropics and warm temperate zones . it is the only member of the genus bubulcus , with two subspecies , the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret . it is a stocky white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season . it nests in colonies , usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds . unlike most other herons , it feeds in relatively dry grassy habitats , often with cattle or other large mammals . it catches insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals . it also captures ticks and flies from cattle . originally native to parts of asia , africa and europe , it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world . this is because humans now raise domesticated cattle throughout most of the world . some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others disperse after breeding .
