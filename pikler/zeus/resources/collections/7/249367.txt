Acacia     acacia is a genus of shrub or tree are belonging to the subfamily mimosoideae of the family fabaceae , first described in africa by the swedish botanist carl linnaeus in 1773. many non-australian species tend to be thorny , whereas the majority of australian acacias are not . acacias are heavily defended against herbivores . different species have different combinations of defences : 1. thorns ( except australia ) 1. chemicals : bitter tannins and psychoactive alkaloids are common in acacias . some species have up to 40 % tannins in their bark 1. ants : in africa and central americs , symbiosis with ants can deter all sizes of enemy , from elephants to caterpillars and stem-boring beetles . some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia , cutting off the offending plant 's leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it . other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts . products from the acacia have often been used for medicinal purposes . various species of acacia yield gum . true gum arabic is the product of `` acacia senegal '' , abundant in dry tropical west africa from senegal to northern nigeria .
