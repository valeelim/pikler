Mayfly     mayflies are insects which belong to the order ephemeroptera ( from the greek `` ephemeros '' = ephemeral , or short-lived ; `` pteron '' = wing ) . the name refers to the most distinctive features of the adults . they are in an ancient group of insects , the palaeoptera , ( 'ancient wings ' ) with dragonflies and damselflies . there are over 3,000 living species of mayfly , in over 400 genera in 42 families . at mating the female lays her eggs in the water . they settle to the bottom where they stick to rocks , vegetation or the bottom of the stream . they range in size by the particular species of mayfly . depending on temperature , the eggs take from a few days to a year to develop : usually it is one to three months . during this embryonic stage the mouth , legs , tail and organs all develop . mayfly are insects whose aquatic larvae ( called `` naiads '' or nymphs ) live from several months up to a year , in freshwater . the naiads go through 20 or 30 moults as they develop . mayflies are unique in that they moult one more time after getting functional wings ( this is known as the `` alate '' stage ) . this second-to-last winged stage is usually very short , lasting from 30 minutes to one day , depending on the species . the function of the adult imago is reproduction and dispersal ; they do not eat . the stage is a favorite food of many fish , and many 'fishing flies ' are modeled on them .
