V12 engine     a v12 engine often just called a v12 is an internal combustion engine with 12 cylinders . the engine has six cylinders on each side called banks . the two banks form a `` v '' shaped angle . in most engines , the two banks are at a 60° angle to each other . all twelve pistons turn a common crankshaft . it can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel and natural gas . each cylinder bank is basically a straight-6 . this set-up has perfect balance no matter which v angle is used . a v12 engine does not need balance shafts . a v12 angled at 45° , 60° , 120° , or 180° from each other has even firing and is smoother than a straight-6 . this provides a smooth running engine for a luxury car . in a racing car , the engine can be made much lighter . this makes the engine more responsive and smoother . in a large heavy-duty engine , a v12 can run slower , and prolonging engine life . v12 engines were first used in aircraft . by the end of world war i , v12s were popular in the fighters and bombers . many zeppelins had v12 engines .
