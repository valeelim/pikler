Great Glen     the great glen is a series of glens in scotland . it runs 100 kilometres from inverness on the moray firth to fort william at the head of loch linnhe . the great glen follows a large geological fault known as the great glen fault . it bisects the scottish highlands into the grampian mountains to the southeast and the northwest highlands to the northwest . the glen is a natural travelling route in the highlands of scotland , which is used by both the caledonian canal and a82 road , which link the city of inverness on the east coast with fort william on the west . it was important in controlling the highland scottish clans , particularly in the jacobite uprisings of the 18th century . this is recognised by the towns of fort william ( population ~10,000 ) in the south , fort augustus ( popln . 600+ ) in the middle of the glen , and fort george ( to this day an army barracks ) , just to the north of inverness . these settlements were built by the british army to control the highlands in the 17th/18th centuries .
