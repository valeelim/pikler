Bombardier beetle     bombardier beetles are ground beetles in the family carabidae . there are more than 500 species which are notable for their defence mechanism . most of them are found in rainforests . when disturbed , the beetle squirts a poisonous chemical spray from special glands in its abdomen . the ejection makes a popping sound . a bombardier beetle produces and stores ( separately ) two chemical compounds which react with each other : hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide . when threatened , the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and enzymes . the reactants undergo a violent chemical reaction which gives off heat . this raises the temperature to near the boiling point of water . the beetle swivels the tip of its abdomen around , and shoots a spray of boiling hot , poisonous chemicals at its attacker .
