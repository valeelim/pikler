Eurypterid     the eurypterids , related to arachnids , were the largest known arthropods . they are members of the extinct order eurypterida . it is a most diverse chelicerate order . the largest , such as `` jaekelopterus '' , reached 2½ metres in length , but most species were less than 20 cm ( 8 inches ) . they were the largest arthropods of all time . they were predators which thrived in the warm , shallow seas and lakes of the ordovician to the permian periods , around 460 to 248 million years ago . recent research suggsts their eyesight was not very good . the move from the sea to fresh water probably occurred by the pennsylvanian period . eurypterids went extinct during the permian–triassic extinction event 251 million years ago , and their fossils have a near global distribution . the typical eurypterid had a large , flat , semicircular carapace , followed by a jointed section , and finally a tapering , flexible tail , most ending with a long spine at the end ( `` pterygotus '' , though , had a large flat tail , possibly with a smaller spine ) . behind the head of the eurypterids were twelve body segments . these segments are formed by a dorsal plate , called a tergite , and a ventral plate , called a sternite . the tail , known as the telson , is spiked in most eurypterids .
