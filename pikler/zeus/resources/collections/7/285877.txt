Stratosphere     the stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet earth . it extends from about 8 km above the poles ( 18 km above the equator ) to about 50 km . in the stratosphere , the temperature rises with increasing height . this makes the stratosphere very stable . this temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some uv radiation from sunlight . the absorbed radiation is converted to heat . this differs from the lower layer , the troposphere , where temperature declines with higher altitude .
