Alnico     alnico is a type of alloy made up of iron with aluminium ( al ) , nickel ( ni ) and cobalt ( co ) . the name is an acronym from al-ni-co. alnico may also contain copper and sometimes titanium . alnico alloys are ferromagnetic ( a mechanism by which some materials form permanent magnets ) . alnico alloys also have a high coercivity ( they do not easily lose their magnetism ) and are used to make permanent magnets . before rare-earth magnets were developed in the 1970s , alnico magnets were the strongest type of magnet . the development of alnico began when t. mishima in japan found that an alloy of iron , nickel , and aluminium had double the coercivity of the best magnets of that time . ( the coercivity of alnico is 400 oersted ) . alnico alloys can be made magnets by strong magnetic fields . rare-earth magnets like neodymium and samarium-cobalt are the only easily found magnets which are stronger than alnico magnets . alnico magnets produce very strong magnetic fields at their poles ( a pole is one of the two ends of a magnet ) as high as 1500 gauss ( 0.15 tesla which is about 3000 times stronger than earth 's magnetic field .
