Phonon     in physics , a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration . the word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed . something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs ; you can only move from step to step and you ca n't stand in between steps . something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline ; you can move any distance up or down . a lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal . a crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern . the points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice . solids , liquids , and gases can all experience vibrations . a vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed . intuitively , there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized . the macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency . it is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important . to understand why phonons exist , complicated quantum mechanics is needed . without going into too much detail , the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically . because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats , when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation , one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed . there is unfortunately no simple way to explain this .
