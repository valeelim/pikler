Protoclepsydrops     protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago . its remains were found at the joggins fossil cliffs world heritage site . the dating of this site has been debated , with dates from 320 million years ago ( mya ) to 305 mya being suggested . it is now settled as 314.5â€“313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years . the skeletal remains of `` protoclepsydrops '' suggest it may have been a synapsid . if so , it is the oldest synapsid known , though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary . `` protoclepsydrops '' lived slightly earlier than `` archaeothyris '' , which was definitely a synapsid . like `` archaeothyris '' , `` protoclepsydrops '' had a body shape which resembled modern lizards .
