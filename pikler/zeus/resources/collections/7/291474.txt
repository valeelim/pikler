RNA splicing     rna splicing is a stage in gene transcription . messenger rna ( mrna ) , which transfers the code from dna to proteins , is built in two stages . in the first stage , each gene is translated into a pre-mrna . then the exons in pre-mrnas are joined by splicing , which is done in the spliceosomes . this is needed because the gene is split into code sections called exons and non-coding sections called introns . the exons are brought together by splicing . so , in molecular biology , splicing is a process where introns are removed and exons are joined . this makes the final mrna . this messenger rna is then used to produce a correct protein by translation . in many cases , the splicing process creates a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same messenger rna . this phenomenon is called alternative splicing . alternative splicing can occur in many ways . exons can be extended or skipped , or introns can be retained . splicing occurs in all the kingdoms or domains of life , however , the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions . eukaryotes splice many protein-coding messenger rnas and some non-coding rnas . prokaryotes , on the other hand , splice rarely . another important difference is that prokaryotes completely lack spliceosomes .
