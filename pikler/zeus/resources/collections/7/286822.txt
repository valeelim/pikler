Anthony Henday     anthony henday ( fl . 1750 – 1762 ) was one of the first white men to explore the interior of the canadian northwest . his explorations were for the hudson 's bay company ( hbc ) who were worried that la vérendrye and the other western commanders were taking furs from the northwest to their forts . henday volunteered to undertake an expedition into this territory . he came from the isle of wight , and was a convicted smuggler and joined the hbc in 1750 as a net-maker and labourer . henday had gained some experience in inland travel after arriving at york factory . on june 26 , 1754 , he set out with a group of plains indians . they passed the french fort paskoya where he may have met la corne , the western commander at that time . in october of 1754 he and his group came to what is now alberta from york factory with a mission to meet the blackfoot and perhaps trade with them . the blackfoot did not give a clear answer , but henday decided they meant “ no ” , so he travelled back to york factory with news that he had explored the area and had met with the blackfoot . since the answer had been unsure , there was no more expeditions to alberta .
