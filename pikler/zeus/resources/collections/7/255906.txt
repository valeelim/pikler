Dental braces     dental braces are wires that are held together by brackets glued to the permanent teeth . the wires and brackets may be made of metal or other materials . each week or month ( or other time the orthodontist decides ) the braces may be checked , cleaned , or changed into a tighter wire . braces are an orthodontic device . they are to make the teeth straight , and to correct problems in a person 's bite . there are many natural problems which occur to the way teeth fit together , but not everyone needs or will need braces . however , the use of braces is quite common , even when they are not medically necessary . their cosmetic use for young females is more common in countries with first world economies . to overcome the visibility of traditional metal braces , there are now nearly transparent braces . sometimes braces are possible behind the teeth , and so are not in view .
