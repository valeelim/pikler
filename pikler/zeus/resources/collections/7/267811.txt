0.999...    0.999 ... 0.999 ... ( also written as 0. , and read as `` 0 point 9 repeating '' ) is one of the ways the number 1 ( one ) can be written . even though it is written like this , no matter how many nines there are before the ellipsis , it is still equal to 1 . 0.999 ... is a repeating decimal , which means the digit `` 9 '' is repeated forever . it is different from 0.999 , which only has three 9s . 0.999 ... can also be written as formula_1 , formula_2 or formula_3 . it is hard for many people to understand why 0.999 ... is the same as 1. there are many proofs that show why they are the same number , but many of these proofs are very complex . one simple way of showing that 0.999 ... and 1 are the same thing is to divide them both by the number 3. when 0.999 ... is divided by 3 , the answer is 0.333 ... , which is the same as ( the fraction one third ) . when 1 is divided by 3 , the answer is . since the answers are the same , that means that 0.999 ... and 1 are the same . another way of thinking about it is if = 0.333 ... and = 0.666 ... , then = 0.999 ... = 1. there are many other ways of showing this .
