Icing (ice hockey)    icing ( ice hockey ) icing in ice hockey is a rule the happens when a player shoots the puck across at least two red lines , the other team 's goal line being the last , and the puck remains untouched but it is not icing if the player shoots the puck from behind the halfway line of the ice into the goal . if the goal went into the net it would be counted as a goal . there is also automatic or no-touch icing which is used mostly in lower-level professional hockey leagues like the echl and central hockey league , it was enforced in 1990 after luděk čajka , a czech player rushed to get to the puck in an icing situation , he crashed into the boards , suffered severe spinal injuries , and died a few weeks later . sometimes the goaltender will raise his hand for icing also . if icing is waved off by a referee it is either because : - the team committing the icing is shorthanded , ( penalty killing ) . - the linesman believes that a player on the other team ( other than the goalkeeper ) could have played the puck before it crossed the goal line .
