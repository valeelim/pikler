Casquets     les casquets or ( the ) casquets ( ) is a group of rocks 13 kilometres ( 8.08 mi ) northwest of alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge . other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of burhou and ortac . little grows on them . theories as to the origin of the name include : - derivation from the french 'cascade ' , which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them ; - derivation from 'casque ' , referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks ; - derivation from 'cas ' ( broken ) and 'quet ' ( rock ) . a map ( `` leyland map '' ) dated from around 1640 gives a latin name `` casus rupes '' ( broken rocks ) , which would seem to confirm the third theory above , but which may be a folk etymology . there have been numerous wrecks on the islets ; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area . the most famous include ss `` stella '' , wrecked in 1899. the largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker `` constantia s '' . it was believed for centuries that hms `` victory '' was wrecked in 1744 on the casquets , the lightkeeper of alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship 's loss . however , when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008 , it was over 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ) from the casquets .
