Diastole     diastole ( ) is the time during a heart beat when the heart fills with blood after a contraction . the contraction of the heart is called systole and is the opposite of diastole . the term `` diastole '' comes from the greek word `` διαστολη '' . this means expanding or opening . there are two types of diastole . - ventricular diastole is the time when the two lower chambers of the heart called the `` ventricles '' are relaxing to let the blood to flow in . - atrial diastole is the time when the two upper chambers of the heart called the `` atria '' are relaxing to allow the blood to flow in . during ventricular diastole , the pressure in the ( left and right ) ventricles drops . when the pressure in the left ventricle becomes lower than the pressure in the left atrium , the mitral valve opens . the blood then flows from the atrium into the ventricle . the speed at which the blood flows into the ventricles can be used to diagnose diastolic dysfunction . because the heart relaxes during diastole , `` diastolic pressure '' is the lowest pressure within the arterial blood stream during each heart beat . the highest arterial pressure happens when the heart muscle contracts , and is called systolic pressure .
