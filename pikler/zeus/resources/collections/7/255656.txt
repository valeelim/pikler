B cell     b cells are lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell . once the b cell is activated , it turns into a plasma cell , and starts producing antibodies . they are a vital part of the adaptive immune system . they have a protein on the b cell 's outer surface known as a 'b cell receptor ' . this allows a b cell to bind to a specific antigen . the main functions of b cells are : 1. to make antibodies against antigens , 1. to perform the role of antigen-presenting cells ( apcs ) , 1. to develop into memory b cells after activation by antigen interaction . recently , a new , suppressive function of b cells has been discovered . in mammals , immature b cells are formed in the bone marrow , hence their name . other websites . - b cells and t cells - b cell development and generation of lymphocyte diversity - interactive animation of b cell maturation ( requires flash video software )
