Mie scattering     mie scattering is the way that light scatters when it hits an object . it is named after the german physicist , gustav mie . this theory is good for all wavelengths of light , and all object sizes . if the object is much smaller than the wavelength of light , rayleigh scattering theory is also quite good . when the object is big , the light can hit many places on the object . a quite good formula for the scattering is :
