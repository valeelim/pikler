Geyser     a geyser is a hot spring which shoots out water and steam . they erupt when pressure has built up , often at regular intervals . there are about a thousand geysers around the world . about half are in yellowstone national park , wyoming , united states . geysers are made in special geological conditions . only a few places on earth have these conditions . because of this , geysers are not very common . one place is the yellowstone national park , which is the remains of a gigantic volcano . another is iceland , which sits on top of the mid-atlantic ridge , where new earth 's crust is formed . geysers are often near active volcanos . this is because the geyser is caused by magma . surface water usually goes down to about . there , it mixes with hot rocks . the pressurized water begins to boil . when it is pressured enough , hot water and steam burst out of the geyser . individual geysers do not last forever , but `` systems '' of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues . the oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old . geysers are usually near volcanic areas . as the water boils , the pressure increases . this forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser . geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes .
