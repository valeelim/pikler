Hamiltonian mechanics     hamiltonian mechanics is a mathematical way of understanding the way something mechanical will behave . it was invented in 1833 by irish mathematician william rowan hamilton . the value of the hamiltonian is the total energy of the thing being described . for a closed system , it is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy . there will be a set of differential equations known as the hamilton equations which show how the thing changes through time . hamiltonians can be used to describe such simple systems as a bouncing ball , a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes between kinetic and potential energy and back again over time . hamiltonians can also be used to study the orbits of planets and in the behaviour of atoms using the principles of quantum mechanics .
