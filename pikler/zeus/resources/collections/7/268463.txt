Ionization energy     ionization energy is the energy needed to take an electron from an atom . the atom is not connected to any other atoms . the chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy . the ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy . the chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy ( due to electrons being farther away from the atom with increasing atomic radius ) . the ionization energy increases as each electron is removed .
