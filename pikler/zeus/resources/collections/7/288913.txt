Mazon Creek     mazon creek is a lagerst√§tte in northeast illinois . it is a site of exceptional fossil preservation from the pennsylvanian sub-period of the carboniferous , about 300 million years ago . the area was declared a national historic landmark in 1997. the site 's greatest find is the oldest-known beetle . the sediments were laid in a gigantic tropical estuary , a river delta with shifting channels and mud and sand bars . much of the continent was then covered by a great internal epeiric sea , which sometimes swept over the area , and then withdrew . coal measures are formed like this . a low-lying tropical swamp or rain forest forms a peat swamp which is short of oxygen . dead plant material builds up , and does not decompose entirely . the plant material gets buried as a peat bog . from time to time rivers bring down a load of sediment from nearby mountains , covering the swamp . eventually layers of coal alternate with layers of sandy deposit . pressure turns it all into hard rock . later on , the rocks are uncovered by erosion , and fossils can be found by humans .
