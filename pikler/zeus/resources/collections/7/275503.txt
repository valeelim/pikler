Bottom quark     bottom quarks or beauty quarks are the second most massive of the elementary particles ( particles that are so small that they can not be divided any more ) . all quarks are elementary particles . bottom quarks have a charge of -1/3 , similar to down quarks . although bottom quarks are not very common , they are found in particles such as b mesons , among others . all bottom quarks will decay into charm quarks or up quarks in about 10 , due to weak force .
