Nippur     nippur , or `` enlil '' ( 'lord wind ' ) , is modern `` nuffar '' in iraq . nippur was one of the most ancient of all the sumerian cities . it was the special seat of the worship of the sumerian god , `` enlil '' , ruler of the cosmos ( universe ) , and subject to `` an '' alone . nippur was always part of a larger empire . its control was crucial , as it gave overall 'kingship ' to monarchs from other city-states . it was a sacred city , important because it had the famous shrine of `` enlil '' . late in the 3rd millennium bc , nippur was conquered and occupied by the semitic rulers of akkad , and their rulers , like sargon , left gifts at this sanctuary . another ruler , naram-suen , rebuilt the temple and the city walls ; in the debris of this ancient site his remains were found . this akkadian occupation was succeeded by an occupation during the third dynasty of ur , and the constructions of ur-nammu , the great builder of temples , are on top of those of naram . under the succeeding kassite dynasty , shortly after the middle of the 2nd millennium , nippur was restored once more to its former splendour .
