Polyphyly     polyphyly is a term in cladistics . it describes a group of organisms whose last common ancestor is not a member of the group . another way of expressing this is to say that polyphyly includes groups some members of which are descended from ancestral populations . the diagrams show that birds and mammals are indeed related , but only at the level of the early amniotes . in terms of evolution , there is a vast gulf between them . more common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants ( say , living mammals ) without the group they evolved from ( which would be some clade in the therapsida ) . this is done for convenience ; but it makes the mammals polyphyletic . biological classification aims to group species together such that every group is descended from a single common ancestor . a polyphyletic group can be `` fixed '' either by excluding clades or by adding the common ancestor . according to cladistics it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are monophyletic . however , other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are paraphyletic , contain their most recent common ancestor but does not all the descendants of that ancestor .
