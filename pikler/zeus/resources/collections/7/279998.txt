Stamen     a stamen is a male reproductive organ of a flower . it produces the pollen . the stamen has two parts : the anther , and the stalk . the stalk is also called the filament . the anther contains microsporangia . each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells . these undergo meiosis , and produce pollen grains , which contain the male gametes ( sperm ) . the pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes . the pollen is released by the opening of the anther . the pollen is carried by some agent ( wind , or some animal ) to the receptive surface of the stigma of the same or another flower . this process is known as pollination . after successful pollination , the pollen grain ( immature microgametophyte ) completes its development by growing a `` pollen tube '' and the two male gametes move through the pollen tube to the ovule .
