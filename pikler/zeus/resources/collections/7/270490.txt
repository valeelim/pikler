New South Greenland     new south greenland , which is also known as morrell 's land , was an appearance of land recorded by the american captain benjamin morrell . morrel reported the sighting on the schooner `` wasp '' in , during a seal hunting and exploration voyage in the weddell sea area of antarctica . he provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline . morrel claimed to have sailed along the coastline for more than . the weddel sea is in the antarctic . because of icebergs , it was difficult to navigate , and few people did . the sighting was never investigated properly , at the time . expeditions to antarctica in the early 20th century proved that there was no land at the positions recorded by morrell . at the time of morrell 's voyage the weddel sea had not been named and its geography and coastline was almost entirely unknown . this made the sighting plausible at the start . morrell made obvious errors when he told about the new sighting . he also had the reputation of liking to invent new stories . these two aspects made many people sceptical about the sighting . in the german explorer wilhelm filchner 's ship `` deutschland '' was blocked by ice in the weddel sea and drifted into the area , where morrell had reported the new land . filchcher searched for the land , but found no trace of it . a sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than of water , indicating no land nearby . three years later , trapped in the same waters with his ship `` endurance '' , ernest shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the land 's non-existence .
