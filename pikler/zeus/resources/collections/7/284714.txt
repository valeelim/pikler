Acanthodii     acanthodii ( sometimes called spiny sharks ) is a class of extinct fishes , having features of both bony fish ( osteichthyes ) and cartilaginous fish ( chondrichthyes ) . they appeared in the early silurian ( 430 mya ) and lasted until the late permian ( 250 mya ) . the earliest ancanthodians were marine , but during the devonian , freshwater species became predominant . they are distinguished in two respects : they were the first known jawed vertebrates , and they had stout spines supporting their fins , fixed in place and non-movable ( like a shark 's dorsal fin ) .
