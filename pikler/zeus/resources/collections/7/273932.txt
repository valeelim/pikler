Halophile     halophiles are organisms that need salt in their environment to live . halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as great salt lake , owens lake , or dead sea . the name `` halophile '' comes from greek for `` salt-loving '' . most halophiles are archaeans , but some bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles , such as the alga `` dunaliella salina '' . most halophilic and salt-eating animals use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm . normally , organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of osmosis . water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment . this is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the cell membrane . to survive , the cytoplasm of halophiles must be isotonic with its environment . to get to this state , halophiles use two different methods . in the first ( mainly used by bacteria , some archaea , yeasts , algae and fungi ) , organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm . these compounds help the organism survive the stress of osmosis . the most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars . advantages to this method are that organisms can live in a wider range of salt concentrations . also , if proteins are not exposed to high salt levels , they do not have to adapt to high salt levels . it requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below .
