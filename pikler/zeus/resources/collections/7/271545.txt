Weaning     weaning means changing the diet of a baby little by little , from its mother 's milk to the food it will eat as an adult . since only female mammals make milk , weaning is only a necessary process for mammals . when a baby does not drink any more breast milk ( or milk substitute ) , the baby has been weaned . human babies should start eating small amounts of solid food , along with breast milk or formula , when they are about six months old . before this time , a child 's digestive system and kidneys are still forming , so the child is not ready for solid food . babies do not have teeth and can not chew their food , so they are usually fed soft , runny food such as cooked mashed fruit or vegetables . babies can not digest some foods which adults can eat , including food with nuts or with large amounts of gluten , salt or sugar . also , babies ' digestive systems are very sensitive to bacteria , so they should not eat any foods with honey , eggs or shellfish in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria .
