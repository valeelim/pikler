Cocculus carolinus     cocculus carolinus otherwise known as `` carolina coralbead '' , `` redberry moonseed '' or the `` carolina snailseed '' . it is indigenous to several states along the south to midwest . it gets its name from the bright red color of the marble like berry that protrudes from the leaves of the plant . the carolina coralbead is a deciduous , woody vine that can twines along the trunks of several trees or along the ground . it occurs in timberline areas , rocky woods , glades , fence rows and ponds . carolina coralbead can grow 10–12 ft ( 3–3.6 m ) and usually spaced within 3–4 ft ( 90–120 cm ) of one another . if ingested in large amounts , the berry on cocculus carolinus can be poisonous , but the overall toxicity of its berries do not prove to be fatal . in areas in little rock , arkansas , the carolina coralbead is referred to as an invasive weed system which seedlings have been spread by birds . once a root system has been established , it is hard to remove the plant , so planting in new areas has been a point of concern for this plant . the best ornamental features of the plant are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall . `` cocculus carolinus '' can grow in temperatures between from -3.8 °c ( 25 °f ) to -28.8 °c ( -20 °f ) . its leaves are covered in short hairs and should not be confused with the species `` smilax bona-nox '' , which has tendrils and prickles .
