Sinodelphys     sinodelphys is an extinct mammal from the lower cretaceous . it is a member of the infraclass metatheria , the group which contains modern marsupials . to date , it is the oldest metatherian fossil known , estimated to be 125 million years old . this makes it almost contemporary to the earliest placental fossils , which have been found in the same area . it was discovered and described in 2003 in rocks of the yixian formation in liaoning province , china , by a team of scientists . `` sinodelphys szalayi '' grew only 15 cm ( 5.9 in ) long and possibly weighed about 30 g ( 1.05 oz ) . its fossilized skeleton is surrounded by impressions of fur and soft tissue . rapid burial followed volcanic events , and the fine sediment preserved details . from its foot structure it is thought that `` sinodelphys '' was a tree-dweller , like its non-marsupial contemporary `` eomaia '' and modern opossums such as `` didelphis '' . `` sinodelphys '' probably hunted worms and insects . most mesozoic metatherians have been found in north america and asia . most lived during the upper cretaceous between 90-65 million years ago .
