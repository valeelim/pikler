Northern Isles     the northern isles are a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland scotland . the group includes shetland , fair isle and orkney . sometimes stroma is included , which is part of caithness . the northern isles are usually separated for political purposes , but they come under the orkney and shetland parliamentary constituency in westminster . due to their history , the islands have a norse , rather than a gaelic flavour , and have historic links with the faroes , iceland , and norway . orkney and shetland were given to scotland as a deposit on the dowry of margaret of denmark when she married james iii of scotland in 1469 .
