Sexual selection     sexual selection is a special kind of natural selection . it is a theory of charles darwin that certain traits can be explained by competition `` within '' a species . darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the `` struggle between the individuals of one sex , generally the males , for the possession of the other sex '' . it is usually males who fight each other . traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics ( including horns , antlers , etc . ) and sometimes referred to as 'weapons ' . traits selected by mate choice are called 'ornaments ' . females often prefer to mate with males with external ornaments—exaggerated features of morphology . genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism—features that also benefit females . this idea is known as the 'good genes ' hypothesis . sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today . ernst mayr said :
