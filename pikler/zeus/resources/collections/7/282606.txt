Transformation (genetics)    transformation ( genetics ) in molecular biology , transformation is the genetic alteration of a cell by the direct uptake and expression of dna from its surroundings . transformation occurs naturally in some species of bacteria , and can also be done artificially . bacteria that are capable of being transformed , whether naturally or artificially , are called `` competent '' . transformation is one of three processes by which outside genetic material may be got into bacterial cells . the other two are conjugation ( transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact ) , and transduction ( injection of foreign dna by a bacteriophage into the host ) . transformation may also used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells , such as animal and plant cells . introduction of foreign dna into eukaryote cells is usually called `` transfection '' . transformation was first demonstrated in 1928 by british bacteriologist frederick griffith . griffith discovered that a harmless strain of `` streptococcus pneumoniae '' could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains .
