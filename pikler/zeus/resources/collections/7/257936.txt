Oxidation state     oxidation state refers to the number of electrons added to or removed from an element . sodium metal , for example , has an oxidation state of 0 in the elemental state . but when it gives up its one valence ( outer ) electron ( symbolized by e ) , it becomes a sodium ion with an oxidation state of +1 . iron is another example . it can lose two electrons , forming an oxidation state of +2 ; or it can lose 3 , forming an oxidation state of +3 . if elements gain electrons , they have negative oxidation states . if chlorine gains an electron , it forms a -1 ion . if sulfur gains two electrons , it forms a -2 ion . the oxidation state determines the number of atoms of other elements that can to the atom . all elements have an oxidation state of 0 . 1. oxygen has an oxidation number -2 in most of its compounds except peroxides where it has an oxidation number -1 . 1. hydrogen has oxidation state +1 in most compounds except with electropositive elements . ex : na . 1. alkali earth metals have oxidation state +2
