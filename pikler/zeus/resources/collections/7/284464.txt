Battenberg cake     battenberg cake is a light sponge cake . it is long , square faced cake , covered in marzipan . when cut in open one can see four more squares alternately coloured pink and yellow . these coloured sections are made by dyeing half of the cake mixture pink , and half yellow , then cutting each resultant sponge into two long , uniform cuboids , and joining them together with apricot jam , to form one cake . established variations are for coconut flavouring to the sponge cake and lemon curd or raspberry jam in place of apricot jam . the cake was probably named in honour of the marriage , in 1884 , of princess victoria of hesse and by rhine queen victoria 's granddaughter to prince louis of battenberg , with the four squares representing the four battenberg princes : louis , alexander , henry and francis joseph . other websites . - a recipe for battenberg cake
