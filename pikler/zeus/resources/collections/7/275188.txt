Pion     pions ( commonly shortened to a π ) are a type of meson , which are subatomic particles made of a combination of quarks and antiquarks . since antiquarks are antimatter , they will annihilate the same type ( known as a flavour ) of quark if they come near it . however , this reaction is not instantaneous , and so pions , like all mesons , can exist for a short amount of time . what makes pions different from other mesons is that they are made of one up quark and one down quark , either of which can be the antiparticle . pions are significant in science because they are thought to be responsible for the strong force interactions that occur between nucleons ( protons or neutrons ) . there are three types of pions : π , π , and π. the + , - , or 0 in above the π simply refers to the charge of the pion . π are made of one up quark and one down antiquark . π are made of one down quark and one up antiquark . since antiparticles have the opposite charge , a π is positive because an up quark has a charge of +2/3 , and a down antiquark ( normal down quarks have a charge of -1/3 ) has a charge of +1/3 . the reverse statement applies for π. π can be formed with one up quark and an up antiquark , or one down quark and one down antiquark .
