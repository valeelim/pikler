Heterodontosaur     the heterodontosauridae ( `` different-toothed lizards '' ) is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs . they have often been considered basal ornithopods , although recent studies suggest they may have been more closely related to marginocephalians . although their fossils are rare , they lived around the globe beginning in the upper triassic and may have persisted into the lower cretaceous . a large gap , called a diastema , separated the premaxillary teeth from the those of the maxilla ( the main upper jaw bone ) in many ornithischia , but this diastema was arched in heterodontosaurs . the mandible ( lower jaw ) was tipped by the predentary , a bone unique to ornithischia . this bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla . all the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone . heterodontosaurids are called that because they have two different kinds of teeth . there were three premaxillary teeth . in the early jurassic `` abrictosaurus '' , `` heterodontosaurus '' , and `` lycorhinus '' , the first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical , while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the `` caniniform '' or 'tusk ' .
