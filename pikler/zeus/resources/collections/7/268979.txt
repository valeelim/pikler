Icelandic name     icelandic names are different from most other naming systems used in the west , in that the names follow a patronymic ( sometimes matronymic ) surname pattern . this means that when a person is named , their last name is the name of their father , plus -sson . so if a man called eric had a son called leif , leif 's name would be leif ericsson . the same is true for females , although sometimes women take the name of their father for their last name , or the name of their mother . also , the suffix -sdottír is added to the end of the parent 's name . so , if a girl called astrid 's parents were leif and inga , then their daughter could be called either astrid leifsdóttir , or astrid ingasdóttir . this is naming system is the same naming system that was used by the vikings . iceland has kept this naming system because iceland is an island , and had little contact with the outside world for quite some time , so there was not much change in things like customs , language and naming systems .
