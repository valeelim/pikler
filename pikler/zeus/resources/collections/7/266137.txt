Thermite     thermite is an incendiary mixture . it is not an explosive , but can burn very fast and very hot . it is made of an oxide of a less reactive metal mixed with a more reactive metal . one of the most common mixtures is iron ( iii ) oxide-aluminium . the iron ( iii ) oxide oxidizes the aluminium , being reduced to iron in the process . the aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide . many other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite . some metals that can be used are boron , magnesium , calcium , titanium , zinc , or silicon . some metal oxides that can be used are copper ( ii ) oxide , chromium ( iii ) oxide , iron ( ii , iii ) oxide , manganese ( iv ) oxide , silicon dioxide , boron trioxide , or lead ( ii , iv ) oxide . a metal can not be used with its metal oxide . the metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide , or the thermite will not work . the reaction for an aluminium-iron ( iii ) oxide thermite is this : it is difficult to ignite thermite . it needs to be very hot . ribbons of magnesium metal are used . a mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerin can be used to ignite thermite . it can be ignited by a flint lighter or a child 's sparkler . it can be mixed with sulfur to make thermate , which makes it easier to melt the iron .
