Neijia     , literally `` internal family '' , is a term in chinese martial arts , grouping those styles that practice , literally `` internal strength '' , usually translated as internal martial arts , occupied with spiritual , mental or qi-related aspects , as opposed to an `` external '' ) approach focused on physiological aspects . the distinction dates to the 17th century , but its modern application is due to publications by sun lutang , dating to the period of 1915 to 1928. nèi jìng is developed by using `` nèigōng '' , or `` internal exercises , '' as opposed to `` wài gōng '' , `` external exercises . '' nèijiā is a broad term used mistakenly in the west as a synonym for the more specific wǔdāngquán styles , named for their association with the taoist monasteries of wudangshan range , hubei province in chinese popular legend . these styles are enumerated by sun lutang as tàijíquán , xíngyìquán and bāguàzhǎng , but must also include bājíquán and the legendary wudang sword . some other chinese arts , not in the wudangquan group , such as liuhebafa , bak mei pai , bok foo pai and yiquan are frequently classified ( or classify themselves ) as `` internal '' .
