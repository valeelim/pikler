Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?    brother , can you spare a dime ? `` brother , can you spare a dime ? `` , also sung as `` buddy , can you spare a dime ? `` , is one of the best-known american songs of the great depression . written in 1931 by lyricist e. y . `` yip '' harburg and composer jay gorney , `` brother , can you spare a dime ? '' was part of the 1932 musical `` new americana ; '' the melody is based on a russian lullaby gorney heard as a child . it became best known , however , through recordings by bing crosby and rudy vallee . both versions were released right before franklin delano roosevelt 's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts . the brunswick crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period , and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era . the song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads , built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war ( world war i ) , who tilled the earth , who did what their nation asked of them should , now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary , find themselves abandoned , in bread lines .
