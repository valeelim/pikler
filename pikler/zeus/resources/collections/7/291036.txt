Terrace farming     `` terrace farming '' is a type of farming that consists of different `` steps '' or terraces that were developed in various places around the world . the rice terraces of the philippine cordilleras ( hills and mountains ) is a world heritage site . it dates back two thousand years . this method of farming uses `` steps '' that are built into the side of a mountain or hill . on each level , various crops are planted . when it rains , instead of washing away all of the nutrients in the soil , the nutrients are carried down to the next level . additionally , these steps prevent a free flowing avalanche of water that would take plants with it and destroy all of the crops on the hillside . this system also allowed them to build aqueducts , which carried water to each level . the idea was also independently developed by the inca people . the incas built their aqueduct system so well that it is still used today . references . - terrace farming : a unique agricultural solution . social studies for kids . web . 11 apr . 2011 .
