Waves at shallow water     waves at shallow water develop when the ocean surface waves travel into the coastal area where the wavelength is much larger than the water depth . the normal circular motion of the water particles there is disrupted by the ocean bottom . as the water becomes shallower , the swell on the water surface becomes higher and steeper . after the wave breaks , the water flows violently , turbulently . this is where erosion of the ocean bottom and shore line intensifies dramatically . the most devastating effect may happen in the case of tsunami . other pages . - ocean surface wave
