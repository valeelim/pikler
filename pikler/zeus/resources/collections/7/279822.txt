Golden Fleece     in greek mythology , the golden fleece is the fleece of the gold-haired winged ram . it is in the story of jason and his group of argonauts . they set out on a quest ordered by king pelias to get the fleece so that jason can rightfully claim the throne of iolcus in thessaly . the story is very old ; it was current in the time of homer in the 8th century bc . there are many different versions of the story . in later versions the ram is said to have been the child of the sea god poseidon and themisto ( less often , nephele or theophane ) . the famous telling is the `` argonautica '' of apollonius of rhodes , written in mid-third century bc alexandria . it reused early sources that have not survived . another , much less-known argonautica , using the same body of myth , was written in latin by valerius flaccus during the time of vespasian.the story of jason , the argonauts , and the golden fleece is told in two modern movies : `` hercules '' starring steve reeves , and `` jason and the argonauts '' starring todd armstrong .
