Colour vision     colour vision is the capacity of an organism to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths ( or frequencies ) of the light they reflect , emit , or transmit . colour is a quality constructed by the visual brain and not a property of objects . a 'red ' apple does not emit red light . rather , it simply absorbs all the frequencies of visible light shining on it except for a group of frequencies that are reflected . it is these frequencies which are perceived as red . the nervous system derives colour by comparing the responses to light from the several types of cone photoreceptors in the eye . these cone photoreceptors are sensitive to different portions of the visible spectrum . for humans , the visible spectrum ranges approximately from 380 to 740 nm , and there are normally three types of cones . the visible range and number of cone types differ between species . with colour vision gets better vision ( more information ) about the things it sees . this lets it see when fruit or vegetables are ripe , and lets it see animals hiding from plain sight . the advantage of colour vision is mainly in the daytime . at night the main problem is to collect light and see in the weak light . this is something rods do better than cones .
