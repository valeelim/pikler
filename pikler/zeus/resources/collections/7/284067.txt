Knockout mouse     a knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse in which one or more genes have been turned off by a gene knockout . knockout mice are important animal models for studying the role of genes which have been sequenced but whose functions are not yet known . by causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse , and observing any differences from normal behaviour or condition , researchers can infer its probable function . mice are currently the most closely related laboratory animal species to humans for which the knockout technique can easily be applied . they are widely used in knockout experiments , especially those genetic questions which relate to human physiology . gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only been possible since 2003. the first knockout mouse was created by mario r. capecchi , martin evans and oliver smithies in 1989 , for which they were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 2007. a detailed explanation of how knockout ( ko ) mice are produced is at the website of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2007 .
