Composite particle     composite particles are subatomic particles that are made of more than one quark . simple particles like protons are actually composites of multiple quarks . protons are known as baryons , which means that they are made of exactly three quarks . baryons are in a family called hadrons , which simply means that they are made of quarks . the only other subcategory of hadrons is mesons , which are made of one quark and one antiquark . since they are made of quarks , composite particles are not so much hard balls , but rather like clouds that contain these quarks . depending on the energy contained by the quarks , the quarks of a proton vibrate , and this gives a proton a size larger than the actual size of the three quarks combined .
