Sheriff     a sheriff is generally a legal official with responsibility for a county or parish . the duties of a sheriff vary from country to country . the term comes from anglo-norman english . the kings officer in each shire was called a `` shire-reeve '' . his function was to enforce the king 's law in the shire or county . the term shire reeve appears in documents in england in the early 11th century . when william the conqueror conquered england in 1066 , he kept most of the anglo-saxon sheriffs . when william abolished the great anglo-saxon earldoms , the sheriff became the immediate representative of the king in the county . his appointment was typically for one year . he held court where he punished minor offenders . later , his powers were reduced to arresting and imprisoning criminals . when the american colonies began to grow , britain established political control . as each colony established counties , a sheriff was appointed to keep law and order . he was also an officer of the british court . the sheriff had different titles in different colonies . in rhode island he was called a general sergeant . in connecticut and massachusetts the title was marshal . in plymouth colony he was called a messenger . in the later colonial period , sheriffs were appointed by the colonial governor . they collected taxes , testified in court and served subpoenas . because they were paid per task , and tax collecting paid the most , enforcing the law became a lower priority .
