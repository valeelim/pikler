Cunard Line     cunard line is a shipping company that was founded in 1840 and runs cruise ships all over the world . cunard was formed in 1840 by samuel cunard after he decided to start a company that would carry mail from england to the united states . england paid for the costs of this service , since the country wanted a more regular service than the sailing ships of the time could do . cunard started with four steam ships that made crossings of the atlantic ocean once a week . the company became known for its record of good safetyâ€“while ships of other companies often sank , killing many people , these sorts of things rarely happened to cunard . by the early 1900s , though , cunard was faced with many other ships from several countries also competing with it for passengers going across the atlantic . this caused the company to build three new ships , larger and faster than the ones before them . they were named rms `` mauretania '' , rms `` lusitania '' and rms `` aquitania '' . theses ships made cunard back into a leading shipping line , even though `` lusitania '' was sunk during world war i by a german submarine , killing 1,200 people .
