Safe mode     safe mode is a mode of startup in computers that allows the user to detect and fix errors . many things do n't run on safe mode . the purpose is to see whether any of the recently added or updated device drivers were causing the problem . when safe mode is used , a computer will only start with the minimum number of system files needed for it to work properly . this is to make it easier to find a problem that may be causing a computer to work incorrectly . the screen resolution is also smaller and there is no sound or internet connection in safe mode . this is because these features are not necessary for the computer to work properly .
