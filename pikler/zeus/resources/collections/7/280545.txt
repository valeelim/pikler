Charge conjugation     charge conjugation describes a type of symmetry of nature . to preform a charge conjugation , one would exchange all particles with their corresponding antiparticles . this action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the electromagnetic charge would be reversed . for example , one could make an antihydrogen atom with an antiproton and an antielectron . this would result in an atom with a negatively charged nucleus orbited by a positively charged positron . the masses of the nucleus and the lepton orbiting the nucleus would remain unchanged . if the behavior of the system ( such as the atom mentioned above ) remains unchanged after charge conjugation , the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation . this symmetry is also known as `` c symmetry .
