Oxygen difluoride     oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula of . it has a v-shaped molecular structure like ho , but has different properties . it is a strong oxidizer . oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929. it was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid . the chemicals had small amount of moisture . nowadays , it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide . sodium fluoride is left as a side-product : it is a very powerful oxidizing agent . this is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom . this oxidising number is quite unusual . above 200 Â°c , of decomposes to oxygen and fluorine . of reacts with many metals . it produces oxides and fluorides . nonmetals also react with it . phosphorus reacts with of to form pf and pof . sulfur produces so and sf with it . a noble gas , xenon also reacts with it . it produces xef and xenon oxyfluorides . oxygen difluoride reacts very slowly with water to form hydrofluoric acid :
