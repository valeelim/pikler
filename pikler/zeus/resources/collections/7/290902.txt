François Jacob     françois jacob ( 17 june 1920 – 19 april 2013 ) was a french biologist . he shared the 1965 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with jacques monod and andré lwoff . jacob , with jacques monod , discovered a fundamental control system in cells . enzyme levels in all cells is regulated by feedback on transcription . like his colleague monod , jacob was an almost lifelong atheist . in 1961 jacob and monod explored the idea that the control of enzyme expression levels in cells is a result of feedback on the transcription of dna sequences . for many years it had been known that bacterial and other cells could respond to external conditions by regulating levels of their key metabolic enzymes , and/or the activity of these enzymes . for instance , if a bacterium finds itself in a broth containing lactose , rather than the simpler sugar glucose , it must adapt itself to : 1. import lactose , 1. cut lactose to its constituents glucose and galactose , and 1. convert the galactose to glucose . it was known that cells increase the enzymes for these steps when exposed to lactose .
