Aaron Klug     sir aaron klug om prs ( želva , lithuania , 11 august 1926 ) is a british chemist and biophysicist . klug won the 1982 nobel prize in chemistry for developing crystallographic electron microscopy and working out the structure of nucleic acid-protein complexes . klug was born in želva , lithuania to jewish parents . the family moved to south africa when he was two . klug graduated with a degree in science at the university of witwatersrand and studied crystallography at the university of cape town before moving to england , completing his doctorate at trinity college , cambridge in 1953. he moved to birkbeck college , university of london , in late 1953 , and started working with rosalind franklin in john bernal 's lab . this experience aroused a lifelong interest in viruses . during his time there he worked on the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus . in 1962 he moved to the newly built mrc laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge . klug used methods from x-ray diffraction to develop crystallographic electron microscopy . in this method , two-dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to make three-dimensional images of the target . he worked out the structure of important nucleic acid-protein complexes .
