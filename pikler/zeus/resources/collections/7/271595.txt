Globular protein     globular proteins are a common type of protein . they are one of three types of protein . the others are fibrous and membrane proteins . their structure is a result of protein folding . they are made of polypeptide chains folded into a compact sphere shape . they are soluble in water because of the hydrophilic ( 'water-loving ' ) side chains that project from the outside of the molecules . they play an important role in metabolic reactions . unlike proteins which only have a structural function , globular proteins can act as : - enzymes , by catalyzing organic reactions taking place in the organism in mild conditions and with a great specificity . different esterases fulfill this role . - messengers , by transmitting messages to regulate biological processes . this function is done by hormones , i.e . insulin etc . - transporters of other molecules through membranes - stocks of amino acids . - regulation of other molecules is also done by globular proteins rather than fibrous proteins . - structural proteins , e.g. , actin and tubulin , which are globular and soluble as monomers , but polymerize to form long , stiff fibers .
