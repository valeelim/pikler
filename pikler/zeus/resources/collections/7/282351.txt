Hollandaise sauce     hollandaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolk and butter . lemon juice , salt , and a little white pepper or cayenne pepper are often added as seasoning . hollandaise light yellow and opaque , smooth and creamy : it tastes rich and buttery , with a mild tang added by the seasonings , but not so strong as to overpower mildly flavoured foods . hollandaise sauce is well known as a key ingredient of eggs benedict , and is often paired with vegetables such as steamed asparagus . hollandaise is one of the five mother sauces in french haute cuisine . hollandaise sauce got its name because it was thought to be like a dutch sauce . as early as 1651 , françois pierre la varenne describes a sauce similar to hollandaise sauce in his groundbreaking cookbook `` le cuisinier françois '' : `` avec du bon beurre frais , un peu de vinaigre , sel et muscade , et un jaune d ’ œuf pour lier la sauce '' alan davidson notes a `` sauce à la hollandoise '' from françois marin 's `` les dons de comus '' ( 1758 ) , but since that sauce included flour , bouillon , and herbs , and omitted egg yolks , it may not be related to the modern hollandaise .
