Caps lock     caps lock is the name of a key on a computer keyboard . when you press this key , letters that you type will be capital letters ( like this , `` abc '' ) , instead of lowercase ( `` abc '' ) . the caps lock key is usually above the shift key and below the tab key on the left side of the keyboard . however , some people prefer it to be in other locations . the way the caps lock key works is that once you press it , a light may come on , or you may get a message on the screen . this lets you know that text that you type will be in uppercase letters . when you press the key again , the light turns off , or another message may appear , saying that caps lock has been turned off and text you type will be back to lowercase letters . some keyboards and typewriters have a key called shift lock . it is a lot like the caps lock key in that letters you type will be in uppercase instead of lowercase . but shift lock also does something else : when it is on , keys which have two symbols on them , such as the number keys in the top row , will print the symbol on top , instead of the symbol on the bottom . for example , pressing the key with the number 1 on it will print the exclamation mark ( `` ! '' ) instead of the number 1. the caps lock key does not do this ; it only affects the letter keys .
