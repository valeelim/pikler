Iron(II) sulfate    iron ( ii ) sulfate iron ( ii ) sulfate , also known as ferrous sulfate or copperas , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is feso . it is made of iron and sulfate ions . the iron is in its +2 oxidation state . it is a blue-green crystalline solid when hydrated and white when anhydrous . it is a reducing agent . it reacts with oxygen in the air to produce a brown coating of iron ( iii ) sulfate and iron ( iii ) oxide . this coating is very corrosive . it dissolves in water to make a blue-green solution . when it is heated strongly , it breaks down into sulfur dioxide , sulfur trioxide , and iron ( iii ) oxide . it reacts with nitric acid to make nitric oxide . it also reacts with chlorine to make iron ( iii ) sulfate and iron ( iii ) chloride . iron ( ii ) sulfate is found as a mineral . the greenish heptahydrate is the most common . it is made when sulfide minerals like pyrite are oxidized to sulfate . it is made by reacting iron with sulfuric acid . this reaction makes hydrogen gas and leaves behind iron ( ii ) sulfate . it can also be made by oxidation of pyrite , an iron sulfide material .
