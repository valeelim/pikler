National Fascist Party     national fascist party was the ruling party of the kingdom of italy from 1922–1943 . benito mussolini founded the party in 1919 and served as it 's chairman ( italian : '' presidente del partito nazionale fascista '' ) from 1919–1943 . the party came to power after mussolini led thousands of blackshirts in a march on rome and forced king victor emmanuel iii to appoint him prime minister . as prime minister ( the `` real '' head of government ) , mussolini banned all other political parties and established a one-party police state , which lasted until mussolini was thrown out of power by his own citizens- and ordered to be arrested- by the king in 1943. after mussolini 's arrest , the national fascist party was destroyed . however , mussolini was rescued from prison by german soldiers sent by adolf hitler in 1943 , and was made the head of state ( this time a member of the newly created republican fascist party ) of the italian social republic , a puppet state whose real laws were made by the nazis .
