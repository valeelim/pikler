Iron sulfide     iron sulfide is the chemical compound fes , a solid of metallic blackish color . it is made of iron and sulfide ions . it has iron in its +2 oxidation state . it is found in the ground as the mineral pyrite . it is shiny like a metal , but it does not conduct electricity . it can make sparks when it is powdered ( ground finely ) . it does not always contains sulfide ions ; sometimes it contains a mixture of sulfide and sulfur . when it is exposed to oxygen in air , it forms acids which pollute streams and rivers . it reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas . the term iron sulfide may refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur . by increasing order of stability : - iron ( ii ) sulfide , fes , the less stable amorphous form ; - greigite , a form of iron ( ii , iii ) sulfide ( fes ) , analog to magnetite , feo ; - pyrrhotite , fes ( where x = 0 to 0.2 ) , or fes ; - troilite , fes , the endmember of pyrrhotite ; - mackinawite , fes ( where x = 0 to 0.1 ) ; - marcasite , or iron ( ii ) disulfide , fes ( orthorhombic ) ;
