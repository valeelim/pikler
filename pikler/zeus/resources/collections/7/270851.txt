Y10K     the y10k , literally meaning the `` year 10,000 problem '' , is an error machines and computers will encounter when the need to express five digits for a year . some people practice the art of cutting the last two digits of a decade . for example , the `` 1970 's '' becomes just the `` 70 's '' . however , this becomes a problem , because to keep order , one will now need to take the last three digits , rather than two . this is also a problem because the `` 000 's '' might be confused with the legit `` 00 's '' , representing a new century . also , the year can overflow with certain computer programs . on microsoft excel , for instance , in a cell the date 12/31/9999 is a legit date , but 1/1/10,000 causes a problem . the date `` ten thousand '' is unable to be supported , producing a large negative instead . so far , the long now foundation is able to preempt the y10k by adding a `` 0 '' in front of the date . so the year 2000 , would look like this : `` 02000 '' . however , it would still be subsceptible to a `` y100k '' problem . other sites and pages .
