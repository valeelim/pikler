Ocean thermal energy conversion     ocean thermal energy conversion ( otec ) is a way of getting useful energy from the world 's oceans . the sun shines on the oceans of the world and in the hot parts near the equator the water at the sea 's surface can be quite warm , sometimes as high as 30°c . many oceans are very deep and the water at depths of 1,000 meters can be around 5 °c . if a pipe is put down into the ocean we can bring the cold water to the surface where we also have warm water available . the difference in temperature between the warm surface water and the cold deep water may only be around 15 °c . but we can build a machine called a heat engine , which can use this difference to generate power that can be used by people that live in that place . a machine which can do this is called an otec machine which stands for `` ocean thermal energy conversion '' . because the difference in temperature is small we will need to get large quantities of warm and cold water to go through the machine to get a useful amount of work , but large quantities are available in the ocean .
