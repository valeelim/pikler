Nova     a nova ( plural `` novae '' or `` novas '' ) is a huge nuclear explosion on a white dwarf star . it causes a sudden brightening of the star . novae are not to be confused with other brightening phenomena such as supernovae . novae occur on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary system . if the two stars of the system are close enough , material is pulled from the companion star 's surface onto the white dwarf . this collection of hydrogen onto the surface of the star starts a runaway fusion reaction . in spite of their violence , the amount of material ejected in novae is usually only about 1⁄10,000 of a solar mass , quite small relative to the mass of the white dwarf . only five percent of the accreted mass is fused during the power outburst . this is enough energy to accelerate nova ejecta to velocities as high as several thousand kilometers per second—higher for some novae than others—with a concurrent rise in luminosity from a few times solar to 50,000–100,000 times solar . in 2010 scientists using nasa 's fermi gamma-ray space telescope were surprised to discover , for the first time , that a nova can also emit gamma-rays ( > 100 mev ) .
