Slime mould     slime moulds , or slime molds , are forms of life which live on the rainforest floor , and many other parts of the world . they slither over ground and fallen tree trunks in search of food . they scatter spores , like plants , which grow into new slime moulds . they are a way of life , or life-form , which has evolved a number of times . because they are not a monophyletic group , they are put into several different phyla . they have some features of fungi and some features of protozoa . this was discussed by anton de bary in 1858. they spend part of their lives as isolated cells , but come together when a chemical signal is released . then together , they form a multicellular organism which reproduces and makes spores . so they are both single-celled and multicellular . that is not all : the multicellular form loses its cell walls , and becomes a syncytium . this is an organism with many nuclei , but few or no cell walls . the single cells are amoeboid ( amoeba-like ) and haploid ( one set of chromosomes , like our gametes ) . the multi-nuclear stage is called a `` plasmodium '' . it is diploid , formed from fusions between pairs of amoeboid cells . it gains nutrition by phagocytosing bacteria and food particles .
