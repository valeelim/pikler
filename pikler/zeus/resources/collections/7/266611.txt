ISO 4217     iso 4217 is the international standard describing three-letter codes ( also known as the currency code ) to define the names of currencies , as established by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) . the iso 4217 code list is the common way in banking and business , all over the world , for defining different currencies . in many countries , the codes for the more common currencies are so well-known , by the general public , that exchange rates written in newspapers or posted in banks use only those codes to define the different currencies , instead of translated currency names or currency symbols . iso 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any uncertainty about the price . the first two letters of the code are the two letters of iso 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes ( which are also used as the basis for national top-level domains on the internet ) . the third letter is usually the initial of the currency itself . so japan 's currency code is jpy , `` jp '' for japan and `` y '' for yen . this eliminates the problem caused by the names `` dollar , franc '' and `` pound '' being used in dozens of different countries , each having significantly differing values . also , if a currency is revalued , the currency code 's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency . in some cases , the third letter is the initial for `` new '' in that country 's language , to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued ; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term `` new '' itself ( for example , the code for the mexican peso is mxn ) . other changes can be seen , however ; the russian ruble , for example , changed from rur to rub , where the b comes from the third letter in the word `` ruble '' .
