Cadmium sulfide     cadmium sulfide is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cds . it has cadmium and sulfide ions in it . cadmium sulfide is a yellow orange solid . it does not dissolve in water . it reacts with hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide and cadmium chloride . it is used in an odd reaction where cadmium sulfide is sprinkled into a sulfide solution and light is shined on it . it starts making small amounts of hydrogen gas . cadmium sulfide is only found in two rare minerals . it is normally made artificially . cadmium sulfide is made several different ways . cadmium salts , normally the sulfate or the chloride ( cadmium chloride ) , are reacted with hydrogen sulfide to make a bright yellow cadmium sulfide solid . when it is made for pigment , the cadmium sulfide is then washed , heated ( to change it into the right form ) , and ground to a powder . it is then mixed with paint . cadmium sulfide is used as a yellow pigment . cadmium yellow is the name of the pigment . if selenide is added during the roasting process ( seen above in `` preparation '' section ) , it can make an orange or a yellow pigment . cadmium sulfide is a good pigment because it does not break down easily , is very bright , and does not react with air like other pigments can . it is toxic , though .
