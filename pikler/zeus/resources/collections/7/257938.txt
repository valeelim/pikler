Oxidizing agent     oxidizing agent can have two meanings . it can be a chemical that releases oxygen atoms . for example , potassium chlorate has a chemical formula of kclo . when it oxidizes a reducing agent , such as powdered aluminum metal , it loses its oxygen to the aluminum and becomes potassium chloride , kcl . another definition is a chemical that accepts electrons from a reducing agent . for example , potassium permanganate has an oxidation state of +7 . in acid solution , it gains 5 electrons ( e ) , becoming a manganese compound with an oxidation state of +2 . most oxidizing agents of the second ( electron-accepting ) definition have oxygen , but not all . for example , fluorine ( f ) , the most powerful oxidizing agent , does not have any oxygen in it . when it acts as an oxidizing agent , it gains an electron to transfer from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of -1. examples . - fluorine - chlorine - potassium nitrate - nitric acid - potassium chlorate related pages . - oxidation - reduction
