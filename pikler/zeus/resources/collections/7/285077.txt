Bush airplane     a bush airplane is an aircraft serving far away areas of a country , usually the african bush , alaskan and canadian tundra or the australian outback . they are used where the road system is not good , or where there are no roads . many planes used as bush planes are made by cessna , or other makers of small and medium-sized airplanes common traits . - high wings make it easier for the pilot to see . there is also more space between the wing and plants and rocks on the ground . - bush airplanes usually have two large main wheels in the front and one small wheel in the back . this makes the plane tilt up in the front when it is on the ground , which makes it easier and safer to take off on a short or bumpy runway . - special modifications to the avionics also help the plane take off on short runways - extra large tires help the plane to land and take off in bumpy places . sometimes a bush pilot will land ( and take off ) where no airplane has been before . - some bush planes have floats for landing on water or skis for landing on snow .
