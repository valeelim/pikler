Jewish territorialism     territorialism , also known as statism ( but not to be confused with another belief also called statism ) , was a jewish political movement . jewish people wanted some land to live in that was big enough for them . it did not necessarily have to be in the land where the country of israel is today , and it did not necessarily have to be its own country . before 1905 , some zionist leaders were thinking about making places for jews to call home other than palestine . theodor herzl 's `` der judenstaat '' argued for a jewish state in either palestine , `` our ever-memorable historic home '' , or argentina , `` one of the most fertile countries in the world '' . ( `` fertile '' means land where it is easy to grow crops . ) many of the socialist zionist groups were more territorialist than zionist , such as nachman syrkin 's zionist socialist workers party ( the z.s. ) . the jewish colonization association , started in 1891 by the baron maurice de hirsch , was started to help move many jews from russia and other eastern european countries . it wanted to move them to land where they could grow food and that it would buy . it had in mind land in north and south america ( especially argentina ) .
