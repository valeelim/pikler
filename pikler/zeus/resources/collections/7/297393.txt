Thylacosmilus     thylacosmilus is a extinct genus of carnivorous sparassodont . found as fossils in deposits dated from about 10 million to 3 million years ago ( late miocene to late pliocene epoch ) in argentina , south america . `` thylacosmilus '' was sabre-toothed and was about as large as a modern jaguar . to a remarkable degree , `` thylacosmilus '' paralleled the evolution of felid sabre-toothed cats like `` smilodon '' . its canine teeth were long and powerfully developed ; they were used for stabbing prey . its killing method was to hold its prey , and make deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles . the canine teeth were protected by a well-developed flange , or projecting edge , in the chin region of the lower jaw . the canines continued to grow during adult life , which they do not in marsupials or placental mammals . `` thylacosmilus '' died out during the late pliocene , whereas saber-toothed cats did not get to south america until the middle pleistocene epoch . as a result , the last appearance of `` thylacosmilus '' is separated from the first appearance of `` smilodon '' by over one and a half million years .
