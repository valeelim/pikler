Central Mount Stuart     central mount stuart is a mountain in the south of the northern territory , australia . it can easily seen from the nearby stuart highway , which is about 6 km away . the mountain is made from dark red sandstone . the mountain is named after the explorer john mcdouall stuart who reached the area on 22 april 1860. he worked out that a point about 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) south-southwest of the mountain was the centre of australia . modern geographers do not agree with this and now place the centre at finke . stuart climbed to the top on 23 april 1860 , writing in his journal : `` '' took kekwick and the flag , and went to the top of the mount , but found it to be much higher and more difficult of ascent than i anticipated ... near the top of the cone i placed a small bottle , in which there is a slip of paper , with our signatures to it , stating by whom it was raised . we then gave three hearty cheers for the flag , the emblem of civil and religious liberty , and may it be a sign to the natives that the dawn of liberty , civilization , and christianity is about to break upon them .
