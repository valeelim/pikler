X-ray crystallography     x-ray crystallography is a way to see the three-dimensional structure of a molecule . the electron cloud of an atom bends the x-rays slightly . this makes a `` picture '' of the molecule that can be seen on a screen . it can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules . the sample is not destroyed in the process . the technique was jointly invented by sir william bragg ( 1862–1942 ) and his son sir lawrence bragg ( 1890–1971 ) . they won the nobel prize in physics for 1915. lawrence bragg is the youngest to be made a nobel laureate . he was the director of the cavendish laboratory , cambridge university , when the discovery of the structure of dna was made by james d. watson and francis crick in february 1953. the oldest method of x-ray crystallography is x-ray diffraction ( xrd ) . x-rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern . these patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal . crystals are regular arrays of atoms , meaning that the atoms are repeat over and over in all three dimensions . x-rays are waves of electromagnetic radiation . when x-rays meet atoms , the electrons in the atoms cause the x-rays to scatter in all directions . because the x-rays are emitted in all directions , an x-ray striking an electron produces secondary spherical waves emanating from the electron . the electron is known as the `` scatterer '' . a regular array of scatterers ( here the repeating pattern of atoms in the crystal ) produces a regular array of spherical waves . although these waves cancel one another out in most directions , they add up in a few specific directions , determined by bragg 's law :
