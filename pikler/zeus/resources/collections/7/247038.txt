Greatest common divisor     the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) or highest common factor ( hcf ) of two integers is the greatest ( largest ) number that divides both of the integers evenly . euclid came up with the idea of gcds . the gcd of any two positive integers can be defined as a recursive function : formula_1 the gcd of 20 and 12 is 4 , since 4 times 5 equals 20 and 4 times 3 equals 12. you can notice 3 and 5 have no common factor , hence their gcd is 1. the gcd of 81 and 21 is 3 .
