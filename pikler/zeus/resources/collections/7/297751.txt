Flame ionization detector     flame ionization detectors ( shortened fid ) is a common type detector used in gas chromatography . these detectors are best at detecting organic compounds . the first flame ionization detector was developed in 1957 in australia . the purpose of a fid is to detect compounds as they exit out of the gas chromatography column . the compounds that are exiting the column are in the gas phase . detection is done by first turning the gas compounds into ions and electrons and then collecting the charged molecules . the fid turns compounds into ions and electrons by putting them into a flame . the fuel used to make the flame in fids is usually made of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen . as these charged materials are collected , they make a current which is measured . the larger the current the more charged compounds are being collected . currents for fids are usually about 10 amps and are measured by a high-impedance picoammeter . flame ionization detectors are used most often for organic compounds . this is because organic compounds contain lot of carbon atoms which easily turn into ions . reduced carbons ( carbons with no oxygen bonds ) make the most ions . other carbons such as alcohols ( c-o-h ) and carbonyls ( c=o ) do not make as many ions .
