Elephant gun     an elephant gun is a large caliber gun , which could be ( but does not have to be ) a rifle . elephant guns were first made to be used by big-game hunters who were hunting elephants and other large animals . as people from europe began exploring africa in the early 1800s , guns were made to handle the very large animals that people saw . this was for people to protect themselves , to shoot animals for food , and later , and most commonly , sport . the first guns were the simple shotgun designs already used for birds . they were loaded with solid balls of lead that could shoot large animals . because they did not kill large animals very easily ( some writers said that it could take up to 35 shots to kill one elephant ) , elephant guns were soon made into larger caliber black powder smoothbores . the caliber was still measured in bore or gauge - or the guns were named by how much the projectiles ( what was shot out of the guns ) weighed in ounces . the projectiles were lead round balls or short slugs shaped like cones . sometimes , antimony was put in them to make them harder .
