Arsine     arsine , also known as arsenic hydride or hydrogen arsenide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is ash . it has hydrogen and arsenide ions in it . the hydrogen is in its +1 oxidation state . arsine is a colorless gas . it is a reducing agent . it has a weak garlic odor . it easily burns to make arsenic trioxide in excess air or arsenic in small amounts of air . it breaks down to arsenic and hydrogen when heated . it can dissolve in water . it is heavier than air . arsine reacts violently with oxidizing agents , such as the halogens . arsine is made by reacting any arsenic ( iii ) compound with any hydride . it can also be made by reacting any arsenide with an acid . it was first made by reacting zinc , hydrochloric acid , and arsenic trioxide . arsine is used to make semiconductors like gallium arsenide . it was looked at as a chemical weapon . it is almost odorless ( it kills before one smells it ) , heavy ( spreads along the ground ) , and colorless . it was unstable though , easily igniting . arsine is extremely toxic . 0.00005 % ( 0.5 ppm ) can poison people ; 0.025 % ( 250 ppm ) quickly kills people .
