Hyssop     hyssop ( `` hyssopus '' ) is a genus of about 10-12 species of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family lamiaceae , native from the east mediterranean to central asia . they are aromatic , with upright branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips . the leaves are narrow ovals , 2â€“5 cm long . the small blue flowers are on the upper part of the branches during summer . by far the best-known species is the herb hyssop ( `` h. officinalis '' ) , widely grown outside its native area in the mediterranean . note that anise hyssop , `` agastache foeniculum '' ( also called blue giant hyssop ) is a very different plant and not a close relation although both are in the mint family . anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern north america . the name 'hyssop ' can be traced back almost unchanged through the greek word ( `` hyssopos '' ) and hebrew word ( `` ezov '' ) . the book of exodus in the bible records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of passover . its vomit-inducing properties are also mentioned in the book of psalms . in the new testament , a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to jesus of nazareth on the cross just before he died . both matthew and mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term ( `` kalamos '' ) , which is translated as `` reed '' or `` stick .
