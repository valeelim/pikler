Loricifera     loricifera is a recently discovered ecdysozoan phylum of marine animals . the phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely anoxic environment ( no oxygen at all ) . the phylum was described in 1983 by reinhardt kristensen . they are a phylum of very small animals which live in sediment . there are now twenty-two described species , in eight genera . in addition , there are about 100 more species which have been collected , but not yet described . their size ranges from 100 Âµm to about 1 mm . their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves . they are among the most recently discovered groups of metazoans . they attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel , and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long . the first specimen was collected in the 1970s , and later described in 1983. they are found at all depths of water , in different sediment types , and in all latitudes . they have not yet been found in the fossil record . these animals have a protective outer case called a lorica . protected by the lorica , the animals have a head , mouth and digestive system . development is usually direct , though there are larvae in some species . the animals have two sexes as adults . there are some complex and flexible life cycles with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction .
