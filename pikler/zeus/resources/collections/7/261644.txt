Tornado drill     a tornado drill is something people do to practice what they would do if there were a tornado . it is usually done in a building such as a school or office . it starts with a signal such as an alarm or a spoken message over an intercom . after they hear the signal , people in the building go to a certain part of the building . this is usually a room deep inside the building ( probably near the middle ) , or a hallway with no windows . they then get into a safe position . this might include kneeling on the ground with their hands over their heads . in some places , schools have to have tornado drills , but usually not as often as fire drills . tornado drills happen more in places where there are more tornadoes , such as in the midwestern united states . in the united states , most states in the midwest and south have a statewide tornado drill in late winter or early spring to get ready for the severe weather season . during these drills , the national weather service gives out test tornado warnings , and local emergency alert systems and/or noaa weather radio ( normally as a weekly or monthly test ) are sounded , along with outdoor warning sirens . schools and businesses may also have a tornado drill .
