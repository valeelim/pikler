Epoch (geology)    epoch ( geology ) an epoch in geology is a part of a period . thus the cainozoic era is now divided into three periods , the palaeogene , the neogene and the quaternary . these are finally broken down into these epochs : palaeocene , eocene , oligocene , miocene , pliocene , pleistocene and holocene . the tertiary , now not used ( 'deprecated ' ) , included the palaeogene and neogene . that is why the last period is called the quarternary , and there was a big debate about that , too . these decisions are made by the international union of geological sciences ( iugs ) . this organisation runs an international commission on stratigraphy , which decides how we should name geological strata and stages . they describe their work as follows : - mesozoic - triassic - lower triassic - middle triassic - upper triassic - jurassic - lower jurassic - middle jurassic - upper jurassic - cretaceous - lower cretaceous - upper cretaceous - cainozoic - palaeogene - palaeocene - eocene - oligocene - neogene - miocene - pliocene
