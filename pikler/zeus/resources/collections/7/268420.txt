French ban on face covering     on 14 september 2010 , the senate of france ( ) passed a law that forbids the wearing of clothing that covers the face of a person in public , so that the person can not be identified . the law talks about clothing that covers the face , so it includes burqas and niqabs , but does not include the chador . the main arguments for the ban are that people wearing such types of clothing can not be identified by police forces , and that such velis are not compatible with the values of france as a state . in addition , there was a discussion about women 's rights . president nicolas sarkozy said that a reason for the ban is to protect women from being forced to cover their faces . the bill which was introduced was refused by many people around the world . some women in france protested against it too . but there were many supporters of the bill .
