Middlesex     middlesex is one of the historic counties of england and the second smallest by area . the county once contained the rich and politically independent city of london on its southern boundary . the county was affected by the expansion of london in the 18th and 19th centuries . from 1855 the south east was administered as part of london . when county councils were initially introduced in england in 1889 around 20 % of the area of middlesex , and a third of its population , was transferred to the county of london . in the interwar years urban london further expanded , with the expansion of public transport , and the setting up of new industries outside inner london . after a royal commission on local government in greater london , middlesex was absorbed by an enlarged greater london in 1965. despite its disappearance as an administrative county , middlesex is still used as an area name . it was kept as a postal county ; it is an optional component of postal addresses . it is still regarded by many as a meaningful area , with its own teams in county cricket , rugby and other sports and pastimes .
