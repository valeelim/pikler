Diffraction     diffraction is a physics concept . diffraction occurs when waves bend around small obstacles , or when waves spread out after they pass through small openings . diffraction occurs with all waves , including sound waves , water waves , and electromagnetic waves such as light that the eye can see . diffraction also occurs with matter such as electrons . diffraction is caused by one wave of light being shifted by a diffracting object . this shift will cause the wave to have interference with itself . interference can be either constructive or destructive . when interference is constructive , the intensity of the wave will increase . when interference is destructive , the intensity will decrease , sometimes to a point where it is completely destroyed . these patterns of interference rely on the size of the diffracting object and the size of the wave . the strongest examples of diffraction occur in waves where the wavelength is close to the size of the object causing diffraction . diffraction can be used to separate different wavelengths of light using a diffraction grating . a diffraction grating can be a series of closely-spaced slits or a mirror with a series of small grooves . diffraction gratings work because different wavelengths of light will constructively interfere at different angles . diffraction gratings are used in many analytical chemistry tools , such as a spectrometer .
