Self-synchronizing code     in telecommunications , a self-synchronizing code , or comma-free code , is a line code that can be easily synchronized . such line codes have the property that the code which is made of a part of the code word , or two overlapping code words is not a valid code . an example , take the code words `` 11 '' and `` 00 '' , and the code `` 11 00 00 11 00 '' . the spaces have been added to show the different words , and are not really in the code . let 's now assume that four letters ( two code words ) are read . the code `` 1000 '' is not a valid code , because `` 10 '' is not one of the two code words defined . similarly , `` 0001 '' . even though `` 00 '' is a valid word , `` 01 '' is not . the only valid way to read two valid words from the example given is by starting at the very beginning , or just after one of the spaces , which have been inserted for clarity only .
