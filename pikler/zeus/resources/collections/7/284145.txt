Model organism     a model organism is a non-human species that is studied over many years , building up a lot of knowledge about it . the purpose is to understand fundamental biological phenomena . the hope is that discoveries made in the model will give insight into how other organisms work . in particular , model organisms are widely used to explore potential causes and treatments for human disease when experimenting on humans would be impossible or less ethical . this strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms , and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genes over the course of evolution . `` drosophila melanogaster '' was one of the first animals used for genetics . today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best-known of all eukaryotic organisms . all organisms use common genetic systems ; understanding transcription and replication in fruit flies helps to understand these processes in other eukaryotes , including humans . studies of x-linked traits confirmed that genes are found on chromosomes . studies of linked traits led to the first maps of genetic loci on chromosomes . the first maps of `` drosophila '' chromosomes were done by alfred sturtevant .
