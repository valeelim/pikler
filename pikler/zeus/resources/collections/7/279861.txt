Deinosuchus     deinosuchus is an extinct relative of the alligator which lived 80 to 73 million years ago , in the upper cretaceous period . the first remains were discovered in north carolina in the 1850s , but it was not until 1909 that the genus was named and described . additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later made into an influential , but inaccurate , skull reconstruction at the american museum of natural history . knowledge of `` deinosuchus '' is still incomplete , but better skull material has been found in recent years . `` deinosuchus '' was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator : it was up to and weighed up to . however , its overall appearance was fairly similar to its modern relatives . it had large , robust teeth that were adapted to crushing , and its back was covered with thick round bony plates . one study suggests that `` deinosuchus '' may have lived for up to 50 years , growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians , but growing for a much longer period .
