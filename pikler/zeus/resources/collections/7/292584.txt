Base on balls     a base on balls ( bb ) is given to a batter and against a pitcher in baseball statistics when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls `` balls '' . it is also known as a walk . another version of base on balls is called intentional base on balls ( ibb ) or intentional walk . this is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls . as with any other walk , an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without being able to be put out , and entitles any runners to advance if forced . intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver , usually done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play ( e.g. , a home run , sacrifice fly , or rbi base hit ) , or to set up a double play or force out situation for the next batter . they do carry an inherent risk , however , as they give the offensive team another runner on base , without any effort on their part , who could potentially score a run .
