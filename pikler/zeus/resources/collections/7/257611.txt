Kiddieland Amusement Park     kiddieland amusement park was an amusement park located just west of chicago at the corner of north avenue and first avenue in melrose park , illinois . it was home to several classic rides including the `` little dipper '' roller coaster , which opened in 1950. the park closed on september 27 , 2009 at 8 pm , and demolished in 2010 to make way for a new costco store . kiddieland started out as a small venture of arthur fritz in 1929 when he purchased six ponies and offered rides as an escape for parents reeling from the great depression . miniature gasoline-powered cars were added a few years later after fritz learned that they were being given away to children by a chicago newspaper as a subscription promotion . in 1940 , the `` german carousel '' , two miniature steam locomotives , the `` little auto ride '' , the `` roto whip '' and the `` ferris wheel '' were added . the latter two lasted until the park 's closing . the park saw its first major expansion in the 1950s with the addition of the little dipper and the carousel , of which both still exist today . bumper cars were added in the 1960s as they replaced the original pony ride .
