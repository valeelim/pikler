Diocese     a diocese is an area of land under the charge of a bishop . he looks after the religious needs of the christians who live there . the bishop organises the work of the church in the area , and is responsible for all the ministers ( priests ) in his area . another word for diocese is see , or even 'episcopal see ' . the diocese is the key geographical unit of religious authority in the church . archbishops have an archdiocese . inside each diocese are a number of parishes . each parish is the area supervised by a local priest , and is part of the diocese . as the western roman empire fell during the 5th and 6th centuries the bishops of the church took over many of the administrative roles of the former roman prefects . the areas of ecclesiastical administration always coincided with those of the roman civil administration . a thousand years later , the ottoman empire conquered the eastern roman , or byzantine empire . the eastern bishops then continued as the roman civil structure was stripped away . many an ancient diocese , though later divided among several dioceses , preserved the boundaries of a long-vanished roman administrative division .
