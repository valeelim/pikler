Storegga Slide     the three storegga slides are amongst the largest known landslides . they occurred under water , at the edge of norway 's continental shelf , in the norwegian sea , which is between norway and greenland , just north of great britain . this caused a very large tsunami in the north atlantic ocean . the collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf , with a total volume of 3,500 km of debris . this would be the equivalent volume to an area the size of iceland covered to a depth of 34 m ( 112 ft ) . based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunami , the latest incident occurred around 6100 bc . in scotland , traces of this tsunami have been recorded , with deposited sediment being discovered in the montrose basin ( estuary of the south esk river ) , and the firth of forth , up to 80 km inland and 4 metres above current normal tide levels . as part of the activities to prepare the ormen lange natural gas field , the incident has been thoroughly investigated . one conclusion is that the slide was caused by material built up during the previous ice age , and that a recurrence would only be possible after a new ice age . this conclusion is supported by numerous scientific studies . facts and arguments supporting this conclusion were made public in 2004 .
