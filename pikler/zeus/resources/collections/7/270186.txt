Spontaneous symmetry breaking     spontaneous symmetry breaking is a way symmetry breaks in a physical system . the underlying laws do not change , but the system as a whole changes . symmetry breaking in physics occurs when a system is crossing a critical point . small fluctuations decide the system 's fate , by determining which branch is taken . spontaneous symmetry breaking can create a particle called a higgs boson . this is a particle which is predicted to be able to give mass to certain particles called bosons , like a photon . also , many scientists believe in the higgs effect ( which is very similar to spontaneous symmetry breaking ) to answer questions that are not answered in the standard model of physics . the standard model predicts that certain types of quarks should have a mass of zero , while in reality they have a non-zero mass value . some scientists believe that spontaneous symmetry breaking is the answer . for spontaneous symmetry breaking to happen , you need an environment which is completely symmetrical , and has at least two outcomes that are equally likely . spontaneous symmetry breaking starts with two particles that are completely equal ; their spin is equal , too . mathematically , spontaneous symmetry breaking can be extremely puzzling , since you start out with two identical things and end up with two non-identical things . however , in practice , it is not so puzzling . if you have two particles moving at each other with equal speed , it would seem impossible for either of them to do anything but be symmetrical . however , if each particle has an equal 50-50 chance to be spinning one way or another , it is possible–in theory and in practice–to have this symmetry broken . it begins with symmetry to start with because the particles have an equal and symmetrical 50-50 chance of spinning one way or another .
