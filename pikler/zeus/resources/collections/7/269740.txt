MicroSD     microsd is a type of removable flash memory card used for storing information . sd is an abbreviation of secure digital , and microsd cards are sometimes referred to as µsd or usd . the cards are used in mobile phones and other mobile devices . it is the smallest memory card that can be bought ; at 15 mm × 11 mm × 1 mm ( about the size of a fingernail ) , it is about a quarter of the size of a normal-sized sd card . there are adapters that make the small microsd able to fit in devices that have slots for standard sd , minisd , memory stick duo card , and even usb . but , not all of the different cards can work together . many microsd cards are sold with a standard sd adapter , so that people can use them in devices that take standard sd but not microsd cards . transflash and microsd cards are the same ( they can be used in place of each other ) , but microsd has support for sdio mode . this lets microsd slots support non-memory jobs like bluetooth , gps , and near field communication by attaching a device in place of a memory card .
