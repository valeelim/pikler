Coriolis effect     the coriolis effect is a force that is found in a rotating object . gaspard gustave de coriolis first described the coriolis effect in 1835 using mathematics . the coriolis effect can best be seen in hurricanes . in the northern hemisphere , or part of the earth , they spin clockwise , in the southern hemisphere they spin the other way . this happens because the earth spins on its tilt . one example of the coriolis effect that is often described is that water flows down a drain in the opposite direction in the northern and southern hemispheres . however , in reality , the force of the coriolis effect is not strong enough to see in such a small amount of water .
