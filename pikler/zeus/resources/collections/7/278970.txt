Compound eye     compound eyes consist of many photoreceptor units or ommatidia . each 'ommatidium ' ( singular ) is an individual 'eye unit ' . the image perceived is a combination of inputs from ommatidia on a convex surface . thus they point in slightly different directions . compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a wide-angle view . they can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarization of light . eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms , and 96 % of animal species possess a complex optical system . image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs , chordates and arthropods . almost all insects and arachnids use both simple and compound eyes . compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image . compound eyes are common in arthropods , and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs . compound eyes , in arthropods at least , grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia .
