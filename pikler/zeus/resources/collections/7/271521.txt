Cro-Magnon     the cro-magnon were early modern humans ( early `` homo sapiens '' ) . they lived in europe during the upper palaeolithic period . some anthropologists use the term `` european early modern humans '' to describe the cro-magnons . the earliest known cro-magnon remains are between 35,000 and 45,000 years old , based on radiometric dating . the oldest remains , from 43,000 45,000 years ago , were found in italy and britain . other remains also show that cro-magnons reached the russian arctic about 40,000 years ago . cro-magnons had powerful bodies , which were usually heavy and solid with strong muscles . unlike neanderthals , which had slanted foreheads , the cro-magnons had straight foreheads , like modern humans . their faces were short and wide with a large chin . their brains were slightly larger than the average human 's is today . the name `` cro-magnon '' was created by louis lartet , who discovered the first cro-magnon skull in southwestern france in 1868. he called the place where he found the skull `` abri de cro-magnon . '' `` abri '' means `` rock shelter '' in french ; `` cro '' means `` hole '' in the occitan language ; and `` magnon '' was the name of the person who owned the land where lartet found the skull . basically , cro-magnon means `` rock shelter in a hole on magnon 's land .
