Braces     braces ( suspenders in the u.s. ) are a standard item of male clothing , now worn less often than before . their function is to keep trousers at a set height on the body . they are standard wear for formal styles of dress such as the lounge suit . there is also a fashion use among some young males , and a use by some workmen . braces can be worn entirely out of sight , hidden by a waistcoat , or in sight as a display . a critical factor in formal dress is the `` drop '' of the trousers as they meet the shoes . here braces avoid the need to hitch trousers up , always a problem with belts . in many countries braces were worn by all classes of men for well over a hundred years until about the 1960s , except in the armed forces . then fashion changed and men 's clothes became informal , with lower waistlines and belts . now they are a minority item .
