K1A1 tank     the k1a1 is a remodeled and upgraded version of k1 , the main battle tank of the south korean army . it looks similar to the k1 tank . the first test model , made by hyundai , was shown to the public on april 3 , 1996. it went through performance tests for two years from 1999 to 2001. production began on october 13 , 2001. it is planned to produce 484 of them by 2010. the k2 black panther is planned to replace it after that . the reason for the upgrade was to increase the fire power of the k1 . the main 105mm gun was replaced with the m256 120mm gun . the m256 122mm has 1.5 times the range and 1.7 times stronger fire power than the older gun . it also changed its armor , called korean special armor plate ( ksap ) , which greatly improved its side shield . the k1a1 weighs about 53.2 tons and can seat four people . besides the main gun , there are two kinds of machine guns , 12.7mm k6 and two 7.62mm m60s as secondary arms . guns and a turret are able to move independently of the main body . this improves its accuracy rate .
