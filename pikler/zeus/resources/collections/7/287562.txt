The Descent of Man     the descent of man , and selection in relation to sex is a book by charles darwin , first published in 1871. it was darwin 's second great book on evolutionary theory , the first being his 1859 work , `` on the origin of species '' . darwin had said almost nothing about human beings in the `` origin '' , except a single sentence : `` light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history '' . in `` the descent of man '' , darwin applies evolutionary theory to human evolution , and also explains his theory of sexual selection . he thought the two topics were closely connected . in the nearly 12 years between the `` origin '' and the `` descent of man '' , several writers had written works on the subject . noteworthy were : - `` man 's place in nature '' by thomas henry huxley . - `` the antiquity of man '' by charles lyell . both were published in 1863. the starting point for sexual selection is the observation that males differ from females , not just in sexual apparatus , but in many other traits . this is true of many animals , and the question is why this happens . the answer given by darwin , and followed by many other biologists , is that the selection on males is different from the selection on females .
