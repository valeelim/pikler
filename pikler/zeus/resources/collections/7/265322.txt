Toner     toner is a powder commonly used in photocopiers and laser printers to draw images and text onto paper . the early forms of toner were just carbon powder . in early machines , the user had to pour the toner into a reservoir on the machine itself . current machines feed from a sealed cartridge which is normally a proprietary design . although manufacturers try to make the process complicated , empty cartridges are sometimes refilled by third-party vendors . toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser , and bind to the paper . since toner is a fine dust , it can remain in the air for a long time , and is considered to have health effects similar to inert dust . it can be very painful to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis . many companies selling laser printers will also provide a way to return empty toner cartridges . these are commonly re-used , with new toner . today , many toners have chilps which tell the printer how much toner is left . these chips also need to be re-programmed , when the toner is re-filled .
