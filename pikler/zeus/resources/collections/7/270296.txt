Quantum fluctuation     a quantum fluctuation is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space , as explained in werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle . it applies only to quantum physics . that means that conservation of energy can seem to be violated , but only to allow the creation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs for exceedingly short period of time . like normal matter and antimatter , theoretical electrons and positrons annihilate each other . unlike normal matter , however , they do not create any energy when they annihilate each other , but instead create an imaginary photon . normal photons can interact with matter , but theoretical photons do not . abhyudaya apoorva - the theory of nothing
