Sexual conflict     sexual conflict is a term in evolutionary biology . it occurs in a species when what benefits the females is different from what benefits the males . the word 'benefit ' here means 'what benefits the reproduction of the female 's ( or male 's ) genes . it is expressed as a `` difference in biological fitness '' . the conflict can lead to an evolutionary arms race between males and females . it has primarily been studied in animals , though it can in principle apply to any sexually reproducing organism , such as plants and fungi . in sexual reproduction there is , from the point of view of evolution , a fundamental difference of interest between males and females . this difference of interest plays out differently in different species . - males their interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females , thus spreading their genes widely in the population . - females their interest is to mate with a large number of fit males , thus producing a large number of fit and varied offspring .
