RB Leipzig     rb leipzig ( rasenballsport leipzig e.v . ) is a german footballclub from leipzig . the club was founded on 19 may 2009 by the red bull company . it was formed out of the ssv markranstädt . due to the regulations of the dfb the name red bull leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called rb ( short for rasenballsport ) . also the logo was forbidden . the company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club , because with the zentralstadion ( now red bull arena ) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area . the club 's long term aim is to reach the bundesliga . like in salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business . so they wanted a `` normal '' football club . they started in the oberliga nordost-süd ( 5th level ) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season . but the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. bundesliga . so the coach was changed , the new one is the austrian peter pacult . the first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the german cup ( 1st round ) versus vfl wolfsburg from the bundesliga .
