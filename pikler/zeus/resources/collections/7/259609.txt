Phoronida     the phoronida , or horseshoe worms , are a small phylum of marine animals . there are twenty species , in two genera . they are part of the brachiozoa , which also includes the brachiopods . phoronids are worm-shaped , but with a gut that loops and exits the body near the mouth . that explains the name 'horseshoe worms ' . they are found in all oceans and seas ( except the polar seas ) , and all species have wide geographical ranges . they occur at depths up to 400 metres , but mainly between 0 to 70 metres . the life span is thought to be about a year . the adults are tube worms , and secrete chitinous tubes in which they live . these tubes can be buried in the mud or sand or rest on the surface of a rocky substrate . if on rocks , they may live in colonies with their tubes become twisted around each other for support . some species can dissolve away holes in rocks such as limestone , calcareous seashells or even cement piers ; they then live in these holes which they line with their secreted tubes .
