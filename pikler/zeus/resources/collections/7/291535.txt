Sydney Brenner     sydney brenner ch frs ( born 13 january 1927 ) is a south african biologist and a 2002 nobel prize in physiology or medicine laureate , shared with robert horvitz and john sulston . he is of jewish descent . brenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code , and other areas of molecular biology . he established the roundworm `` caenorhabditis elegans '' as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology , and founded the molecular sciences institute in berkeley , california . brenner made several important contributions to molecular biology in the 1960s . with francis crick and others , he worked out the genetic code , where triplets of nucleic acid bases are translated into amino acids . brenner then focused on establishing `` caenorhabditis elegans '' as a model organism for the investigation of animal development including development of the nervous system . brenner chose this 1 millimeter-long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple , is easy to grow in bulk populations , and turned out to be convenient for genetic analysis . for this work , he shared the 2002 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with robert horvitz and john sulston . his nobel lecture in december 2002 , `` nature 's gift to science '' is a homage to this modest nematode . he considers chosing the right organism is as important as picking the right problems to work on . in recognition of his pioneering work on `` c. elegans '' , another closely related nematode was given the scientific name `` caenorhabditis brenneri '' .
