Ted Nelson     theodor holm nelson ( ted nelson , born 1937 ) is an american sociologist , philosopher , and pioneer of information technology . he coined the terms `` hypertext '' and `` hypermedia '' in 1963 and published it in 1965. he also is credited with first use of the words `` transclusion '' , `` virtuality '' , `` intertwingularity '' and `` teledildonics '' . the main thrust of his work has been to make computers easily accessible to ordinary people . his motto is : `` a user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds . '' however , he is known for inventing many new words ( neologisms ) which few other people understand ( such as `` intertwingularity '' ) , and his remarks contain humor to entertain rather than just inform . consequently , some of his ideas have been met with negative reactions . from a pessimist viewpoint , ted nelson promotes four maxims : `` most people are fools , most authority is malignant , god does not exist , and everything is wrong '' . nelson started project xanadu in 1960. he wanted to create a new computer network that was easy to use and easy to understand . he wrote about the project in his books `` computer lib/dream machines '' ( 1974 ) and `` literary machines '' ( 1981 ) . he has spent much of his adult life working on project xanadu and telling people about its benefits .
