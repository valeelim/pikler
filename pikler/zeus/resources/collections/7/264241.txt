Typesetting     typesetting is the making of block-printed writing which is formed by using types grouped from sorts . typesetting uses the earlier steps of designing a font and storing it in some manner . typesetting is the taking of the stored letters ( called `` sorts '' in mechanical systems and `` glyphs '' in digital systems ) and the ordering of them in the manner of a language 's orthography for showing them on a page . during the letterpress era , moveable type was composed by hand for each page . cast metal `` sorts '' were grouped into words and lines of text and tightly bound together to make up a page image called a `` forme '' . all letter faces were set to the same height , to form an even surface of type . the forme was mounted in a machine press , inked , and an impression made on paper . the diagram at right shows a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot . wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type . copies of formes were cast when expecting later printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work . in this process , called stereotyping , the entire forme is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of paris or papier mâché called flong to create a positive , from which the stereotype forme was cast of type metal .
