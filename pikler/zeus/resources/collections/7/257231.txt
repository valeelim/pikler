Endeavour River     the endeavour river on cape york peninsula in north queensland , australia , was named in 1770 by the english explorer , captain james cook . he had been forced to put his ship , hm bark endeavour , onto the beach at the river mouth so that it could be repaired . the ship had been damaged by coral on the great barrier reef . the aboriginal australians , the guugu yimithirr people , called the river `` wabalumbaal '' . cook and his crew stayed for seven weeks and met with the guugu yimithirr . the word `` kangaroo '' was a guugu yimithirr word for the animal which cook wrote down in his diary . the naturalists joseph banks and daniel solander made big collections of native plants and flowers , while sydney parkinson made pictures of the flora and fauna of the region . the endeavour river is very wide at its mouth where it meets the sea . upstream it quickly branches into many small creeks . there are 25 species of mangrove grwoing along the river . saltwater crocodiles live in the river , and can often be seen on the banks during the winter in june and july . in october 2008 , a man fishing for crabs on the river bank was taken by a crocodile . at first people thought it was a big crocodile , more than six metres in length . but his remains were later found inside a 4.5 metre crocodile . the river is also a good place to go fishing for barramundi .
