Hollow-cathode lamp     a hollow-cathode lamp ( hcl ) is a light source or radiation source which is used to excite electrons of a metal of interest to a higher energy level . excitation is when an electron in its lowest energy state , also known as the ground state , undergoes a transition to a higher energy state known as an excited state . these transitions can occur through heat , electrical energy , light , particles , or a chemical reaction . a hcl consists of an anode and a cathode inside of a glass tube . the glass tube is filled with some type of inert gas such as argon or neon with a pressure of around 5 torr ( 666 pascal ) . it is important that the gas is inert in order to minimize interferences in the output of the data . the anode is an electrode in which oxidation takes place . oxidation is the loss of electrons . the cathode is an electrode in which reduction takes place . reduction is the gain of electrons . the anode is typically constructed of some type of metal such as tungsten and is coated with a material that helps to prevent contamination from the sputtering process described below . the cathode is constructed of the pure metal of interest or a mixture of metals containing the metal of interest . this mixture of metals is referred to as an alloy . it is important that the cathode be stored under a vacuum to avoid any kind of contamination . contamination of the cathode compromises the purity of the metal of interest and the data obtained for that metal . the material of the window is specifically selected in order to get the best transmission of spectral lines for the cathode element .
