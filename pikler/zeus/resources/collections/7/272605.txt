Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji     the started on december 16 , 1707 ( 23rd day of the 11th month of the year hōei 4 ) and ended about january 1 , 1708 ( 9th day of the 12th month of the year hōei 4 ) during the edo period . there was no lava flow , but the hoei eruption released at least 800 million cubic meters of volcanic ash . this ash spread over very large areas around the volcano . it even reached edo almost 100 km away . cinders and ash fell like rain in izu , kai , sagami , and musashi provinces . the eruption was on mount fuji 's east–north-east slope and made three new volcanic openings called no . 1 , no . 2 , and no . 3 hōei vents . the danger of the eruption increased over the next several days . after the first earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash , another stronger explosion happened a few days later . this explosion threw out rocks and stones . mount fuji has not erupted since ; but scientists describe fuji as an active volcano . hokusai 's `` one hundred views of mount fuji '' includes an image of the small crater which developed from a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope . this was called hōeizan ( mount hōei ) because the eruption happened in year hōei 4 .
