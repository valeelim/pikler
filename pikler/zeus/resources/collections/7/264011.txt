Ohm     there are some materials which offer some resistance to the current flow , they are called resistive materials , for example graphite , iron , and certain synthetic materials . the magnitude that represents this characteristic is the resistance , and it is measured in ohms . an ohm ( referred to by the greek letter Ï‰ ( omega ) ) is the si unit of resistance ( r ) . it can be defined by ohm 's law and the equation : where formula_2 is resistance in ohms , formula_3 is voltage in volts , and formula_4 the current in amperes . the ohm was named after georg ohm . further reading . - resistors basics : everybody is able to understand electronics
