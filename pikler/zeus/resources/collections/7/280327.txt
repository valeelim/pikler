Chainsaw     a chainsaw ( or chain saw ) is a portable mechanical saw , typically powered by a two-stroke engine . it is used for cutting trees , to fell snags , to cut firebreaks in wildland fires , and to harvest firewood . special chainsaws are used for cutting concrete . a chainsaw has several parts , including : - engine — usually a two-stroke gasoline ( petrol ) internal combustion engine , usually with a cylinder volume of 30-120 cm3 or electric motor . - drive mechanism — typically a clutch and sprocket . - guide bar — a long bar with a round end of wear-resistant alloy steel usually 16 to 36 inches in length . an edge slot guides the cutting chain . - cutting chain — usually each segment in this chain ( which is constructed from riveted metal sections similar to a bicycle chain , but without rollers ) features small sharp blades called teeth . the bottom of each link features a small metal finger called a `` drive link '' which locates the chain on the bar , helps to carry lubrication oil around the bar , and engages with the engine 's drive sprocket inside the body of the saw .
