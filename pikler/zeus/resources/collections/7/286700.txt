Archaeothyris     archaeothyris was the earliest definite synapsid . it lived in the late carboniferous period , 306 million years ago . it was found in nova scotia , at the same locality as `` hylonomus '' , and `` petrolacosaurus '' , which are similar to `` archaeothyris '' , but probably sauropsids . `` protoclepsydrops '' is slightly older , but its status as a synapsid is unclear as the remains are more fragmentary . `` archaeothyris '' belonged to a group of early pelycosaurs that evolved early in the pennsylvanian . it is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids ( which include mammals ) . unlike the early sauropsids , `` hylonomus '' and its kin , `` archaeothyris '' was relatively large , measuring head to tail . it was also more advanced than the early sauropsids ( ~reptiles ) , with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids . its sharp teeth were all of the same shape , and it had a pair of enlarged canines , suggesting that it was a carnivore . `` archaeothyris '' lived in what is now nova scotia , about 306 million years ago in the carboniferous period ( pennsylvanian ) . nova scotia at this time was a swamp , similar to today 's everglades in florida . the 'trees ' ( actually giant clubmosses ) were very tall . some , such as `` lepidodendron '' , were up to tall . `` archaeothyris '' and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor .
