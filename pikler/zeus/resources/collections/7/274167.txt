Pharmacoepidemiology     pharmacoepidemiology studies the use and effects of drugs on large groups of people and patients . it assesses probability of beneficial and adverse effects , and risks for humans while using a particular drug . pharmacoepidemiology bridges pharmacology and epidemiology and borrows their methodology from both of them . it uses descriptive epidemiological method by describing exposure to a drug and by calculating rates , e.g. , incidence and prevalence . such descriptive method generates hypothesis about influence of the drug , but does not test it . pharmacoepidemiology also uses analytic epidemiological method by means of observation ( case-control and cohort studies ) and experimentation ( clinical trial ) . the analytic study compares an exposed group with a control group and serves as testing of the hypothesis . pharmacoepidemiology provides pharmacovigilance , the later is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs in current growing integrating markets . pharmacovigilance is conducted by spontaneous reporting systems through health care professionals and others which report adverse drug reactions to the central agency . the central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products .
