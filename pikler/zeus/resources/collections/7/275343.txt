Time Person of the Year     person of the year is an issue of the united states magazine `` time '' that has come out each year since 1927. until 1999 , it was called `` man of the year . '' the `` person of the year '' is not always a person . it can be a person , group , idea , or thing that `` for better or for worse ... has done the most to influence the events of the year '' . this means that being chosen is not an award , like being chosen as the `` best person of the year . '' the person of the year may be an enemy of the united states , like adolf hitler ( 1938 ) or joseph stalin ( 1939 and 1942 ) . every year , `` time '' chooses the person who they think has had the most effect on the things that have happened in that year ( whether those things were good or bad ) . the first person of the year was aviator charles lindbergh , in 1927. since then , persons of the year have included groups , whole generations , important objects , and even the earth . since the list began , every serving president of the united states has been a person of the year at least once , except for calvin coolidge , herbert hoover , and gerald ford . franklin d. roosevelt is the only person to have been named person of the year three times .
