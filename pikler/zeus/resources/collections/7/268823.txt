Flotation     flotation is a process where gas bubbles are injected at the bottom of a tank containing a mixture of a liquid and solid particles to separate the solid particles from the liquid . when the gas bubbles move along the liquid mixture , the solids particles stick to the surface of the bubbles . the bubbles form a foam at the surface of the liquid : this foam contains the solid particles , so after the flotation process the solids can be removed just cleaning the liquid from this foam . flotation is used to separate sulfide ores from the impurities in the ore ( gangue ) . a detergent is added to the mixture and it is stirred . the sulfide minerals float , while the gangue sinks to the bottom and is removed . this is used in making zinc , where zinc sulfide ( sphalerite ) is a major zinc ore .
