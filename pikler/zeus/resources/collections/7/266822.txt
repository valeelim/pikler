Second Amendment to the United States Constitution     created on december 15 , 1791 , the second amendment to the united states constitution is the part of the united states bill of rights that establishes the right of citizens to possess firearms for lawful purposes . it says , `` a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . '' when america was being colonized by european countries , firearms were very important to colonists . when europeans came to america , they brought with them the idea of land ownership by an individual . they received this right from their king through land grants . this was completely foreign to native americans who considered a particular territory belonged to the tribe . colonists defended their claims against native americans and other europeans whose kings may have granted them the same lands . they also needed firearms for hunting . in many towns and villages , men were required to own firearms for the defense of the community . most colonists coming to america in the 17th century had no experience as soldiers . the british kept few soldiers in the colonies , and colonists soon found they needed to establish militias .
