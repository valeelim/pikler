Atmospheric circulation     atmospheric circulation is a large-scale movement of masses of air . the origin of these processes is the sun 's radiation . the sun waves radiate the short-wave radiation . the earth absorbs only a part of this energy . the other part is radiated back to the atmosphere and to the universe . the back radiation is long-waved . the thermal energy is distributed thanks to the circulation of the air on the surface of the earth . the demonstration of circulation varies from year to year , but the basic climatologic structure is almost constant . we recognize 3 cells : the hadley cell , the ferrel cell and the polar cell . the movement of air masses is influenced by coriolis force . it means that the air diverts to the west . the earth and ocean are intensively radiated in the equatorial areas . the hot and usually moist air rises . it is called convection . this process creates a low pressure area along the equator . the area is also called the intertropical convergence zone . the hot air goes to both south and north and gets colder . when the air is cold enough , it goes down to the surface again . this creates deserts and semi-deserts of the subtropics . reaching latitude 30 degrees , the masses of air return to the rainy equator .
