Oomycete     the oomycota are a class in a huge phylum of eukaryotic microorganisms called the heterokonts . oomycetes are a distinct phylogenetic lineage of fungus-like microorganisms . they are not actually fungi , though some have filaments as fungi do . like fungi , they are saprophytic and pathogenic . also like fungi , oomycetes rarely have septa , and if they do , they are scarce . they are microscopic organisms which reproduce both sexually and asexually . oomycetes are some of the most notorious pathogens of plants , causing devastating diseases such as potato blight and sudden oak death . they are often referred to as water moulds ( or moulds ) , although the water-loving nature which led to that name is not true of most species , which are terrestrial pathogens .
