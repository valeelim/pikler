Ornithopter     an ornithopter from the ancient greek language is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings . designers try to make the flapping-wing flight of birds , bats , and insects seem real . though machines may differ in form , they are usually built on the same scale as these flying creatures . manned ornithopters have also been built , and some have worked . the machines are of two general types : those with engines , and those powered by the muscles of the pilot .
