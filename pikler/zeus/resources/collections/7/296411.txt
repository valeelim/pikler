Hox gene     hox genes are a group of related genes that determine the basic structure and orientation of animals . 'hox ' is short for 'homeobox ' . hox genes are critical for the proper placement of segment structures of animals during early embryonic development ( e.g . legs , antennae , and wings in fruit flies or the different vertebrate ribs in humans ) . hox genes are a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes . the target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism . - hox genes have a dna sequence known as the homeobox . the homeobox is a 180 nucleotide-long dna sequence which codes for a 60 amino acid-long protein domain known as the `` homeodomain '' . this works by binding with dna . - hox genes are in gene clusters on the genome - the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed in segments along the body . - this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms .
