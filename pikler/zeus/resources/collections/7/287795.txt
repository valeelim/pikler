Evolution: The Modern Synthesis    evolution : the modern synthesis evolution : the modern synthesis is the title of a book by julian huxley which was published in 1942. it was the book which gave the modern evolutionary synthesis its name , and was one of the most important books on biology in the mid-twentieth century . huxley was one of the main architects of the new evolutionary synthesis which took place around the time of world war ii . huxley 's first 'trial run ' was the treatment of evolution in the `` science of life '' ( 1929â€“30 ) , and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the british association . in 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics . two of these papers were on the subject of sexual selection , an idea of darwin 's whose standing has been revived in recent times . huxley thought that sexual selection was `` ... merely an aspect of natural selection '' . this rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the great crested grebe ( and other birds that pair for life ) : the courtship takes place mostly `` after '' mate selection , not before .
