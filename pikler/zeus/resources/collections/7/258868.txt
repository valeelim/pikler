Impact crater     impact craters are formed by meteorites or comets striking the earth ( or moon , or planet ) . there is now a system for recording and assessing craters . the five largest `` confirmed '' impact structures are : 1. vredefort crater , south africa : 300 km diameter , 2023 million years ago . 1. sudbury basin , ontario , canada : 250 km diameter , 1850 million years ago . 1. chicxulub crater , mexico : 170 km diameter , 65 million years ago . 1. popigai crater , russia : 100 km diameter , 35.7 million years ago . 1. manicouagan crater , quebec , canada : 100 km diameter , 214 million years ago . there are some other suggested impact structures which are larger . it is a feature of the earth that climate , weathering and plate tectonics removes most of the older features and events . in comparison , the moon retains a nearly complete record of its past impact events . the implication is that the earth once suffered a similar bombardment in its early history . this period is known as the late heavy bombardment , because it occurred after the earth and moon formed .
