Gene knockout     a gene knockout is a genetic technique in which one of an organism 's genes is switched off or replaced by one which does not work . the organisms , such as knockout mice , are used to learn about a gene that has been sequenced , but whose function is unknown or incompletely known . researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals . knockout is often abbreviated as ko . gene knock-in is the opposite term . there a gene is switched on , or a working gene inserted . knockout is accomplished through a combination of techniques . it starts in the test tube with a plasmid , or other dna construct , and proceeding to cell culture . individual cells are genetically transformed with the dna construct . often the goal is to create an animal that has the altered gene . if so , embryonic stem cells are genetically transformed and inserted into early embryos . resulting animals with the genetic change in their germline cells can then often pass the gene knockout to future generations .
