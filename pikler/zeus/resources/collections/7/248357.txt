Nematomorpha     the nematomorpha ( horsehair worms ) are a phylum of parasitic cycloneuralian animals . they look similar to nematode worms and live in similar environments , which is why their names are similar . they are sometimes called gordiacea.. they range in size from long and in extreme cases may be up to 2 meters long . they are in diameter . horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs , streams , puddles , and cisterns . about 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide . fossilized worms have been reported from lower cretaceous burmese amber 100â€“110 million years ago . the adult worms are free living and , in north america , are usually found only in the summer months in or near shallow water . the larvae are parasitic on beetles , cockroaches , and orthoptera ( like grasshoppers and crickets ) . these are their final hosts , but since they do not live in water , the nematomorph life cycle has an extra stage . a day or two after they come out of their hosts , the adult worms mate in the water , and then around mid-august or mid-october , they lay their eggs in the water . it takes about a month for the larvae to develop inside the egg . once the larvae hatch , they somehow get into gastropods ( like snails and slugs ) , insects , or earthworms , which live in moist habitats . there they build a cyst , and grow . the animal they grow inside is called an interim ( temporary ) host , because a final host is still needed .
