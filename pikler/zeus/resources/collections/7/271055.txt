Geometric abstraction     geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms in non-representational compositions . this art is not meant to depict our everyday visual world , but instead uses the shapes of basic geometry . wassily kandinsky , one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting , was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work . other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as kazimir malevich and piet mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting . geometric abstraction is not just an invention of 20th century avant-garde artists or movements . it is present in many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves . islamic art , in its prohibition of depicting religious figures , is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art . it existed centuries before the modern movement in europe , and in many ways influenced this western school . geometric patterns were often used in the architecture of islamic civilisations from the 7th century-20th century , to visually connect spirituality with science and art .
