Cobalt(II) chloride    cobalt ( ii ) chloride cobalt ( ii ) chloride , also known as cobaltous chloride and cobalt dichloride , is a chemical compound . it contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state . its chemical formula is cocl . it contains cobalt and chloride ions . cobalt ( ii ) chloride is normally found in the red ( or pink ) form . the red form has water in it . it can be heated to turn it into the blue form , without water . the blue form will absorb water from the air and turn red again . a different blue form is made when cobalt ( ii ) chloride is reacted with a chemical compound that has chloride in it . hydrochloric acid works the best , but sodium chloride can be used too . when it is heated , it turns more blue than when it is cooled . it can be oxidized to cobalt ( iii ) compounds , although cobalt ( iii ) chloride does not exist . if it is made , it just drops a cl from cocl , making cocl ( cobalt ( ii ) chloride ) again . the anhydrous ( without water ) blue form can be made by reacting cobalt with chlorine . the hydrated ( with water ) red form can be made by reacting cobalt ( ii ) oxide or cobalt ( ii ) hydroxide with hydrochloric acid .
