Ingredient     an ingredient is a part that forms part of a mixture ( in a general sense ) . for example , in cooking , recipes specify which ingredients are used to prepare a specific dish . many commercial products contain a secret ingredient that is purported to make them better than competing products . in the health industry , an active ingredient is that part of a recipe that yields the effect required by the buyer . national laws usually require prepared food products to show a list of ingredients , and require that certain `` bad things '' be listed . in most developed countries , the law requires that ingredients be listed according to their weight in the product . if an ingredient itself consists of more than one ingredient ( such as the cookie pieces which are a part of `` cookies and cream '' flavor ice cream ) , then that ingredient is listed by what percentage of the total product it occupies , with its own ingredients showed next to it in brackets .
