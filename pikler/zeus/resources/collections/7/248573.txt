Enigma (machine)    enigma ( machine ) the enigma machine was created for germany by arthur scherbius in world war i. it is a cypher machine : a way of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters ( or , random letters ) . each time a letter is typed , it appears as another letter in the alphabet . the choices are `` not '' random . they are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up . every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position . german military messages done on the enigma machine were first broken by the polish cipher bureau , beginning in december 1932. later , they designed mechanical devices for breaking enigma cyphers . from 1938 more complexity was added to the enigma machines , making decryption more difficult . on 25 july 1939 , in warsaw , the poles showed french and british intelligence agents their cryptanalysis of the enigma , and promised each delegation a polish-built enigma . the demonstration was a vital start for the later british work at bletchley park .
