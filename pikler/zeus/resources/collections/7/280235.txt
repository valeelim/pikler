Earthquake protector     earthquake protector is a type of base isolation made to protect building and non-building structures against damage from strong earthquakes . a building 's seismic performance may be improved by reducing vibrations . this may be done with damping mechanisms in vibration control technologies and especially in base isolation . however , for the very pliant systems such as base isolated structures , with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping , the so-called `` damping force '' may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake . this finding created a theoretical ground in earthquake engineering for a damping-disengaged base isolation technology called earthquake protector .
