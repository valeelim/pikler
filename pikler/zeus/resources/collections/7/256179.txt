Rumba     rumba is a music and dance term with two different meanings . first , it means cuban event of african style , the rumba genre of afro-cuban music . this use of the term 'rumba ' is quite different from the latin ballroom dance . second , it refers to one of the latin ballroom dances . in this sense , the rumba is the slowest of the five competitive international latin dances . the paso doble , the samba , the cha-cha-cha and the jive are the others . this ballroom rumba was also danced in cuba to a rhythm they call the `` bolero-son '' . the international style was derived from studies of dance in cuba in the pre-revolutionary period . the `` peanut vendor '' was the first recording of cuban music to become an international hit . it was described on the label as a `` rumba '' , perhaps because the word `` son '' would not be understood in english . the label stuck , and a 'rumba craze ' developed through the 1930s . this kind of rumba was introduced into dance salons in america and europe in the 1930s , and was characterized by variable tempo , sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom rumba .
