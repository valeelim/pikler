Planck units     the planck units are physical units of measurement . the system of these units was first developed by max planck . the definition of the five base planck units are based only on five physical constants found in nature . when planck units are used to express any of these five physical constants , the value is 1. this allows physicists to simplify many equations about physical law . planck proposed these units in 1899. they are also known as `` natural units '' because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of nature and not from any human construct . planck units are only one system of natural units among other systems . they are considered unique , because these units are not based on properties of any prototype object , or particle ( that would be arbitrarily chosen ) but are based only on properties of free space . the constants that planck units , by definition , normalize to 1 are the : - gravitational constant , `` g '' ; - reduced planck constant , `` Ä§ '' ; - speed of light in a vacuum , `` c '' ;
