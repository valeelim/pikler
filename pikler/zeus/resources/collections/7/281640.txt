Endgame (chess)    endgame ( chess ) the endgame in chess ( or `` end game '' or `` ending '' ) is the part of the game when there are few pieces left on the board . alternatively , endgames begin when the middlegame is over , and kings are relatively safe . there are three main strategic differences between earlier parts of the game and endgame : the - `` pawns '' : during the endgame , pawns become more special . in the endgame , one thing players try to do is to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank . - `` kings '' : may become strong pieces in the endgame . the king may be brought towards the center of the board . there it can support its own pawns , attack the opponent 's pawns , and oppose the opponent 's king . - `` draws '' : in the endgame , a game may be drawn because there are too few pieces on the board to allow a player to win . this is one of the main reasons for games to be drawn . all endgame positions can be put into two camps . on the one hand are positions which may be won by force . on the other hand are positions which are drawn , or which should be drawn . the ones that are drawn for certain may be legally drawn ( mate could not happen ) or drawn by chess experience ( no sane defence could lose ) . all endgames in master chess revolve around the borderline between winning and drawing . generally , once a 'textbook ' drawn position is reached the players will agree a draw ; otherwise they play on .
