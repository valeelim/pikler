Fire ecology     fire ecology is about the effects of fire on the ecosystems where it occurs . the results of fire are studied , and also what causes the fires . in many ecosystems , fire helps keep the habitat healthy . examples of such habitats are the north american prairie and chaparral ecosystems , and the south african savanna . in these ecosystems , fire helps renew the habitat . in theses places , many plants and trees have adapted and need fire to grow well , or for their seeds to germinate . if the fires are stopped , dry wood and dead plants accumulate . bushes and trees that catch fire easily will start growing . when this area finally does catch fire , it will make the wildfire larger and more damaging , and be harder to control . in the united states , campaigns have made people believe that wildfires are always bad for nature . this comes from the old belief that ecosystems grow towards a stable system , and disturbances like fires stop that , and destroy the harmony of nature . but we have since learned that in some areas , fire is needed to make the system work properly ; fire also helps biodiversity of many habitats . the plants and animals in these habitats have adapted to protect themselves from fire , and sometimes must have fire to survive .
