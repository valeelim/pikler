Endianness     endianness refers to how hexadecimal data is ordered in machine language , the simplest , most understandable code that a computer can use . in computer coding , certain numbers , usually two bytes long ( 1 byte = 8 bits ) that are called `` words '' , can be written or input in two ways : little-endian and big-endian . it depends on the data format and the way the computer reads the data . say that we have a `` word '' like this : 12ab -- - > 12 | ab now , the way it 's written right now is big-endian , because the bigger number is on the end . ( in hexadecimal , the numbers go from 0 to 9 , then from a to f. after f , a 1 is added to the front . [ e.g . f+1=10 , which is 16 in our numbering system ] ) to write it in little-endian , we simply switch the positions of the first two and the last two pieces , so it becomes : ab12 -- - > ab | 12
