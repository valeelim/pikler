Drosophila pseudoobscura     drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of fruit fly , used extensively in lab studies of the genetics of natural populations . it was first used by theodosius dobzhansky and his colleagues . they collected samples from populations in western north america and mexico , and grew them in 'population cages ' in the laboratory . they were interested in natural selection , genetic drift , and other aspects of population genetics . in 1989 diane dodd gave laboratory populations of `` d. pseudoobscura '' two different food types , starch and maltose . they rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods . as the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type , this was claimed as an example of speciation by reproductive isolation . dodd 's experiment has been repeated by others , and works with other kinds of fruit flies and foods . in 2005 , `` d. pseudoobscura '' was the second `` drosophila '' species to have its genome sequenced , after `` drosophila melanogaster '' .
