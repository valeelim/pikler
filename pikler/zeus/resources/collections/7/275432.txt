Up quark     up quarks are subatomic particles that help make up many larger particles , like protons . up quarks have a charge of +2/3 , and are the lightest of the six types ( flavours ) of quarks . like all fermions ( non force-carrying particles ) , up quarks have a spin of 1/2 . they are affected by all four of the fundamental forces , which are gravity , strong force , weak force , and electromagnetism . like all quarks , up quarks are elementary particles , which means that they are so small that scientists believe that they can not be divided any more . protons ( which have a total charge of +1 ) are made of two up quarks ( which have a charge of +2/3 ) and one down quark ( which have a charge of -1/3 ) . neutrons ( which have a total charge of 0 ) are made of one up quark , and two down quarks . up quarks can also be used to create more complex particles , such as pions .
