Pair production     in physics , pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the nucleus of an atom , instead of the electron like in lower level x-ray interactions . the photon gives its energy to the nucleus and then creates a pair of positively and negatively charged electrons . the positive electron ( positron ) ionizes until it combines with a free electron . the two particles scatter in opposite directions . the probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photon and is affected by the material 's atomic number . pair production usually happens with energy levels over 25 mev . pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high-energy photon beams .
