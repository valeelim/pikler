Lumbricus terrestris     lumbricus terrestris is a large reddish worm native to europe , but now also widely distributed elsewhere around the world ( along with several other lumbricids ) , due to human introductions . in some areas where it has been introduced , some people consider it to be a serious pest species , since it is out-competing locally native worms . through much of europe it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm , typically reaching 20 â€“ 25 cm in length when extended ( though in parts of southern europe there are native species which are much larger ) . it has an unusual habit of copulating on the surface at night , which makes it more visible than most other earthworms .
