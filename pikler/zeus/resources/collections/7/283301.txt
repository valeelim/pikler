Agnès Sorel     agnès sorel ( 1421 – 9 february 1450 ) , was a favourite mistress of king charles vii of france . charles vii was the father of her three daughters . she was the subject of several contemporary paintings and works of art , including jean fouquet 's `` virgin and child surrounded by angels '' . sorel was twenty years old when she was first introduced to king charles . she was a very beautiful young woman , and was also of above-average intelligence . the french king immediately fell in love , and she soon became his mistress . the king gave her the château de loches ( where he had been persuaded by joan of arc to be crowned king of france ) as her private residence . sorel 's presence was alleged to have brought the king out of a protracted depression . she had a very strong influence on the king , and that , in addition to her extravagant tastes , earned her a number of powerful enemies at court . agnès gave birth to three daughters fathered by the king : marie de france , charlotte de france , and jeanne de france . while pregnant with their fourth child , she journeyed from chinon in deep midwinter to join charles on the campaign of 1450 in jumièges , wanting to be with him as moral support . there , she suddenly became ill and died at the age of 28. while the cause of death was originally thought to be dysentery . in 2005 french forensic scientist philippe charlier examined her remains and found that the cause of death was mercury poisoning . this did not mean sorel was murdered , because mercury was sometimes used in cosmetic preparations and also to treat worms . this could therefore have been the reason for her death .
