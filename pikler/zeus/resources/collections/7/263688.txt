Immune system     the immune system is the set of tissues which work together to resist infections . the immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen , and neutralize its threat . the immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents . examples are viruses , bacteria and parasites . the immune system can detect a difference between the body 's own healthy cells or tissues , and 'foreign ' cells . detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated , because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them . once a foreign cell or protein is detected , the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders , and sends special cells ( 'phagocytes ' ) to eat them up . even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections . other basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and insects . these mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides ( called defensins ) , phagocytosis , and the complement system . these are the innate immune system , which defends the host from infections in a non-specific way . the simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in . for example , skin stops most outside bacteria getting in .
