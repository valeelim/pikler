Wilson prime     a wilson prime is a special kind of prime number . a prime number `` p '' is a wilson prime if ( and only if [ iff ] ) formula_1 where `` n '' is a positive integer ( sometimes called natural number ) . wilson primes were first described by emma lehmer . the only known wilson primes are 5 , 13 , and 563 ; if any others exist , they must be greater than 5. it has been conjectured that there are an infinite number of wilson primes , and that the number of wilson primes in an interval is about formula_2 . compare this with wilson 's theorem , which states that every prime `` p '' divides ( `` p '' âˆ’ 1 ) ! + 1. related pages . - wieferich prime - wall-sun-sun prime - wolstenholme prime other websites . - the prime glossary : wilson prime - status of the search for wilson primes - wilson quotients for composite moduli - on congruences involving bernoulli numbers and the quotients of fermat and wilson
