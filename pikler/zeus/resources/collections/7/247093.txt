Ant mill     an ant mill is a small group of army ants away from the other ants . they lose the pheromone track and begin to follow each other , making a spinning circle . the ants will die of exhaustion . people can make this happen easily . this is a side effect of the self organizing structure of ant colonies . each ant only knows to follow the ant in front of it . this will work until something goes wrong and an ant mill forms . an ant mill was first seen by william beebe who saw a mill 1,200 feet in circumference . it took each ant 2.5 hours to go around .
