Bell's theorem    bell 's theorem bell 's theorem , also called `` bell 's inequality , '' is a thought experiment . when joined with real experiments it shows there are no hidden variables which can explain some of the consequences of quantum mechanics . this study , closely related to quantum mechanics , was done by john stewart bell . the following analogy has been provided by brian greene : pairs of boxes have been prepared and sent to earth and on vulcan . there is something inside that shows a light when a door is opened . if the same doors are opened on both members of the pair , then both lights will be blue or both lights will be red . what if different doors are opened ? maybe the chances that a red light or a blue light shows up were set by the maker of the boxes . or maybe whether a red light or a blue light shows up depends on an individual coin flip in each box . how can we tell ? in a system that works the way quantum mechanics does , there is a 50 % chance that opening any pair of doors ( on the gray side , the white side , or the black side of each of the boxes in the schematic diagram ) will give rise to a match . for instance , earth could open the door in the gray side of its box , and vulcan could open the door in the black side of its box . quantum physics says that half the time they should get a match . but if the decision to produce a certain color for each of the doors opened is programmed into both boxes , then there is a 55 % or greater chance of getting a match .
