Venerable     the venerable is used as a style in several christian churches . it is also the common english-language translation of a number of buddhist titles . in the latin rite of the catholic church , `` the venerable , '' is the style used for a person who has been posthumously declared `` heroic in virtue '' during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint . before a person is considered to be `` venerable , '' he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation , approved by the pope , of having lived a life that was `` heroic in virtue '' â€“ the virtues being the theological virtues of faith , hope , and charity and the cardinal virtues of prudence , justice , fortitude , and temperance . the next step is beatification , at which point the person is referred to as `` the blessed '' , and finally canonization , at which point the person is referred to as `` saint '' . two modern and well-known examples of those who have been declared venerable are popes john paul ii and pius xii , who were both declared venerable by pope benedict xvi in december 2009 , and who are likely to be beatified soon .
