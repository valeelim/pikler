Tree of life (biology)    tree of life ( biology ) the tree of life is a metaphor which expresses the idea that all life is related by common descent . charles darwin was the first to use this metaphor in modern biology . it had been used many times before for other purposes . the `` evolutionary tree '' shows the relationships among various biological groups . it includes data from dna , rna and protein analysis . tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy , and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research . below is a simplified version of present-day understanding . jean-baptiste lamarck ( 1744–1829 ) produced the first branching tree of animals in his `` philosophie zoologique '' ( 1809 ) . it was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals . however , lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life . instead , he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex . the american geologist edward hitchcock ( 1763–1864 ) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his `` elementary geology '' . on the vertical axis are paleontological periods . hitchcock made a separate tree for plants ( left ) and animals ( right ) . the plant and animal trees are not connected at the bottom of the chart . furthermore , each tree starts with multiple origins . however , they were not `` evolutionary '' trees , because hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change .
