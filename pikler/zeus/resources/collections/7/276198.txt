Creative destruction     creative destruction ( german : `` schöpferische zerstörung '' ) is a term that came from marxism . it talks about how wealth is gathered and lost under capitalism . the term was first used in werner sombart 's `` krieg und kapitalismus '' ( `` war and capitalism '' , 1913 ) these ideas were first discussed in books `` the communist manifesto '' ( 1848 ) , in `` grundrisse '' ( 1857 ) `` volume iv '' of `` das kapital '' ( 1863 ) . creative destruction is supposed to describe a theory of how the `` destruction '' of economic order leads to capitalistic economic ideals . a german marxist sociologist ( sombart ) is credited for using it first in his 1913 book `` krieg und kapitalismus '' , which means `` war and capitalism '' in english . the works and publications of marxists such as karl marx himself , and friedrich engels , a socialist scientist , discuss the ideas of creative destruction . in and after the 1950s , the term became associated with austrian-american economist joseph schumpeter . schumpeter is credited for making the theory popular . however , his idea of creative destruction was quite different from marx 's original theory . the term gained popularity within neoliberal or free-market economics where it is used to described processes such as downsizing . the original marxist usage has , however , been maintained in the work of influential social scientists such as david harvey , marshall berman , and manuel castells .
