Uniformitarianism     uniformitarianism is the idea that the same physical laws of today have always operated . it was the centerpiece of james hutton 's 1795 geology book `` theory of the earth , with proofs and illustrations '' . in this work hutton proposed that the causes acting on the world today also acted in the past . this means that the rocks of the earth were formed by processes which we can see operating today . these processes , though very slow ( gradualism ) , made the world what it is today . the idea is part of a wider philosophy called the philosophy of naturalism . the term 'uniformitarianism ' was invented by william whewell in 1837 to describe hutton 's basic idea . this idea is the foundation of modern geology . hutton 's ideas were popularised by john playfair in 1802 in `` illustrations of the huttonian theory of the earth '' , and by charles lyell in his `` principles of geology '' ( 1830 to 1833 ) . the phrase `` the present is the key to the past '' is lyell 's most famous quotation . uniformitarianism in geology is opposed by catastrophism , the idea that major changes in the earth take place through sudden and violent events .
