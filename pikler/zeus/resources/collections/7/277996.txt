Negative film     negative film is the name for a photographic film that will give images which have their colors inverted , after development . this inversion means that the complementary color is used . a second process ( usually called `` making a print '' ) is used to obtain any number of `` photos '' , which can also be in different sizes . the other kind of film is called reversal film , where development results in exactly one `` positive '' image ( which does not use complementary colors ) . negative films that use colors have multiple layers . each layer is sensitive to a different wavelength of light . most amateur films in use today are negative films . the benefits of this kind of film is that it is very tolerant to exposure differences , without noticeable loss in quality . another benefit is that getting the film developed is very easy .
