Entscheidungsproblem     the entscheidungsproblem ( german , `` decision problem '' ) is a famous problem of mathematics . david hilbert formulated the problem in 1928 : is there an algorithm that will take a formal language , and a logical statement in that language , and that will output `` true '' or `` false '' , depending on the truth value of the statement ? the algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer , nor prove it , as long as the answer is always correct . in 1936 and 1937 , alonzo church and alan turing showed independently , that there can be no answer to the entscheidungsproblem . they showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false . for this reason , there can be no solution for the entscheidungsproblem .
