Tempura     batter for tempura is generally made from cold water and a light wheat flour . however , sometimes other ingredients may be added , such as eggs , baking soda or baking powder , starch , oil , or spices . traditionally , the batter is mixed a small amount at a time using chopsticks . the batter is only mixed for a few seconds and the lumps are left behind , giving the fried tempura its unique shape . great care is taken to make sure the tempura is not over-mixed , otherwise it will become chewy and dough-like . special tempura flour has become widely available in supermarkets around the world . tempura generally does not use breadcrumbs ( `` panko '' ) . foods made with this are usually referred to as `` furai '' -- japanese-style fried foods , such as tonkatsu ( fried pork cutlet ) or ebi furai ( fried shrimp ) . seafood or thinly sliced vegetables are dipped in the batter and then quickly fried in hot oil . usually vegetable oil is used and is heated to around 160 to 180 degrees celsius . the cooking time for different types of tempura varies greatly , from only a few seconds for very thin vegetables to minutes for thicker ingredients or `` kakiage '' ( mixed vegetables fritters ) .
