Ketosis     ketosis occurs when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver . ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acid . ketosis can be understood as the use of body fat as a source of energy . the body goes through ketosis when there is not enough carbohydrate to refill glycogen in the liver . an example of this kind of diet is the atkins diet , where followers start by eating fewer than 20g of carbohydrates per day . it takes 48 hours for the brain to switch from glucose to ketone bodies . ketosis helps the body prevent using protein , from muscles , for gluconeogenesis to make glucose . ketosis in essence , a ketogenic diet mimics '' starvation '' , allowing the body to go into a metabolic state called ketosis ( key-tow-sis ) . normally , human bodies are sugar-driven machines : ingested carbohydrates are broken down into glucose , which is mainly transported and used as energy or stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue . when deprived of dietary carbohydrates ( usually below 50g/day ) , the liver becomes the sole provider of glucose to feed your hungry organs – especially the brain , a particularly greedy entity accounting for ~20 % of total energy expenditure . the brain can not directly use fat for energy . once liver glycogen is depleted , without a backup energy source , humanity would ’ ve long disappeared in the eons of evolution .
