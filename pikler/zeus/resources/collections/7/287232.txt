Evolution of the eye     the evolution of the eye is an example of a homologous organ present in a wide variety of taxa . certain components of the eye , such as the visual pigments , appear to have a common ancestry – that is , they evolved once , before the animals radiated . however , complex , image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times – using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction . complex eyes appear to have first evolved within a few million years , in the rapid burst of evolution known as the cambrian explosion . there is no evidence of eyes before the cambrian , but a wide range of diversity is evident in the middle cambrian burgess shale . eyes show a wide range of adaptations to meet the requirements of the organisms which bear them . eyes may vary in their acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light levels , their ability to detect motion or resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours . the first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower cambrian period , about 540 million years ago . this period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution , dubbed the 'cambrian explosion ' . one biologist holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution .
