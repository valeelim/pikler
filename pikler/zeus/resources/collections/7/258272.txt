March (music)    march ( music ) in music a march is a piece of music with a strong marching rhythm . marches are often written especially so that soldiers can march to them . other marches may not be intended for marching , but they still have a strong , regular beat so that people could , if they wanted to , march to the music . marches are usually 2/4 time ( one - two - one - two - left - right - left- right ) or 4/4 ( the same as two bars ( measures ) ) although other time signatures are possible . marches can be slow marches or quick marches . a slow march may be a funeral march . john philip sousa was a composer whose marches became extremely popular ( e.g . `` colonel bogey 's march '' ) . in classical music many composers wrote marches which are not intended to be marched to , but still give the mood of a march . some famous examples of funeral marches include the second movement of beethoven 's `` eroica '' symphony , the `` marche fun√®bre '' ( funeral march ) in chopin 's `` piano sonata in b flat minor '' , and the `` dead march '' in handel 's oratorio `` saul '' .
