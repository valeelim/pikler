Subject (grammar)    subject ( grammar ) the subject in grammar is the agent ( the 'doer ' ) in an active sentence such as : `` alan kissed jane '' . however , there is a difficulty . the following two sentences are identical in meaning : - `` our children planted a tree '' . - `` a tree was planted by our children '' . only in the first sentence is `` our children '' the grammatical subject . so there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subject . also , many sentences have no subject , for instance : - `` come here ! '' - `` identifying the thief may take some time '' . if a sentence does have a subject , then the rest of the sentence may be called the `` predicate '' .
