Chondrostei     the chondrostei are a sub-class of ray-finned fish , the actinopterygii . they include the sturgeons , huge fish which provide caviar . the chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification . there are 52 species divided among two orders . the orders are the acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) , and the polypteriformes ( reedfishes and bichirs ) . this group has at times been classified with the sharks : the similarities are obvious , not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone , the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish . both lack scales ( except the polypteriforms ) . additional shared features include spiracles and , in sturgeons , a heterocercal tail ( the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin ) . however the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the teleostei than their external appearance might suggest . it is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later evolutionary development , resulting in a lightening of the frame . elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish .
