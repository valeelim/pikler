Quine     a quine is a special kind of computer program , which accepts no inputs and outputs its own source code . they are named after the philosopher willard van orman quine . quine was very interested in the `` liar paradox '' , `` this statement is false '' , which ca n't be either true or false . this paradox appears in lots of other places . in the mathematics of set theory it is called russell 's paradox , it is a set which contains sets which do n't contain themselves . all of those examples before quine were 'self-referential ' . this means that they define an object in terms of itself , like the liar paradox starting with the words `` this statement '' . lots of people thought that you could ignore the liar paradox if you just decided to ignore all self-referential statements . quine saw that you would also have to ignore `` quotation '' , which is the process that happens when you put a phrase in quote marks . when you `` say '' a phrase , you are talking about its meaning ; but when you `` quote '' a phrase , you are talking about that phrase , and not what it means .
