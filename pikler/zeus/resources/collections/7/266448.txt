Photodetector     a photocell , also known as a photoresistor , is an electronic component , device that changes its electrical conductivity when light shines on it . in the picture , the electricity flows through the reddish part . normally , when light shines on it , then more electricity flows through . when it is dark , almost no electricity flows through . selenium can be used to make photocells , although some other chemicals can be used . semiconductors are used to make photocells . when the light shines into the photocell , it `` loosen '' s the electrons , allowing them to flow and make an electrical current . related pages . - resistor - capacitor
