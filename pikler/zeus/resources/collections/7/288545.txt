Black market     the black market is the trade of goods illegally . black markets opeate outside the normal economy . the black market is different from the so-called grey market , where goods are traded legally , but outside the common channels . goods and services traded on the black market include drug and arms trafficking as well as prostitution . in some casess , the goods or services are cheaper than on the normal market , because taxes or production costs do not need to be paid - very often the goods traded were stolen . in other cases , the price on the black market is higher , because the goods are difficult to get , producing or handling them may be dangerous . some drugs are illegal to produce , their price on the black market is often higher than the production costs . even though such a market is not controlled by the state , the economic principles are still that of a market : supply and demand influence the price .
