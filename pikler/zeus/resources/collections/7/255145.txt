Quickstep     the quickstep is an international style ballroom dance that follows a 4/4 time beat , at about 50 bars per minute . from its early beginning as a faster foxtrot , the quickstep has become quite different . it is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances . the quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the foxtrot , the charleston , and other dances . the dance is english in origin , and was standardized in 1927. although it came from the foxtrot , the quickstep now is quite separate . unlike the modern foxtrot , the feet often close and syncopated ( split-beat ) steps occur often . three characteristic dance figures of the quickstep are the `` chass√©s '' , where the feet come together , the `` quarter turns '' , and the `` lock step '' . this dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor , with many advanced patterns including hops , runs , quick steps with a lot of momentum , and rotation . the tempo of quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music .
