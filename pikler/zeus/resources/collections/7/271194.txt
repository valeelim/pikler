Cleisthenes     cleisthenes was a noble athenian of the alcmaeonid family . he reformed the constitution of athens , and set it on a democratic footing in 508/7 bc . for these accomplishments , historians refer to him as `` the father of athenian democracy '' . he also increased the power of the assembly , and he broke up power of the athenian nobility . with help from the his clan , he overthrew hippias the tyrant ( dictatorial ruler ) . after the collapse of hippias ' tyranny , isagoras and cleisthenes were rivals for power . isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the spartan king cleomenes i to help him expel cleisthenes . so cleisthenes left athens as an exile , and isagoras held power in the city . isagoras uprooted hundreds of people from their homes on the pretext that they were cursed , and attempted to dissolve the council ( βουλή , boulé ) . however , the council resisted , and the athenian people declared their support of it . hence isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the acropolis , remaining besieged there for two days . on the third , they fled and were banished . cleisthenes was subsequently recalled , along with hundreds of exiles , and he assumed leadership of athens .
