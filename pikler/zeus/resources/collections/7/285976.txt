Optical gain medium     an optical gain medium ( also called an `` active laser medium '' ) can make light stronger . in general , gain media must be powered by another energy source in order to have energy to provide as light . some gain media can be powered using electricity , but many others need light energy from bright flash lamps or a laser . optical gain media are used in lasers . the first lasers used artificial ruby as their optical gain medium .
