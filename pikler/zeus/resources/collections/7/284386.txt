Heterozygote advantage     heterozygote advantage is the situation where , at a gene locus , the heterozygote has greater fitness than either homozygote . it is a type of balancing selection . hb = gene for normal haemoglobin molecules ; hb = mutant gene . three genotypes are possible in a population : hbhb producing a normal phenotype ; hbhb the heterozygote ; and hbhb homozygous for sickle cell anaemia . the fitness of these three genotypes varies according to the environment . in the temperate zone , the normal homozygotes and the heterozygotes will leave most offspring . this is because the homozygote for sickle cell has less chance of surviving to leave children , and if they do survive , they will have many health problems . in a tropical climate , such as equatorial africa , malaria is a big killer . there , the heterozygote has the advantage in fitness . they do not get malaria so badly , and they do not suffer the earlier deaths of the homozygote sickle cell sufferers . not surprisingly , the hb gene is present in about a quarter of africans from the countries near the equator . in europeans it is a rare gene .
