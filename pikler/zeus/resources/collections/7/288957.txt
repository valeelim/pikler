Old Red Sandstone     the old red sandstone is a dark red sandstone laid down in the devonian period over a large part of the northern continent of laurussia . laurussia , which is often called the old red continent , included much of northern europe , greenland and north america . it was , at the time , between 0 and 30 south of the equator . the old red sandstone ( ors ) was first discovered in great britain , and it played a big part in early geology . the term 'old red sandstone ' was first used in 1821 by scottish naturalist and mineralogist robert jameson . in 1787 james hutton saw what is now known as hutton 's unconformity at jedburgh in the scottish borders . later , on the berwickshire coast , he found siccar point . there was `` a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea '' , where 345 million year old devonian old red sandstone overlies 425 million year old silurian greywacke . the unconformity represents a gap in the record of geological time . during this time the rocks were raised above sea level , and erosion took place . folding and faulting occurred as the caledonian mountains were formed when a section of northwestern europe collided with a continental plate made up of parts of present-day north america and greenland . the lower strata tilted almost vertical .
