SOAP (protocol)    soap ( protocol ) soap , or the simple object access protocol is a protocol used in computing . web services use this protocol to communicate . soap uses xml to encode a message . it uses other application-layer protocols , for transport , and content negotiation , for example http and remote procedure call . the most common combination is to use soap with http and tcp . there are different versions , 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2. since version 1.2 the protocol is simply called `` soap '' . this is because the protocol is not `` simple '' , and that it can be used for other purposes than accessing objects . soap is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized , distributed environment . soap uses xml technologies to define an extensible messaging framework , which provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols . the framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation specific semantics .
