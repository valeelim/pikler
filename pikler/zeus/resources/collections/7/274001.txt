Proteobacteria     the proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria . they are gram-negative bacteria . this means they do not retain the violet dye in the gram staining protocol . in a gram stain test , a counterstain ( commonly safranin ) is added after the crystal violet , colouring all gram-negative bacteria with a pink colour . the test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell walls . proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogens , such as `` escherichia coli '' , `` salmonella '' , `` vibrio '' , `` helicobacter '' , and many other notable genera . others are free-living , and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation . the group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) sequences . most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic , chemoautotrophs , and heterotrophic , but there are numerous exceptions . there are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in marine plankton . they may constitute over 10 % of the open ocean microbial community .
