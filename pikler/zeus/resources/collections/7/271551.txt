Photocathode     a photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device . they are the main type of photomultiplier . that means they take a little light , and make more of it . there are instruments which need to magnify the amount of light coming in . examples are astronomical telescopes and military night-sight equipment : binoculars and telescopes on helmets and rifles etc . the lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light-sensitive metal . when this is struck by light , the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump off . this is called the 'photoelectric effect ' . the freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image . some photocathode materials . 1. ag-o-cs , ( silver oxide/caesium , also called s-1 ) . this was the first compound photocathode material , developed in 1929 . 1. high temperature bialkali or low noise bialkali ( sodium-potassium-antimony , na-k-sb ) . this material is often used in oil well logging since it can withstand temperatures up to 175 Â°c . at room temperatures , this photocathode operates with very low dark current , making it ideal for use in photon counting applications .
