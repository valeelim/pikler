Marin Mersenne     marin mersenne , ( born 8 september 1588 , in modern-day sarthe , died 1 september 1648 , in paris ) was a french theologian and mathematician . he developed the first laws of acoustics , which was known by his name for a long time . today , he is mainly remembered for the mersenne primes . together with galileo galilei he built the laws which describe how a mass falls in an empty space . he was in favour of modern science , and did not agree with `` occultist '' movements . he often travelled to meet great scientists , which made him an important mediator . this is especially true for mathematicians such as pierre gassendi , gilles personne de roberval , blaise pascal und pierre de fermat . to tell mersenne of a discovery was like publishing it . he told gassendi to reply to the `` meditations '' of descartes . mersenne gave huygens the idea of using a pendulum to measure time . this led to the development of pendulum clocks .
