Barbara McClintock     barbara mcclintock ( june 16 , 1902 – september 2 , 1992 ) was an american biologist . she was a distinguished cytogeneticist who worked on inheritance in maize . mcclintock was awarded the 1983 nobel prize in physiology or medicine . mcclintock got her phd in botany from cornell university in 1927. maize cytogenetics was the focus of her research for the rest of her career . from the late 1920s , mcclintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize . she used microscopic analysis to show genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information . she produced the first genetic map for maize , and demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere . these are regions of the chromosome that are important in preserving genetic information . she was recognized amongst the best in the field , awarded prestigious fellowships , and elected a member of the national academy of sciences in 1944. during the 1940s and 1950s , mcclintock discovered transposition and used it to show how genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on or off . she developed theories to explain the control of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next . encountering skepticism of her research and its implications , she stopped publishing her data in 1953. later , she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics of maize races from south america .
