Femur     the femur is the thighbone in tetrapods . it connects to the pelvis ( hip ) at the upper end and to the knee at the lower end . it connects with the hip by a ball-and-socket joint which allows freedom of movement . the lower end of the femur forms a hinge with the lower leg known as the knee . this has two 'articulations ' : with the patella ( knee-cap ) , and with the tibia ( the main lower leg bone ) .
