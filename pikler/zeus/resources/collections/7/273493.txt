Metriacanthosauridae     metriacanthosaurids were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs . they tended to be large predators , and some were 30 ft ( 10 m ) long . metriacanthosaurids are carnosaurs . at first they were classified in the megalosauridae or allosauridae , now they are put in their own family . a gigantic tooth , which may come from a giant metriacanthosaurid , was described recently ( 2008 ) . the metriacanthosauridae is a monophyletic group . cladistically it includes `` metriacanthosaurus parkeri '' and species closer related to `` metriacanthosaurus '' than to `` allosaurus fragilis '' , `` carcharodontosaurus saharicus '' , or to birds . these theropods are close to the ancestors of the allosaurs . metriacanthosauridae is often referred to as `` sinraptoridae '' , but metriacanthosauridae is the correct name under iczn rules , since `` metriacanthosaurus '' was the first member of the family to be described and named . the cladogram here follows a study by benson and colleagues . other websites . - taxon search - sinraptoridae
