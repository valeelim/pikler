Electrical resistivity     electrical resistivity is a concept in electrical engineering . it is a measure of how much an electrical conductor stops the flow of electricity through it . most metals have a very low electrical resistivity . the si uses the ohm metre for measuring how much electrical resistivity there is . electrical resistivity is also inverse of electrical conductivity . this term is more meaningful in case of semiconductors and insulators .
