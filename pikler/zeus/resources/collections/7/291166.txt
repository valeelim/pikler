David Hubel     david hunter hubel ( february 27 , 1926 september 22 , 2013 ) was a professor of neurobiology emeritus at harvard medical school . hubel was co-recipient with torsten wiesel of the 1981 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system . the prize was shared with roger sperry for his independent research on the cerebral hemispheres . hubel died of renal failure . hubel and wiesel received the nobel prize for two major contributions : 1. their work in the 1960s and 1970s on how the visual system developed . they worked on parts of the visual cortex of the brain which get signals from the right or left eye . 1. their work describing how signals from the eye are processed by the brain to generate edge detectors , motion detectors , stereoscopic depth detectors and colour detectors . these are building blocks of the visual scene . in one experiment , done in 1959 , they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat . they then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat . they found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle , while others responded best to another angle . some of these neurons responded differently to light patterns than to dark patterns . hubel and wiesel called these neurons 'simple cells ' .
