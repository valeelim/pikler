Coelurus     coelurus ( meaning `` hollow '' ) is a poorly known genus . it was perhaps a bipedal theropod dinosaur 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) long , weighing roughly 20 kg . its femur ( thigh bone ) was 55 cm long . it was a carnivore that lived during the late jurassic period , about 156 to 145 million years ago . its bones were hollow and lightweight , so `` coelurus '' was probably light and fast . its fossils were found in wyoming . `` coelurus '' was named by paleontologist othniel c. marsh in 1879 .
