Old Style and New Style dates     old style ( or o.s . ) and new style ( or n.s . ) are terms used in english language historical studies for two reasons . the first reason is that the method of dating that is most widely used around the world today , the gregorian calendar , has not always been used . the second is that 1 january has not always been the first day of the year . both of these conventions changed not very long ago . so when a date is given in a history book ( or an old book ) , we need to know whether it is in the modern `` new style '' or the traditional `` old style '' . during the time of the changeover , people would give both dates . even today , when historians are writing about an event in those times , they often give the date as it was used at the time but also give the modern equivalent for your convenience . in europe and its colonies , the julian calendar was used traditionally . other countries used different systems : for example china , japan and korea used lunisolar calendars . the reason for changing the calendar was that experts in the early 1700s realised that that there is a mistake in the julian calendar , that it adds too many leap years . this meant that the date of easter was being calculated wrongly . so they designed a new calendar that corrected this error . pope gregory xiii declared that this new calendar should be used from 1753 onwards . but only roman catholic countries accepted this ruling : protestant and eastern orthodox countries refused to have the pope tell them what to do . so even in europe , the change happened at different times . for example , it was not until 1752 that great britain and its colonies changed over to the new calendar , changing the start of the year to 1 january at the same time . russia changed in 1918 , after the 'october ' revolution .
