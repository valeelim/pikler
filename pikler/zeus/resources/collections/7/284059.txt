Desiccation     desiccation is the state of extreme dryness , or the process of extreme drying . a desiccant is a hygroscopic ( water-attracting ) substance that causes desiccation in a moderately sealed container . desiccation tolerance refers to the ability of an organism to withstand or endure extreme dryness , or drought-like conditions . plants and animals living in arid or periodically arid environments such as temporary streams or ponds may face desiccation , therefore physiological or behavioural adaptations are necessary to ensure survival . in particular , insects occupy a wide range of ecologically diverse niches and so have a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation . desiccation resistance in insects is generally measured by the change in mass during dry conditions . the overall mass difference between measurements before and after aridity exposure is attributed to body water loss . cryptobiosis refers to the state of an organism that has no detectable metabolic activity , resulting from extreme and unfavorable environmental conditions . anhydrobiosis refers to the state of surviving the loss of ( almost ) all body water .
