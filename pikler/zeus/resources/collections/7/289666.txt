Shotgun shell     a shotgun shell is the standard type of ammunition for a shotgun . it is fired after being loaded into the chamber or chambers of a shotgun . the shell is cylindrical in shape and is normally between and long . it holds a charge of gunpowder and either lead shot or a shotgun slug made to be fired from the shotgun . shotgun shells are usually mostly plastic but have thin brass at the base , though they can be made of solid brass , paper , or other combinations of these materials . a shotgun shell 's size is usually measured in gauge ( also known as bore ) . the most common size of shotgun shell is the 12-gauge . when measuring gauge , a smaller number means a larger shell : a 12-gauge shell is larger than a 20-gauge shell . shell gauge is an old measurement . except for the .410 bore or gauge , which is not a gauge at all but a caliber , the gauge of a shotgun was equal to the number of lead balls that added up to . so in a 12 gauge , 12 balls add up to about a pound of lead . so the diameter is equal to a ball weighing 1/12th of a pound of lead . a 20 gauge , another popular size today , has the diameter of a ball weighing 1/20th of a pound of lead .
