Thallium halide     the thallium halides come in two oxidation states : monohalides , where thallium has the oxidation state +1 , and trihalides , where thallium generally has oxidation state +3 . the monohalides all contain thallium with oxidation state +1 . - thallium ( i ) fluoride , a white crystalline solid . it is soluble in water , unlike the other thallium monohalides . - thallium ( i ) chloride , sensitive to light . it is a white crystalline solid . - thallium ( i ) bromide , sensitive to light . a pale yellow crystalline solid . - thallium ( i ) iodide , at room temperature it is a yellow crystalline solid . at higher temperatures the colour changes to red . thallium ( iii ) halides are very rare . some of them are unstable . the thallium ( iii ) iodide does not form . they are quite different to aluminium , gallium and indium trihalides . - thallium ( iii ) fluoride , also known as thallic fluoride , is made of thallium in its +3 oxidation state and fluoride ions . it is made by reacting thallium ( iii ) oxide with bromine trifluoride , fluorine , or sulfur tetrafluoride at a warm temperature .
