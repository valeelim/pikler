Suda     the suda or souda ( ) is a massive 10th century byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient mediterranean world . it is an encyclopedic dictionary , written in greek , with 30,000 entries . the derivation is probably from the byzantine greek word `` souda '' , meaning 'fortress ' or 'stronghold ' . the `` suda '' is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense . it explains the source , derivation , and meaning of words according to the philology of its period . there is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work . it is the articles on literary history that are valuable . these entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost . this lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political , ecclesiastical , and literary history in the east down to the tenth century . the chief source for this is the encyclopedia of constantine vii porphyrogenitus ( 912â€“959 ) , and for roman history the excerpts of john of antioch ( seventh century ) .
