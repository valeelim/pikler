Luminiferous aether     luminiferous aether is something once believed to fill the universe and explain how the transmission of waves of light can happen . people believed that light was a kind of wave . waves travel over the surface of water in a pond , through the air in a room , etc . all waves that people had studied before had traveled through something . sound waves traveled faster through steel than through air . so people imagined that light had to travel through something too . since light travels faster than anything else , light should travel through something more rigid ( like steel ) faster than anything else . but at the same time this substance would have to be entirely yielding so that it would not slow down the movements of planets and cause them to eventually fall into their suns . the people coming before albert einstein believed this stuff to exist , and they called it the `` luminiferous aether . '' if we were traveling on a boat moving through an ocean current , then we could see changes in the rate that waves appeared to travel depending on whether we were moving with the current , across the current , or against the current .
