Wind turbine     a wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy . if the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery , such as for pumping water , cutting lumber or grinding stones , the machine is called a windmill . if the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity , the machine may be called a wind turbine generator ( wtg ) , wind power unit ( wpu ) , wind energy converter ( wec ) , or aerogenerator . the wind turbine 's blades are turned by the wind . this turns a shaft turning at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque . the shaft goes into a gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50 , although more recent wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more . this is then creating an output of around 1000 rpm but at a low torque . it is connected to a generator which uses magnetic fields and wire to create electricity . this electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm , and this combined electricity is conditioned to be the same as the power grid and then the electricity is sent to the power grid .
