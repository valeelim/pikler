Plasmid     a plasmid is a dna molecule that is separate from the chromosomal dna and that can replicate ( copy itself ) independently . the term `` plasmid '' was first introduced by the american molecular biologist joshua lederberg in 1952. plasmids are double stranded and , in many cases , circular . plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria , but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms ( e.g. , the `` 2-micrometre-ring '' in `` saccharomyces cerevisiae '' ) . plasmid size varies from 1 to over 1,000 kilobase pairs ( kbp ) . the number of identical plasmids within a single cell can range from one to thousands . plasmids are often associated with conjugation , a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer . plasmids are transferable genetic elements , or `` replicons '' , capable of independent self copying in a suitable host . plasmids can be found in all three major domains , archaea , bacteria and eukarya . similar to viruses , plasmids are not considered a form of `` life '' as it is currently defined . unlike viruses , plasmids are `` naked '' dna and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host .
