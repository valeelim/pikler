Charm quark     charm quarks or c quarks are the third most massive of the six quarks . like all quarks , they are thought to be so small that they can not be divided . ( they are called elementary particles for this reason ) . similar to up quarks , charm quarks have a charge of +2/3 . although charm quarks are not extremely common , they can be found in particles created by particle accelerators ( which smash atoms together at extremely high speeds ) , such as j/ψ mesons , d mesons , and other charmed particles . since they are fermions ( particles that can not have more than one of that particle at the same place at the same time ) , charm quarks have a spin of 1/2 . the discovery of charm quarks – and j/ψ mesons – led to a rapid series of scientific breakthroughs . these events are known as the november revolution .
