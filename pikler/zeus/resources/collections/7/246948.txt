Troodontidae     troodontidae is a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs . they were found mainly in mongolia , china and north america . the first specimen , just a single tooth , was found in central montana in 1855 by ferdinand hayden . for a long time , troodontid fossils were few and scrappy . recently more complete specimens have been found . there are now complete and articulated specimens , including feathers , eggs and embryos , and complete juveniles . in 1994 a fossil of an adult `` troodon '' was found sitting on a nest with eight eggs . anatomical studies of the most primitive troodontids , like `` sinovenator '' , demonstrate striking similarities with `` archaeopteryx '' and primitive dromaeosaurids . this proves they are relatives : they are a clade called paraves . the family have relatively large brains , a skull with many air pockets , a retractable second toe claw ( it could be pulled in ) and many teeth . the number of teeth ranges from 96 in `` saurornithoides mongoliensis '' to 120 in the `` troodon '' . taxonomy .
