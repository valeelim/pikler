Growth ring     growth rings are the rings ithat can be seen when a tree is cut . each ring equals one year of growth . some animals have annual growth rings like this . they are shells and corals . counting the growth rings shows how old a tree is . the growth ring in furniture , walls and other wooden things can be counted , too . tree rings grow under the bark , and the bark is pushed out while the tree is growing . the inner part of a growth ring is formed early in the growing season , when growth is fast and is known as early wood . the outer portion is the late wood , and is denser than early wood . many trees in places with hot summers and cold winters make one growth ring a year . for the entire life of a tree , a year by year record or ring pattern is formed that reveals the climate conditions in which the tree grew . if a tree grows in a dry place , you can tell its age better than when it grows in a wet place . switching in between bad and good conditions can result in several rings forming in one year . tree ring growth patterns are affected by the climate , weather , rain , temperature , soil ph , plant nutrition , co2 concentration , and sunspots .
