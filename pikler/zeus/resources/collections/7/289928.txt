Catastrophism     catastrophism is the idea that earth has been affected in the past by sudden , short-lived , violent events . catastrophes , possibly worldwide in scope , came between long periods of quiet inactivity . this was called 'catastrophism ' by william whewell in 1837. catastrophes were thought to be the main cause of the changes seen in the record of the rocks and fossils . this record appeared to show that the earth had suffered occasional gigantic upheavals in what was otherwise a quiet planet . supporting this view was the greatest comparative anatomist and palaeontologist of the early 19th century . he was georges cuvier , director of the `` mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle '' in paris . cuvier had shown that extinction of species had definitely taken place . his catastrophism was an explanation for the regular changes in species seen in the rock strata . he had no real explanation of why later species were different from earlier ones . he rejected the idea of evolution , but did not propose a religious solution .
