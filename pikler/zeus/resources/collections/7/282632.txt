Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment     the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment was an experimental demonstration , reported in 1944 by oswald avery , colin macleod , and maclyn mccarty , that dna is the substance that causes bacterial transformation . this was the culmination of research in the 1930s and early 1940s at the rockefeller institute for medical research to purify and characterize the `` transforming principle '' responsible for the phenomenon first described in griffith 's experiment of 1928. in this early experiment dead `` streptococcus pneumoniae '' of the virulent strain type iii-s , when injected along with living but non-virulent type ii-r pneumococci , resulted in a deadly infection of type iii-s pneumococci . at that time it was thought protein might be the hereditary material . in their paper of 1944 , avery and his colleagues suggest that dna , rather than protein was the hereditary material of bacteria , and could be analogous to genes and/or viruses in higher organisms . this was an epoch-making experiment , but the three men did not get the nobel prize . the nobel laureate arne tiselius said that avery was the most deserving scientist not to receive the nobel prize for his work .
