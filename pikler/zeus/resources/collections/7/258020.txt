Iron(II) hydroxide    iron ( ii ) hydroxide iron ( ii ) hydroxide is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is fe ( oh ) . it has iron and hydroxide ions in it . the iron is in its +2 oxidation state . when pure , it is a white solid . it very easily turns dark green in air , which is its normal form . it then reacts with more oxygen to turn brown as iron ( iii ) oxide is formed . it is a reducing agent . it can be formed by electrolysis of water with a piece of iron metal as the anode ( positive connector ) . a green slime will appear around it , and hydrogen will be released at the cathode ( negative connector ) . it is normally made by reacting iron ( ii ) sulfate with sodium hydroxide . it was being investigated as a detoxifier in wetlands . some wetlands have toxic selenite and selenate ions in them . iron ( ii ) hydroxide reduces them to selenium , which is much less toxic . it is also used in the nickel-iron battery . related pages . - iron ( ii ) oxide - iron ( ii ) chloride
