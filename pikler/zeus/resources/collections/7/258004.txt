Laurasia     laurasia was a supercontinent . it had been the northern part of the pangaea global supercontinent . pangaea split in the jurassic into laurasia and gondwana to the south . laurasia included most of the landmasses which make up today 's continents of the northern hemisphere , chiefly laurentia ( the name given to the north american craton ) , europe , baltica , siberia , kazakhstan , and china . the name combines the names of laurentia and eurasia . although laurasia is known as a mesozoic phenomenon , today it is believed that the same continents that formed the later laurasia also existed as a coherent supercontinent after the breakup of rodinia around 1 billion years ago . to avoid confusion with the mesozoic continent , this is referred to as proto-laurasia .
