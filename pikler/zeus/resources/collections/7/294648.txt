Asphalt     asphalt , or bitumen , is a sticky , black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid , composed almost entirely of petroleum . it is present in most crude petroleums and in some natural deposits . it is the material which made the la brea tar pits . its main use is in road construction . mixed with `` aggregate '' ( sand , gravel , crushed stone , etc . ) it makes a good road surface . it has various other names : pitch , tarmac , blacktop , asphalt concrete , asphalt pavement ( us ) , all mean roughly the same thing . asphalt which is liquid is often called tar . tar is also used for plant resin . solid asphalt is often called pitch . although a block of asphalt or pitch can look like a solid , it still flows , but very slowly . there have been a few `` pitch experiments '' to see how long it takes for a drip to form and drop off a block of apparently solid pitch . related pages . - tar
