Pot-in-pot refrigerator     the pot-in-pot refrigerator , also known as a zeer in arabic , is a food cooling device . it works by using the evaporation of water . it needs no electricity . it is made by putting a clay pot inside a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top . as the water evaporates it cools the inside , letting food stored in the inner pot to be kept fresh for some time . it must be placed in a dry , ventilated place for the water to evaporate to the outside . evaporative coolers perform poorly or not at all in climates with high humidity . mohammed bah abba of nigeria patented the device in 1995 and was awarded a rolex prize in 2000 for developing the “ pot-in-pot preservation/cooling system ” . however , the device was known at least as early as the middle kingdom of egypt , as seen by the hieroglyphic kbb , `` to cool '' . earthenware wine coolers work on the same principle . they are soaked in cold water for a while , then emptied and put on the table . the pores of the earthenware are now full of water . evaporation from the earthenware keeps white wine cool enough for several hours .
