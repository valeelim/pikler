Copper(II) sulfate    copper ( ii ) sulfate copper ( ii ) sulfate , also known as cupric sulfate , copper sulfate , blue vitriol , or bluestone , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cuso . it contains copper in its +2 oxidation state . it also contains sulfate ions . it is a blue solid that can kill fungi . it is also used to purify copper metal . it is common in chemistry sets and chemistry demonstrations . copper ( ii ) sulfate is a blue solid when hydrated ( attached to water molecules ) . it is whitish when anhydrous ( not attached to water molecules ) . when hydrated , it normally has five water molecules attached to it . it can be dehydrated by heating it . when water is added to it , it gets hydrated again . when it is in air , it absorbs water vapor and becomes hydrated , too . it is a weak oxidizing agent . it reacts with most metals to make copper and a metal sulfate . for example , it reacts with iron to make copper and iron ( ii ) sulfate . it reacts with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to make copper ( ii ) hydroxide .
