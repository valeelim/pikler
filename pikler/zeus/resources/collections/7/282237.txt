Printer Command Language     the printer command language ( often shortened to pcl ) is a page description language , developed by hewlett-packard . as of 2011 , most modern printers understand pcl . its complexity is between pure ascii text , such as in esc-p , and for example postscript . there are different versions of the language . common versions : - pcl3 , pcl3+ : can use raster description of fonts , grayscale , 300 dpi output maximum - pcl3c , pcl3c+ : supports color , in addition to pcl3/pcl3+ - pcl3gui : allows compression of raster images , is not compatible with other pcl standards - pcl4 : macros , bigger bitmaps , introduction of graphics - pcl5 : supports graphics in hpgl/2 , fonts can be resized - pcl5e : supports bidirectional communication with the printer , supports the windows fonts - pcl5c : color version of pcl5e , supports different color palettes , and the option to select different colors - pcl xl later renamed to pcl6 enhanced : allows compression to increase throughput . this is a stack-based object oriented programming language similar to postscript
