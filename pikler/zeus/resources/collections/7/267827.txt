Anoxic event     anoxic events ( ae ) occur when oceans become completely depleted of oxygen ( o ) below the surface levels . they may be called oceanic anoxic events : or deep ocean anoxic events . major anoxic events have happened , though not for millions of years . the geological record of organic-rich sediment ( black shales ) shows that they happened in the past . however , only `` in rare , extreme cases , [ did ] euxinia lead to biotic crises . [ the ] hypothesis [ is ] best supported by evidence from the end-permian mass extinction '' . anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions . these mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphic dating . typically , oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years , before a full recovery . there are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level . 'dead zones ' exist off the east coast of the united states in the chesapeake bay , in the scandinavian strait kattegat , the black sea , in the northern adriatic and off the coast of louisiana .
