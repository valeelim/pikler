Nuclear fuel     nuclear fuel is a material that can be consumed to take over nuclear energy , by analogy to chemical fuel that is burned for energy . nuclear fuels are the most dense sources of energy available . most nuclear fuels contain heavy `` fissile '' elements which to undergo a nuclear fission chain reaction in a nuclear reactor . the most common nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium but not all nuclear fuels are used in reactors . some of them power radioisotope thermoelectric generators .
