Hotspot (geology)    hotspot ( geology ) in geology , a hotspot or hot spot is a portion of the earth 's surface which experiences volcanism . this may be caused by a rising mantle plume or some other cause . hotspots may be far from tectonic plate boundaries . a volcanic hotspot is where lava pushes up from under the mantle and creates a volcano . the earth 's plates move along and another volcano is created later . this creates a chain of volcanoes , such as in hawaii . most volcanoes are explained by the collision or splitting apart of continental plates . this explains the long mountain ranges which have many volcanoes , such as the western edge of the americas . it also explains the huge rift valleys such as the east african rift valley . most earth scientists accept that the cause of these great features is plate tectonics . the problem arises with volcanoes which are not at the edges of plates . in the united states , the yellowstone caldera is obviously active . it has geysers caused by constant geothermal energy activity , and the floor of the crater moves up and down as much as 50 meters in a few years . the pacific ocean has six or seven chains of islands formed by volcanic activity . most of these can not be explained simply as being on the edge of two or three plates .
