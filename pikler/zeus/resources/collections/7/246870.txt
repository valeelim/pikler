Vetus Latina     vetus latina is the name given to a collection of biblical texts that were translated into latin before the vulgate became the standard version used in the latin-speaking world . the texts themselves are written in late latin , not in old latin . they often use different words than the vulgate . no complete manuscript survives , only fragments are known . many text passages are known because church fathers such as augustine of hippo cited from them . since the council of trent , held in the 16th century , the vulgate is the official bible translation for the roman catholic church . some of the vetus latin texts survives in the liturgy , however : the old latin text means , `` glory [ belongs ] to god among the high , and peace [ belongs ] to men of good will on earth '' . the vulgate text means `` glory [ belongs ] to god among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth '' . probably the best known difference between the old latin and the vulgate is in the pater noster , where the phrase from the vetus latina , `` quotidianum panem '' , `` daily bread '' , becomes `` supersubstantialem panem '' , `` supersubstantial bread '' in the vulgate .
