Tuff     tuff ( from italian `` tufo '' ) is a type of rock produced by the eruption of volcanoes . it consists of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic eruption . rock with more than 50 % tuff is called `` tuffaceous '' . the chemical and mineral composition of tuff varies according to what was in the molten magma . in a volcanic eruption , magma is blown apart by volcanic gases and steam . the products are volcanic gases , lava , steam , and tephra ( fragments ) . the solid material produced and thrown into the air is called `` tephra '' , regardless of composition or fragment size . if the pieces of ejecta are small , the material is called volcanic ash , defined as such particles less than 2 mm in diameter , sand-sized or smaller . these particles are small , slaggy pieces of magma and rock that have been tossed into the air by outbursts of steam and other gases . among the loose beds of ash that cover the slopes of many volcanoes , three classes of materials are represented . 1. true ashes of the kind described above .
