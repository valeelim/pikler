Alternative splicing     alternative splicing allows dna to code for more than one protein . it varies the exon make-up of the messenger rna . in alternative splicing the exons of the pre-messenger rna produced by transcription are reconnected in different ways during rna splicing . this produces different mature messenger rnas from the same gene . they get translated into different proteins . thus , a single gene may code for multiple proteins . alternative splicing is normal in eukaryotes . it greatly increases the diversity of proteins that can be encoded by the genome . in humans , ~95 % of multiexonic genes are alternatively spliced . there are various kinds of alternative splicing : the most common is exon skipping . an exon may be included in mrnas under some conditions or in particular tissues , and omitted from the mrna in others . there are splicing activators that promote the use of a particular splice site , and splicing repressors that reduce the use of a particular site . new types of alternative splicing are being found .
