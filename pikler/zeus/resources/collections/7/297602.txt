Balancing selection     balancing selection refers to selective processes by which different alleles ( different versions of a gene ) are kept in the gene pool of a population `` at frequencies above that of gene mutation '' . this usually happens when the heterozygote for a gene has a higher relative fitness than the homozygote . in this way genetic polymorphism is conserved . evidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies . all modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is common in panmictic populations . it is the field experience of darwin , wallace and others , that natural populations in the wild are extraordinarily varied . museum collections of single species tell the same story . there are several ways balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism . the two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection . in heterozygote advantage , or `` heterotic balancing selection '' , an individual who is heterozygous at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness than a homozygous individual . polymorphisms maintained by this mechanism are `` balanced polymorphisms '' .
