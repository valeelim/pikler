Crystallography     crystallography is the study of the arrangement of atoms in solids . before the development of x-ray crystallography , the study of crystals was based on their geometry . this involves measuring the angles of crystal faces , and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question . crystal structure is now found by analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type . the technique was jointly invented by sir william bragg ( 1862–1942 ) and his son sir lawrence bragg ( 1890–1971 ) , who jointly won the nobel prize in physics for 1915. lawrence bragg was the youngest to become a nobel laureate . he was the director of the cavendish laboratory , cambridge university , when the discovery of the structure of dna was made by james d. watson and francis crick in february 1953. x-rays are most commonly used , but for some purposes electrons or neutrons are used . because of the different forms of interaction , the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies .
