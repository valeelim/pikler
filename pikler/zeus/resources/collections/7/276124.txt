Arsenic pentoxide     arsenic pentoxide , also known as arsenic ( v ) oxide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is aso . it has arsenic and oxide ions in it . the arsenic is in its +5 oxidation state . more common is arsen in its oxidation state +3 as aso ( arsenic trioxide or arsenic ( iii ) oxide ) . the ld50 for arsenic pentoxide is 8mg/kg for rats . when the substance becomes wet , it turns into arsenic acid , which corrodes metals . arsenic pentoxide is a white , odourless solid . it dissolves easily in water to make arsenic acid . it is highly toxic , as are almost all arsenic compounds . it is a powerful oxidizing agent . it reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine . aso breaks down to arsenic trioxide and oxygen when heated to about 300Â°c . it reacts with bases to make arsenates . the energy for the reaction is taken from the heating . arsenic pentoxide can not be produced by burning arsen . that only results in aso . to produce arsenic pentoxid , arsenic acid will be dehydrated . this is done with phosphorus ( v ) oxide .
