Anna Freud     anna freud ( 3 december 1895 â€“ 9 october 1982 ) was the sixth and last child of sigmund freud and his wife martha bernays freud . she was born in vienna . she followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis . with melanie klein , she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology . as her father put it , child analysis had received a powerful impetus through `` the work of frau melanie klein and of my daughter , anna freud '' . her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially . after a somewhat troubled childhood , anna was psychoanalysed by her father . when her analysis was completed in 1922 , she became a psychoanalyist herself . she taught at the vienna psychoanalytic training institute on the technique of child analysis . from 1925 until 1934 , she was the secretary of the international psychoanalytical association . she continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject . after the anschluss in 1938 the freuds fled vienna and came to london . freud himself was dying of cancer , so anna ran the household . anna had a professional disagreement with melanie klein , who had come to london much earlier , and was already established as a child psychologist . a series of 'controversial discussions ' were held by the british psychoanalytical society . the discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties . eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools ' should co-exist inside the society . the society now has three training divisions : kleinian , freudian and independent .
