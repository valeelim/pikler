List of European dinosaurs     dinosaurs evolved partway through the triassic period of the mesozoic era , around 230 ma ( million years ago ) . at that time , the earth had one supercontinental landmass , called pangaea , of which europe was a part . so it remained throughout the triassic . by the start of the jurassic period , some 30 million years later , the supercontinent began to split into laurasia and gondwana . the largest inlet from panthalassa , the superocean that surrounded pangaea , was called the tethys ocean , and as this inlet cut deeper into the supercontinent , much of europe was flooded . by the cretaceous , from 145 to 65 million years ago , the continents were beginning to approach their present shapes , but not their present positions , and europe remained tropical . at times , it was a chain of island-microcontinents including baltica and iberia . europe is relatively rich in fossils from the jurassic-cretaceous boundary , and much of what is known about european dinosaurs dates from this time . as the timeline below illustrates , there are substantial gaps in our knowledge from the rest of the mesozoic . the absence of dinosaur genera from this time is because few fossils have been discovered , and almost certainly not because europe contained few types of dinosaur—except , perhaps , immediately after the triassic–jurassic extinction event .
