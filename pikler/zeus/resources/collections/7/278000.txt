Air navigation     air navigation is navigation while flying . it is used by pilots in aircraft to know their exact position and fond their way . that is important because if they get lost , they can hit a mountain or fly into a dangerous area or not find a place to land . there are generally two types of air navigation depending on weather . in good weather , pilots navigate themselves visually with maps . but when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground , they use special radio navigational instruments or the air traffic controller navigates them . the first kind of navigation is called vfr ( visual flight rules ) navigation . the second is ifr ( instrument flight rules ) navigation . under visual flight rules , pilots use a map and compass , and look on the ground . when preparing for a flight they choose big visible points on the map , for example large cities , lakes , hills , rivers , roads or forests . when in the air , they seek the chosen points to make sure of going the right way way . the weather must be good enough to let them see the ground . they can not fly into clouds , because they can get lost . pilots also have to look for other aircraft . it is their responsibility to make sure they do not get too close to other aircraft . this is called `` see and avoid '' .
