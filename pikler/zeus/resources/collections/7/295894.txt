Fraternities and sororities     fraternities and sororities are social groups for college students , though sometimes high schools have them too . they exist mostly in the united states and europe . the words `` frater '' and `` soror '' are latin for `` brother '' and `` sister '' and used to show closeness between members . they also denote whether the group is for men or women . sororities are only for women . fraternities are primarily for men , but less often , a fraternity can be for both men and women . fraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools . each fraternity or sorority is given two or three greek letters to call themselves , for example , αφ ( alpha phi ) or αχω ( alpha chi omega ) . to tell the difference between groups at different schools , called chapters , each chapter is given another set of greek letters . for example , a man in the kappa sigma fraternity who goes to the university of louisiana at lafayette is part of the fraternity 's ex ( epsilon chi ) chapter . chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in .
