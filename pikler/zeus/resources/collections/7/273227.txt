Pointillism     pointillism is a way of painting in which small separate dots of pure color are used to form images . the artist paints the picture with hundreds of tiny dots , mainly of red , yellow , blue and green , with white . the eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours , as well as orange , purple , pink , and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged . georges seurat , at first an impressionist painter , and paul signac , developed this technique in 1886. other important artists were camille pissarro and , in some paintings , vincent van gogh . art critics who saw their work , laughed at it and called it `` pointillism '' as an insult . this name is still used , but is no longer thought of as an insult . traditionally , artists blend pigments ( mix colours ) on a palette . pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all they just use the colours straight from the tube . traditional painters , and also impressionist painters , use many types of brushstrokes , and many textures of paint . the surface of the painting may have flat colour , lines , squiggles and dabs of paint . in a pointillist painting , every part of the picture is done in tiny dots , and most of the dots are about the same size . pointillism is usually done in oil paints , because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas .
