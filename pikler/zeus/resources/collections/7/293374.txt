Sparassodont     the sparassodonts were an order of carnivorous metatherian mammals . they are all now extinct . the sparassodonta is native to south america . they were once considered to be true marsupials , but are now thought to be a sister taxon to them . a number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately in eurasia . they were first described by florentino ameghino , from fossils found in the santa cruz beds of patagonia . members of the order sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental carnivora , but they were not closely related . they are a very good example of convergent evolution . for example , sparassodont molars were similar to the meat slicing teeth of modern cats . the canines were also lengthened , and in some cases , such as `` thylacosmilus '' , resemble those of saber-toothed cats like `` smilodon '' . their body size varied , ranging from 80 cm ( 2 ft 8 in ) long to the size of today 's modern big cats . another family of large predators wrere the borhyaenids , which were more like wolves or dogs .
