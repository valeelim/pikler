Šumadija    šumadija šumadija ( serbian cyrillic : шумадија ) is a geographical region in serbia . the area was heavily forested , hence the name ( `` šuma '' - forest ) . the city of kragujevac is the center of the region , and the administrative center of the šumadija district in central serbia . šumadija is located between rivers sava and danube in the north , river velika morava in the east , river zapadna morava in the south , and kolubara , ljig and dičina in the west . according to some interpretations ( for example , physiologists such as jovan cvijić and ethnologist such as erdeljanović . ) , the northern border of šumadija lay between avala and kosmaj mountain . according to that view , the capital of serbia , belgrade does not belong to this region . during the 18th century , the forests of šumadija were the refuge for the hajduks that fought against ottoman occupation . the first serbian uprising in 1804 was led by national hero karađorđe . the second serbian uprising in 1815 was led by miloš obrenović who successfully repelled the turkish forces and , by 1830 , serbia had gained its full autonomy . because of miloš 's efforts and negotiations serbia was finally an independent state , after centuries under ottoman reign .
