Solnhofen limestone     the solnhofen limestone is the world 's most famous fossil site . it is a lagerstätte of upper jurassic limestone which has preserved many fossils in great detail . the specimens of `` archaeopteryx '' are perhaps the world 's most valuable fossils , because they are the earliest fossils of a bird capable of flight . the solnhofen beds lie in the german state of bavaria ( bayern ) , halfway between nuremberg ( nürnberg ) and munich ( münchen ) . they were originally quarried as a source of roof and floor tiles , then for lithographic printing . in the late jurassic this area was an archipelago at the edge of the tethys sea . this included placid lagoons which had limited access to the open sea because they were surrounded by coral reefs . water runoff from the land was low and , under the sun , evaporation was high . salinity rose so high that the resulting brine could not support life , except at the top of the water column . the lowest water was not only very salty , but hypoxic : very low in oxygen . this was caused by the lack of water mixing . many ordinary scavengers were absent from the lagoon floor . from the condition of the water , it follows that almost all of the fossilised animals were not living in the lagoon . they must have lived on land , in the air , or out to sea beyond the reef . then when they died , they fell , drifted , or were washed into the lagoons from the air , ocean or land . occasional storms at sea would have killed flying animals , and swept fish over the reef in a suspension of finely-dispersed lime . there the bodies sank into the dead zone and were preserved .
