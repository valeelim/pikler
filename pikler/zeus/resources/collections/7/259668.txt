Excretion     excretion is one of the most basic functions of life . it is the process of eliminating waste products of metabolism and other non-useful materials . it is an essential process in all forms of life . it contrasts with secretion , where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell . in single-celled organisms , waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell . multicellular organisms use more complex methods . higher plants eliminate gases through the stomata on the surface of leaves . animals have special excretory organs . in mammals , excretion is the formation of urine in the kidneys , and expelling carbon dioxide from the lungs . these waste products are eliminated by urination and breathing out respectively . if excretion does not occur in an organism , waste products accumulate , which eventually kill the organism . also , food waste is expelled through the anus . other substances are secreted into the bile , and then eliminated in the faeces . the skin and lungs also have excretory functions : the skin eliminates metabolic wastes like urea and lactic acid through sweating , and the lungs expel carbon dioxide .
