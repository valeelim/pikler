Pythagorean triple     in mathematics , a pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers which satisfy the equation ( make the equation work ) : this equation is known as the diophantine equation , and is related to pythagoras ' theorem . the lowest pythagorean triple is [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] because : the next highest triple is [ 5 , 12 , 13 ] then [ 7 , 24 , 25 ] , and so on . there is an infinite number of pythagorean triples . a pythagorean triple always consists of : • all even numbers , or • two odd numbers and an even number . a pythagorean triple can never be made up of all odd numbers or two even numbers and one odd number .
