Bitcoin     bitcoin is a digital and global money system ( currency ) . it allows people to send or receive money across the internet , even to someone they do n't know or do n't trust . money can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity . the mathematical field of cryptography is the basis for bitcoin 's security . one of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having to link any sort of real-world identity to it . unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address , it is hard to tell who owns the address . bitcoin does not keep track of users ; it keeps track of addresses where the money is . each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information , or keys : a public one and a private one . the public key , which is what the `` bitcoin address '' is created from , is similar to an email address ; anyone can look it up and send bitcoins to it . the private address , or private key , is similar to an email password ; only with it can the owner send bitcoins from it . because of this , it is very important that this private key is kept secret . to send bitcoins from an address , you prove to the network that you own the private key that corresponds to the address , without revealing the private key . this is done with a branch of mathematics known as public key cryptography .
