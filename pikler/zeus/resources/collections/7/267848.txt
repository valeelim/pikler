Siberian Traps     the siberian traps form a large region of volcanic rock , known as a large igneous province , in the russian region of siberia . the large eruptions which formed the traps were one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500 million years of earth history . they continued for a million years and spanned the permian-triassic boundary , about 251 to 250 million years ago . it was the same time as the permian–triassic extinction event , which is estimated to have killed 90 % of species existing at the time . the eruption of the siberian traps is a possible cause of this `` great dying '' . the term `` traps '' is derived from the swedish word for stairs ( `` trappa '' , or sometimes `` trapp '' ) , referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region , which is typical of flood basalts . vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large expanse of primaeval siberia in a flood basalt event . today the area covered is about 2 million km² – roughly equal to western europe in land area – and estimates of the original coverage are as high as 7 million km² . the original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4 million km³ .
