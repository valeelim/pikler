Elaphrosaurus     elaphrosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the upper jurassic period , about 150 million years ago . it was 15 feet long , and weighed 450 pounds . `` elaphrosaurus '' was a slender , fast , and agile predator that probably preyed on small ornithopods , such as `` dryosaurus '' . the type specimen was found in the tendaguru formation in tanzania . it was a nearly complete skeleton , but unfortunately , it lacked a skull . since its body was similar to ornithomimids , it was originally thought to be the earliest ornithomimid . however , later studies showed that it is actually a ceratosaur . there is one named species , `` elaphrosaurus bambergi '' . remains very similar to it have also been found in the morrison formation in the western united states . these may possibly belong to `` elaphrosaurus '' , indicating that this dinosaur had a wider range than previously thought .
