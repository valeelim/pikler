Ring of Steel (London)    ring of steel ( london ) ring of steel is the name people use for the security cordon around the city of london . its purpose is to prevent terrorism . it was designed during the ira 'troubles ' . the city of belfast was the first to get a `` ring of steel '' . roads entering the city are narrowed and have small chicanes to force drivers to slow down and be recorded by cctv cameras . these roads have a concrete median with a sentry box where police can stand guard and monitor traffic . tucked away out of sight may be police armed with submachine guns . city planners call these precautions 'fortress urbanism ' . some roads have been closed to traffic entirely . despite the term 'ring of steel ' , the roadblocks and chicanes are actually created with concrete blocks , sometimes plastic coated , that are wedged together . the measures were introduced following a massive ira bombing campaign in the city in the early 1990s such as the 1992 baltic exchange bombing and the 1993 bishopsgate bombing . at this time the sentry posts were guarded by armed police almost continuously . initially the ring of steel consisted of plastic cones and on duty policemen which the locals described as the 'ring of plastic ' . it showed the public that the city authorities were taking seriously the threats by the ira . this was replaced by more permanent structures consisting of concrete barriers , checkpoints and thousands of video cameras . after the ira ceasefire the police guard was reduced .
