Protocarnivorous plant     a protocarnivorous plant is a plant that traps small animals ( usually insects and arthropods ) much like carnivorous plants do . unlike carnivorous plants , these plants can not get the nutritients from the trapped prey , though . the mechanisms of trapping are very similar to those developed by carnivorous plants . the problem is also one of definitions , as people do not agree what makes a `` carnivorous plant '' .
