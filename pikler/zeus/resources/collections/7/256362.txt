Macrophage     macrophages are white blood cells within tissues , produced by the differentiation of monocytes . monocytes and macrophages are phagocytes , acting in general immunity . they also trigger specific defense mechanisms ( adaptive immunity ) of vertebrates . their role is to phagocytose ( engulf and then digest ) cellular debris and pathogens either as stationary or as mobile cells . they also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to the pathogen . when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the wall of a blood vessel it changes to become a macrophage . monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances , triggered by a range of stimuli . at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation . unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months .
