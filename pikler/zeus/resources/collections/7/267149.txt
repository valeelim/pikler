Christianity and alcohol     christianity and its beliefs about alcohol have changed since christianity was started about 2,000 years ago . wine has always been important in christianity . christians believe that jesus turned water into wine at a wedding where there was not enough to drink ( see the picture at the right ) . the bible says that wine was also important at the last supper - the last time jesus ate with his disciples before he was arrested . the bible 's gospel of matthew 26:27 says that jesus held up a cup of wine and told all of his disciples : `` '' take this [ cup ] all of you and drink from it . this is the cup of my blood ... my blood will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven . '' '' since that time , roman catholic church services have always included something called the eucharist ( also called `` holy communion '' ) . a priest holds up a cup of wine and says a prayer . at that point , catholics believe the wine is turned into jesus 's blood . they believe drinking the wine is a way of remembering that jesus was willing to die so their sins would be forgiven .
