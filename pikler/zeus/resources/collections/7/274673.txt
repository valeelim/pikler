NMR spectroscopy     nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) spectroscopy is a type of spectroscopy that allows chemists to see the structure of a molecule . certain atoms ' nuclei have certain magnetic properties when in a strong magnetic field . atoms like carbon , hydrogen , and fluorine can be detected in this way . a chemical sample is prepared by placing a tiny amount of the sample in an nmr tube . it is dissolved in a special solvent like heavy water ( see deuterium ) or chloroform-d , then the tube is placed into the nmr machine . the machine is a large magnet , like an mri . some atoms in the sample will become excited when it is in the magnet , and when the sample is removed , the atoms will go back to a lower energy state . a computer connected to the nmr can detect this change in excitement and it will cause different peaks and bumps to appear on the nmr diagram . a chemist can print this diagram and study the various peaks . most nmr machines can only detect excitement from one type of atom . for example , an h nmr can only `` see '' hydrogen atoms . a c nmr can only see activity from carbon atoms .
