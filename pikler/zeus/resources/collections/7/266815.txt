Weak acid     a weak acid is an acid chemical which does not dissociate ( split into ions ) completely when in a water solution . this means it does not give all its hydrogen ions into the water . weak acids typically have a ph between 3 and 6. acetic acid ( chcooh ) and oxalic acid ( hco ) are examples of weak acids . if an acid is represented by ha , then there is a balance between molecules which are split ( ionised ) , and molecules which are not :
