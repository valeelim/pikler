Muslim Brotherhood     the `` al ikhwan el muslimeen '' , the society of the muslim brothers , often called the muslim brotherhood , or the brotherhood , is an islamist movement . today , it exists in many states and often is one of the largest political opposition groups . the group is the world 's oldest and largest islamic political group , and the `` world 's most influential islamist movement '' . hassan al-banna founded the group in egypt in 1928. the brotherhood 's stated goal is to instill the qur'an and sunnah as the `` sole reference point for ... ordering the life of the muslim family , individual , community ... and state '' . since it was created , in 1928 the movement has officially opposed violent means to achieve its goals , with some exceptions such as in the israeli-palestinian conflict or to overthrow secular ba'athist rule in syria ( see hama massacre ) . this position has been questioned , particularly by the egyptian government , which accused the group of a campaign of killings in egypt after world war ii .
