Monocyte     monocytes are a type of white blood cell , part of the human body 's immune system . they are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed nucleus . they are a kind of reserve cell which turn into macrophages and immune helper cells called dendritic cells . monocytes work at two speeds in the immune system : 1. to gradually replenish resident macrophages and dendritic cells under normal conditions , and 1. to move quickly ( ~ 8-12 hours ) to infected tissue in response to inflammation signals . there they divide and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells to cause an immune response . half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the spleen ; the rest are circulating or in tissues . monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called `` monoblasts '' . monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body . they make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood .
