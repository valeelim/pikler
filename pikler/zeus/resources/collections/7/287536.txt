Tsunami protection engineering     tsunami protection engineering is intended to prevent or mitigate possible tsunami damage and save lives . the best method of protection seems to be the use of seawalls in front of ports and cities . another effective method from a tsunami is proper planting trees . some villages in india , for example , had minimal casualties in the 2004 tsunami because they had planted trees along the coastline . tsunami protection engineering should also foresee and prevent situations like one that happened at fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant when the main power went down , backup generators failed and cooling water could not get to the nuclear fuel . the overheating that followed led to explosions , fires and dangerous release of radiation .
