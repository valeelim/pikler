Enthalpy of fusion     enthalpy of fusion is the measure of the energy needed to change a substance from a solid to a liquid . extra energy is needed , more than what is obvious by the temperature scale . for example , ice at 0°c needs to absorb heat before it converts ( changes ) to water at 0°c . the temperature does not change , but energy is absorbed to change from solid to liquid . related pages . - enthalpy of vaporization
