Siltstone     a siltstone is a mudrock . for a rock to be a siltstone , it must be over fifty percent silt-sized material . silt is any particle smaller than sand , 1/16 of a millimeter ( ~0.06 mm ) , and larger than clay , 1/256 ( ~0.004 mm ) of millimeter . silt is the product of physical weathering , such as freezing and thawing . physical weathering does not involve any chemical changes in the rock , just its physical breaking apart . one of the highest proportions of silt found on earth is in the himalayas , which get rainfall of up to five to ten meters ( 16 to 33 feet ) a year . quartz and feldspar are the biggest contributors to silt . silt tends to be non-cohesive , non-plastic , but can liquefy easily . there is a simple field test to judge whether a rock is a siltstone or not , and that is to put the rock to one 's teeth . if the rock feels `` gritty '' against one 's teeth , than it is a siltstone . references . - folk , r.l. , 1965 , `` petrology of sedimentary rocks '' pdf version . austin : hemphill â€™ s bookstore . 2nd ed . 1981. isbn 0-914696-14-9
