Plasmodium     plasmodium , commonly known as the malaria parasite , is a large genus of parasitic protozoa . there are about 200 species . infection with these protozoans is called malaria , a deadly disease widespread in the tropics . the parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle : a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host . the life-cycle is very complex . there is a sequence of different stages in the vector and the host . these stages include : 1. sporozoites which are injected by the mosquito vector into the host 's blood ; 1. hypnozoites which may rest undetected in the liver for up to 30 years ; 1. merosomes and merozoites which infect the red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) of the blood ; 1. trophozoites which grow in the red cells , and schizonts which divide there , producing more merozoites which leave to infect more red cells ; 1. gametocytes , male and female sexual forms , which are taken up by other mosquitoes . in the mosquito 's midgut , the gametocytes develop into 1. gametes which fertilize each other to form motile
