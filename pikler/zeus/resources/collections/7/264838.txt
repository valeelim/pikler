Statistical process control     statistical process control ( spc ) is the use of statistical methods to assess the stability of a process and the quality of its outputs . for example , consider a bottling plant . the entire system of production that produces filled bottles is termed a `` process '' . suppose the weight of liquid content added to a bottle is critical for cost control and customer satisfaction . the content should weigh 250 grams , but it is acceptable if the actual weight is between 245 and 255 grams . `` monitoring '' means that the weight of every bottle is measured and recorded ; sampling means that only a few bottles ( say one in a thousand ) are actually weighed ( analysis to determine the rate of sampling and to assess sample representativeness is a well-established part of spc . ) spc relies on quantitative and graphic analysis of measurements to evaluate observed variation . if the attributes of interest ( content weight in this example ) vary within an acceptable range , a process is said to be `` in control , '' `` in statistical control , '' or `` stable . '' when unacceptable variation is noted , actions are typically taken to determine and correct their cause . in the bottling example , suppose too many bottles are filled with less than 245 grams . checking the plant equipment reveals that one of ten filler valves is malfunctioning .
