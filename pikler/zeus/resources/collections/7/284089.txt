DNA construct     a dna construct is an artificially constructed segment of nucleic acid which is going to be 'transplanted ' into a target tissue or cell . it often contains a dna insert , which contains the gene sequence encoding a protein of interest . the dna insert has been subcloned into a molecular biology vector . a dna construct may express wildtype protein , or prevent the expression of certain genes by expressing competitors or inhibitors . it may express mutant proteins , such as deletion mutations or missense mutations . a dna construct is often used in molecular biology to analyze macromolecules such as proteins or rna in more detail . a molecular biology vector is a dna molecule used as a vehicle to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell . the main types of vectors are plasmids , bacteriophages and other viruses , and artificial chromosomes . common to all engineered vectors are an origin of replication , a multicloning site , and a selectable marker . the vector itself is generally a dna sequence that consists of an insert ( transgene ) and a larger sequence that serves as the 'backbone ' of the vector . the backbone will include bacterial resistance genes for growth in bacteria , and promoters for expression in the organism .
