Sun King (song)    sun king ( song ) `` sun king '' is a song written by john lennon but credited to lennon/mccartney and recorded by the beatles for their `` abbey road '' album . the working title was `` here comes the sun king '' , but was shortened to `` sun king '' to avoid confusion with the song `` here comes the sun '' . the song is in three-part harmony , sung by lennon , paul mccartney , and harrison . at the end of the song , the music stops abruptly and a ringo starr drum fill leads into the next track , `` mean mr. mustard '' . the mixing of romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song . in 1969 , lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said , `` we just started joking , you know , singing 'cuando para mucho . ' so we just made up ... paul knew a few spanish words from school , you know . so we just strung any spanish words that sounded vaguely like something . and of course we got 'chicka ferdy ' in . that 's a liverpool expression . just like sort of -- it does n't mean anything to me but ( childish taunting ) 'na-na , na-na-na !
