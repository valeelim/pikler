Cladocera     cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas . around 620 species have been recognised so far , with many more undescribed . they are everywhere in inland aquatic habitats , but rare in the oceans . most are long , with a down-turned head , and a carapace covering the thorax and abdomen . there is a single median compound eye . they swim with jerking flea-like movements . most species show cyclical parthenogenesis , where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction . the sexual reproduction produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats .
