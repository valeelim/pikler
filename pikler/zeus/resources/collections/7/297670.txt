Photomultiplier tubes     a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) is a transducer which converts photons into electrons , which generate a current and voltage . photomultiplier tubes are used to detect low levels of incident light , even as low as a single photon . an incoming photon will strike the photocathode surface of the pmt which will emit electrons . these electrons are then accelerated toward additional electrodes by a potential difference of about 90 volts . upon striking this electrode , more electrons are emitted . this process repeats nine times , each time generating more and more electrons . this process can generate 10 to 10 electrons for each individual photon . these electrons are then collected at the anode where the current and voltage is then measured . photomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive and have very quick response times . the sensitivity of the pmt can be improved by cooling it , to reduce temperature induced noise . photomultiplier tubes must not be exposed to intense light , such as the sun or ambient light because the intensity can damage the components .
