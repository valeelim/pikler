Film processing     photographic film is able to record images . in order to make these images visible , the film needs to undergo a number of chemical processes . the result of these processes will either be negatives or slides . this is generally known as `` developing '' . different films need different processes . the process for black and white film is different from that for slide film . in general , the provess involves the following steps : - making the image visible . the chemicals to do this are known as developer . - making the visible image fixed , so it changes no longer . there are different kinds of films . the most common of these is negative film . with negative film , all colors are reversed . this is corrected in an additional step of making a `` print '' of each image . so called reversal film , which is used for diapositives directly produces `` positive '' images ( which are `` framed '' to become a `` diapositive '' ) . this whole process is known as film processing .
