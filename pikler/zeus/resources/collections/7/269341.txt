Higgs field     the higgs field is an energy field that is thought to exist everywhere in the universe . the field is accompanied by a fundamental particle called the higgs boson , which the field uses to continuously interact with other particles . as particles pass through the field they are `` given '' mass and , similar to an object passing through treacle ( or molasses ) , will become slower , and can not travel at the speed of light because they have mass . mass itself is not generated by the higgs field : the creation of matter or energy would conflict with the laws of conservation . however , mass is `` given '' to particles from the higgs field via the higgs bosons , which contain the relative mass in the form of energy . once the field has endowed a formerly massless particle the particle slows down because it has become heavier . if the higgs field did not exist , particles would not have the mass required to attract one another , and would float around freely at light speed . also gravity would not exist because mass would not be there to attract other mass .
