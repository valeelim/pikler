Sauerkraut     sauerkraut ( `` sour herb '' ) directly translated from german or `` sour cabbage '' , is finely shredded cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria , including `` leuconostoc '' , `` lactobacillus '' , and `` pediococcus '' . it has a long shelf-life and a distinctive sour flavor , both of which result from the lactic acid that forms when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage . it is therefore not to be confused with coleslaw , which receives its acidic taste from vinegar . it has its roots in cole flower marinated in honey and fluid from your belly .
