Banach–Tarski paradox     banach–tarski paradox is a theorem in mathematics that says that any solid shape can be reassembled into any other solid shape . for example , a sphere can be split up into a limited number of parts which can then be put back together again to make two identical copies of the original sphere . the banach-tarski paradox can also be used to turn a small sphere into a huge sphere . it is important when thinking about this to realize that the parts that the solid shape is being split into are not solid shapes themselves ; they are infinite sets of points spread around the solid shape . for the banach-tarski paradox to work , you need to use the axiom of choice . the reason this is called a paradox is because no stretching or bending of the parts takes place and no new material is added yet by the end the volume can be doubled . this goes against our geometric intuition . however , it is mathematically possible and it turns out that in this case our intuition is not correct .
