Constitution of Australia     the constitution of australia is the laws that set up the australian commonwealth government and the way it works . it is made up of several documents . the most important is the constitution of the commonwealth of australia . the people of australia voted in referendums from 1898â€“1900 to accept the constitution . the constitution was then passed as a part of the commonwealth of australia constitution act 1900 ( imp ) , an act of the parliament of the united kingdom . queen victoria signed it on 9 july 1900. the constitution became law on 1 january 1901. even though the constitution was an act of the united kingdom parliament , the australia acts took away the power of the united kingdom parliament to change the constitution . now only the australian people can change it by referendum . two other laws support the australian constitution . the first is the statute of westminster , as passed by the commonwealth as the `` statute of westminster adoption act 1942 . '' the second is the `` australia act 1986 '' , which was passed by the parliaments of every australian state , the united kingdom , and the australian federal parliament . together , these acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between australia and the united kingdom . even though the same person , queen elizabeth ii , is the monarch of both countries , these are now separate countries .
