Lactase     lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose , breaking it down so it can be digested . mammals in their infancy usually make lactase : they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother 's milk . mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase . thus , if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea . humans are somewhat different . some humans continue to produce lactase , and some do not . it is a type of polymorphism . the ability to digest lactose into adulthood ( 'lactase persistence ' ) was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry . this created a system providing a consistent supply of milk . hunter-gatherer populations before the neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant . so are modern hunter-gatherers . a mutation on chromosome # 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production , making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk ( and eating other dairy products ) throughout their lives . this appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption . it has occurred independently in both northern europe and east africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle . lactase persistence , allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood , is a dominant allele , making lactose intolerance a recessive trait .
