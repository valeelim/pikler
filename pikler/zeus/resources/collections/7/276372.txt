Confuciusornis     confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the lower cretaceous . it was found in the yixian and jiufotang formations of china , dating from 125 to 120 million years ago . the bird was named after the chinese moral philosopher confucius ( 551â€“479 bc ) . like modern birds , `` confuciusornis '' had a toothless beak , but close relatives of modern birds such as `` hesperornis '' and `` ichthyornis '' were toothed . this shows that the loss of teeth occurred more than once , in `` confuciusornis '' and in ancestors of modern birds . this is an example of convergent evolution . `` confuciusornis '' is the oldest known bird to have a beak . it is also the first known bird to have lost the long tail of `` archaeopteryx '' and develop fused tail vertebrae ( a pygostyle ) . `` confuciusornis '' is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the yixian formation , and `` several hundred '' complete , articulated specimens have been found . the proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching , while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing . the head probably had a small crest or tuft .
