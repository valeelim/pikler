Drosera regia     drosera regia , also known as the king sundew , is a carnivorous plant of the sundew family . in the wild , it only grows in two places in a single valley in south africa . its leaves can grow to a size of 70 cm in length . it also has features which are not found in many other sundews , such as wooded rhizomes and special covered pollen . these features have been combined with a genetic analysis , and it was found that `` d. regia '' is among the older species of sundew . the venus flytrap , another carnivorous plant , shares some of the features , which suggests a close relationship between the two . the leaves of the plant are covered with tentacles . they are able to capture large prey , such as beetles , moths and butterflies . the tentacles of all `` drosera '' species are specialized glands , capable of producing sticky mucus . the leaves are active flypaper traps : they capture prey by surrounding it . in its native habitat , the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs . there are two known populations of the plant in the wild . the higher-altitude site is overgrown , and `` d. regia '' no longer grows there . on the lower-altitude site , there are about 50 mature plants . for this reason , `` d. regia '' is the most endangered `` drosera '' species , since it is threatened with extinction in the wild . it is often grown by people who like carnivorous plants and a single cultivar , `` big easy '' , has been registered .
