Claude Bernard     claude bernard ( 12 july 1813 – 10 february 1878 ) was a french physiologist . he has been called `` one of the greatest of all men of science '' . he was one of the first to suggest blind experiments to get scientific observations more free of bias . he was the first to define the term `` milieu interieur '' , which is now known as homeostasis , a later term coined by walter cannon . bernard made animal experimentation a part of the standard scientific method . he famously wrote in 1865 that `` the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lit hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen '' . he was born in 1813 in saint-julien near villefranche-sur-saône . he wrote comedies and other plays . when he was 21 he went to paris with his play and went to a critic . but the critic suggested for him to study medicine instead of literature . in 1845 bernard married françoise marie ( fanny ) martin for her money . her money helped him in his experiments , but she was firmly against his methods , and founded the first french society for anti-vivisectionists . when he died bernard was given a public funeral . this was something which had never been given by france to a man of science before .
