Stile     a stile is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the countryside . where there is a footpath ( a right of way ) which goes through a field with animals , there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field . the stile is there instead of a gate . if there were a gate and there were animals in the field , the animals could escape if the gate were left open . stiles are , of course , a problem for people who are disabled . there are many stiles in the countryside in the united kingdom . another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a kissing gate . related pages . - turnstile - kissing gate - cattle grid
