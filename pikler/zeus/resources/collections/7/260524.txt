Phosphoric acid     phosphoric acid , also known as orthophosphoric acid , is a chemical compound . it is also an acid . its chemical formula is hpo . it contains hydrogen and phosphate ions . its official iupac name is trihydroxidooxidophosphorus . phosphoric acid is a white solid . it melts easily to make a viscous liquid . it tastes sour when diluted ( mixed with a lot of water ) . it can be deprotonated three times . it is very strong , although not as much as the other acids like hydrochloric acid . it does not have any odor . it is corrosive when concentrated . salts of phosphoric acid are called phosphates . phosphoric acid can be made by dissolving phosphorus ( v ) oxide in water . this makes a very pure phosphoric acid that is good for food . a less pure form is made by reacting sulfuric acid with phosphate rock . this can be purified to make food-grade phosphoric acid if needed . it is used to make sodas sour . it is also used when a nonreactive acid is needed . it can be used to make hydrogen halides , such as hydrogen chloride . phosphoric acid is heated with a sodium halide to make the hydrogen halide and sodium phosphate . it is used to react with rust to make black iron ( iii ) phosphate , which can be scraped off , leaving pure iron . it can be used to clean teeth .
