Carbon disulfide     carbon disulfide , also known as carbon bisulfide , is a chemical compound . it consists of carbon and sulfide ions . it contains carbon in its +4 oxidation state and sulfur in its -2 oxidation state . its chemical formula is cs . it is similar to carbon dioxide , although much more reactive . sulfide is a much more powerful reducing agent than oxide . it burns very easily and catches fire at 90Â°c . it smells sweet but is often contaminated other chemicals that smell bad . it used to be made by reacting carbon and sulfur at a very high temperature . now it is made by `` burning '' methane in sulfur ( instead of oxygen ) . it is much harder to burn methane in sulfur . the waste product ( carbon disulfide ) is also much more reactive than carbon dioxide , the normal waste product . it is used to make carbon tetrachloride . it is also used in making organic chemicals . it is used to dissolve things like phosphorus and iodine and to kill insects . carbon disulfide is very flammable and is also toxic in large amounts when breathed in .
