Upper Jurassic     the upper jurassic is the last geological epoch in the jurassic that began 163.5 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended at 145 mya . it was followed by the lower cretaceous . during the upper jurassic epoch , pangaea broke up into two supercontinents , laurasia to the north , and gondwana to the south . the result of this break-up was the spawning of the atlantic ocean . however , at this time , the atlantic ocean was relatively narrow . sea level was high , though not so high as during the upper cretaceous . the laurasian landmass was broken up by the rising sea into large islands . the rocks were carbonate limestones and clays . the epoch included the famous solnhofen limestone lagerst√§tte , where `` archaeopteryx '' was found . the upper jurassic of england and europe bears a huge amount of the products of life . the kimmeridge clay is the main source for the huge north sea oil reserves , and the whole epoch is stuffed full of marine fossils . many dinosaur remains have also been found . the epoch starts with the oxford clay deposited in a shallow seaway of 10 to 50 metres depth .
