Flood basalt     a flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava . flood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory , creating great plateaus and mountain ranges . flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout earth history . they are clear evidence that the earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state . one explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting . then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basaltic magma . these have a low viscosity , which is why they 'flood ' rather than form taller volcanoes . flood basalts start at between 100 and 400 km depth , in the asthenosphere . to get a partial melting as large as that of the traps , expelling huge quantities of lava , it is necessary to have a large heat input . such melting can take place near a hotspot , resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume .
