RuBisCO     ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase , better known as rubisco , is an enzyme that catalyzes the first major step of carbon fixation in the calvin cycle . carbon fixation is a process by which the atoms of atmospheric carbon dioxide are made available to organisms in the form of energy-rich molecules such as glucose . rubisco splits 6-c molecules into two equal parts . rubisco is very important in biology and ecology because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which inorganic carbon permanently enters the biosphere . rubisco is also the most abundant protein in leaves and the most abundant protein on earth . it accounts for 50 % of soluble leaf protein ( 20-30 % of total leaf nitrogen ) and 30 % of soluble leaf protein in plants ( 5-9 % of total leaf nitrogen ) . given its important role in the biosphere , there are currently efforts to genetically engineer crop plants to contain more efficient rubisco . notes and references . - notes - references
