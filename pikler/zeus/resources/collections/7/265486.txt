Formula Two     formula two , often called f2 , is a type of open wheel auto racing . it served as a feeder series to formula one . in 1985 it was replaced by formula 3000. in 2008 the fia announced that formula two would return for 2009 season in the form of the fia formula two championship . the goal is to develop a low-cost series to allow young drivers a chance to compete in the highest levels of motor racing . formula one is generally regarded as the top open-wheeled auto racing series . because of the high performance and expense of the cars , a lower level racing series was needed for developing drivers and teams . for much of the history of f1 , formula two was that step in the racing ladder . before the second world war , there was a division of racing cars smaller and less powerful than the grand prix racers . this division was usually called voiturette ( `` small car '' ) racing . it provided a place for amateur or less experienced drivers and smaller team to prove themselves . in 1946 , formula a ( later known at formula 1 ) was introduced . the old 1.5 l voiturette formula was replaced with 3.0 l supercharged cars .
