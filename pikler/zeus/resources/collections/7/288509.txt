Villi     villi ( singular is `` villus '' ) are small , finger-like structures in the small intestine . they help to absorb digested food . each villus has micro-villi which increase the surface area of the intestinal walls . a larger surface area allows nutrients to be taken in more quickly . the food ( proteins , fats and carbohydrates ) has already been broken down by enzymes called proteases , lipases and amylases . the amino acids and sugars ( breakdown molecules of proteins and carbohydrates ) go first into the blood stream . then they are then processed by the liver , which acts like a chemical factory for the body . lipid substances ( such as cholesterol ) go first into the lymphatic system , and eventually into the blood stream and the liver . villi contains many different particles that extend in the small intestine . this then increases the speed of the absorption of food in the human gut/digestive system .
