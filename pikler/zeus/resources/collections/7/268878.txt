Abstract art     abstract art is modern art which does not represent images of our everyday world . it has colour , lines and shapes ( form ) , but they are not intended to represent objects or living things . often the artists were influenced by ideas and philosophies . abstract art is found in painting and in sculpture . there are also many works of art which are partly abstract , and partly representational . and there are many artists who work in abstract and other types of modern art . purely abstract art is a 20th-century invention . it grew out of the earlier forms of modern art , but it is perhaps the one movement which is absolutely modern . it has no roots in earlier art ( as we use the term today ) . one of the first to achieve complete abstract paintings was kazimir malevich , who presented a completely black square in 1913. he was a suprematist , an art movement based on simple geometrical shapes . art based on geometry is a kind of geometric abstraction . wassily kandinsky painted a famous work `` composition vii '' in 1913 , which was completely abstract and very complex .
