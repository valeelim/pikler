POST     the post , in most computers , is a self-test that checks the os ( s ) available and boots from the os selected . post stands for `` power on self test '' . a post usually checks the crucial , files , folders , and components . once the post is completed , a selected os will take control and finish the startup process . if the post fails , usually a bsod displays ( blue screen of death , most commonly ) and offers recovery options such as safe mode . lkgc ( last known good configuration ) reverts to the last non-problematic , successful bootup . it is similar to system restore , but its primary function is to allow the user to use the computer normally , unlike system restore , which does not guarantee a fix . also , lkgc is unrevertable , unless you successfully bootup again . system restore works by allowing the user to open a wizard , then select a `` restore point '' . the user must restart for the point to take effect , but the system will start as normal . system repair is typically found on the hard disk of your computer and contains options that can be used to fix the system . however , in serious cases , the os may need to be reinstalled .
