Spirochaete     spirochaetes ( or spirochetes ) are the phylum spirochaetae . these are double-membrane bacteria with long , helically coiled ( spiral-shaped ) cells . spirochaetes are bacteria . they have flagella , which run lengthwise between the cell wall and outer membrane . the flagella cause a twisting motion which moves the spirochaete about . most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic , but there are many parasitic species . the spirochaetes are divided into three families ( brachyspiraceae , leptospiraceae , and spirochaetaceae ) . they are all put in a single order , the spirochaetales . disease-causing members of this phylum include : - `` leptospira '' species , some of which which cause leptospirosis - `` borrelia species , some of which cause lyme disease - `` borrelia recurrentis '' , which causes relapsing fever . - `` treponema pallidum '' subspecies which cause syphilis and yaws . - `` brachyspira '' species , which cause intestinal spirochaetosis . other websites . - introduction to the spirochetes . ucmp .
