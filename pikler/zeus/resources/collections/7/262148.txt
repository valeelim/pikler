Turbocharger     a turbocharger , or turbo , is a gas compressor . it is used to force air into an internal combustion engine . a turbocharger is a form of supercharger . it increases the amount of air entering the engine to create more power . a turbocharger has the compressor powered by a turbine . the turbine is driven by the exhaust gas from the engine . it does not use a direct mechanical drive . this helps improve the performance of the turbocharger . early . builders of turbochargers called them as `` turbosuperchargers '' . a supercharger is an air compressor used for forcing air into an engine . they thought that by adding a turbine to turn the supercharger , it would yield a `` turbosupercharger '' . the term was soon shortened to `` turbocharger '' . this can now create some confusion . the term `` turbosupercharged '' is sometimes used to refer to an engine that uses both a crankshaft-driven supercharger and an exhaust-driven turbocharger . this is also called twincharging . some companies such as teledyne continental motors still use the term `` turbosupercharger '' to refer to their turbochargers .
