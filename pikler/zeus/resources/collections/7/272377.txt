Power line     power lines are wires that conduct electricity through to another place . some have step-up transformers and step-down transformers . the voltage of the power at the end is usually 120v , but is much higher while going through the lines . the power at the end is then safe enough to be used when `` stepped-down '' by a transformer . the original power is made at a power plant . as the power is sent through the power lines , sometimes it encounters spots that it can not go through . then it will need to raise its voltage with a step-up transformer . the act is called `` stepping up '' . but when it reaches buildings , it is too dangerous to be used ( about 750,000v ) so it goes through a step-down transformer . the act is called `` stepping down '' . then the elctricity can be distributed to buildings . related pages . - electricity - static electricity - power line communication
