Beau Brummell     beau brummell , ( born george bryan brummell , london 7 june 1778 â€“ died caen , france 30 march 1840 ) , was the leader of men 's fashion in regency england . he was a friend of the prince regent , the future king george iv , and started the fashion for men to wear tailored clothes that were tasteful and fitted well . brummell once said : `` if john bull turns around to look at you , you are not well dressed ; but either too stiff , too tight , or too fashionable '' . this hardly suggests a dandy whose cravats alone were a peacock display . no doubt brummell wore various styles , but one in particular seems to have been his favourite . the style included dark coats and full-length trousers , with an elaborately-knotted cravat . the coat was cut away at the front , and double-breasted . if worn open , it had a double-breasted waistcoat underneath . the tails of the coat were not long , ending above the back of the knees . they were cut square . the collar of the coat was a 'stand-up ' : it stood higher at the back of the neck .
