Royal Hospital Kilmainham     the royal hospital kilmainham is a 17th-century building in kilmainham , dublin , ireland . it was built to be a home for retired soldiers . it was used as a home for over 250 years . the hospital was built between 1680 and 1684 by architect sir william robinson . he was the official state surveyor general for james butler , 1st duke of ormonde and lord lieutenant of ireland to king charles ii . the style is based on les invalides in paris . the royal hospital chelsea in chelsea , london was completed two years later and looks alike in style . the tudor gothic gateway at the end of the road leading to the royal hospital was designed by francis johnston . he was one of the leading architects of the day . this gateway originally stood beside the river liffey at bloody bridge ( now rory o'more bridge ) . it was moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844. when the irish free state was formed , they thought about using the building for the oireachtas éireann , the new irish national parliament . this did not happen . after the soldiers were all gone , the buildings were used for different things like offices for the garda síochána ( the irish police force ) and as storage for the national museum of ireland .
