Riojasaurus     riojasaurus was a herbivorous prosauropod dinosaur . it was one of the earliest of the large , plant-eating dinosaurs . `` riojasaurus '' lived during the upper triassic , roughly 225 to 219 million years ago . fossils have been found in la rioja province in argentina . there are include incomplete skeletons from about 20 individuals . `` riojasaurus '' had a heavy body , bulky legs , and a long neck and tail . its leg bones were dense and massive for a prosauropod . by contrast , its vertebrae were lightened by hollow cavities , and unlike most prosauropods , `` riojasaurus '' had four sacral vertebrae instead of three . it probably moved slowly on all fours and could not rear up on its back legs . the nearly equal length of the fore and hindlimbs is also suggestive of a quadrupedal animal .
