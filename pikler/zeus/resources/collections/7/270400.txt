Sinosauropteryx     sinosauropteryx is a genus of non-avialan dinosaur ( `` not '' a bird ) . it is the first one found with the fossilized impressions of furry down or filamentous feathers . overall , the filaments resemble the down-like feathers of some modern flightless birds . `` sinosauropteryx '' lived in china during the early cretaceous period and was a close relative of `` compsognathus '' . it has been dated to 124.6â€“122 million years ago . the fossils were from the famous jehol biota of sihetun , liaoning province , china , and represent an ancient lake bed . most paleontologists do not consider `` sinosauropteryx '' to be a bird , because phylogenetically , it lies far from the `` clade '' aves , usually defined as `` archaeopteryx '' plus modern birds . `` sinosauropteryx prima '' is among the smallest known non-avian theropods , with the type specimen ( a nearly mature individual ) measuring only in length , including a very long tail . paleontologist nick longrich suggested that these specimens preserve remnants of the original colour pattern the animal would have had in life . he argued that the dark , banded stains on the tail were too evenly spaced to have been caused by random separation of the fossil slabs , and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers .
