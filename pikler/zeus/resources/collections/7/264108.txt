Orogeny     orogeny is the process of mountain-building . it takes place when two tectonic plates come together . orogens develop while a continental plate is crumpled and thickened to form mountain ranges , and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis . examples : - where a continent rides over an oceanic plate ( non-collisional ) : - andes in south america - where two continental plates converge ( collide ) : - alps - himalayas another , less common cause is when a plate moves over a hot spot in the earth 's mantle . examples : - hawaiian chain of islands - yellowstone national park there is a third process , called `` delamination '' . here an unstable portion of cold root of the lithosphere drips down into the mantle , decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift . example : - the sierra nevada in california . areas that are rifting apart , such as mid-ocean ridges and the east african rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy caused by the hot mantle underneath them , which pushes them up . this thermal buoyancy is known as `` dynamic topography '' . examples :
