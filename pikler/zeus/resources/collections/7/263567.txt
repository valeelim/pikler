Res Gestae Divi Augusti     res gestae divi augusti ( literally 'the achievements of the divine augustus ' ) , also known as `` res gestae '' and `` rgda '' , was an autobiography and epitath written by emperor augustus following the tradition of writing about a dead person 's achievements and life but augustus ' is the biggest by far . it was about his achievements in his life in politics ( his early career ) , the positions he held and various other parts like the money he spent on public games and on rebuilding temples around the empire . various copies of the `` res gestae '' have been found throughout the roman empire . all the surviving copies come from modern-day turkey - the best preserved one comes from ancyra . most historians feel that augustus wrote several versions during his life and kept updating them until the final version which is usually dated to the same year as augustus ' death in 14 ad . as a source , the `` res gestae '' is not fully accurate . whilst not lying , he does n't mention some things that he did like the proscriptions of his enemies and refers to his rival marc antony as 'a faction ' . through the inscription , augustus makes a big deal of his money he spends on the people , rome and the empire . he also says frequently that he has 'restored the republic ' and only gains his titles because of the universal support from the people and , most importantly , the senate .
