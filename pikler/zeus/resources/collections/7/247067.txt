Elgin Marbles     the parthenon marbles , sometimes called the elgin marbles , are a series of ancient greek sculptures made from marble . they were originally part of the parthenon temple in athens but they were taken by thomas bruce , 7th earl of elgin in the early 1800s . many people , including the greek government , have argued that elgin stole the marbles and did not take them legally . they are on display in the british museum . the greek government asked to have them back many times . in 2014 unesco offered to mediate but the museum declined .
