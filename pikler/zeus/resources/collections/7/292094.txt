Scientific racism     scientific racism is the idea to use science to promote racism . this is different from using the scientific method , and simply pointing out differences between races . the scientific method does not claim that one race is `` better '' than another , it may simply show differences between the races . very often , the term is also used for different theories of anthropology and other closely-related disciplines to create evidence , which would allow to classify humans into groups . these groups are then called `` races '' , and some think it is possible to claim that one race is superior to another . most of these theories were common between 1880 and 1930 , in a period called new imperialism .
