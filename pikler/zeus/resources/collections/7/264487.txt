Copper(II) chloride    copper ( ii ) chloride copper ( ii ) chloride , also known as cupric chloride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cucl . it contains copper in its +2 oxidation state . it also contains chloride ions . copper ( ii ) chloride is light brown when anhydrous . it is green when hydrated . it is a weak oxidizing agent . it reacts with aluminium foil to make hydrogen , copper ( i ) oxide , and aluminium chloride . this is used in school demonstrations . it releases chlorine and turns into copper ( i ) chloride when heated very hot . it reacts with sodium hydroxide to make copper ( ii ) hydroxide . copper ( ii ) chloride reacts with metals to make metal chlorides and copper . it puts out blue flames if it is heated in a flame . it reacts with sulfur dioxide to make copper ( i ) chloride . it dissolves in water to make a blue solution . when more chloride is added , it turns green , then yellow . it is made by reacting copper with chlorine . it can also be made by reacting copper ( ii ) hydroxide , copper ( ii ) oxide , or copper ( ii ) carbonate with hydrochloric acid and from pure copper and from 1:1 solution of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid where copper first get oxidized to cuo from h2o2 and then reacts with hcl to form cucl2 , reaction goes like this :
