Usage share of web browsers     the usage share of web browsers is the percentage ( % ) of viewers at a group of websites who use a particular web browser . for example , when it is said that internet explorer has 51 % usage share , it means that some version of internet explorer is used by nearly 51 of every 100 visitors who visit a given set of websites . it can be misleading to measure the browser usage in the number of requests ( page hits ) made by each user agent . not all requests are generated by a user , as a user agent can make requests at regular time intervals without user input . in this case the user 's activity might be overestimated . some examples : - a web browser that refreshes the webpage at a regular time interval . - a feed reader that requests the rss or atom feed at a regular time interval . - extra files like css hacks and javascript hacks are often sent to internet explorer . - gecko-based browsers ( such as firefox ) can prefetch linked web pages , potentially increasing hits . link prefetching in gecko-based browsers is used on pages with enhanced markup , including google search results .
