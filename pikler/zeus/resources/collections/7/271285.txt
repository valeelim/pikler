Conceptual art     conceptual art is art in which the concepts or ideas involved in the work are more important than traditional aesthetic and material concerns . many of the works , sometimes called installations , may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions . this method was fundamental to one of the first to appear in print : conceptual art even questions the nature of art . joseph kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art . the notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic clement greenberg 's vision of modern art during the 1950s . with the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s , however , conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done . one of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects . conceptual art has come to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture .
