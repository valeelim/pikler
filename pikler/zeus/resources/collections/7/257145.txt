'' in real life , melanie did not `` meet a man from the motor trade '' , but instead a croupier , and left in the afternoon while her parents were at work . she was found ten days later because she had said where her boyfriend worked . coincidentally , coe had met mccartney three years earlier when she was a contestant and prize winner on itv 's `` ready steady go ! '' . an update on melanie appeared in the daily mail in may 2008 .
