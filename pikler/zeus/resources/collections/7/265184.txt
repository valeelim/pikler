Nicaraguan Sign Language     idioma de signos nicaragüense , or nicaraguan sign language , is a sign language that was spontaneously invented by deaf schoolchildren in nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s . the language developed when the sandinist government of nicaragua created the first ( elementary ) school for deaf people , in the 1970s . the language is of special interest to linguists , because it allows them to study how languages develop . in the 1970s , the deaf people of nicaragua rarely met . they lived isolated lives and used simple gestures to communicate with their friends and family . in 1977 , a special programme for the deaf was started in a suburb of managua . at first , fifty children took part . when the sandinist came to power , the number of pupils rose to hundred . in 1980 , a vocational school for deaf people was opened in another part of managua . in 1983 , both schools together had about 400 pupils . the teaching was centered on lip reading and the use of a hand alphabet . this was mostly unsuccessful , because most pupils had trouble spelling words in this way . the children were cut off from their teachers , and used recreational breaks , and free time spent together to create a system that allowed them to communicate with each other . gestures and signs used at home were used to create a pidgin . later the pidgin developed into a creole language . the first step , that is to say the pidgin is called `` lenguaje de signos nicaragüense '' ( lsn ) today . pupils who left the school before the creole language was created , continue to use the pidgin .
