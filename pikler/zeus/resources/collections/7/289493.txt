Messel Pit     the messel pit ( ) is a disused quarry near the village of messel , hesse about 35 km southeast of frankfurt am main , germany . it is a special site where fine fossils are preserved : a lagerstätte . bituminous shale was mined there . because of its fossils , it has significant geological and scientific importance . after almost becoming a landfill , strong local resistance eventually stopped these plans . the messel pit was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1995. it was placed on the list solely due to fossils . amateur collectors developed a `` transfer technique '' that enabled them to preserve the fine details of small fossils , the method still used to preserve the fossils today . many of the known specimens from the site have come from amateur collectors , and in 1996 , an amnesty on previously collected fossils was put in effect , in the hope of getting privately owned collections back into public ownership and available to science . the current surface of the messel pit is roughly 60 m below the local land and is about 0.7 km² in area . the oil-shale bed originally extended to a depth of 190 m .
