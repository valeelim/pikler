Crocodylomorph     the crocodylomorphs are an important group of archosaurs that include the crocodilians and their extinct relatives . during mesozoic and early tertiary times the crocodylomorpha were far more diverse than they are now . triassic forms were small , lightly built , active terrestrial animals . these were supplanted during the early jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms . the later jurassic , cretaceous , and tertiary saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lineages . modern crocodilians do not appear until the upper cretaceous . the crocodylian lineage ( clade crurotarsi ) were a very diverse group of reptiles . not only are they an ancient group of animals , at least as old as the dinosaurs , they also evolved into a great variety of forms . the earliest forms , the sphenosuchians , evolved during the upper triassic , and were highly gracile terrestrial forms built like greyhounds . during the jurassic and the cretaceous , marine forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish .
