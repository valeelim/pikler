No Protection     no protection is the name of a dub remix of massive attack 's second album `` protection '' . the remix was done by the british dub producer mad professor . mad professor was contacted by massive attack after `` protection '' was released to remix a song for a single . after the single was remixed , the band asked mad professor to listen to more of the album to find the possibility of more remixes . the project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album . mad professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow , pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized , reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals ( many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental ) fade in-and-out in normal dub fashion , making a hypnotic , if hi nice repetitive , mix . the result is , on paper , more textured than the original , but loses any sense of the jazzy feel of `` protection '' . track listing . 1 . `` radiation ruling the nation '' ( based on `` protection '' ) – 1:35 1 . `` bumper ball dub '' ( based on `` karmacoma '' ) – 5:59
