Meson     mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark . antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark , meaning that in a fraction of a second , a quark and its antiquark will destroy each other to produce only energy . since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks , their spins can cancel each other out , which forms a particle similar to a higgs boson . the name meson comes from greek `` mesos '' , meaning middle . this is because the masses of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like electrons , called leptons , and heavy particles like protons , called baryons . mesons are hadrons , which simply means that they are made of quarks . since quarks have different fractional charges , mesons can have a charge . however , the charges of the quarks may cancel out , forming an uncharged meson . the rest of the hadron family are known as baryons , which are made of three quarks . since quarks all have a spin of 1/2 , three of them will never add up to an integer spin . an integer spin is simply 0 , 1 , or 2. particles with an integer spin are called bosons , which obey bose-einstein statistics . this means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in space at the same time . however , a meson is made of one quark and one antiquark , which each do not have an integer spin . particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2 . these particles with 1/2 spin are called fermions because they obey fermi-dirac statistics . this means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time . all known baryons and quarks ( and antiquarks ) are fermions , and all mesons are bosons . this can get very confusing because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time , but the quarks that make up mesons can not exist in the same point in space at the same time .
