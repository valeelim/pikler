Potassium chloride     potassium chloride is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is kcl . it contains potassium and chloride ions . it is a colorless crystalline solid . it is not reactive . it is similar to sodium chloride . it reacts with silver nitrate to make silver chloride . it reacts with sodium metal when very hot to make potassium metal . the metals are a gas because it is so hot . it makes a pink color when heated in a flame . potassium chloride is found as a mineral . the mineral is called sylvite . it is also found in sylvanite , a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride . it is taken from the ocean . it can also be processed from the mineral sylvite or sylvanite . it is made when potassium nitrate is reacted with hydrochloric acid , making nitric acid and potassium chloride . it is made when potassium burns in chlorine . it is used to make potassium metal . potassium chloride is heated very hot until it melts . sodium metal is reacted with it . the sodium metal melts and boils to make sodium gas . the sodium gas reacts with the potassium chloride to make potassium gas and sodium chloride . it can be electrolyzed in a water solution to make potassium hydroxide . it is used in food processing . it can be used to execute people in a lethal injection . it is used instead of table salt sometimes . normally it is half table salt and half potassium chloride . it can be used to extinguish fires . it was used to make packs that get hot when squeezed , but better chemicals are used now .
