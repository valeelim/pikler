MP-40     the mp-40 ( german : `` maschinenpistole 40 '' ) ( english : `` machine pistol 40 '' ) , is a type of sub-machine gun . it is also known as the schmeisser . it was developed in the late 1930s and was first used in the early 1940s . it was used by the german military during world war 2. it fired 9mm bullets and had a 32-round magazine . the weapon could only fire in full-automatic fire , but since the weapon had such a slow rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute , it was possible to fire individual bullets . it was one of the first weapons made completely out of plastic and steel , making it both cheap and quick to make . the design was so good and so reliable that british soldiers would often ditch their own sten sub-machine guns and use the mp-40 instead . this would not have been a big problem since both weapons fire the same type of bullet and clip .
