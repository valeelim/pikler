Rhynie chert     the rhynie chert is an lower devonian sedimentary deposit , part of the old red sandstone . it has extraordinary fossil details , and is a lagerst√§tte . the chert is exposed near the village of rhynie , aberdeenshire , scotland . a second unit , the windyfield chert , is located some 700 m away . the rhynie chert contains exceptionally preserved material covered by an overlying volcanic deposit . most of the fossil bed has primitive plants ( which had water-conducting cells and sporangia , but no true leaves ) , along with arthropods , lichens , algae and fungi . this fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons . first , the age of the site , formed about 410 million years ago . this places it at an early stage in the colonisation of land . second , these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of preservation , with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens . stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material . the book lungs of some early spiders can be seen in cross-sections . fungal hyphae can be seen entering plant material , acting as decomposers and mycorrhizal symbionts .
