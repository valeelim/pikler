Sarcosuchus     sarcosuchus is an extinct genus of giant crocodile . it lived in the lower cretaceous of what is now africa 135 to 112 million years ago . strictly speaking , it was not a modern type of crocodile but a kind of pre-crocodile . these earlier types are called crocodylomorphs . true crocodiles arrived in the upper cretaceous . `` sarcosuchus '' was one of the largest giant crocodile-like reptiles that ever lived . it was almost twice as long as the modern saltwater crocodile and weighed about 8 tonnes . until recently , all that was known of it was a few fossilised teeth and armour scutes , which were discovered in the sahara desert in the 1940s or 1950s . in 1997 and 2000 , paul sereno discovered half a dozen new specimens , including one with about half the skeleton intact and most of the spine . all of the other giant crocodiles are known only from a few partial skulls , so which is actually the biggest is an open question . unlike other giant crododiles , `` sarcosuchus '' was a river predator . as the overhanging jaw and stout teeth are designed for grabbing and crushing , its primary prey may have been large animals and smaller dinosaurs , which it ambushed , dragged into the water , crushed , drowned and then tore apart .
