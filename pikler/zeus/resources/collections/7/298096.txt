Inductively coupled plasma     an inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) is a type of plasma source . electromagnetic induction creates energy in the source by causing ions to circulate . movement of the ions generates energy in the form of heat . inductively coupled plasma sources usually use argon as a fuel . unfortunately , most icp sources require at least 5 l/min of argon . this makes inductively coupled plasma a rather expensive source . the argon atoms are ionized with a spark from tesla coil . these ions will circulate due to the magnetic field to produce heat and high temperatures . this will cause additional ions to be formed from the argon fuel . after a period of time , the torch will reach temperatures between 6 000 and 10 000 kelvin . the high temperatures produced by icp make it a popular source for many scientific experiments . this source had the advantage of providing strong signals and only small amounts of noise or interference . also , the data obtained from experiments using an inductively coupled plasma source is often linear . this makes it easy for scientists to determine the amount of something in a sample . some of the most common applications are
