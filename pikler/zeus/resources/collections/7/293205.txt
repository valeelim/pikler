Yew     a yew is a coniferous tree . the name is most used for species of the genus taxus , or for other members of the coniferous family taxaceae . all species of yew contain highly poisonous alkaloids known as taxanes . all parts of the tree except the arils ( red 'fruits ' ) contain the alkaloid . the arils are edible and sweet , but the seeds are dangerously poisonous . unlike birds , the human stomach can break down the seed coat and release the taxanes into the body . this can have fatal results if yew 'berries ' are eaten without removing the seeds first . the seeds and leaves will kill cattle and horses , but deer can break down the poisons and will eat yew foliage freely . in the wild , deer browsing of yews is often so extensive that wild yew trees are restricted to cliffs and steep slopes inaccessible to deer . the foliage is also eaten by the larvae of some lepidopteran insects including willow beauty . yews are slow growing and can be very long-lived , and reach heights of 1-40 m , with trunk diameters of up to 4 m. they have reddish bark , spear-shaped flat , dark-green leaves 1-4 cm long and 2-3 mm broad , arranged spirally on the stem , but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem .
