Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry     gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography ( gc ) and mass spectrometry ( ms ) . this makes it possible to identify different substances within a test sample . gc-ms has many uses include drug detection , fire investigation , environmental analysis and explosives investigation . it can also be used to identify unknown samples . gc-ms can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings . additionally , gc-ms can identify trace elements in deteriorated materials , even after the sample fell apart so much that other tests can not work . gc-ms is the best way for forensic experts to identify substances because it is a `` specific test '' . a specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample . a `` non-specific test '' only says that categories of substances are in the sample . although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance , this could lead to false positive identification .
