Anchiornis     anchiornis ( 'near bird ' ) is a genus of small , feathered , troodontid dinosaurs . `` anchiornis huxleyi '' is named in honour of thomas henry huxley , the first to propose a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs . a complete individual would be 34 cm ( 13 in ) and weigh only 110 g ( 3.9 oz ) , making it the smallest known feathered dinosaur . `` anchiornis '' fossils have been found in liaoning , china , dating to the first part of the late jurassic period , 160 to 161 million years ago . `` anchiornis '' is a small , early troodontid dinosaur with a triangular skull like other troodontids . also , `` anchiornis '' had long legs , usually an indication of a strong runner . however , the extensive leg feathers indicate that long legs may be an vestigial trait , because running animals tend to have reduced , not increased , hair or feathers on their legs . the forelimbs of `` anchiornis '' were also very long , unusual among troodontids ( which tend to be short-armed ) but similar to dromaeosaurids and early birds , emphasizing its basal ( 'primitive ' ) position among dinobirds .
