Spoonbill     spoonbills are a group of large , long-legged wading birds in the family threskiornithidae , which also includes the ibises . all have large , flat , spatulate bills and feed by wading through shallow water , sweeping the partly-opened bill from side to side . the moment any small aquatic creature touches the inside of the bill—an insect , crustacean , or tiny fish—it is snapped shut . spoonbills generally prefer fresh water to salt but are found in both environments . they need to feed many hours each day . spoonbills are monogamous , but , so far as is known , only for one season at a time . most species nest in trees or reed-beds , often with ibises or herons . passaro colhereiro
