Ophthalmosauridae     ophthalmosauridae were a family of ichthyosaurs which lived from the middle jurassic to the upper cretaceous period . within ophthalmosauridae there are two lineages , one including `` aegirosaurus '' and `` ophthalmosaurus '' , and the other including `` brachypterygius '' , `` caypullisaurus '' and `` platypterygius '' . only three genera survived the end-jurassic extinction event : `` caypullisaurus '' , `` maiaspondylus '' , and `` platypterygius '' . they did , however , have a worldwide distribution . the last to survive was `` platypterygius '' . this genus became extinct about 30 million years before the end of the upper cretaceous period . it happened when there was a deep ocean anoxic event , which wiped out all the animals below pelagic waters . ichthyosaurs , being reptiles , came to the surface to breath , but the extinction event removed their prey species .
