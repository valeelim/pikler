Richard Roberts     sir richard john roberts frs ( born 6 september 1943 , derby ) is a british biochemist and molecular biologist . he was awarded the 1993 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with phillip sharp for `` the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns , and that the splicing of messenger rna to delete those introns can occur in different ways , yielding different proteins from the same dna sequence '' . roberts has worked at harvard university , cold spring harbor laboratory and new england biolab . he was knighted in the 2008 birthday honours . it used to be thought that each gene on dna coded for a single protein in a continuous strip . roberts and sharp independently found out that the genes in adenovirus ( which causes the common cold ) , were split into segments that were combined later in rna processing . in 1997 roberts proved that in the adenovirus coding dna is separated by stretches of dna which are non-coding . the coding sections are exons , and the non-coding sections are introns .
