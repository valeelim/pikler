Red beds     the term red beds usually refers to strata of reddish-colored sedimentary rocks such as sandstone , siltstone or shale that were deposited in hot climates under oxidizing conditions . they are usually formed in terrestrial situations : on land , and in rivers and lakes . the red color comes from iron oxide in their mineral structure . although they have been deposited throughout the phanerozoic , they are most commonly associated with rocks deposited during the devonian , permian and triassic periods . the old red sandstone is one of the most famous rock formations . red beds have economic significance since many of them contain reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas . secondary red beds are linked to the uplift , erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary red beds for their formation . the formation of red beds has been much discussed . the basic chemical change which produces them is oxidation . at first it was thought they indicated desert conditions . some do , and this can be proved if the strata show signs of dune formations . however :
