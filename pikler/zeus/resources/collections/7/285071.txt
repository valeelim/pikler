Nuclear espionage     nuclear espionage is sharing a country 's secrets about nuclear weapons to other countries without permission . since nuclear weapons have been invented , there have been many cases of known nuclear espionage , and also many cases where it has thought to have happened , but has not been proven . because nuclear weapons are usually considered the most important of state secrets , all nations with nuclear weapons have strict rules against sharing information about how nuclear weapons are designed , where they are kept , and other things about them . there are also rules that keep countries who have signed non-proliferation agreements ( which are meant to stop the spread of nuclear weapons ) from sharing information about such weapons with the public . during the manhattan project , which was when the united states , the united kingdom , and canada worked together during world war ii to make the first nuclear weapons , there was much nuclear espionage in which scientists or technicians working for the project sent information about bomb development and designs to the soviet union . these people are often called the atomic spies , and their work continued into the early cold war . there has been much disagreement over the exact details of these cases , though some of this was settled when venona project transcripts were made public . these were secret messages between soviet agents and the soviet government that were discovered and decoded . some issues remain unsettled , however .
