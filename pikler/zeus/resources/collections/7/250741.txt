Glomerular filtration rate     glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) is a test used by physicians and other medical professionals to see if the kidneys are working correctly . in basic terms , it is a measurement of how much liquid and waste is passing from the blood through the tiny filters in the kidney , called the glomeruli , and out into the urine during each minute . the test measures how much creatinine is in the blood . this shows how well the kidneys are performing . in a normal healthy person the gfr stays close to the same value all of the time . the test is done by taking blood from a person and sending it to a laboratory . normal values are between 90ml/min and 110ml/min . a value below 60ml/minute means the person has chronic renal disease and a value below 15ml/minute means the person 's kidneys have stopped working . measurement of the gfr can be very helpful to medical professionals . it helps them decide if a person has a disease of the kidneys or not . a normal value for gfr is between 90-110ml/min . this will normally go down in older people . it will also go down in people with kidney disease . as well as helping a medical professional diagnose a kidney disease , the gfr is also used to monitor the progress of a disease .
