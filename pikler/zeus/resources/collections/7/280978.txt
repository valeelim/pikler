Frill-necked Lizard     the frill-necked lizard ( `` chlamydosaurus kingii '' ) has a large reptile , thin frill around its head , which it displays in order to frighten enemies . to appear even more impressive , it also opens its mouth wide and often rears up on its hind legs . when frightened , this lizard will run away , using its back-legs only , earning it the nickname , the `` bicycle lizard . '' these lizards spend most of their life in trees ( they are primarily arboreal ) . they live in the north of australia and in new guinea . they inhabit moist tropical and warm-temperate forests and in woodlands with shrubby understory . when displayed , the frill is 9.5-14 inches ( 24-34 cm ) wide . when the lizard is at rest , the frill folds down on its shoulders . adults are over 8 inches ( 20 cm ) long . frill-necked lizards are carnivorous ( meat-eaters ) . they eat bugs ( like cicadas , ants , and spiders ) and small lizards . they hunt in trees and on the ground .
