Quantum gravity     quantum gravity is an area of research in physics . right now , physics is able to describe gravity of real-life sized objects using general relativity . physicists can also describe the universe on a microscopic scale with quantum mechanics . the goal of quantum gravity is to develop a theory which contains both general relativity and quantum mechanics . however , combining the theories of the big and the small is very difficult in practice . physicists are working on a number of ways to write down a theory of quantum gravity . one approach is to search for a unified field theory . physicists also try to develop theories at an even more fundamental level , like string theory , loop quantum gravity , or other methods , to find out why our current theories of gravity and quantum mechanics can not be combined .
