Central dogma of molecular biology     the central dogma of molecular biology is a phrase by francis crick , who proposed the double helix structure of dna . it means that information passes from dna to proteins via rna , but proteins can not pass the information back to dna . crick first wrote it in 1958 , and repeated it in 1970. the dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information . there are 3 major classes of such biopolymers : dna and rna ( both nucleic acids ) , and protein . there are 3Ã—3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these . the dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3 : - 3 general transfers ( believed to occur normally in most cells ) , - 3 special transfers ( known to occur , but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory ) , and - 3 unknown transfers ( believed never to occur ) . the general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information : dna can be copied to dna ( dna replication ) , dna information can be copied into mrna , ( transcription ) , and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mrna as a template ( translation ) .
