Upper Triassic     the upper triassic is the last epoch in the triassic . it began 237 million years ago , and ended at 201.3 million years ago . before it was the middle triassic it is followed by the lower jurassic . the other two epochs of the triassic were the lower and middle triassic . many early dinosaur species appeared for the first time during the upper triassic , including `` plateosaurus '' , `` coelophysis '' , and `` eoraptor '' . pterosaurs were common in the air , and ichthyosaurs dominated the seas . at the end of the upper triassic some event or events caused the extinction of many animal species worldwide . known as the endâ€“triassic extinction event , it was similar to the more famous event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs , except no one knows for sure what caused the event . although the triassic was , in general , a dry period with inland areas often deserts , the upper triassis saw a big change . the carnian pluvial event ( cpe ) was a major global climate change and biotic turnover ( many extinctions ) early in the upper triassic , ~ 230 million years ago . shifts in carbon and oxygen isotopes suggest a global warming .
