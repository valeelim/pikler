Cambrian explosion     the cambrian explosion is when many animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record . it happened about 530 million years ago ( mya ) . probably most had evolved before then , but that was their first appearance as fossils . before about 580 mya it seems that most organisms were simple . they were made of individual cells , occasionally organized into colonies . over the following 70 or 80 million years the rate of evolution seemed to accelerate . by the end of the cambrian most phyla we know today existed . the cambrian explosion has caused much scientific debate . the seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the 'primordial strata ' was noted as early as the mid 19th century , and charles darwin saw it as one of the main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection . the long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the cambrian fauna , seemingly abruptly and from nowhere , centres on three key points : 1. whether it actually happened . was there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early cambrian ?
