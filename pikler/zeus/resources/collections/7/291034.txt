San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan     san lorenzo tenochtitlan started out as an agricultural and population center for the olmec civilization , which inhabited a region of what is today southeastern mexico . the olmecs emerged as early as 1500 bc as the earliest complex society in the americas . san lorenzo is best known as the first city established in the americas . the main reason san lorenzo flourished at such an early period is its location within the coatzacoalcos flood plain , which provided fertile land for farming . thus , the settlement of san lorenzo follows the pattern of settlement of the world ’ s very first urban centers , which emerged in the fertile river valleys of mesopotamia . because of the high farming value of the surrounding land , san lorenzo ranked as the olmecs ’ most populous settlement from 1200-900 bc . during that period , san lorenzo had the biggest trade market in all of the olmec heartland . for unknown reasons , many people migrated out of san lorenzo in 800 bc to the nearby city of la venta . however , san lorenzo was repopulated in 600 bc , when it became a center for olmec ritual sacrifices until the population faded away in 400 bc along with the olmec civilization . today , san lorenzo remains a significant archaeological site because the artifacts found there–including the famous colossal heads and jade masks–shed some light on olmec culture and its profound influence on later mesoamerican civilizations , such as the aztec and maya .
