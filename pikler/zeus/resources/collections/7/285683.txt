Theriodont     theriodonts are a major group of therapsids . they are a clade which include not only the traditional theriodonts , but also their descendants the mammals as well ( in the same way that theropod dinosaurs include the birds as a sub-clade ) . they can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of synapsida that lived from the middle permian to the middle cretaceous . theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago , in the middle permian . even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their relatives . theriodonts fall into three main groups : gorgonopsia , therocephalia and cynodontia . early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded . early forms were carnivorous , but several later groups became herbivorous during the triassic . theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids , because their dentary ( lower jaw ) was larger , which gave them more efficient chewing . several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw , moved into the ears , allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider . this made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids .
