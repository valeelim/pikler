Light clock     the light clock is a simple way of showing a basic feature of special relativity . a clock is designed to work by bouncing a flash of light off a distant mirror and using its return to trigger another flash of light , meanwhile counting how many flashes have occurred along the way . it is easy to show that people on earth watching a spaceship fly overhead with such a clock would see it ticking relatively slowly . this effect is called time dilation . before we study the light clock , consider another kind of relativity . imagine that someone is dribbling a basketball in the hold of a large cargo jet . the basketball player is moving in the same direction as the jet airplane . the other people in the plane see him moving a meter or two as he makes one dribble . between the time the ball bounces the first time and the ball bounces the second time , about one second has passed . but when the first bounce occurred the basketball was over gibraltar , and when the second bounce occurred the basketball was over the water nearer to spain . so the basketball has moved 280 meters with respect to earth .
