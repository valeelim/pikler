Food poisoning     food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated . there are two kinds of food poisoning : poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent . food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten . food intoxication is when the food contains toxins , including bacterially produced exotoxins , which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection . even though it is commonly called `` food poisoning '' , most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria , viruses , prions or parasites that contaminate food , rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , about 76 million people in the united states become ill from the food they eat , and about 5,000 of them die every year . symptoms start within hours to many days after eating . depending on what the cause of the poisoning was , they can include one or more of the following : nausea , abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhoea , gastroenteritis , fever , pain in the head or fatigue .
