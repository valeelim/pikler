Reproductive isolation     reproductive isolation refers to the situation where different species may live in the same area , but properties of individuals prevent them from interbreeding . the things which stop species or groups of organisms reproducing sexually are called isolating mechanisms . members of one species do not , in general , mate with members of another species , though there are many exceptions and variations to this . and , if such mating does take place , the offspring may not develop , or may not be fertile . if species arise by the splitting of ancestral species , it might be asked what stops the new species continuing to reproduce together . if they did , they would again become one species . the answer given by dobzhansky and ernst mayr was that species split mainly because they lived in different areas ( geographical speciation ) . they developed features which , if they later lived together , would make crossing not work properly . the idea of the biological species concept was that a species was defined as a group of interbreeding individuals . they would be a natural population which is reproductively isolated from other such groups .
