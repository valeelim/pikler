Four Asian Tigers     the four asian tigers or asian dragons are the highly developed economies of hong kong , singapore , south korea and taiwan . these regions were the first newly industrialized countries . they are known because they had very high growth rates ( they became rich very fast ) and fast industrialization between the early 1960s and 1990s . now people say that all four economies are rich economies . all four asian tigers have a highly educated and productive work force compared to others in the region . the economic success stories of korea and taiwan became known as the miracle on the han river and the taiwan miracle . this helped many developing countries think maybe they could become rich too , especially the tiger cub economies . the four tigers grew richer very quickly . some of this was because these countries let companies compete more , and some of this was because they started to sell more to other countries . the united states helped during the cold war , because they did n't want these countries to become communist countries unlike some other countries .
