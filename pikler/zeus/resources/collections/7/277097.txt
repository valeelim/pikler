Hesperornis     hesperornis is an extinct genus of flightless aquatic birds that lived during the upper cretaceous ( 89â€“65 million years ago ) . `` hesperornis '' was an important early find in the history of avian paleontology . it was discovered by the paleontologist o.c . marsh in the late 19th century bone wars . famous locations for `` hesperornis '' are the upper cretaceous marine limestones from kansas and the marine shales from canada . the genus probably had a holarctic distribution . `` hesperornis '' was a large bird , reaching up to 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) in length . it had virtually no wings , and swam with its powerful hind legs . like many other mesozoic birds such as `` ichthyornis '' , `` hesperornis '' had teeth in its beak which were used to hold prey ( most likely fish ) . `` hesperornis '' hunted in the waters of such contemporary shelf seas as the north american inland sea , the turgai strait and the prehistoric north sea , which then were subtropical to tropical waters , much warmer than today . they probably fed mainly on fish , maybe also crustaceans , cephalopods and mollusks , as do the diving seabirds of today . their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey .
