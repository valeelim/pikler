Hyperon     hyperons are particles that are made of quarks . what makes them different from other baryons ( particles made of three quarks ) is that they must have at least one strange quark , but no charm quarks or bottom quarks . strange quarks have a property known as strangeness . strangeness causes the strange quark–and all other particles bonded with it–to not decay by strong force , but instead due to the much slower weak force . since all quarks are fermions ( which means that no two of them can be in the same point in space at the same point in time ) , each quark has a spin of 1/2 , adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon . this quickly decays into a 1/2 spin particle . hyperons themselves decay due to weak force . there are dozens of different hyperon combinations . for example , a λ ( lambda ) hyperon has a charge of 0 , and is often written as λ. when it decays , it usually creates one proton , and one antipion . like many forms of weak force decay , there is more than one possible outcome . a λ also has a significantly lower , but still possible , chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged pion . λ hyperons have an average lifespan of 2.6x10 seconds , which makes it one of the longest living hyperons .
