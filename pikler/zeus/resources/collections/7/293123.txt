Ulster Scots people     ulster scots are an ethnic group in ireland , descended from lowland scots and english from the border of those two countries , were `` border reivers '' . these people first began to occupy ireland in large numbers with the plantation of ulster , ordered by james i of england on land taken from the irish nobility , mostly in the province of ulster . the term `` ulster-scots '' refers to both these colonists of the 17th century and , less commonly , to the gallowglass who began to arrive from what is now northwest scotland centuries earlier . ulster-scots were largely descended from colonists from galloway , ayrshire , and the scottish borders country , although some descend from people further north in the scottish lowlands and the highlands . ulster-scots emigrated in significant numbers to the united states and all corners of the british empire — canada , australia , new zealand , south africa — and to a lesser extent to argentina and chile in south america . `` scotch-irish '' is a traditional term for ulster scots who later emigrated to what is now the united states ; `` scots-irish '' is a more recent form of the american term , the term has usually been scotch-irish in america , as evident in merriam-webster dictionaries , where the term scotch-irish is recorded from 1744 , while scots-irish is not recorded until 1972. and is not to be confused with irish-scots , i.e. , recent irish immigrants to scotland .
