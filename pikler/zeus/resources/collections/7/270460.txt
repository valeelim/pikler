Ecumenism     ecumenism ( or oecumenism ) is the idea that the different christian denominations should work together more than they currently do . this idea is different from religious toleration . over the years , christianity has been split into many different movements . these separations are based on doctrine , on history , and what people do in everyday life . the term ecumenical comes from the latin `` oecumenicus '' , a phrase referring to `` the whole world '' , meaning literally `` inhabited '' . in christianity the qualification ecumenical is originally ( and still ) used in terms such as ecumenical council and ecumenical patriarch . the meaning pertains to the totality of the larger church ( such as the catholic church or the orthodox church ) . it is not restricted to one of its local churches or dioceses .
