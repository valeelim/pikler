Australopithecus garhi     australopithecus garhi is a gracile australopithecine species discovered in ethiopia . the remains of this hominin are believed to be a human ancestor species , and perhaps the ancestor of the human genus `` homo '' . the fossils were found in 1996 in the bouri formation . this is in the middle awash of ethiopia 's afar depression . some primitive shaped stone tool artifacts closely resembling olduwan technology were discovered with the `` a. garhi '' fossils , dating back roughly 2.5 and 2.6 million years old . the tools are thought to be older than those found with `` homo habilis '' , which may be a direct ancestor of more modern hominins . for a long time anthropologists assumed that only members of early genus `` homo '' had the ability to produce sophisticated tools . at another site in bouri , ethiopia , roughly 3,000 stone artifacts had been found to be about 2.5 million years old in age . `` australopithecus garhi '' may have been the species responsible for making and using these earliest stone tools .
