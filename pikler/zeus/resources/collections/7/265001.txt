Quatour pour la fin du temps     quatuor pour la fin du temps is a piece of chamber music by the french composer olivier messiaen . in english -speaking countries it is often called by the english title quartet for the end of time . the piece is written for an unusual combination of four instruments : clarinet ( in b-flat ) , violin , cello , and piano . there are 8 movements . it takes about 50 minutes to perform . the work was first performed in unusual circumstances in 1941. it is a very important work in the history of 20th century classical music . there was a special reason why messiaen wrote this work for an unusual combination of instruments . in 1940 , when world war ii was being fought , germany invaded france . messiaen was captured by the german army and he was held as a prisoner of war . while being taken to the prisoner of war camp , messiaen talked to another prisoner , henri akoka , who was a clarinettist . messiaen showed him the sketches for a clarinet piece he was writing called `` abîme des oiseaux '' . two other professional musicians were also among the prisoners : jean le boulaire , a violinist and étienne pasquier , a cellist . messiaen composed the `` quatuor '' for these three musicians with himself at the piano . the combination of these four instruments is unusual , although paul hindemith had written a work for the same combination in 1938 .
