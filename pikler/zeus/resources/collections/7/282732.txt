Xiphosura     xiphosura is an order of marine chelicerates . it includes a large number of extinct lines and only four recent species in the family limulidae , which include the horseshoe crabs . the group has hardly changed in millions of years . the modern horseshoe crabs look almost identical to prehistoric genera such as the jurassic `` mesolimulus '' , and are considered to be living fossils . xiphosura are traditionally placed in the class merostomata . this term was originally made for the eurypterids ; now , with the xiphosura added , it is known to be paraphyletic . although the name merostomata is still seen in textbooks , without reference to the eurypterida , some have urged that this usage should be discouraged . the shared features of the two groups traditionally grouped in the merostomata are now thought to be retentions of primitive conditions ( symplesiomorphies ) . the xiphosura is basal to a clade comprising eurypterida and arachnida . it is estimated that the xiphosura diverged from the arachnida 480 million years ago .
