Hominina     hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates . it is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes , including the genus `` homo '' . if an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe hominini , then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put australopithecines and humans in . but this is not a majority view at present , and the mainstream view is : - family : hominidae - subfamily : homininae - tribe : hominini - subtribe : hominina ( not used ) if used , the group includes `` sahelanthropus '' six to eight million years ago . even today , the genus `` homo '' has not been properly defined . because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members , carl linnaeus did not even bother to define `` homo '' when he first created it for humans in the 18th century . the discovery of neanderthals brought the first addition . the genus `` homo '' was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human . over the decades of the 20th century , there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late miocene and early pliocene times .
