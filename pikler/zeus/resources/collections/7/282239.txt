Graphics Device Interface     the graphics device interface is an api of microsoft windows used for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output devices , such as printers and monitors . gdi is responsible for tasks such as drawing lines and curves , rendering fonts and handling palettes . it is not directly responsible for drawing windows , menus , etc . ; that task is reserved for another subsystem built on top of gdi . other systems have components that are similar to gdi , for example macintosh 's quickdraw and gnome/gtk 's gdk/xlib . perhaps the most significant capability of gdi over more direct methods of accessing the hardware is its scaling capabilities , and abstraction of target devices . using gdi , it is very easy to draw on multiple devices , such as a screen and a printer , and expect proper reproduction in each case . this capability is at the center of all what you see is what you get applications for microsoft windows . simple games that do not require fast graphics rendering use gdi . however , gdi can not animate properly as it has no notion of synchronizing with the framebuffer , and lacks rasterization for 3d . modern games usually use directx or opengl instead , which give programmers the capabilities to use features of modern hardware .
