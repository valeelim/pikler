Doctor-patient relationship     the relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine . only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare . this relationship is also at the base of medical ethics . many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients , to respect the patients ' dignity and privacy . this relationship has asymmetric information though . the doctor knows more than the patient , but has to explain the patient 's situation , and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done . there is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses , psychologists . there are different legal norms that regulate this relationship . examples of such norms are the hippocratic oath , the declaration of geneva . professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship . ideally , patient and doctor trust each other . if they do , this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition . healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs , of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed .
