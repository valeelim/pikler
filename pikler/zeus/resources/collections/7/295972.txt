Seed fern     the term seed ferns ( pteridospermatophyta ) are several distinct groups of extinct seed plants ( spermatophytes ) . the oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from upper devonian strata , and they flourished particularly during the carboniferous and permian periods . pteridosperms declined during the mesozoic era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the cretaceous , though some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into eocene times in tasmania . the concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features like cycads . british palaeobotanists made the critical discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds , and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants . initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads , and especially in the english-speaking world they were referred to as `` seed ferns '' or `` pteridosperms '' . today , most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading , but the names have nevertheless stuck .
