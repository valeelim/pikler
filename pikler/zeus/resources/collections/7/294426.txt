Parabola     the parabola ( from the greek παραβολή ) is a type of curve . menaechmus ( 380–320 bc ) discovered the parabola , and apollonius of perga ( 262 bc–c190 bc ) first named it . a parabola is a conic section . if a cone is dissected by a plane which is parallel to one of the surfaces of the cone , the result is a parabola . the point where the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum is called the `` vertex . '' at this point the curvature of the parabola is greatest . each parabola has a focal point . any ray that enters the parabola and is parallel to the axis of symmetry will pass through this point after being reflected by the curve . because of this fact , parabolas are important in devices such as satellite dishes , or magnifying mirrors . parabolas are often used to approximate curves that are more difficult to model by themselves . every parabola uses the equation formula_1 , where formula_2 , formula_3 and formula_4 are constants , and formula_2 is not equal to formula_6 .
