Andrea Moda Formula     andrea moda formula , commonly referred to as andrea moda , was a formula one team which raced in the 1992 formula one season . it was founded by andrea sassetti , who owned a shoe maker in italy . in 1991 sassetti bought the old coloni f1 team which had failed to get through pre-qualifying . the team was excluded from the opening race in south africa after not paying the required $ 100,000 entry fee for new teams . sassetti argued that the team was a continuation of the coloni team . even still , the car was not ready , as the team did not participate in the next race in mexico . even though the team was entered in the next race , in brazil , with drivers roberto moreno and perry mccarthy , the cars were still not ready . at the fifth race in san marino the car was finally ready but mccarthy did not receive his super license , which is required to race a f1 car . however , moreno finally qualified his car in monaco , only to retire during the race due to an engine problem . in canada , the team did not have engines because sassetti did not pay the engine supplier , judd , the money . the team also missed france due to their car being stuck in a blockade by french truck drivers .
