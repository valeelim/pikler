Notoceratops     notoceratops ( meaning `` southern horned face '' ) was a ceratopsian dinosaur known only from a late cretaceous jaw bone . `` notoceratops '' walked on four sturdy legs , had a large head , a bulky body , a parrot-like beak , cheek teeth , and a small frill on its head . notoceratops was named by augusto tapia in 1918 from a partial lower jaw found in chubut , argentina . this original `` notoceratops bonarelli '' is missing and there is some doubt as to whether or not this fossil was actually a ceratopsian .
