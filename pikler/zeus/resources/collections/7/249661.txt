Handedness     handedness is the preference for using either the left or the right side of the body for certain things . people are described as left-handed or right-handed when they prefer to write with their left or their right hand . they may prefer the use of certain hands for certain tasks . handedness is caused by the lateralisation of brain function . lateralisation is not only found in humans : it is found in many kinds of animals . purposeful movements of the limbs are controlled by the pyramidal motor system in the cerebral cortex . as the motor nerve fibres move down through the lower part of the brain , they cross over to the opposite side of the body . so , the movements on each side are controlled by the opposite side of the brain . handedness seems to follow from the brain hemisphere division of labor . since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking , right-handedness predominates . this theory predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor . however , many animals also have handedness . for example : elephants often have preferences for whether they swing their trunks to the left or the right . honeybees have right antennas that are more sensitive to smells . parrots can be left- or right-footed , and some don ’ t mind ( they are “ ambidextrous ” ) . animals as different as chickens and minnows like to look for food with one eye and look out for predators ( animals that might eat them ) with the other . this seems to help them to do two things at once .
