Poisson's ratio    poisson 's ratio poisson 's ratio ( letter `` v '' ) is a measure of the contraction that happens when an object is stretched . this contraction is perpendicular to the stretching force . it can also expand as the object is compressed in a perpendicular direction . for example , if a block is being stretched as shown in the image to the right , the equation for the poisson 's ratio will be : poisson 's ratio ranges from 0.0-0.5 for common materials , though for materials with certain structures , can be as low as -1. a material with a poisson 's ratio close to 0 ( like cork ) can be stretched a lot in the axial direction without changing much at all in the transverse , where as pulling on a material with a high poisson 's ratio ( like rubber ) will cause it to become much more narrow . a material with a negative poisson 's ratio will expand in all directions as it is stretched .
