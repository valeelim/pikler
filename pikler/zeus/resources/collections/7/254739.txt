Paso doble     the paso doble is a dance and music based on the spanish bullfight . it is the music played at bullfights at the procession of the bullfighters , between stages , and at the end of each session . the dance is based on the way matadors perform in the ring . in the dance , the man takes the part of the matador , and the woman takes the part of the man 's cape ( `` not '' the bull ! ) . the man 's stance ( the way he stands ) should be proud , and when he has a free arm it should be held slightly bent , rather as matadors do . the photograph of the ice dancers gives a perfect example of what dancers should aim for in this style . the paso doble is one of the five international latin ballroom dances . it gives a very good contrast in style with the four other dances . although so spanish in style and origin , the dance techniques were first developed in paris . later , in mid 20th century london , the latin and american dances took on their present form . the music is scored in 2/4 time . it is a march-like type of music , and as a dance it is a two-step ( `` paso doble '' = two-step ) . it is played at about 60/62 bars ( measures ) a minute for dancers .
