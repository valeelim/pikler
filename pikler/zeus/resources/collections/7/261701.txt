Hanja     hanja is the korean word for chinese characters . it is about the chinese characters that are borrowed from the chinese language and used in the korean language with korean pronunciation . `` hanja-mal '' or `` hanja-eo '' is about words which can be written with hanja . `` hanmun '' ( 한문 ) is about the chinese classical writing , but `` hanja '' can sometimes be used to generally mean `` hanmun '' too . hanja was never very greatly changed , so many of the chinese characters are often entirely the same as traditional chinese . only a few hanja characters are unique to korea . in the 1440s , however , a korean alphabet relying on sound was made by a group of scholars , led by king sejong the great . it was not widely used at first . however , by the early 19th and 20th century it was more widely used than `` hanja '' , and it is now the official language of korea . but until then , everyone mostly read and wrote in `` hanja '' , so most of the older books in korean literature are written in hanja . scholars who learn korean history learn hanja to read historical papers . children in korea still learn hanja , for many korean words still have roots in hanja .
