Jaguar Racing     jaguar racing was a formula one team which raced from 2000 to 2004. it comes from stewart grand prix . ford bought the team in june 1999 and was to be renamed to jaguar racing to promote their jaguar brand . for their first season in 2000 , the team hired former stewart gp driver johnny herbert and the 1999 championship runner-up ( second place ) eddie irvine . however , the team only finished in the points twice during the season . in 2001 , herbert was replaced by luciano burti , who was replaced four races in the season by pedro de la rosa . although the team got double the amount of points finishes in 2001 , including a podium ( top three ) in monaco , this did not help the fact that the team did not have the same success as stewart gp got in 1999. in 2002 the team got worse , with three points finishes ( but a podium in italy ) , and a lot of financial ( money ) issues . cutbacks were announced for the 2003 season , which included money savings , and a layoff ( mass sackings of employees ) . in 2003 , with a improved points system which allowed eight drivers to finish in the points , jaguar racing benefitted from this as they finished in the points eight times , with drivers mark webber , ant√¥nio pizzonia , and justin wilson replacing pizzonia for the last five races . 2004 was to be the last season for jaguar , keeping webber , and hiring christian klien for the whole season . five points finishes would follow , though financial difficulties would result in the team being bought out by red bull , then the team was renamed to red bull racing .
