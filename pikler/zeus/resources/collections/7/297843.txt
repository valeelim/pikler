Ultravioletâ€“visible absorption     uv-visible absorption is a process where a molecule absorbs ultraviolet or visible light that excites electrons ( makes them high energy ) . this energy causes an electronic transition from a ground state ( non excited ) to an excited state . this is used in a technique of absorption spectroscopy known as uv-visible spectroscopy . different molecules will absorb different wavelengths of light . the wavelengths of light for uv-visible absorption are from about 200 nanometers to 800 nanometers . this is a section of the electromagnetic spectrum pictured . absorption of light starts with energy of a certain wavelength in this uv-visible region being exposed to a molecule . the light/energy then excites the ground state ( non excited ) outer or valence electrons to an excited state ( high energy ) . the outcome of this can be measured by a uv-visible spectrophotometer . the data is shown as a spectrum with absorption versus wavelength . this pattern can be used to learn properties of the molecule . only certain molecules can absorb light in this region .
