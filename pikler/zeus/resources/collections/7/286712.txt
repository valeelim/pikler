Water park     a water park ( occasionally written as `` waterpark '' ) is an amusement park that features water play areas , such as water slides , splash pads , spraygrounds ( water playgrounds ) , lazy rivers , or other recreational bathing , swimming , and barefooting environments . water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or flowrider . water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s . the united states has the largest and most concentrated water park market , with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year . major organizations are iaapa ( international association of amusement parks and attractions ) and wwa ( world waterpark association ) . water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example , splash universe water park resort , a member of the world water park association , is themed to match the community in which it is located . the theme is intended to enhance the communities ' destination appeal . therefore , the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides . a process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme- , amusement- , and water parks . some water parks are more spa-oriented ; e.g . schwaben quellen , a member of european waterparks association ( ewa ) has no water slides , but instead has many saunas , steam rooms , `` adventure showers '' , and relaxation-oriented water play areas .
