Grade (education)    grade ( education ) grades are a teacher 's evaluation of a student 's performance . they are often letters ( e.g . a , b , c , d , f , ) or numbers ( e.g . 1-10 . ) , although in some countries they do not use either of these systems . letter grades are most commonly used in the united states and some others . the grades d or c are usually enough to pass . grades can also be on a number scale . typically a midpoint score is a pass . sometimes the numbers can go in descending order to indicate better performance . a `` grade point average '' , or gpa , takes the grade ( s ) of a student and assigns point values to them . these points are added up and divided to calculate the gpa .
