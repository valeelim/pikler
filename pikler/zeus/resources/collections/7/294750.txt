Aye-aye     the aye-aye ( `` daubentonia madagascariensis '' ) is a lemur which lives in rain forests of madagascar , a large island off the southeast coast of africa . this solitary animal is nocturnal ( most active at night ) . the aye-aye spends most of its time in trees . during the day , it sleeps in a nest in the fork of a tree . it builds the nest out of leaves and twigs . the aye-aye has rodent-like teeth and a special thin middle finger to get at the insect grubs under tree bark . it fills the same ecological niche as woodpeckers do elsewhere . it taps on trees to find grubs , then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors . then it sticks in its middle finger to pull the grubs out . lemurs are primates , and so are related to monkeys , apes , and people .
