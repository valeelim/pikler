Giant impact hypothesis     the giant impact hypothesis is that the moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young earth and a mars-sized protoplanet . this is the favoured scientific hypothesis for the formation of the moon . evidence for this hypothesis comes from moon samples which show that : 1. the surface of the moon was once molten 1. the moon 's apparently relatively small iron core and a lower density than the earth , and 1. evidence of similar collisions in other star systems ( which result in 'debris disks ' ) the colliding body is sometimes called theia for the mythical greek titan who was the mother of selene , the goddess of the moon . there are several unanswered issues with this hypothesis . lunar oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to earth , with no evidence of a contribution from another solar body . also , lunar samples do not have expected ratios of volatile elements , iron oxide , or siderophilic elements ( chemical elements which bond with iron ) , and there is no evidence that the earth ever had the magma ocean implied by the hypothesis .
