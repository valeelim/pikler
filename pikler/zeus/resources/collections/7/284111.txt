Gene targeting     gene targeting is a genetic technique for replacing an existing gene with a mutated ( changed ) one . it can be done in lab mice or some other model organism . the method can be used to delete a gene , remove control sections , add a gene , and introduce point mutations . gene targeting can be permanent or conditional . conditions , for example , can be a specific time during development in the life of the organism or limited to a specific tissue . to date , this method has been applied to a number of species including `` drosophila melanogaster '' , tobacco , corn , human cells . mice , and rats . mario r. capecchi , martin j. evans and oliver smithies were awarded the 2007 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on `` principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells '' , in other words , gene targeting . first a dna construct is made , usually in bacteria . the construct has the mutated gene or part of it , and a reporter gene , which may be a selectable marker . mutated dna is put into a stem cell genome derived from an embryo .
