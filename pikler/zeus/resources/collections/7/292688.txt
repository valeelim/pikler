Balkan Wars     the balkan wars were a series of wars fought in the balkan peninsula in 1912 ( first balkan war ) and 1913 ( second balkan war ) . the first balkan war was fought by greece , serbia , montenegro and bulgaria ( the balkan league ) against the ottoman empire . the main objective of the balkan league was to annex the european territories of the ottoman empire , because large numbers of the people of the balkan league lived under ottoman rule . the war was a success and the ottoman empire lost almost its entire european territories . the second balkan war was fought by greece , serbia , the ottoman empire and romania against bulgaria . because bulgaria felt that greece and serbia got more lands than they deserved , bulgaria declared war on greece and serbia , which repelled the attacks . the ottoman empire and romania declared war on bulgaria , because they wanted to gain bulgarian territories , and by the end of the second balkan war bulgaria had lost almost all its gains from the first balkan war .
