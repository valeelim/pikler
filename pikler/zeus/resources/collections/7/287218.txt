Mission (Christianity)    mission ( christianity ) christian churches often send individuals , or small groups of people to a foreign country . these people should then convince the local population to convert to the christian faith . very often , this couples evangelisation with humanitarian work . as well , the missionaries are priests , and can administer sacraments , but sometimes they are laypeople . today , missionary activity often means cooperating with the local church . as an example , the evangelical-lutheran church in tanzania has sent missionaries to mozambique . missionary work is often criticized for the ways used . examples are forced baptisms , proselytism , and that during colonial times , there were strong ties between colonialism and missionary work . sometimes , there is the problem that the moral standards of the societies are very different from the moral standards of christianity , missionary work will force different standards onto indigenous societies .
