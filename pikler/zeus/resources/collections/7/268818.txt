Henry Moore     his forms are usually abstractions of the human figure , typically mother-and-child or reclining figures . moore 's works usually suggest the female body , apart from a phase in the 1950s when he did family groups . his forms are generally pierced or have hollow spaces . some think the undulating form of his reclining figures reflect the landscape and hills of his birthplace , yorkshire . moore was born in castleford , the son of a mining engineer . he became known for his larger-scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures . his large-scale commissions made him exceptionally rich . yet he lived carefully and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the henry moore foundation . this supports education and promotion of the arts . he did some work in architecture . in 1955 moore did his only work in carved brick , `` wall relief '' at the bouwcentrum in rotterdam . the brick relief was sculpted with 16,000 bricks by two dutch bricklayers under moore 's supervision .
