Speciation     speciation is about how species form . it is a major part of evolutionary biology . darwin thought most species arose directly from pre-existing species . this is called anagenesis : species by changing , or 'phyletic evolution ' . now we think most species arise by previous species splitting : cladogenesis . the general view is that most species splitting is caused or helped on its way by isolating mechanisms . isolating mechanisms are things which prevent successful breeding between groups in a species . reproductive isolation of populations is established . this is particularly important to the biological species concept , as species are defined by reproductive isolation . isolating mechanisms can be divided into two groups , before and after fertilisation . factors which prevent individuals from mating . - geographic isolation : species occur in different areas , and are often separated by barriers . - temporal isolation : individuals do not mate because they are active at different times . this may be different times of the day or different seasons . the species mating periods may not match up . individuals do not encounter one another during either their mating periods , or at all .
