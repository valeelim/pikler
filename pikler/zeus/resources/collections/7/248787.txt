Pterygota     pterygota is a subclass of insects that includes the winged insects . it also includes insect orders that are secondarily wingless . that means insect groups whose ancestors once had wings but that have lost them later in evolution . the pterygota today includes almost all insects . that is because flying led to a great radiation of insect types . the groups without flight are in the apterygota . in the pterygota , are the palaeoptera and the neoptera . the palaeoptera is paraphyletic , and its classification is being discussed . likewise the exopterygota . there are no agreed alternatives at present , so the taxonomy is left in its traditional form . the endopterygota is made up of all the insects which have complete metamorphosis . it is agreed to be a good monophyletic clade , even though some of the details may need to be adjusted .
