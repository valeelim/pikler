Spiraeoideae     the spiraeoideae is an old name for a subfamily of flowering plants in the family rosaceae . until 2007 , the subfamily name was used for a group of plants that are mostly shrubs ( but some are herbs ) and have small dry fruit . in 2007 , the subfamily was made much larger , to include plants that were previously placed in subfamilies amygdaloideae and maloideae . in 2012 , it was decided at the international botanical congress that the correct name for that large subfamily must be amygdaloideae . subfamily amygdaloideae now includes plants with fleshy fruit including apple and plum .
