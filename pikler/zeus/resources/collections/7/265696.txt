Barium hydroxide     barium hydroxide is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is ba ( oh ) . it contains barium and hydroxide ions . barium hydroxide is a white solid . it dissolves in water to make a basic solution . it decomposes to barium oxide when heated in a vacuum . it reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate . it reacts with any sulfate to make barium sulfate . it reacts with hydrogen sulfide to make barium sulfide . it is made by dissolving barium oxide in water . barium hydroxide is used in titrations . if sodium hydroxide solution is used , some sodium carbonate may be in there . it is less basic than sodium hydroxide , so the titration can be messed up . when barium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate , it forms a white solid that can be removed . it is used as a strong base in organic chemistry . it is used to clean up sulfuric acid spills by making barium sulfate . it can also be used for removing ink marks from clothes . barium hydroxide is corrosive because it is basic . it is also toxic because of barium ions .
