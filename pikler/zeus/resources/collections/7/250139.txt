Implication and inference     implication and inference are two related words which are opposites . to imply is to suggest something is true without actually saying it . examples : 1 . `` your former wife '' : suggests you did have a wife to whom you are no longer married . 1 . `` have you stopped beating your wife ? '' suggests not only that you have a wife , but that you have been in the habit of beating her . to infer is to see the implication in the sentence . when you realise the meaning of the second sentence , and protest `` i have never beaten her '' , you have made an inference . here are the rules : - the person who makes the suggestion implies it . - the person who recognises the suggestion infers it ( or `` draws an inference '' ) . - inference always comes after an implication : i imply , then you infer . an implication is always verbal , but inferring is not always verbal . a non-verbal response might show the indirect message ( implication ) had been accurately interpreted ( inferred ) by the receiver . example : `` i hate you '' ! may contain unspoken implications , according to circumstance and tone of voice . between two lovers it might mean :
