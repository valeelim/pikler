Hedge     a hedge or hedgerow is a close-knit row of shrubs and sometimes tree species . they were usually planted and `` trained '' to form a barrier . they marked the boundary of an area , and so were a sign of possession . livestock farmers use them to prevent cattle straying out of fields . animals which can not usually be contained in fields ( hill sheep for example ) need a man and dog to look after them , which is an expense . hedges were much more common before modern agriculture . modern crop farming uses machines to gather the crop , and so hedges have all but disappeared in some areas . when hedges are first laid , they are usually all of one species . but over hundreds of years , the number of species in a hedge gradually increases , and often includes fully-grown trees . there are many hedges in europe which have been there for 500 or a thousand years . making hedges into ornaments is a skill called topiary . sometimes , hedges are made into mazes . hedges are vitally important to small birds and mammals . in the modern world they play the role which thick forest undergrowth would have played in an ancient ecology . the nests in a hedge or thicket often can not be got at by larger predators . obviously tiny birds like robins or finches choose safe places to nest , and if they can not , then their brood is unlikely to survive .
