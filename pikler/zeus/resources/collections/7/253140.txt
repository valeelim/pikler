Kinorhyncha     kinorhyncha is a phylum of small ( 1 mm or less ) marine invertebrates . they are widespread in mud or sand at all depths of the sea . they are also called mud dragons . about 150 species are known . kinorhynchs eat either diatoms or organic material found in the mud , depending on species . kinorhynchans are segmented , limbless animals , with a body consisting of a head , neck , and a trunk of eleven segments . unlike some similar invertebrates , they do not have external cilia , but instead have a number of spines along the body , plus up to seven circles of spines around the head . these spines are used for movement , withdrawing the head and pushing forward , then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body . the body wall consists of a thin layer , which secretes a tough cuticle ; this is molted several times while growing to adulthood . this layer is a syncytium , containing nuclei , but no cell membranes . the spines are moveable extensions of the body wall , and are hollow and covered by cuticle . the head is completely retractable , and is covered by a set of neck plates called `` placids '' when retracted .
