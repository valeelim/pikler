Theme restaurant     theme restaurants are restaurants in which the idea for the restaurant takes priority over everything else . it influences the architecture , food , music , and overall `` feel '' of the restaurant . the food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme . these restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself . one example is the `` rainforest cafe '' restaurants which have the obvious theme of a `` tropical rainforest '' . `` medieval times '' has its theme of `` medieval europe '' . the `` jekyll & hyde club '' has an atmosphere of jack the ripper and victorian horror novels . one strange but famous theme restaurant in berlin , germany is called `` das klo '' ( german for `` the toilet '' ) . it shows the insides of a toilet . many people consider the rainforest cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant . they also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend . theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity , given the closings of several planet hollywood , jekyll & hyde club , and wilderness cafe locations in recent years . theme restaurants often depend on tourist business , since the theme soon becomes stale to locals . the focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service . certain tourist destinations such as the mall of america or orlando , florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants . theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks , such as universal studios .
