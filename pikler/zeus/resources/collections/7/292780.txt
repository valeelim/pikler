Ragdoll     the ragdoll is a cat breed that is large , with blue eyes , and a semi-longhair soft and silky coat of fur . it is usually mostly white , with light to dark marks . the ragdoll was first bred by an american breeder named ann baker from a persian-like cat ( without a pedigree ) and a birman cat with the siamese colorpoint gene . it is similar in appearance to the himalayan , which was bred directly from the persian and siamese . the ragdoll is gentle , easy going , and affectionate . the breed was named `` ragdoll '' because they often go limp and relax like a rag or cloth doll when it is picked up . the original mother cat that the breed was created from was involved in a car accident , but contrary to popular belief , this is not why the breed goes limp when picked up ( injuries from an accident are not passed on to offspring genetically ) . ragdoll is a breed that enjoys being around humans and it may follow its owner around the house . due to its soft nature , it is strictly recommended to be an indoor only cat .
