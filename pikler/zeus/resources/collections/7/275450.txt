Strange quark     strange quarks are the third lightest quarks , which are subatomic particles that are so small , they are believed to not be able to be divided . like down quarks , strange quarks have a charge of -1/3 . like all fermions ( which are particles that can not exist in the same place at the same time ) , strange quarks have a spin of 1/2 . what makes strange quarks different from down quarks–apart from having 25 times the mass of down quarks–is that they have something that scientists call `` strangeness . '' strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism . this means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force ( or electromagnetism ) , but instead with the much slower weak force . it was believed that this was a 'strange ' method of decay , which is why the scientists gave the particles that name . strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaons and some hyperons . scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have . however , it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over 16 years to predict it after the discovery of kaons .
