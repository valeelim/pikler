MOX fuel     mixed-oxide fuel ( or mox fuel ) is nuclear fuel that contains an oxide of more than one element . most nuclear fuel that is not of the mox type only contains uranium dioxide . in most cases , the additional oxide will be plutonium dioxide , sometimes thorium dioxide . any reactor that uses uranium-based fuel will produce plutonium dioxide . mox fuel consists of about 93 % uranium , and about 7 % of thorium or plutonium dioxide . one of the benefits of using mox-type fuel is that the plutonium dioxide that is produced , can be re-used for energy generation . certain types of nuclear power plants need plutonium to work properly .
