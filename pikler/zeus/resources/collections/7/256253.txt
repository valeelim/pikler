Ice algae     ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on long-lasting snow and ice fields like glaciers . when liquid water is available between the snow and ice crystals , they may color the surface green , yellow or red during the summer months . the red pigment of some species is an intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun , which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutations . without it , the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and dna mutations . there are also ice algal communities on sea ice . these algae ( mainly diatoms ) are important in polar ecosystems ( especially antarctica ) because they provide food for krill . krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice , which is colored brown by the algae . the algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them , in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals . `` chlamydomonas nivalis '' is a green microalga which causes , besides other closely relative species , watermelon snow .
