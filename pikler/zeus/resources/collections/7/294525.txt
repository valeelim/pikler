Homo cepranensis     homo cepranensis is a proposed name for a human species , known from only one skull cap discovered in 1994. the fossil was discovered by archeologist italo biddittu and was nicknamed `` ceprano man '' after a nearby town in the province of frosinone , 89 kilometers southeast of rome , italy . the age of the fossil is estimated to be between 350,000 to 500,000 years old . [ 3 ] an adjacent site , fontana ranuccio , was dated to 487,000 +/- 6000 years and muttoni et al . suggest that ceprano is most likely 450,000 years old . the cranial features on the bone seem to be intermediate between those found on `` homo erectus '' and those of later species such as `` homo heidelbergensis '' which dominated europe long before `` homo neanderthalensis '' . there is yet not enough material to make a complete analysis of the individual .
