Type 1 diabetes     diabetes mellitus type 1 , also called type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results in high blood sugar . people with this condition are insulin dependent - they require insulin injections without which they may die . people with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of stroke , heart disease or gangrene . about 15 % of people with diabetes have type 1. type 1 diabetes is a condition caused by a lack of insulin in the body . insulin is a hormone produced by cells in the pancreas . insulin is responsible for moving sugars out of the blood and into cells to be used for energy . if insulin is not made , the body will search for other ways to get the sugars needed to feed the body 's cells , including breaking down muscle and fat , leading to a loss of weight . insulin is not being produced in the pancreas due to an autoimmune condition attacking its cells . the body 's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas , the beta cell , damaging the cells in a way the prevents them from producing more insulin . as more and more cells are damaged , less insulin is produced in the body . this means that more sugar remains in the bloodstream rather then being moved into cells . this high blood sugar causes the symptoms seen in type 1 diabetes .
