Hamilton Smith     hamilton othanel smith ( born august 23 , 1931 ) is an american microbiologist and a nobel prize winner . he was jointly awarded the 1978 nobel prize in physiology or medicine . he is a leader in the field of genomics . hamilton smith was , with craig venter , a leader in the celera corporation 's bid to analyse and sell information about the human genome . the basic idea was to find ways to make dna sequencing cheaper so that everyone could have their dna analysed . then the information could be used for medical purposes . smith 's award was for the discovery of restriction enzymes . these are enzymes that cut dna at specific places . such enzymes , found in bacteria and archaea , probably evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses . inside a bacterial host , the restriction enzymes selectively cut up `` foreign '' dna . host dna is modified so it does not get cut up . together , these two processes are called the restriction modification system . to cut the dna , a restriction enzyme makes two cuts , once through each sugar-phosphate backbone ( i.e . each strand ) of the dna double helix .
