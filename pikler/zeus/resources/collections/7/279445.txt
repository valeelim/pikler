Negative feedback     negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics ; it is the basis of regulation and control . it is important in engineering and physiology . in biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis . negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system . this has the result that the changes are made less , and the system kept within limits . the classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a ( suitably placed ) temperature sensor hits a pre-set mark . the negative feedback part is the thermostat . virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis , and disease follows when any of these systems fail . examples : blood pressure , glucose level , liver functions , cell division , and so on . homeostasis was defined by claude bernard and later by walter bradford cannon in 1926 , 1929 and 1932 is the property of a system , either open or closed , that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable , constant condition . the concept came from that of `` milieu interieur '' which was created by claude bernard and published in 1865 .
