Maya calendar     the maya calendar is a system of calendars and almanacs used in the maya civilization of pre-columbian mesoamerica , and in some modern maya communities in highland guatemala . it shares many aspects with calendars employed by other earlier mesoamerican civilizations , such as the zapotec and olmec , and contemporary or later ones such as the mixtec and aztec calendars . although the mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the maya , their subsequent extensions and refinements of it were the most sophisticated . along with those of the aztecs , the maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood . there are three main maya calendars : the 260 day ritual calendar called `` tzolk'in '' , the 365 day `` haab '' ' , and the `` long count '' . approximately 52 years pass before the haab and tzolkin calendars converge and are back in the same alignment . this is called the calendar round . the tzolk'in is still in use today by the ixil , kek'chi and quiche peoples of the guatemalan highlands .
