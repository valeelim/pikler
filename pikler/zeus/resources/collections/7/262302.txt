V6 engine     a v6 engine , often just called a v6 , is an internal combustion engine with six cylinders . the engine has three cylinders on each side called banks . the two banks form a `` v '' shaped angle . in most engines , the two banks are at a right angle ( 90Â° ) or less to each other . all six pistons turn a common crankshaft . it is the second most common engine design in modern cars after the inline four . it can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel , natural gas and alcohol . the v6 is a very compact engine design . it is shorter than the straight-4 . many v6 engines are narrower than the v8 engine . they work well and are well suited to the popular transverse engine front-wheel drive cars . it has largely replaced the inline-6 , which is too long to fit in many modern cars . it is more complicated and not as smooth as the inline-6 . the v6 is more compact , more rigid , and less prone to vibrations . it is also becoming a high performance engine . it has high power and torque output like the classic v8 , but has good fuel economy .
