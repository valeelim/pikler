Homology     a homologous trait is any characteristic which is derived by evolution from a common ancestor . this is contrasted to analogous traits : similarities between organisms that were evolved separately . the term existed before 1859 , but got its modern meaning after darwin established the idea of common descent . the pre-darwinian naturalists cuvier , geoffroy and richard owen , also used the idea . a homologous trait is often called a homolog ( also spelled homologue ) . in genetics , the term `` homolog '' is used both to refer to a homologous protein , and to the gene ( dna sequence ) encoding it . according to russell , we owe to richard owen the first clear distinction between homologous and analogous organs . owen 's definitions were : the distinction is made clear by examples such as the ear ossicles of mammals . these little bones have , in the course of several hundred million years of evolution , made their way from the gill covers of fish to the rear jaw bones of synapsids to their present position in the ear of mammals . in the fossil record is evidence of this , and also in embryology . as the embryo develops , the cartilage hardens to form bone . later in development , tiny bone structures break loose from the jaw and migrate to the inner ear area . the ear ossicles are homologous with the jaw bones and the gill covers , but not analogous .
