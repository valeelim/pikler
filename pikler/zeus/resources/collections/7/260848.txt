Behaviorism     behaviourism is an approach to study behaviour based only what can be directly seen . behaviorists focus on relationships between stimuli and responses . unseen qualities such as states of mind ( any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state e.g . as a result of fear or anxiety ) were not used in this type of study even though we know that the mind plays a part in all advanced animals ' behaviors . behaviourism states that behaviour can be studied without knowing what the physiology of an event is , and without using theories such as that of the mind . by definition , all behaviour can be observed . behaviorism also relied on another idea , that all human behaviour was learned . behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or operant conditioning . this is learning as a result of influences from past experiences . however , behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours , instincts ( inherent inclination of a living organism ) , or inherited tendency to behave . they did not believe , or ignored , the idea of heredity ( passing of traits to offspring from parents ) , that something can come from a person 's genes . this was the idea of the blank slate , that babies are born with a clean , empty mind . humans , when born , are thought not have mental experience or knowledge , and that everything is learned after they grow.. the blank slate premise is opposed by modern evolutionary psychology .
