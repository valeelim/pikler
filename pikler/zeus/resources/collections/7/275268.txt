Kaon     kaons are a specific type of meson ( mesons are particles made of one quark and one antiquark ) . what makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark , and one strange quark . ( one of the two quarks that make of a kaon must be an antiquark , and the other must be normal matter . for example , a kaon can be made of one up quark and an strange antiquark ) . the discovery of kaons was significant because it proved the existence of yet another flavour ( type ) of quark , the strange quark . there are four types of kaons , but two of them are relatively easy to understand . there is the k and the k. the + and 0 above the letter k refer to whether the charge is positive , or 0 ( neutral ) . the k is made of one up quark , and one strange antiquark . since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart ( and since normal strange quarks have a charge of -1/3 ) , 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 charge , or simply a + charge . ( also because antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart , if you change the up quark in a k to an up antiquark and the strange antiquark to a normal strange quark , you get the opposite charge , forming a k ) . since down quarks and strange quarks have the same charge , if either one of them is an antiparticle , the overall charge is zero . therefore , a k can either be made of one down quark and strange antiquark , or one down antiquark and one normal strange quark .
