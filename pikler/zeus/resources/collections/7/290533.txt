Paraphyly     paraphyly is a term in cladistics . it means a group which does not include all its descendents . so sauropsida without birds is paraphyletic , since birds are definitely descended from archosaurs , probably small theropod dinosaurs ( origin of birds ) . paraphyly is corrected to monophyly when the missing group ( s ) are included . so if birds are included in sauropsida , the larger group is then monophyletic . traditional classification is often paraphyletic .
