Gelug     the gelug or gelug-pa , is a school of tibetan buddhism founded by je tsongkhapa ( 1357–1419 ) , a philosopher and tibetan religious leader . the first monastery he established was at ganden , and to this day the ganden tripa is the nominal head of the school , though its most famous person is the dalai lama . there are others gelug masters , like trijang rinpoche and ling rinpoche . tsongkhapa was a big promoter of the kadampa ( bka'-gdams-pa ) teachings and the mahāyāna principle of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation . he combined this with a strong emphasis on the cultivation of in-depth insight into the doctrine of emptiness as taught by the indian masters nāgārjuna ( 2nd century ) and candrakīrti ( 7th century ) . tsongkhapa said that these two aspects of the spiritual path , compassion and insight into wisdom , must be rooted in a big wish for liberation driven by a genuine sense of renunciation . he called these the `` three principal aspects of the path '' , and said that it is on the basis of these three that one must embark on the profound path of vajrayāna buddhism .
