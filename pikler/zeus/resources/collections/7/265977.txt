History of astronomy     the history of astronomy describes the ideas of earlier civilisations . it also discusses the beginnings of modern astronomy . the babylonian astronomers viewed the universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean . this forms the start for early greek maps like those of anaximander and hecataeus of miletus . greek philosophers , seeing the movement of heavenly bodies , developed models of the universe based more on empirical evidence . the first model was proposed by eudoxus of cnidos . according to this model , space and time are infinite and eternal , the earth is spherical and stationary , and all other matter is confined to rotating concentric spheres . this model was brought into agreement with astronomical observations by ptolemy of alexandria , in the second century ad . his `` syntaxis mathematica '' , known as the `` almagest '' , was translated from greek to arabic , and from arabic to latin . it was first printed in 1515 , with another edition in 1528. however , not all greek scientists accepted the geocentric ( earth-centered ) model of the universe . the pythagorean philosopher philolaus thought the center of the universe was a `` central fire '' around which the earth , sun , moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion .
