Svante Arrhenius     svante august arrhenius ( 19 february 1859 â€“ 2 october 1927 ) was a nobel prize-winning swedish scientist who made discoveries in physics , chemistry and earth science . originally he was a physicist , but he won the 1903 nobel prize in chemistry , and was a founder of physical chemistry . later in life , he turned to other scientific problems . he was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide , from processes like the burning of fossil fuels , would cause global warming . his early work was on the conductivity of electrolytes . in 1884 , based on this work , he submitted a 150-page essay on electrolytic conductivity to university of uppsala for his doctorate . it did not impress the professors , and he received a low-class degree . later , extensions of this work would earn him the nobel prize in chemistry . the most important idea in the thesis was his explanation that neither pure salts nor pure water is a conductor , but solutions of salts in water are . arrhenius ' explanation was that in forming a solution , the salt splits up into charged particles ( which michael faraday had given the name ions many years earlier ) . faraday 's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis ; arrhenius ' idea was that , even in the absence of an electric current , solutions of salts contained ions . he proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions .
