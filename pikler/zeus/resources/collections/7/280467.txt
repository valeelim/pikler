Scottish Highlands     the scottish highlands is an historic region of scotland . it is the area to the north of the highland boundary fault . the fault separates the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks to the north from the softer sedimentary rocks of the scottish lowlands in the south . the highlands are divided in two parts . the great glen divides the grampian mountains to the southeast from the northwest highlands . the area is generally sparsely populated , with many mountain ranges , and includes the highest mountain in the british isles , ben nevis . before the 19th century the highlands was home to a much larger population but , for several reasons , the area is now one of the most sparsely populated in europe . the average population density in the highlands and islands is lower than that of sweden , norway , papua new guinea and argentina . the reasons for the low population include the harsh nature of the land . also , the outlawing of the traditional highland way of life after the jacobite rising of 1745 , the infamous highland clearances , and mass migration to urban areas during the industrial revolution all had their effects .
