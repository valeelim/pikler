Banded Stilt     the banded stilt , `` cladorhynchus leucocephalus '' , is a nomadic stilt from australia . it is a type of water bird known as a wader . the bird gets its name from the red-brown breast band found on breeding adults . this is mottled or completely absent in non-breeding adults and juveniles . its remaining feathers are pied ( black and white ) and the eyes are dark brown . the banded stilt stands between 35â€“45 cm tall . it is called the `` flamingo of australia '' , and the rottnest snipe on rottnest island , though not related to true snipes . they spend much of their life on the coast in river estuaries and on tidal flats , but they breed in the desert when the water conditions are suitable . they lay 3-4 white , brown or black eggs in nests scraped in the sand . banded stilts breed on islands created when dry salt lakes fill with water during a flood . they come to the lakes to eat the brine shrimp , `` paratemia '' . the eggs of the shrimp can lie in the dry lake beds for many years until the rains fall .
