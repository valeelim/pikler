Spiral galaxy     a spiral galaxy is a kind of galaxy that looks like a flat , slowly rotating disk with a bulge in the centre . it contains stars , gas , dust , dark matter and a supermassive black hole at its centre . galaxies were first listed in the 18th century by william herschel . the spiral galaxy as a type was first described by edwin hubble in his 1936 work `` the realm of the nebulae '' . they are named after their shape . the spiral arms are where young , hot stars are made , which is why they are brighter than the center of the galaxy . some spiral galaxies have yellow , 'fossil ' arms of older stars . the barred spiral galaxy is an important and common type of spiral galaxy . there are three other kinds of spiral galaxies . `` grand-design '' spiral galaxies have two well-shaped arms . `` multiple-arm '' spiral galaxies have more arms . in `` flocculent '' spiral galaxies , it is hard to see the arms at all . about 60 % of galaxies in the universe near us ( the 'local universe ' ) are spiral and irregular galaxies . they are mostly found in low-density parts of the universe , and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters .
