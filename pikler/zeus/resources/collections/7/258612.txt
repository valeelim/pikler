Flightless birds     flightless birds are birds which can not fly . they rely on their ability to run or swim , and have evolved from their flying ancestors . there are about 60 species living today , the best known being the ostrich , emu , cassowary , rhea , kiwi , and penguin . two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent ( or greatly reduced ) keel on their breastbone . the keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement . flightless birds also have more feathers than flying birds . new zealand has more species of flightless birds ( including the kiwis , several species of penguins , and the takahe ) than any other country . one reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago , there were no large land predators in new zealand . the main predators of flightless birds were larger birds . some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties . this implies that flight is a significant biological cost . as soon as birds do not need to fly , there is selection against flight .
