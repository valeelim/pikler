ISO 21482     iso 21482 is a standard that specifies a warning symbol to warn against the dangers of radiation . the warning is made of the trefoil on the top , which warns against radiations . there are lines towards the bottom . on the bottom left , there is a skull , which warns against poison . on the bottom right , there is a running figure , and an arrow pointing outside the sign . the color red was chosen because children said it expresses danger better than yellow . the gallup organization recommended the symbol , after showing it to 1650 people . the new symbol does not replace the old one , but it amends it . it was designed to show the danger of radiation to people who do not know about radiation , or who do not know the symbol for it . the symbol was developed because of nuclear accidents that happened because people opened containers with radioactive materials , such as the goi√¢nia accident in 1987 , or the samut prakan disaster near bangkok in 2000. the new symbol will not be placed on the containers . rather , it will directly placed on the substances emitting radiation , of the highest categories , 1 to 3. containers will continue to bear only the old symbol , as they do not pose a direct risk . this also applies to rooms with radiation sources or x-ray equipment in them .
