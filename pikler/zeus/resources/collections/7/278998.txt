Opsin     opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom . they change from a resting state to a signalling state by absorbing light . this activates the g protein , resulting in a signalling cascade which produces physiological responses . this process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction . five groups of opsins are involved in vision . another opsin found in the mammalian retina , melanopsin , is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex , but not in image-forming . one opsin allows vision in just a short stretch of wavelength . this is equivalent to seeing in only one colour . two opsins allow vision in two colours , and is usual in mammals . four opsins allows vision in full colour , and is usual in teleost fish , reptiles and birds . in mammals , only old world monkeys , apes and humans have trichromacy , full colour vision . it is thought – see evolution of colour vision – that mammals lost much of their colour vision capability during the long period in the mesozoic when they lived as mostly nocturnal animals .
