Dispersion     dispersion is the idea that the frequency of a wave influences its velocity ( speed ) . dispersion is most easily seen in light , when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism . when a white beam is shone at the prism , all of the colors in the light ( colour spectrum ) are slowed down when they meet the prism . each color then refracts ( bends ) at different angles , making us see a rainbow .
