Classical physics     classical physics is physics that was worked out before our more modern and complete theories . sir isaac newton made major contributions to our understanding of classical mechanics , mathematics , optics and other areas . many other scientists improved upon his work . newton observed that things in nature such as the falling of an apple occur the same way each time . for instance , a cannonball dropped from a tall building will strike the ground after the same length of time no matter how many times you drop it . it will be going the same speed each time that it hits the ground . newton made equations that let him such events . he called these equations the laws of physics . newton 's laws of physics have been tested both by s and by using them in doing jobs . sometimes other things with an and make the results come out a little wrong . for instance , in the example above , a powerful wind coming from directly below the cannonball could slow it down a little bit . but when people make efforts to get rid of these extra factors , the results of the experiments always get closer to what newton 's laws predict . or at least that was always the case for ordinary things and events .
