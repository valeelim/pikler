Hyperthermophile     hyperthermophiles are extremophile organisms that live best in very hot environments– from 60°c ( 140°f ) up to 100°c ( 212°f ) . the best temperature for hyperthermophiles to grow at is around 80°c ( 176°f ) . hyperthermophiles are mostly in the archaea domain , but some bacteria are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100°c ( 212°f ) as well . many hyperthermophiles are also able to tolerate other environmental extremes , like high acidity or radiation levels .
