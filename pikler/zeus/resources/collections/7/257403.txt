Hookah     a hookah is a type of glass water pipe used to smoke tobacco , or special hookah-tobacco called `` shisha '' . it can also be used for smoking herbal fruits . the hookah gained popularity under the reign of the ottoman dynasty . a hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat . the hookah has origins in arabia , persia , turkey , india and ancient china . ancient persian paintings depict people smoking hookahs . in the early 19th century , hookahs became popular with rich men , who often smoked them wearing smoking caps or fezzes and smoking jackets . the more colloquial terms `` hubble-bubble '' and `` hubbly-bubbly '' may be used in the region surrounding the red sea . the archaic form of this latter indian name `` hookah '' is most commonly used in english for historical reasons . it was in india that many english-speakers first sampled the effects of the water pipe . the writer william hickey wrote in his `` memoirs '' that shortly after his arrival in calcutta ( now kolkata ) , india in 1775 : the jar at the bottom of the hookah is filled with water sufficient to submerge a few inches of the body tube , which is sealed tightly to it . deeper water will only increase the inhalation force needed to use it . tobacco or tobacco-free molasses are placed inside the bowl at the top of the hookah . often the bowl is covered with perforated tin foil or a metal screen and coal placed on top . the foil or screen separates the coal and the tobacco , which minimizes inhalation of coal ash with the smoke and reduces the temperature the tobacco is exposed to , in order to prevent burning the tobacco directly .
