Stibine     stibine , also known as antimony hydride or hydrogen antimonide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is sbh . it is a covalent compound . it could be seen as having antimonide and hydrogen ions , or antimony and hydride ions . stibine is a colorless gas . it is very toxic . it has a bad smell like hydrogen sulfide . its structure is similar to ammonia . it can be found in the marsh test , a test for arsenic . antimony is reacted with a mixture of zinc and hydrochloric acid in a tube , making stibine . the stibine is heated and a shiny area of antimony is made in the heated part of the tube . stibine easily decomposes into antimony and hydrogen at room temperature . this decomposition can be explosive . it burns very easily in air to make antimony trioxide and water . it can be deprotonated by very strong bases . stibine melts at -88°c and boils at -17°c . stibine was first found in 1837. it was difficult to find its properties because people did not know of a good way to make it . in 1901 , alfred stock found a good way to make this gas and found most of its properties .
