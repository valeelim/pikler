Belemnite     belemnites ( or belemnoids ) are an extinct group of marine cephalopod , similar in many ways to the modern squid , and closely related to the modern cuttlefish . like them , the belemnites had an ink sac , but , unlike the squid , they had ten arms of roughly equal length , and no tentacles . the belemnites are a monophyletic group of superorder status , called the belemnoidea . there are four orders . the belemnites evolved from nautiloids , which are the basal group of cephalopods . well-formed belemnite guards can be found in rocks dating from the mississippian ( or lower carboniferous ) . belemnites were numerous during the jurassic and cretaceous periods , and their fossils are abundant in mesozoic marine rocks , often with their cousins the ammonites . the belemnites and ammonites become extinct at the end of the cretaceous period . like some modern squid , belemnite arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey . belemnites were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws .
