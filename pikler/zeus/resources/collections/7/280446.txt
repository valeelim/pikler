Highland Boundary Fault     the highland boundary fault is a geological fault that crosses scotland diagonally from arran and helensburgh on the west coast to stonehaven in the east . it separates two distinctly different regions : the highlands from the lowlands . the geological history of scotland can be understood as the result of two great tectonic events . the first was the formation of the global super-continent pangaea , the second was the break-up of pangaea to form the continents we know today . the fault is the middle of three great faults which run south-east to north-west across scotland . in the north there is the great glen fault , and in the south the southern uplands fault . further south , just over the border with england , is the iapetus suture , where the palaeo-iapetus ocean closed . these four major geological signs mark the ancient history of scotland . the highland boundary fault was active during the caledonian orogeny . this was a plate tectonic collision which took place from mid ordovician to mid devonian periods ( 520 to 400 million years ago ) , during the closure of the iapetus ocean .
