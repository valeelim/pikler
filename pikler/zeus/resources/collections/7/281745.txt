Display (zoology)    display ( zoology ) display is a form of animal behaviour , linked to survival of the species in various ways . one function of display is in courtship . in most species the male has a striking feature that is distinguished by colour , shape or size , used to attract a female . in many species the male has another , more cryptic , form out of the mating season . a related function is armament ( horns , teeth ) exhibited and used by 'tournament ' species . in these species , males fight to gain the 'right ' to breed . the display part of the process is a mechanism for younger males to avoid being damaged by prime males . instinctive behaviour prompts lesser males to leave the field . peafowl , deer , antelope and elephant seals are good examples . the other main function is in species which have territorial display behaviour . this may preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group .
