American crocodile     the american crocodile is a species of crocodile that lives in the americas , from the southern united states to northern south america . its scientific name , `` crocodylus acutus '' , means `` pointy-snouted crocodile '' , for the shape of its snout . american crocodiles feed mostly on fish , but large individuals may prey on larger animals , such as deer . the crocodile looks like it is a log , and hides beneath the surface of the water . when the deer comes down to the water to drink , the crocodile lunges out of the water , grabs the deer in its jaws , and pulls it underwater , where it drowns . after the deer is dead , the crocodile will grab a piece of meat in its jaws and spin around in a `` death roll '' . american crocodiles are a somewhat aggressive crocodile species , and have been known to attack humans . attacks on humans are rare , but happen most often in mexico . the american crocodile 's range in southern florida overlaps with that of the closely related american alligator . however , while the american alligator 's range stretches as far north as virginia , the american crocodile 's range in the united states is confined to southern florida . this is because alligators are much better at tolerating cold weather than crocodiles . the body temperature of alligators has been known to drop to 38 degrees fahrenheit without any harm at all to the alligator . however , the american crocodile is better at tolerating saltwater than the alligator . american crocodiles have regularly been sighted 140 miles away from shore in the caribbean sea .
