Halomonadaceae     the halomonadaceae are a family of halophilic proteobacteria . the family was originally created in 1988 to contain the genera `` halomonas '' and `` deleya '' . many of its members were only recently discovered , and research is discovering new facts about them . gfaj-1 is a strain of rod-shaped extremophile bacteria in the halomonadaceae . it was claimed that , when it did not have phosphorus , it took the usually poisonous element arsenic as a substitute . geomicrobiologist felisa wolfe-simon collected lake-bottom sediments in the shallow waters of mono lake in california . wolfe-simon cultured the organisms from this hypersaline ( very salty ) and highly alkaline environment . they grew in an arsenic-containing medium . unfortunately , the conclusions taken from this research have been disproved . a group of researchers analyzed the dna of gfaj-1 , and could not detect any arsenic . the phosphorus in its dna can not be , and is not , replaced with arsenic . life is mostly composed of the elements carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , sulfur , and phosphorus . although these six elements make up nucleic acids , proteins , and lipids and thus the bulk of living matter , it is possible in theory that some other elements in the periodic table might serve the same functions .
