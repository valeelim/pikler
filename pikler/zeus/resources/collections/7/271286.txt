Center of mass     center of mass or barycenter of a system is the average position of all the mass in a system . in a rigid body , the centre of mass is always in the same place . in a loose collection the center of mass may be in space , as it is in the solar system . also , as planets ' orbits change slightly , so will the position of the barycenter . a simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley . if you hold only one corner and push , it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass . otherwise a turning force is created . this shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place . the center of gravity is a closely related term . it is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object . it is the center of mass acting in a gravitational field . the concept of center of mass was first introduced by the ancient greek physicist , mathematician , and engineer archimedes of syracuse . archimedes showed that the torque ( turning force ) exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point â€” their center of mass .
