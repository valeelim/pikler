Nanoelectromechanical systems     nanoelectromechanical systems will be very tiny machines , with dimensions thousands of times thinner than the human hair , that could be used as motors or sensors . the technology is very new and still in the laboratory stage , but may replace microelectromechanical systems . compared to human scale , things work very differently at nano dimensions . for example , attractive forces between materials of the same type may push together moving parts and block a motor .
