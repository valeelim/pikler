Supersymmetry     supersymmetry is a theory ( commonly found in some forms of string theory ) that says that when the universe formed , the same number of theoretical `` superparticles '' were created . if this theory is true , it would at least double the number of known particles in the universe . supersymmetry may create more than one copy , since there are many dimensions ( m-theory by edward witten predicts up to 11 ) . many scientists believe in supersymmetry because it solves many inconsistencies in the standard model of physics . supersymmetry was the idea of hironari miyazawa ( b . 1927 ) . hitoshi murayama is with the university of california at berkeley physics dept , and a fellow of the american physical society . - hitoshi murayama homepage . introduction to supersymmetry . - hitoshi murayama 's supersymmetry phenomenology .
