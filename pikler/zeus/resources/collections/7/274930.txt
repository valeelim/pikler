Na+/K+-ATPase     na/k-atpase is an enzyme found in the plasma membrane . it is sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase , also known as the 'na/k pump ' , 'sodium-potassium pump ' , or simply 'sodium pump ' , for short . the enzyme moves na ( sodium ) ions out of the cell and replaces them with k ( potassium ) ions . this keeps the na+ ions outside of the cell membrane , and keeps the k+ ions on the inside of the cell membrane . the process works in the opposite direction of diffusion . for every three sodium ions that get pumped out of the cell , two potassium ions get pumped into the cell . one phosphate group is still bound to the pump .
