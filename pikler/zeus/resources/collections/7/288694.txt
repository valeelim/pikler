Environment of Florida     the state of florida in the u.s.a. has a mild subtropical climate . because of that , millions of people have settled in the once rural state over the last hundred years . florida 's population increases by about 1,000 residents each day . land development and water use have changed the state , mostly by draining the wetlands that once covered most of the peninsula . much of florida is made of karst limestone with water-filled caves and sinkholes , which provide homes to many species of aquatic life , some of which only live in florida . as more and more people move to florida , they use up the water in the underground caves . when a cave has no more water , it will sometimes collapse , forming a sinkhole , which can hurt animals , people , and buildings . for a long time , the state has been trying to restore the everglades . in 2000 , congress passed the comprehensive everglades restoration plan , a $ 7.8 billion , 30-year project aimed at preserving and restoring the region and its unique combination of environments .
