Miller–Urey experiment     the miller and urey experiment ( or `` urey–miller experiment '' ) was an experiment that made organic compounds out of inorganic ones by applying a form of energy . the idea was to simulate hypothetical conditions thought to be present on the early earth ( hadean or early archaean ) . it was a test of the chemical origins of life . specifically , the experiment tested alexander oparin 's and j.b.s . haldane 's hypothesis that conditions on the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors . considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life , it was conducted in 1952 and published in 1953 by stanley miller and harold urey at the university of chicago . after miller 's death in 2007 , scientists examined sealed vials preserved from the original experiments . they were able to show that there were well over 20 different amino acids produced in miller 's original experiments . that is considerably more than those miller originally reported , and more than the 20 that naturally occur in life .
