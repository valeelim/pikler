Year 2038 Problem     the year 2038 problem , or y2.038k , is a problem machines and computers have when the year hits 2038 . 32-bit time stores the number of seconds since january 1 , 1970. if the value goes above a certain number , the date resets to a very negative number , showing the date in 1901 instead of 2038. a solution to this problem is to store the time in a 64-bit number , which will not reset for millions of years . most 64-bit computers already store the time in a 64-bit number or can be configured to do so .
