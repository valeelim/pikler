Exopterygota     the exopterygota are a superorder of insects . they are in the subclass pterygota in the infraclass neoptera . in exopterygotes the young resemble adults but have externally-developing wings . they undergo a modest change between immature and adult , without going through a pupal stage . the nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of moulting . the exopterygota are a diverse insect superorder , divided into eight orders . they include locusts , thrips , and lice among other types of insects . they are distinguished from the endopterygota ( or holometabola ) by the way in which their wings develop . endopterygota ( meaning literally `` internal winged forms '' ) develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage . exopterygota ( `` external winged forms '' ) develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage , though a few have something resembling a pupa .
