TERGV     the tergv ( for `` regional express train on high-speed line '' ) is a model to run trains in nord-pas-de-calais . the idea is to run regional trains on lines constructed for `` express trains '' , instead of the `` classic lines '' . this works only in the case that the high-speed line is used only rarely . running regional trains on such lines slows down the express trains , and costs more than running them on the classic lines . despite these problems , the concept is very promising for distances between 100 and 200 km . there are currently two lines that operate in this manner : 1. lille-dunkerque ( 30 minutes ) 1. lille-calais-boulogne-sur-mer ( 55 min , 30 min to calais ) to use these connections , an extra fee must be paid , which is three euros , per day . another line , lille to arras has been opened . this line does not require the extra fee , and has proved very successful .
