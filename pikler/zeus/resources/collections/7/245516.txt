Landlord     a landlord is a kind of businessperson or company who owns buildings or land , and earns money by charging rent to people ( tenants ) who want to use them . the word originated in the middle ages because a person who owned land then was also its lord who was in charge of the local government . many natural persons who are landlords use borrowed money to buy their real estate and depend on enough tenants paying their rent on time , more for the purpose of reducing the amount of money they owe on the property than to provide them with an income . donald trump is an example of a well known modern landlord .
