Plausible deniability     plausible deniability are words first used by the central intelligence agency ( cia ) during the kennedy administration . in that case it meant not to tell senior government officials about illegal cia activities . these officials could then defend themselves if the activities were discovered . they would be able to say quite plausibly , and perhaps truthfully , that they did not know anything about it ( deniability ) . it meant that actions of the cia could not be blamed on the president of the usa . the concept is tied up with the idea of a `` paper trail '' , whereby journalists find evidence of orders or discussions between senior officials and agents doing the forbidden acts . interceptions of phone messages or e-mail messages may also be evidence of wrongdoing by officials . if there is no definite evidence of wrongdoing by an official , then his/her denial can be taken as sincere . the denial is `` plausible '' ( or , at least , `` might '' be true ) . that achieves one of the main goals of public relations : for officials at least not to be caught red-handed doing something illegal . the effect of officials being caught red-handed can be extremely serious : see watergate scandal .
