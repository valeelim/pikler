Dirac equation     the dirac equation is an equation from quantum mechanics . paul dirac formulated the equation in 1928. the equation describes the behaviour of fermions ( e.g . electrons ) , and takes special relativity into account . the equation showed the existence of antimatter . - it does not change in lorentz transformation . this means it is a differential equation of the same order in space and time . - the pauli equation can be derived from a special case of the equation - it predicts the existence of antimatter particles , with the same mass and spin , but with the opposite charge . in 1931 , dirac predicted the existence of positrons , one year before the particles were found in an experiment . - it explains why the spin of the electrons in the sternâ€“gerlach experiment acts like a magnet , which splits the silver atoms according to their spin . - the differential operator used in a special form of the equation is very important for differential geometry - dirac equation also explains the behaviour of electron in two-dimensional graphene sheet where the electron is set free due to the lack of interaction between elections thus making the electron behave massless .
