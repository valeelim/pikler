Iapetus Ocean     the iapetus ocean existed in the neoproterozoic and palaeozoic eras ( between 600 and 400 million years ago ) . the ocean was in the southern hemisphere , between three paleocontinents . the ocean disappeared when these three continents joined to form one big landmass . that large continent has been given various names , such as laurussia or the old red sandstone continent . probably the best name is euramerica , because basically it was american and europe stuck together . the iapetus ocean was between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the atlantic ocean . it was a kind of precursor of the atlantic . at the start of the 19 century , american paleontologist charles doolittle walcott noticed differences in early paleozoic benthic trilobites either side of the line which later was called the iapetus suture . the so called `` pacific fauna '' of laurentia , as found in scotland and western newfoundland , was quite different from those of baltica , often called the `` atlantic fauna '' . the latter is found in the southern parts of the british isles and eastern newfoundland . geologists of the early 20 century thought a large trough , a so-called geosyncline , had existed between scotland and england in the early paleozoic , keeping both sides separated .
