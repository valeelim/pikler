Copper(I) acetylide    copper ( i ) acetylide copper ( i ) acetylide , also known as cuprous acetylide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cuc . it contains copper in its +1 oxidation state . it also contains acetylide ions . copper ( i ) acetylide is a reddish solid . it is an explosive . it is a strange explosive because it does not release gas . when it detonates , it only releases copper and carbon . it can be formed inside copper pipes where acetylene flows through . it explodes because the acetylide is a reducing agent and the copper ( i ) is an oxidizing agent . it is made by reacting copper ( i ) chloride dissolved in ammonia with acetylene . hydrochloric acid and copper ( i ) acetylide is made . this reaction is used to test for acetylene . it is used in organic chemistry . it is a very sensitive explosive , too sensitive to be used . other pages . - copper ( i ) oxide - copper ( ii ) oxide
