Metriacanthosaurus     metriacanthosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in europe during the middle jurassic period , about 160 million years ago . its name means `` moderate-spined lizard '' , because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as `` allosaurus '' , but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs , such as `` acrocanthosaurus '' . like most theropods , `` metriacanthosaurus '' was a meat-eater . it had three fingers on each hand . each finger ended in a sharp , hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws . it probably preyed on the large , long-necked sauropods , such as `` pelorosaurus '' , that lived in the same time and place as it . it was originally classified as a megalosaurid , but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family , the metriacanthosauridae in `` jurassic park '' , one of the vials of dinosaur dna that dennis nedry steals is labeled `` metriacanthosaurus '' .
