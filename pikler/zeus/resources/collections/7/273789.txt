River Teifi     the river teifi is a river in west wales . it starts in the hills above the town of tregaron and then flows into a large marsh called tregaron bog . this bog helps to stop flow in the river being too extreme . it stores up flood water when it is raining hard and it lets water go during dry weather . the water in the river teifi is very good quality . the river supports lots of wild-life including salmon and trout . the wildlife is so special that the whole river has been given special protetion by scientists to stop it being damaged . the river passes through small towns such as lampeter and newcastle emlyn before it reaches the sea at cardigan . for the last few miles before it reaches cardigan , the river runs through a deep gorge called cigerran gorge . some people still fish for salmon here using a very ancient boat called a coracle .
