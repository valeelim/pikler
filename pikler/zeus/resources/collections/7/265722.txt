Jean Piaget     jean piaget ( 9 august 1896 - 16 september 1980 ) was a swiss developmental psychologist . he is famous for his work with children and how they learn . he started a type of study called `` genetic epistemology '' , which is about where knowledge comes from . at first , piaget was a biologist . he was especially interested in mollusks . he became more interested in psychology while listening to children talk . he wondered how they learned , and came up with a theory that they go through stages where they become ready for certain kinds of learning . these stages are called `` stages of cognitive development '' . for example , the first stage he came up with is called the `` sensorimotor stage '' . he believed that , from birth to two years old , children would learn that they are different from objects , and that even if the child left a room , things that were in the room would still be there . ( this is called `` object permanence '' ) . other websites . - piaget 's cognitive stages
