Mercury(I) chloride    mercury ( i ) chloride mercury ( i ) chloride , also known as calomel and mercurous chloride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is hgcl . it has mercury and chloride ions in it . the mercury is in its +1 oxidation state . it is a white to pale yellow crystalline solid . it is toxic , but not as toxic as mercury ( ii ) chloride because it does not dissolve in water . it turns back into mercury and mercury ( ii ) chloride when reacted with ammonia or exposed to ultraviolet light . the black color that came from the reaction with ammonia gave its name `` calomel '' ( beautiful black ) . it is a weak reducing agent . it is the most common mercury ( i ) compound . calomel is sometimes found as a mineral , but it is quite rare . it is made by reacting mercury with mercury ( ii ) chloride . it can also be made by reacting mercury ( i ) nitrate with sources of chloride , such as sodium chloride . it is used in electrochemistry as a reference electrode . reference electrodes are used to find the electrode potentials ( ability to be oxidized and reduced ) of other chemical substances . since it decomposes when light is shined on it , it is used to see how many photons are in a light beam . it was used as medicine in the past , although it was toxic .
