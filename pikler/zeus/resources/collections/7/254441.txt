Epidexipteryx     epidexipteryx ( 'display feather ' ) is a genus of small maniraptoran dinosaurs , known from one fossil specimen in beijing . `` epidexipteryx '' is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record . it is a small maniraptoran dinosaur from the middle or upper jurassic age daohugou beds of inner mongolia , china ( perhaps 160 to 168 million years ago ) . it is known from a well preserved partial skeleton that includes four long feathers on the tail , composed of a central rachis and vanes . however , unlike in modern-style tail feathers , the vanes were not branched but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet . `` epidexipteryx '' also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers . they are unique in that some appear to arise from a `` membranous structure '' . in all , the skeleton of `` epidexipteryx hui '' measures 25 centimeters ( 10 inches ) in length ( 44.5 cm or 17.5 in including the incomplete tail feathers ) , and the authors estimated a weight of 164 grams , smaller than most other early dinobirds .
