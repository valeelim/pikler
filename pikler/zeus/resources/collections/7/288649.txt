Princess of Orange     princess of orange is the title ( `` name '' ) used for the women who were married to the ruling princes of orange in the time between 1171 to 1815. since 1815 , it was also used for the wives of the heirs to the dutch throne , who were titled prince of orange . the only woman who became a `` princess of orange '' without being married to a `` prince of orange '' was marie , princess of orange ( 1393-1417 ) . together with her husband john , prince of orange ( 1393-1418 ) , they governed the land . because the title `` prince of orange '' was only used for 'the eldest son of the king ' ( the `` crown prince '' ) , dutch crown princesses did not get the title . there were no `` oldest sons '' for a few generations , and so the title was not used since 1877. because dutch law was changed in 1983 to include `` oldest daughters of the king '' , catharina-amalia , the next princess of orange became the first dutch princess of orange in her own right once her father , prince willem-alexander , became king of the netherlands .
