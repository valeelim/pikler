Visionary     defined broadly , a visionary , is one who can envision the future . for some groups , this can involve the supernatural or use of mind-altering drugs . a visionary state can be achieved via meditation , drugs , lucid dreams , daydreams , or art . one example is hildegard of bingen , a 12th century artist/visionary and catholic saint . other visionaries in religion are mohammed ( who had a vision of and communed with the angel gabriel ) , st. bernadette ( who had a vision of contact with the blessed virgin ) , and joseph smith ( who had a vision of contact with the angel moroni ) . a `` vision '' can be political , religious , environmental , social , or technological in nature . by extension , a `` visionary '' can also be a person with a clear , distinctive and specific ( in some details ) vision of the future , usually connected with advances in technology or social/political arrangements . for example , ted nelson or u.s. vice president al gore is referred to as a visionary in connection with the internet . other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day , as some forms of `` visioning '' ( or gazing ) can provide a glimpse into the possible future . therefore , visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth , but might exist in another realm , such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought . examples are buckminster fuller in architecture and design , and some of the pioneers of personal computing such as steve wozniak . some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe . in that sense , a visionary may also function as a secular prophet . some visionaries emphasize communication , and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group .
