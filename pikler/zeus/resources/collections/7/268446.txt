Inner transition metal     an inner transition metal ( itm ) is one of a group of chemical elements on the periodic table . they are normally shown in two rows below all the other elements . they include elements 57-71 ( lanthanides ) and 89-103 ( actinides ) . the lanthanides are very similar , and the actinides are all radioactive . itms have three incomplete outermost electron shells and are all metals . in some cases they are quite malleable and ductile . they do not occur in nature ( except for the lanthanides thorium and uranium ) , and are highly unstable .
