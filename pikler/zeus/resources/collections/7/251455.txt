Hornbill     the hornbills ( bucerotidae ) are a family of bird found in tropical and subtropical africa , asia and melanesia . they have a long , down-curved bill which is often brightly colored and sometimes has a box-like thing on the upper mandible . the female hornbill lays her eggs in a hole in a tree . then , helped by her mate , she seals herself in , covering the entrance with droppings and mud . only a small slit is left , through which the male gives her food . this keeps the nest safe from snakes until the chicks are grown enough to leave the nest , and learn how to fly .
