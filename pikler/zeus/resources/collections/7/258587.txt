Gastornis     gastornis , formerly known as diatryma , is an extinct genus of large flightless birds . they lived in the late paleocene and early eocene epochs of the cainozoic . the first remains were discovered in the mid-19th century . in the 1870s , the famous american paleontologist edward drinker cope discovered another , more complete set of fossils in north america , and named them `` diatryma '' . the fossil remains of these birds have been found in western-central europe ( england , belgium , france and germany ) as well as north america . their life style is in dispute . `` gastornis parisiensis '' measured on average 1.75 metres ( 5.7 ft ) tall , but large individuals grew up to 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) tall . `` gastornis '' had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top , which possibly suggests that it was carnivorous . `` gastornis '' had large powerful legs . it had large feet with small talons . fossil footprints suggest it was a herbivore . although north american and europe were separated by the end of the cretaceous , there must have been a landbrige still in place somewhere . this is because the european and north american `` diatryma '' s were so similar . other bird and mammal genera also occur on both sides of the ( present-day ) north atlantic in the palaeocene and eocene . this is evidence that europe and north america were once connected by dry land in part of the early cainozoic .
