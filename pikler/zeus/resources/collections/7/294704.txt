Rhysling Award     the rhysling awards are a prize given each year for the best poem from science fiction , fantasy , or horror . most awards for writing are named for the creator of the award , the subject of the award , or an important person . the rhyslings are named for a character in a science fiction story : the blind poet rhysling , in robert a. heinlein 's short story `` the green hills of earth '' . two awards are given : `` best long poem '' , for poetry of 50 or more lines , and `` best short poem '' , for works of 49 or fewer lines . the members of the science fiction poetry association ( sfpa ) choose several possible winners ( nominees ) for each year 's rhysling awards . each member may name one work that should win in each category . all of the nominees are published in a book called `` the rhysling anthology '' . members of the association then vote on the final winners . since 2005 , the awards have been presented in july at a ceremony at readercon . the `` best short poem '' category allows very short poems to be entered . however , the sfpa also has the dwarf stars award for poems from one to ten lines .
