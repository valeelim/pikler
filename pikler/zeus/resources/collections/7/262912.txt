Reincarnation research     psychiatrist ian stevenson , from the university of virginia , interviewed young children who claimed to remember a past life . he did more than 2,500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books , including `` twenty cases suggestive of reincarnation '' . stevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years . he compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased , attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased 's family had occurred . some 35 per cent of the children examined by stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects . stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children , when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased , provided the best evidence for reincarnation . however , stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation , and cautiously referred to his cases as being `` of the reincarnation type '' or `` suggestive of reincarnation '' .
