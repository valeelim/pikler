Mexican coat of arms     the flag of mexico contains a coat of arms which is derived from an aztec symbol depicting an eagle with a snake in its mouth . in the early 14th century , the mexica people were a wandering tribe looking for a permanent settlement in modern day central mexico . they survived by hunting and gathering and were often hired to fight as mercenaries for the city-states scattered throughout the region . according to legend , their god , huitzilopochtli , told them to establish a city of their own at a site where they would find an eagle eating a snake on top of a cactus . the legend relates that the people saw the eagle on a small , swampy island in the middle of the shallow texcoco lake . the mexica invented a resourceful system of gardening , called chinampas , which allowed them to grow small gardens , eventually drying out the lake . in 1325 , they completed construction of a city there . that city , which they called tenochtitlan , became the capital of the aztec empire , which dominated central mexico until its destruction by spanish conquistadores led by hernando cortes .
