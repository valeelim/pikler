Sulfur hexafluoride     sulfur hexafluoride , also known as sulfur ( vi ) fluoride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is sf . it contains sulfur in its +6 oxidation state . it also contains fluoride ions . sulfur hexafluoride is a colorless , odorless gas . it is very heavy for a gas ( about 5 times heavier than air ) . it is non reactive , and hard to find anything that reacts with it . it is a strong greenhouse gas . this has made people put some restrictions on using it . it is made by reacting sulfur with fluorine . that combination also makes toxic disulfur decafluoride , which has to be removed . it is used in electronics and various electrical devices . it can be used in the body since it is not toxic . it can be used as a test gas to look where gas flows in a heater system , for example . it is detected easily . it is used in some torpedoes . lithium is one of the only things that reacts with sulfur hexafluoride . sulfur hexafluoride is sprayed on lithium . this makes the lithium very hot . it creates steam from water and shoots the torpedo . it can be breathed in to make the voice deeper . this is the opposite of breathing in helium gas .
