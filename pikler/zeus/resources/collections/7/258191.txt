Neutralization     neutralization occurs when a base is reacted with an acid . the oh ions in the base react with the h ions in the acid to form ho , water . in this reaction , the base is protonated and the acid is ( deprotonation|deprotonated ) . to neutralise a substance ( e.g alkali substance ) , you must put an equal amount of an acid into the alkali in order for it to become neutral ( also known as ph 7 ) . titration uses neutralization to measure chemical concentrations . related pages . - base ( chemistry ) - acid - protonation - deprotonation - alkali
