Fade (audio engineering)    fade ( audio engineering ) in audio engineering , a fade is a gradual increase ( fade-in ) or decrease ( fade-out ) in the level of an audio signal . the term can also be used for film cinematography or theatre lighting , in much the same way ( see : fade ( filmmaking ) ) . a recorded song may be gradually reduced to silence at its end ( `` fade-out '' ) , or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning ( `` fade-in '' ) . for example , the songs `` bitter sweet symphony '' by the verve and `` turn to stone '' by electric light orchestra fade in from the beginning , while the songs `` born to be wild '' by steppenwolf , `` boogie oogie oogie '' by a taste of honey , and `` hey jude '' by the beatles fade out . however , `` born to be wild '' and `` boogie oogie oogie '' fade out in a matter of seconds , whereas `` hey jude '' takes over 2 minutes to completely fade out . `` goodbye stranger '' by supertramp takes about a minute to fade out . fading-out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending . though relatively rare , songs can fade out , then fade back in . some examples of this are `` helter skelter '' by the beatles , `` suspicious minds '' by elvis presley , `` thank you '' by led zeppelin or `` undercover of the night '' by the rolling stones .
