Earth's core    earth 's core the earth 's core is the part of earth in the middle of our planet . it has a solid inner core and a liquid outer core . the outer core of the earth is a liquid layer about 2,260 kilometers thick . it is made of iron and nickel . this is above the earth 's solid inner core and below the mantle . its outer boundary is beneath the earth 's surface . the transition between the inner core and outer core is approximately beneath the earth 's surface . the temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 °c in the outer regions to 6100 °c near the inner core . eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the earth 's magnetic field . the average magnetic field strength in the earth 's outer core was measured to be 25 gauss , 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface . without the outer core , life on earth would be very different . convection of liquid metals in the outer core creates the earth 's magnetic field . this magnetic field extends outward from the earth for several thousand kilometers , and creates a protective bubble around the earth that deflects the sun 's solar wind . without this field , the solar wind would directly strike the earth 's atmosphere . this might have removed the earth 's atmosphere , making the planet nearly lifeless . it may have happened to mars .
