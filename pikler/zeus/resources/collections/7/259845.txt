Hemichordata     the hemichordata is a phylum of worm-shaped marine deuterostome animals , generally considered the sister group of the echinoderms . they date back to the lower or middle cambrian and include an important class of fossils called graptolites , most of which became extinct in the carboniferous . living hemichordates are a phylum with two living classes : the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs . since the hemichordates are the closest living relatives to the chordates , they are of great interest to those studying the origins of chordate development . the bodies of hemichordates are divided into three parts , proboscis , collar and trunk . they have open circulatory systems and a complete digestive tract but the musculature in their gut is very poorly developed , and food is mostly transported through it by using the cilia that cover its inside surface . a hollow neural tube exists among some species ( at least in early life ) , probably a primitive trait they share with the common ancestor of chordata and the rest of the deuterostomes .
