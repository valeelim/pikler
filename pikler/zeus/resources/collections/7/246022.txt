Louver     a louver ( american english ) or louvre ( british english ) , from the french `` l'ouvert '' ; `` the open one '' ) is a window , blind or shutter with horizontal or , less often , vertical slats . they are angled to allow light and air in . they also keep out rain , direct sunshine , and noise . the angle of the slats may be adjusted . louvers come from the middle ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes . they were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow . they were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel . later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery . they took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth . they also became more like modern louvers , with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string . more modern louver windows are made of slats of glass , opened and closed with a metal lever . they may also be shutters of wood , plastic or other material .
