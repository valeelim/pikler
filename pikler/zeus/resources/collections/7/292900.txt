Great American Interchange     the great american interchange was an important zoogeographic event about three million years ago . land and freshwater fauna migrated between north america and south america . the migration happened during the pliocene , 3.6–2.6 million years ago ( mya ) . the volcanic isthmus of panama rose up from the sea floor and bridged the two continents . the land bridge in what is now panama joined the neotropic ( roughly south america ) and nearctic ( roughly north america ) ecozones to form the americas . the interchange is visible from both stratigraphy and nature . its most dramatic effect is on the distribution of mammals , but weak-flying or flightless birds , reptiles , amphibians , arthropods and even freshwater fish also migrated . the differences in the fauna of north and south america had been known for some time . both humboldt and darwin discussed it . the interchange as a concept was first fully laid out in 1876 by the `` father of biogeography '' , alfred russel wallace . wallace had spent 1848–1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the amazon basin . others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include florentino ameghino and george gaylord simpson .
