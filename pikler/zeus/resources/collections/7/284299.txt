Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)    council of ministers ( soviet union ) the council of ministers of the union of soviet socialist republics ( ussr ) ( ) , ( sometimes shortened to `` sovmin '' or `` soviet of ministers '' ) was legally the soviet government . it was the highest executive and administrative body of the soviet union . the council could issue declarations and instructions based the laws of the ussr , and all territories and republics within the union had to follow them . however , the most important state issues were made by the joint declarations with the central committee of the communist party of soviet union ( cpsu ) , which was `` de facto '' more powerful than the council of ministers . it was replaced in 1991 by the cabinet of ministers of the ussr , which was dissolved only months later when the soviet union ceased to exist .
