Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States     historians ( and sometimes political scientists ) are surveyed and asked to give presidents of the united states number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership . several different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president . these include their character , their vision for the country , their relations with congress , their relations with foreign leaders ( diplomacy ) , how they managed the economy , how they managed the military , and their overall political skill . to make sure the rankings are fair , many surveys equally balance the opinions of liberal democrats and conservative republicans . it is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times . historical opinions of u.s. presidents often change over time . for example , harry truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office , but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents .
