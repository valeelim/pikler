Hadrosaur     hadrosaurs ( meaning `` bulky lizards '' ) were the family of duck-billed herbivorous dinosaurs . they were the most common dinosaurs . hadrosaurs ranged in size from 10 to 65 ft ( 3 to 20 m ) long . they had horny , toothless beaks and hundreds of cheek teeth in the sides of their jaws . the duck-billed dinosaurs had the most teeth ; they had up to about 960 cheek teeth . hadrosaurs lived during the later cretaceous , and their fossils have been found in north america , europe , and asia . hadrosaurs had a stiff tail that was probably used for balance . they had hoof-like nails on their feet , and bumpy skin . they ran on two legs , holding their tail and head in a horizontal position . they may have walked on all four legs while grazing . hadrosaurs probably lived near bodies of water , migrating to high ground to lay eggs . it used to be thought that they had webbed hands , but this was an artifact of the fossilization process . it is a very interesting thing that , as bakker says , the duckbills were so common , yet they had no obvious defence against the large carnivores . perhaps herd organisation and running speed were sufficient . their eating apparatus must have been an advantage as compared to other herbivores .
