London Livery Company     the city of london livery companies began as trade associations or trade guilds , which controlled who could carry out certain jobs in the city of london . today the companies act mainly as social and charitable groups , because over the centuries the livery companies have lost most rights to control trade , often as statute law applied the same standards across the whole country . some support schools which were set up in the 1500s . others sponsor apprentices in colleges and unversities . some still have a statutory role . for example the goldsmiths ' company continue to run the london assay office where several million articles of gold , silver and platinum are hallmarked each year . the order of precedence was first set down in 1515 by the aldermen of the city of london . forty-eight livery companies then existed . the list was based on the companies ' economic or political power . the first twelve livery companies are known as the `` great twelve city livery companies '' . there are now 108 livery companies , some very new , so the order of precedence is sometimes reviewed .
