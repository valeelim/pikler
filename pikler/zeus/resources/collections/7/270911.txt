Ermine Street     ermine street is the name of one of the main roman roads in britain . it ran from london ( `` londinium '' ) to lincoln ( `` lindum colonia '' ) and york ( `` eboracum '' ) . the original roman name for the road is not known . ermine street is also called the old north road from london to where it joins the a1 near godmanchester . the alternative route ( in blue ) was built to allow transport in all weather . the direct route crosses the river humber , a tidal estuary of the rivers trent and ouse . in bad weather crossing would have been impossible . the humber is too wide for the romans to have built a bridge , therefore some kind of ferry must have been used .
