Tellurium(VI) fluoride    tellurium ( vi ) fluoride tellurium ( vi ) fluoride , also known as tellurium hexafluoride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is tef . it contains tellurium in its +6 oxidation state . it also contains fluoride ions . it is the oldest known tellurium fluoride . tellurium ( vi ) fluoride is a colorless gas . it condenses to a white solid when made cold . it has a very bad smell . it is very toxic . it is similar to selenium hexafluoride , even though it is less volatile ( not as easily evaporated ) . it reacts with water to make telluric acid and hydrofluoric acid . it reacts with tellurium under to make tellurium tetrafluoride . it is made by reacting hot fluorine with tellurium . cold fluorine gas makes tellurium tetrafluoride . it can also be made by reacting fluorine with tellurium trioxide . another way to make it is reacting selenium tetrafluoride and tellurium dioxide to make tellurium tetrafluoride , which is heated above to make tellurium hexafluoride and tellurium . related pages . - tellurium ( iv ) fluoride
