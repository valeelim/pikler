Backspace     backspace is the keyboard key ( sometimes labeled as : ← ) that originally pushed the typewriter carriage one position backwards , and for modern computer screens , moves the cursor one position backwards , deletes the preceding character , and shifts back the text after it by one position . in typewriters , a typist would , for example , type a lowercase letter `` a '' with acute accent ( á ) by typing a lowercase letter `` a '' then backspace , and then the acute accent key ( also known as overstrike ) . this is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ascii caret ( ^ , for the circumflex accent ) . backspace composition no longer works with digital displays or typesetting systems . it has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of unicode , though such characters do not work well with many fonts , and precomposed characters continue to be used . some software like tex or microsoft windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks , namely positioning the accent first , and then placing the base letter at that position .
