Two of Us (The Beatles song)    two of us ( the beatles song ) `` two of us '' is a song by the beatles , written by paul mccartney , although it is credited to lennon/mccartney . lennon and mccartney sang the song as a duet . it was written for linda eastman , mccartney 's soon to be wife , though it sounds at times as if it is addressing lennon , whose relationship with mccartney was tense at that time . `` two of us '' was originally a hard rock song . in the `` let it be '' film , mccartney and lennon sing the song `` rocker '' style into the same microphone . mccartney had never been satisfied with this style , which he said was `` chunky . '' and so on 24 january , he and the band reworked it . lennon had ideas about how the song might sound if stevie wonder performed it , and just before revisiting the song , the band had run through the everly brothers hit `` cathy 's clown '' . with these influences and a move from electric guitar to acoustic , the song transformed into the gentler , stripped-down version that fans know today . the beatles performed a finished version of the song live at apple studios on 31 january 1969 ; this performance was included in both the `` let it be '' film and album .
