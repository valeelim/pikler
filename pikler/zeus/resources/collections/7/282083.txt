Streptococcus     streptococcus is a genus of spherical gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum firmicutes and the lactic acid bacteria group . they are cocci , meaning that they are shaped like spheres or circles . cellular division occurs along a single axis in these bacteria , and thus they grow in chains or pairs , hence the name from greek στρεπτος `` streptos '' , meaning easily bent or twisted , like a chain ( twisted chain ) . contrast this with staphylococci , which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells . streptococci are oxidase and catalase-negative , and many are facultative anaerobes .
