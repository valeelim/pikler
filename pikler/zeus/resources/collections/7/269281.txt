Lithography     lithography ( from greek `` λίθος '' - `` lithos '' , 'stone ' + `` γράφω '' - `` graphο '' , 'to write ' ) is a method for printing using a stone ( lithographic limestone ) or a metal ( steel or aluminium ) plate with a completely smooth surface . lithography was invented in 1796 by bavarian author alois senefelder as a low-cost method of publishing theatrical works . lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other suitable material . lithography originally used an image drawn in wax or other oily substance applied to a lithographic stone as the medium to transfer ink to the printed sheet . in modern times , the image is often made of polymer applied to a flexible aluminium plate . the flat surface of the plate or stone is slightly roughened , or etched , and divided into hydrophilic ( = water-loving ) regions that accept a film of water and repel the greasy ink , and hydrophobic regions which repel water and accept ink . the image may be printed directly from the stone or plate ( in which case it is reversed from the original image ) or may be offset by transfer to a flexible sheet , usually rubber , for transfer to the printed article .
