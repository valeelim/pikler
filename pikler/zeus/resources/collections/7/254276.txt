Age of majority     the age of majority is the age that children become adults by law . this means that they are legally in control over their own actions and decisions , and their parents are no longer responsible for them . when used this way , the word `` majority '' means having the full number of years to be an adult . the opposite is `` minority '' , which means being a minor or child . the law in a given place may never actually use the words `` age of majority '' when deciding when people become adults . the age of majority is a legally fixed age and idea of adulthood which is different in different places . it may not match the actual maturity of a person 's body or mind . the age of majority is 18 in the vast majority of jurisdictions , but ages as low as 15 and as high as 21 exist in some . once a person reaches the age of majority , there are some things they can do that they could not do before . these may include buying stocks , voting , buying or drinking alcohol , driving cars on public roads , and marrying without having to ask for permission . the ages that these things can be done are different depending on where the person lives .
