Hydrogen halide     hydrogen halides ( or hydrohalic acids ) are inorganic compounds that contain a hydrogen ion and a halide ion . the halogens are fluorine , chlorine , bromine and iodine . astatine does not make a stable hydrogen halide , so it is not included . the hydrogen halides are diatomic molecules with no tendency to ionize in the gas phase . chemists therefore distinguish hydrogen chloride from hydrochloric acid . the former is a gas at room temperature that reacts with water to give the acid . once the acid has formed , the diatomic molecule can not easily be regenerated .
