Ultrarelativistic limit     particles which go near the speed of light are called ultrarelativistic . the ultrarelativistic limit is the maximum velocity that a particle can move at . albert einstein found the equation for energy : e=mcÂ² . this means that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass . however , this is a simplified version of his equation . the longer version of his equation is e=mc+pc . ( mathematically , if you ignore the pc and take the square root of the equation , you get e=mc ) . pc refers to the velocity of a particle multiplied by a very large number . einstein then went on to show that a particle can never achieve the speed of light , because you get a divide by zero error from the equation for kinetic energy , formula_1 . look at the denominator ( bottom ) of the equation , formula_2 . `` v '' refers to the velocity of the particle . if its velocity reaches the speed of light ( which is `` c '' in this equation ) , formula_3 will equal one , and since that would leave one minus one in the denominator , there would be a divide by zero error .
