Transduction (genetics)    transduction ( genetics ) transduction is the process by which dna is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus . joshua lederberg and his graduate student norton zinder showed in 1952 that bacteriophages could transfer genetic information between bacteria in `` salmonella '' . this process explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly . transduction also refers to the process whereby foreign dna is introduced into another cell via a viral vector . this is a common tool used by molecular biologists to introduce a foreign gene into a host cell 's genome . when bacteriophages infect a bacterial cell , their normal mode of reproduction is to harness the replicational , transcriptional , and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make numerous complete viral particles , including the viral dna or rna and the protein coat . errors in this process can result in the virus carrying over dna from one bacterium to another .
