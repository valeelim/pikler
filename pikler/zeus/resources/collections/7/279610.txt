Brewing     brewing is the process of making beer . it is usually made in a brewery , though it can be made at home . it is made by adding bacteria that ferment malt , barley or sugar into a large vat . ethanol is produced by bacteria using up the energy from the mixture ( which the bacteria digest into glucose ) because there is no oxygen in the vat .
