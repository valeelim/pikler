Variations on a Rococo Theme     variations on a rococo theme is a piece of music for cello and orchestra composed by pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky . it is one of the most popular pieces of music for cello and orchestra . tchaikovsky never composed a cello concerto , but he did write this work , which is a tune with a set of variations . it is called `` rococo '' because the music is based on the style that was popular in the late 18th century , the period during the classical period known as rococo , the time of composers such as mozart . the main theme is an original theme by tchaikovsky , not a theme that had been composed by someone else in the 18th century . tchaikovsky wrote this piece for wilhelm fitzenhagen to play . he was a german cellist who lived in russia . like tchaikovsky , he was a professor at the moscow conservatory . fitzenhagen gave the first performance of the work in moscow on 30 november 1877. nikolai rubinstein was the conductor . what happened to the work after that first performance is an interesting story . tchaikovsky himself had not been at the first performance because he was in switzerland trying to calm himself down after a very short , disastrous marriage . he wanted to prepare the work so that it could be published . he sent fitzhagen a short score ( this is similar to an arrangement for the piano ) . he asked fitzhagen to make any necessary changes to the cello part . meanwhile , tchaikovsky got on with the job of orchestrating the music ( showing exactly what is played by each instrument ) .
