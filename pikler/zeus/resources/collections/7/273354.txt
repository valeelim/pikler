Copper(I) iodide    copper ( i ) iodide copper ( i ) iodide , also known as cuprous iodide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cui . it has copper and iodide ions in it . the copper is in its +1 oxidation state . copper ( i ) iodide is a white solid . it does not dissolve in water . it easily turns tan or brown . it is a reducing agent . the iodide easily oxidizes to iodine . copper does not form a stable copper ( ii ) iodide ; copper ( ii ) iodide breaks down right away to make copper ( i ) iodide and iodine . it dissolves in concentrated iodides like potassium iodide . when it is diluted , it makes copper ( i ) iodide again . it can be made by reacting iodine and copper in concentrated hydroiodic acid . another way would be to react copper ( ii ) sulfate and potassium iodide . this makes copper ( ii ) iodide which as said before breaks down right away to make iodine and copper ( i ) iodide . it is used to make organic compounds . it is also used to make clouds rain . it is used to make nylon resistant to heat . it can be used to put iodine to foods .
