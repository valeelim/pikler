Oscillation     something that oscillates is something that `` vibrates '' , or repeats the same pattern . many things in nature move back-and-forth or up-and down when pushed or struck . in time , natural oscillators slow down and stop because of friction . examples . - the pendulum of a `` grandfather clock '' , for example , is a very slow oscillator . - the strings of pianos and string instruments `` oscillate '' when struck by a hammer . - a water wave is the result of water moving up and down . - circuits powered by electricity can `` oscillate '' . such circuits can be used to make sounds or radio waves . - different chemicals , when you mix them together in the right order , can make some new things . but then these things change back to the original ones , making this repeating pattern . these are called chemical oscillators . related pages . - vibration
