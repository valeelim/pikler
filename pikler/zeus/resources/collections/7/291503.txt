Gun control     gun control is the attempt , usually by a government , to restrain or stop people from owning or using guns . gun control may also regulate the making , moving , and selling of guns . people want gun control because guns are very dangerous . gun control is very controversial in some countries , such as in the united states . some countries such as the united states , switzerland , and israel allow people to own guns to defend themselves , but most countries do not . because of the 2nd amendment to the united states constitution , every american citizen has the right to `` keep and bear arms '' . this has been taken to mean that most people can own guns . originally , it was thought that the federal government could not ban guns , but states and cities could . but recently , the supreme court said that states and cities could not ban handguns . although banning all guns is not allowed anymore , states and cities can still stop the sale and use of certain kinds of guns , such as guns that fire many bullets very quickly . they can also say that certain people , such as criminals , can not own guns . there is a strong `` gun lobby '' in the united states . it is led by the national rifle association , which supports the right to own guns . they want it to be fairly easy to get a gun . other groups , such as the brady campaign , want guns to be hard to get because they believe that guns cause violence , injury and death . some states have very strict gun laws , but others , such as arizona , utah , and mississippi , do not .
