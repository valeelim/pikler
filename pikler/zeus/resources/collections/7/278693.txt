Coinage metal     a group 11 element is one in the series of elements in group 11 ( iupac style ) in the periodic table , consisting of transition metals which are the traditional coinage metals of copper ( cu ) , silver ( ag ) , and gold ( au ) . roentgenium ( rg ) belongs to this group of elements based on its electronic configuration , but it is a short-lived transactinide with a 22.8 seconds half-life that has only been observed in laboratory conditions . the name `` coinage metals '' is often used in casual speech to refer to these elements , but various cultures have used many other metals in coinage including aluminium , lead , nickel , stainless steel , and zinc . all the elements of the group except roentgenium have been known since prehistoric times , as all of them occur in metallic form in nature and no extraction metallurgy has to be used to produce them . like other groups , the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration , especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior :
