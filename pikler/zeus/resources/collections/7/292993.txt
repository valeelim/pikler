Tree frog     tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees . there are several lines of neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs . these groups are only distantly related , but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions . the result is that , today , there are species from different groups that look very much like each other . this is convergent evolution . it goes so far that in almost all cases , where one group occurs , the other does not . their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of both groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared . they do not normally descend to the ground , except to mate and spawn , though some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees at all as adults . in some species the eggs develop directly into adults ; in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf . many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage . others are poisonous ( poison dart frog ) , and display warning colouration .
