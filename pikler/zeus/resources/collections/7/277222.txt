Mica     the mica group of minerals are aluminosilicates with various metals . they split into fine sheets , which puts them in the phyllosilicate group of silicate minerals . mica includes several closely related materials having perfect basal cleavage . all are monoclinic which means their crystals are shaped like one kind of prism . they tend towards pseudo-hexagonal crystals and are similar in chemical composition . the highly perfect cleavage , which is the most prominent characteristic of mica , is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms . being excellent electrical insulators , they are used in electronic equipment including capacitors .
