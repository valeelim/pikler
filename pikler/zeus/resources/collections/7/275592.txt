Pseudopodia     pseudopods ( which translates to `` false feet '' ) are temporary cytoplasm-filled parts of the cell wall that are able to change their form in order to move . they are used in some eukaryotic cells to move around or to eat . most cells that do this are called amoeboids . the amoeba is a common example . the cell wall makes a network of fibers . the cytoplasm flows into the network and fills it up , similar to a net filled with gelatin . this is able to move , lengthen , or shorten . the pseudopod extends from the amoeba . then the main part of the amoeba flows into that pseudopod and the amoeba has changed its place . pseudopods are one of the three locomotion modes of unicellular organisms ( together with flagella and cilia ) . pseudopods can also capture prey by phagocytosis . pseudopedia are used by some cells to move around . they can detect food and place it inside the cell . the human white blood cell uses this way to get around . pseudopods can be classified into several varieties according to their appearance :
