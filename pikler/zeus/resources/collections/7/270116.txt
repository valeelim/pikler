Abelisaurus     abelisaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in south america during the upper cretaceous period . there is one known species , `` abelisaurus comahuensis '' . `` abelisaurus '' was the first abelisaurid to be discovered , and gives its name to the family , the abelisauridae . `` abelisaurus '' is the type genus . despite this , little is known about it . the first , and only , fossils discovered were several skull bones found in argentina . scientists put them back together in the lab to create a skull . the skull is similar to that of other members of its family . like most abelisaurs , it is blunt and short in length , but tall in vertical height from a front view . `` abelisaurus '' probably preyed on the large sauropod dinosaurs of the time , such as `` amargasaurus '' , in packs . it may also have hunted smaller plant-eating dinosaurs , such as the small ornithopod `` gasparinisaura '' .
