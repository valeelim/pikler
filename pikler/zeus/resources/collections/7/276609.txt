Citadel     a citadel is a large fortress mainly used to protect towns or castles from attacks or disaster , though citadels have been built for other reasons as well . the oldest known citadels were built in the indus valley civilization , where the citadel may have been used as a symbol of authority , no one is fully sure about their purpose . in ancient greece , the acropolis was important in the life of the people , serving as a refuge and stronghold in peril and containing military and food supplies , the shrine of the god and a royal palace . the most well-known is the acropolis of athens , but nearly every greek city-state had one - the acrocorinth famed as a particularly strong fortress . the `` citadelle '' of quebec still survives as the largest citadel still in official military operation in north america after more than two hundred years of existence .
