Category theory     category theory is a type of mathematics . category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are alike . for example , some ideas from topology and abstract algebra are similar . ideas in category theory are written down in formulas or diagrams . category theory can be used to make computer programs more secure or easy to write . a category is a mathematical object . it can be drawn with dots and arrows . each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot . there can be many dots , sometimes so many that you can not count them . an arrow is the abstract idea of a function and the dots are the domain and codomain of the function . composition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows . if two arrows form an elbow shape , then they have a composition arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second . composition obeys some axioms , or equations . many ideas in abstract algebra are examples of categories or can be used to make categories . often , this makes the ideas seem more similar .
