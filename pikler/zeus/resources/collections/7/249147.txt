Vuvuzela     a vuvuzela is a blowing horn used in soccer games in south africa . they are also called lepatas or a stadium horn . to blow this horn , the lip and lung strength of the blower has to be strong to make a sound like a foghorn or an elephant . the `` vuvuzela '' was originally made out of tin . it became very popular in south africa in the 1990s . a fan of the kaizer chiefs fc named freddie `` saddam '' maake says that he invented the vuvuzela . he got the idea from the aluminium 1965 bicycle horn , and after taking off the black rubber , he blew it . after that , he thought it was too short , and so he joined a pipe to make it longer . he has kept photos of himself in south african soccer games holding the aluminium vuvuzela . he says the instrument was not allowed to be used because it was thought of as a dangerous weapon . because of this , he tried to find a plastic company that could make it safer . in 2001 , south africa-based company masincedane sport began to sell the plastic version . neil van schalkwyk , the co-owner of masincedane sport , won the sab kickstart award in 2001 .
