JPEG     in computing , the jpeg file format is a file format which is used to compress digital images . the amount of compression can be changed . if an image is high quality , it will take up a large amount of storage . if it is low quality , it will take up a small amount of storage . the jpeg file format is commonly found on the world wide web . the word `` jpeg '' is short for the joint photographic experts group which created the format . jpeg file extensions include codice_1 , codice_2 , codice_3 and others . the first notable thing about jpeg compression is the way in which the colour of each pixel is stored . each pixel of the image is assigned 3 bytes to define its colour . all three bytes can have any value from 0 to 255 and every possible combination of the three bytes stands for another colour . in most file formats , the rgb format is used for defining the colour . rgb stands for red green blue . it 's named this way , because the first of the three bytes tells you how much red there is in the pixel 's colour . the second byte tells you how much green there is in the colour and the third byte how much blue . the higher value the first byte has , the more red the pixel looks .
