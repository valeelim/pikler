Acupuncture     acupuncture is an ancient kind of medical treatment developed in china about 5000 years ago . thin metal needles are pushed into the body at certain places called `` acupuncture points '' . it is a form of alternative medicine , and a key part of traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) . it uses the chinese philosophy of yin and yang . there is no general agreement as to whether acupuncture is effective . it is difficult to do good research on this issue . a 2014 review article said `` researchers usually find that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted , how often ( that is , no dose-response effect is observed ) , or even if needles are actually inserted . in other words , 'sham ' or 'placebo ' acupuncture generally produces the same effects as 'real ' acupuncture and , in some cases , does better '' . a 2013 analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain ( compared to sham ) was modified by the location of the needles , the number of needles used , the experience or technique of the practitioner , or by the circumstances of the sessions .
