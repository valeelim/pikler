Blest Pair of Sirens     blest pair of sirens is a short work for choir and orchestra by hubert parry . it was composed in 1887. it is a setting of an ode called `` at a solemn musick '' by john milton . `` blest pair of sirens '' was first performed by the bach choir conducted by charles villiers stanford . at first stanford wanted to perform another work by parry : `` the glories of our blood and state '' . however , the performance was going to be part of queen victoria ’ s golden jubilee celebrations . the words of `` the glories of our blood and state '' were about death coming to kings and queens , so it was not thought to be appropriate , and so stanford asked parry to write a new work for the occasion . george grove suggested milton ’ s `` ode at a solemn music '' would be a good poem for parry to set . the first performance of `` blest pair of sirens '' at st james ’ s hall took place on 17 may 1887. it is very well written for choir with music that excellently fits milton ’ s powerful words . the choir divides into eight parts . the words are about man ’ s desire to join the heavenly music of the spheres .
