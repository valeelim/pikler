Sodium azide     sodium azide , also known as sodium trinitride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is nan . it is a white crystalline solid . it is an explosive . it can be detonated by an electric spark . it contains sodium and azide ions . it reacts with acids to produce hydrazoic acid . it can be destroyed by reacting it with nitrous acid . this reaction produces nitric oxide , nitrogen , and sodium hydroxide . it is a powerful reducing agent , which makes it explosive . it contains nitrogen in its -/ oxidation state . it is made by reacting ammonia with sodium to make sodium amide . the sodium amide then reacts with nitrous oxide to make sodium azide . it can also be made by reacting sodium nitrate with sodium amide . another process is reacting sodium nitrite with hydrazine . it is used in airbags . it makes the airbags puff out . a computer detects that the car is crashing and ignites the sodium azide . this makes sodium metal and a lot of nitrogen gas . the nitrogen gas inflates the airbag . it can be used to make other explosives , such as lead azide .
