Mechanical advantage     mechanical advantage ( also written as ma in formulas ) is the factor by which a machine multiplies force . the mechanical advantage of a machine can be used to find out how well a machine works and whether it can perform a particular job . the mechanical advantage of a machine is the ratio of the load ( the resistance overcome by a machine ) to the effort ( the force applied ) . for an ideal ( without friction ) mechanism , it is also equal to : there is no unit for mechanical advantages since the unit for both input and output forces cancel out .
