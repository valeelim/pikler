Katrina cottage     katrina cottages are small houses designed and marketed in the united states in the wake of hurricane katrina ( august 2005 ) . they were designed as a response to the inadequacies of the trailers issued to flood victims by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . the homes are designed to attempt to fulfill the needs of their occupants in a more permanent and weather-resistant manner , while addressing the challenges of building and protecting a home in the gulf coast region . some of the homes are elevated , on stilts , particularly in southern louisiana and mississippi , where much of the land currently used is near sea level , protected by levees , or prone to flooding by nearby rivers or coastal storm surges or high tides . though designs differ somewhat , the main factor for appearance is that katrina cottages look like traditional homes in the area , reduced in size to lower costs and ease construction so that multiple units can be built quickly as needed . the katrina cottages are usually one-bedroom , shotgun-house designs , with a front porch that helps stabilize the house from strong winds . hence , they tend to be smaller than many house trailers , which have 2 or 3 bedrooms ( as in a double wide trailer ) ; however , the cottages are constructed of heavier materials to resist winds that would buckle the light-weight walls of mobile homes .
