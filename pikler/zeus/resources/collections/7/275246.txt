Tau lepton     tau ( τ ) leptons ( aka tauons , tau particle ) are one of the very small elementary particles . this means that they are believed to be so small that they can not be divided any more . tau leptons can be thought of as very heavy electrons , as they are both leptons . this is because they have about 3,500 times as much mass as electrons , and about 17 times as much mass as muons . since they only live for 2.9x10 seconds , they do not have a significant role in the regular world . however , they are very important in the decay of subatomic matter . like the other two basic leptons , tauons have a neutrino named after them ( the tau neutrino ) . tau have a charge of -1 , and can be written as τ. since antimatter has the opposite of charge of regular matter , anti-tauons have a charge of +1 , and can be written as τ. tauons themselves are unstable , and can decay . also , τ and τ can annihilate each other in a form of decay . when a single tauon decays , it is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons ( things made of quarks ) . τ and τ can be formed by an electron-positron ( antielectron ) pair combining . the two tauons then decay into an electron and a positron or a muon and an antimuon , and four of the various neutrinos . however , a single tauon decays differently than a tauon and an antitauon .
