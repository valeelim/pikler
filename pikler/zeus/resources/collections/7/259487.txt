Roman roads in Britain     the roman roads in britain were , with roman aqueducts , and the roman army , one of the most impressive features of the roman empire in britain . in britannia , as in other provinces , the romans constructed a network of paved trunk roads ( surfaced highways ) . in their nearly four centuries of occupation ( 43 â€“ 410 ad ) they built about 2,000 miles of roman roads in britain . they are shown on the ordnance survey 's `` map of roman britain '' . this contains the most accurate and up-to-date layout of certain and probable routes that is readily available to the general public . the pre-roman britons used unpaved trackways , including very ancient ones running along the ridges of hills , such as the south downs way , now a public long-distance footpath . in contrast , most of the roman network was surveyed and built from scratch , with the aim of connecting key points by the most direct possible route . the roads were all paved , to permit heavy freight-wagons to be used in all seasons and weather .
