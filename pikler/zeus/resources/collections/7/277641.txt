Sterile neutrino     sterile neutrinos , also known as neutral heavy leptons , heavy neutrinos , or right-handed neutrinos , are theoretical particles that are extremely difficult to find . this is because they are not affected by all of fundamental forces that rule normal physics , only gravity . they are detected by a theory called the seesaw mechanism which says that when sterile neutrinos are near other neutrinos ( tiny particles which are not affected by much ) , they increase their own mass by lowering the mass of the nearby neutrinos . detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity .
