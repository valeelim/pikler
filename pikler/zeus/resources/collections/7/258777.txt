Package management system     a package management system keeps track of information about software packages : what files go where , and which package owns that file , therefore behaving like a phone directory . examples of package management systems for linux include dpkg , rpm and emerge . in microsoft windows , `` add/remove programs '' / '' programs and features '' are like package managers , but use no format ( it leaves it up to the program ) .
