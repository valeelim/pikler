Auger electron spectroscopy     auger electron spectroscopy is a way of telling what chemical elements are at the surface of an object . when an electron is removed from a core level of an atom , a higher energy level electron may fall in the vacancy . if the energy released by the fall is transferred to another electron , the latter ( called auger electron ) will be emitted from the atom , in what is called the auger effect , after the french physicist who discovered the phenomenon , pierre auger . the kinetic energy levels of the auger electrons depend on the type of the atoms from which the electrons were ejected , and the chemical environment of the atoms . aes consists of bombarding a sample with energetic electrons and measuring the energy of the auger electrons , obtaining a spectra that can be used to get information about the identity and environment of the emitting atoms .
