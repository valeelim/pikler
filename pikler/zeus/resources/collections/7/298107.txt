Stonefly     the stonefly '' or plecoptera '' ' are an order of aquatic insects . there are some 3,500 described species worldwide , and new ones are still being discovered . although stoneflies are found worldwide , they are absent from antarctica . stoneflies are believed to be one of the most primitive groups of neoptera . their close relatives are identified from the carboniferous and lower permian geological periods . true stoneflies , known from fossils , are only a little younger . the larva have claws on their legs . this allows them to better hang on to things in their environment and withstand stronger current . they need fast moving water in streams and rivers to survive . they can not tolerate the low oxygen saturation found in warm water . they usually live in cold clean streams with a lot of turbulence ( such as rapids ) . the adult stoneflies are easily identified by their wings that fold over their abdomen . the `` pteronarcys '' stoneflies , found only in north american waters , live for several years .
