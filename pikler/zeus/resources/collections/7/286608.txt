John McDouall Stuart     john mcdouall stuart ( 7 september 18155 june 1866 ) is regarded as one of australia 's greatest explorers . he went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of australia . he was leader of six of these expeditions . he spent more time out in the australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer . on each trip , he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey . in 1862 , he crossed australia from adelaide , south australia , to van diemen gulf in the northern territory . he was the first european to cross the continent from north to south and then return again . exploring australia caused stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi . he pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance . each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back . stuart 's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle . his route was used to build the australian overland telegraph line from adelaide to darwin which joined an undersea line from java . this meant that for the first time , australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world . but his personal rewards were small . he was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers . stuart died poor in england at the age of 50 .
