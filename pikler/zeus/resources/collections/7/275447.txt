Down quark     down quarks ( sometimes written as a `` d '' ) are very small particles that help make up many larger particles , like protons and neutrons . down quarks have a charge of -1/3 . since down quarks are fermions ( which means that no two of them can exist in the same space at the same time ) , they have a spin of 1/2 . down quarks are the second lightest quark , the first being up quarks . the antiparticle of a down quark is a down antiquark , or simply an antidown .
