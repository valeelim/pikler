List of African dinosaurs     this is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from africa . africa has a rich fossil record , but it is patchy and incomplete . prosauropods dating from the early triassic period , about 230 million years ago , have been discovered in madagascar . africa is rich in triassic and lower jurassic dinosaurs . african dinosaurs from these time periods include `` syntarsus '' , `` dracovenator '' , `` melanorosaurus '' , `` massospondylus '' , `` euskelosaurus '' , `` heterodontosaurus '' , `` abrictosaurus '' , and `` lesothosaurus '' . the middle jurassic is poorly represented in africa . only the three sauropods `` cetiosaurus '' , `` lapparentosaurus '' , and `` archaeodontosaurus '' have been discovered dating from this time period . the upper jurassic , however , is well represented in africa , mainly thanks to the spectacular tendaguru formation . `` allosaurus '' , `` ceratosaurus '' , `` elaphrosaurus '' , `` giraffatitan '' , `` dicraeosaurus '' , `` janenschia '' , `` tornieria '' , `` tendaguria '' , `` kentrosaurus '' , and `` dryosaurus '' are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from tendaguru . this fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the morrison formation in the united states and the lourinha formation in portugal . for example , `` allosaurus '' , `` ceratosaurus '' , and `` dryosaurus '' have been found in both the tendaguru and the morrison . this has important biogeographical implications .
