Béarnaise sauce     béarnaise sauce ( ) is a sauce made of clarified butter , egg yolks , and herbs . it is considered to be a 'child ' of the mother hollandaise sauce , one of the five mother sauces in french haute cuisine . the difference is only in their flavouring : béarnaise uses shallot , chervil , peppercorn , and tarragon , while hollandaise uses lemon juice . in appearance it is light yellow and opaque , smooth and creamy . béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak . although a similar recipe was published in 1818 , béarnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef collinet , the inventor of puffed potatoes ( ) , and served at the 1836 opening of `` le pavillon henri iv '' , a restaurant at saint-germain-en-laye , not far from paris . evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for henry iv of france , a gourmet himself , who was born in the former province of béarn . a béarnaise sauce is simply clarified butter , an egg yolk , a shallot , a little tarragon vinegar . it takes years of practice for the result to be perfect .
