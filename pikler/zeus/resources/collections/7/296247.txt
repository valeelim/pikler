Preludes (Chopin)    preludes ( chopin ) preludes , op . 28 is a collection of short pieces for piano . these pieces were written by frédéric chopin between 1837 and 1838. they were published in the middle of 1839 , just after the composer 's winter sojourn ( stay ) on the isle of majorca with george sand . chopin was greatly influenced by johann sebastian bach in the composition of these preludes . the title may have been a tribute to bach 's 24 preludes and fugues in `` the well-tempered clavier '' . like bach , chopin journeys through the circle of fifths . the preludes begin in c major and end in d minor . one of the well-known ones is prelude no . 15 , nicknamed `` raindrop '' . this nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment . it reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops . another well-known number is prelude no . 4 with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment . the `` preludes '' are all very different . many are very short , so the atmosphere changes quickly , and this can make the overall structure seem disorganized and uncontrolled .
