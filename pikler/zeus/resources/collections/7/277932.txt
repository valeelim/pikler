Earthquake performance simulation     earthquake performance simulation is meant to study effect of earthquakes on building structures and is a practical way of seeing a thing to happen without it actually taking place in the same way . the best way to do it is to put the structure on a shake-table that simulates the seismic loads and watch what may happen next ( if you have no time to stand out in the field and wait for a real earthquake to strike , of course ) . the earliest experiments like this were performed more than a century ago another way is to evaluate the earthquake performance analytically . the very first earthquake simulations were performed by statically applying some `` horizontal inertia forces '' , based on scaled peak ground accelerations , to a mathematical model of a building . with the further development of computational technologies , statics approaches began to give way to dynamics ones . other websites . - network for earthquake engineering simulation ( nees ) - aem earthquake simulation
