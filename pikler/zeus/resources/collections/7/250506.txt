On the Origin of Species     on the origin of species is the famous book by charles darwin . it gave evidence for evolution , and suggested what had caused evolution to happen . its full title was `` on the origin of species by means of natural selection , or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life '' . it was published in london by john murray in november 1859. it was translated into many languages , and has been in print ever since . the title since the 6th edition of 1872 has been `` the origin of species '' . this is the most important single book in the biological sciences , and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research . darwin 's book did two things . first , it provided a great deal of evidence that evolution has taken place . second , it proposed a theory to explain `` how '' evolution works . that theory is natural selection . evolution by natural selection is the key to understanding biology , and the diversity of life on earth . darwin 's ideas on the connection between natural selection and inheritance were unclear , mainly because the process of genetic inheritance was unknown at that time . this was solved in the mid-20th century by the modern evolutionary synthesis , which showed that gregor mendel 's genetics was compatible with evolution in small steps . darwin made almost no mention of the evolution of the human race , though most of the controversy raged around this topic . darwin eventually published `` the descent of man '' in 1871 .
