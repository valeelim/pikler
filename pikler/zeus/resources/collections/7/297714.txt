Thin layer chromatography     thin layer chromatography ( or tlc ) is a method by which mixtures are separated into their individual components . tlc is performed on a tlc plate . these plates consist of a layer of silica and are usually backed by a thin piece of glass , although other materials like plastic may be used . the silica coating on the front of the tlc plate is called the stationary phase . the process of running a tlc experiment starts with placing a small droplet of liquid analyte near the bottom of the tlc plate . this is called “ spotting ” the tlc plate . very thin glass tubes are commonly used as spotters . once a plate has been spotted , it is placed into a glass container with a small amount of solvent . this solvent is called the mobile phase . it is important that the height of the solvent is below the height that the compound was spotted on the plate . as the solvent moves up the tlc plate by capillary action , the compound will also move . the compound will be separated into its components based upon each component ’ s attraction for the stationary phase versus the mobile phase . components that are attracted to the mobile phase more than they are attracted to the stationary phase will move further up the column . attractive forces are based on polarity differences .
