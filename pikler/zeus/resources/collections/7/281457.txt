Farrier     a farrier is a person who works with iron , or other materials , to make horseshoes and take care of horse 's hooves . they check for signs of disease and make sure the feet are well cared for . at one time , a farrier and blacksmith had almost the same job , which can be seen by the etymology of the word : farrier comes from middle french : `` ferrier '' ( `` blacksmith '' ) , from the latin word `` ferrum '' ( `` iron '' ) . today , farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing , and on the care of the horse 's hoof . for this reason farriers and blacksmiths are now known to be different jobs . by law , in great britain , it is illegal for anyone except a registered farrier to call themselves a farrier or to carry out any farriery work under the farriers ( registration ) act 1975. the main aim of this act is to `` prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons '' . the worshipful company of farriers a london livery company , was set up in 1356. it still offers diplomas which are recognised qualifications to be a modern farrier .
