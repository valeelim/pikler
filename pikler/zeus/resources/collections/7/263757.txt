Paridae     the paridae is a family of tiny birds , the tits ( called 'chickadees ' or 'titmice ' in north america ) . they are passerine songbirds which are native to the northern hemisphere and africa . most of them used to be classified in the genus `` parus '' , which has now been split up . these birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills . some have crests . they range in length from 10 to 22 centimetres . they are adaptable birds , with a mixed diet including seeds and insects . many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed , and learn to take other foods . in britain , great tits and blue tits learned to break through the foil caps sealing bottles of milk on doorsteps , to get at the cream on top . of course , the change in milk packaging has robbed them of this delicacy . these are hole-nesting birds , typically using trees , although some species build nests on the ground . they lay anything from three to nineteen speckled white eggs , depending on species .
