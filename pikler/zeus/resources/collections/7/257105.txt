Zangalewa     `` zangaléwa '' or `` tsaminamina '' is a 1986 hit song , originally sung by a makossa group from cameroon called golden sounds who were popular throughout africa for their silly dances and costumes . the song was such a hit for golden sounds that they eventually changed their name to zangaléwa , too . the song pays tribute to african skirmishers ( a.k.a tirailleurs ) during ww2 . most of the band members were in the cameroonian army themselves and used make up , fake belly and fake butt for comic relief . the song is still used today almost everywhere in africa by soldiers , policemen , boy scouts , sportsmen and their supporters , usually during training or for rallying . it is also widely used in schools throughout the continent especially in cameroon as a marching song and the lyrics are well-known among cameroonians . the song was also popular in colombia where it was known as “ the military ” and brought to the country by west african djs . the men in the group often dressed in military uniforms , wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes with pillows to appear like they had a swollen buttocks from riding the train and overweight stomachs from eating too much . music historians say the song , or at least part of it , is a criticism of black military officers who were in league with whites to oppress their own people . the rest is cameroonian slang and jargon from the soldiers during the war .
