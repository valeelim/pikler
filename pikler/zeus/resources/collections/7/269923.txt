Lucius Verus     lucius verus ( lucius ceionius commodus , 15 december 130 – 169 ) was roman co-emperor with marcus aurelius ( 121–180 ) , from 161 until his death . in practice , he was the junior partner of the great marcus aurelius . when his father died in early 138 , hadrian chose antoninus pius ( 86–161 ) as his successor . antoninus was adopted by hadrian on the condition that verus and hadrian ’ s great-nephew marcus aurelius was to be adopted by antoninus as his sons and heirs . verus started his political career as a quaestor in 153 , became consul in 154 , and in 161 was consul again with marcus aurelius as his senior partner . antoninus died on 7 march 161 , and was succeeded by marcus aurelius . although the senate planned to confirm marcus alone , he refused to take office unless lucius received equal powers . the senate accepted , granting lucius the `` imperium '' , the tribunician power , and the name augustus . it was the first time that rome was ruled by two emperors . in spite of their nominal equality , marcus held more authority than verus . he had been consul once more than lucius , he had shared in pius ' administration , and he alone was `` pontifex maximus '' . it would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior . as the biographer wrote , `` verus obeyed marcus ... as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor '' .
