Macbeth (opera)    macbeth ( opera ) macbeth is an opera by giuseppe verdi . it is based on shakespeare ’ s play with the same name . the opera is normally in italian , though there is also a french version that 's almost never used anymore . the libretto ( the words ) was written by francesco maria piave with some extra additions by andrea maffei . verdi wrote several works based on shakespeare plays . `` macbeth '' was the first of these . it was composed in 911at a time when he was composing a lot of operas . in those days italian operas were always about a love story , but `` macbeth '' was unusual because there was no love story . instead , it is a story about wanting power , even if means murder . the opera helped to make him very famous , and it has remained one of his most popular operas . andrea maffei , a poet and friend of verdi , suggested to him that `` macbeth '' would be a good story to make into an opera . verdi did not read shakespeare ’ s original work until after he had composed the opera . the words were written for him by piave who based the libretto on an italian translation . verdi loved the story , he thought it was “ one of the greatest creations of man ” . the opera is very similar to the story told by shakespeare , but verdi uses a large chorus of witches instead of just three . the last act ends with the refugees coming together on the english border , and , in the revised version , ends with a chorus of bards celebrating their victory over the cruel tyrant .
