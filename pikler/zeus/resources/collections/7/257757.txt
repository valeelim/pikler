A Day in the Life     `` a day in the life '' is a song by the english rock group the beatles . it is the last song on the group 's 1967 album `` sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band '' . it is a very famous song . many people think that the first verse was written about the death of tara browne , the 21-year-old heir to the guinness fortune and close friend of lennon and mccartney , who had crashed his lotus elan on 18 december 1966 when a volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in redcliffe gardens , earls court . in many interviews , lennon said this was the verse 's main inspiration . however , george martin thinks that it is a drug reference ( as is the line `` i 'd love to turn you on '' and other passages from the song ) and while writing the lyrics lennon and mccartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights . the description of the accident in `` a day in the life '' was not a literal description of browne 's fatal accident . lennon said , `` i did n't copy the accident . tara did n't blow his mind out , but it was in my mind when i was writing that verse . the details of the accident in the song — not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene — were similarly part of the fiction .
