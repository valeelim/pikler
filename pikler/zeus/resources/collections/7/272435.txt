Bronze Age collapse     the bronze age collapse is so called by historians who study the end of the bronze age . they see the change in the near east and eastern mediterranean from the late bronze age to the early iron age , as violent , sudden and culturally disruptive . the palace economies of the aegean and anatolia of the late bronze age were replaced , eventually , by the village cultures of the 'greek dark ages ' . between 1200 and 1150 bc , the cultural collapse of the mycenaean kingdoms , the hittite empire in anatolia and syria , and the egyptian empire in syria and canaan , interrupted trade routes and extinguished literacy . in the first phase of this period , almost every city between troy and gaza was violently destroyed , and often left unoccupied : examples include hattusa , mycenae , ugarit . the gradual end of the dark age saw the rise of settled neo-hittite aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century bc , and the rise of the neo-assyrian empire . every important anatolian site during the preceding late bronze age shows a destruction layer . it appears that civilization did not recover to the same level as that of the hittites for another thousand years . hattusa , the hittite capital , was burned and abandoned , and never reoccupied . troy was destroyed at least twice , before being abandoned until roman times .
