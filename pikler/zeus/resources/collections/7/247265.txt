Commutative property     the commutative property of addition and multiplication tells us that it does not matter which number we add first , or multiply first . we will still get the same answer if we add them backwards . the same thing goes for multiplying backwards . the definition of commutative property of addition is , when we substitute any number for `` a '' and `` b '' , formula_1 . for example , formula_2 , because formula_3 and formula_4 are both formula_5 . it does n't matter whether the formula_6 or the formula_7 comes first . 2+3=3+2 is the same as formula_1 , when formula_9 and formula_10 . we can substitute fractions too . formula_11 . either way , it adds to formula_12 . and for good mathematicians , we can substitute irrational numbers as well : formula_13 . some operations like dividing are not commutative . for instance , 6 divided by 3 is 2 , but 3 divided by 6 is 1/2 . do not divide backwards . dividing is not commutative . subtracting is not commutative either : 6−2 is 4 , but 2−6 is minus 4. exponentiation is not commutative , either : for example , 2³ is 8 , but 3² is 9 .
