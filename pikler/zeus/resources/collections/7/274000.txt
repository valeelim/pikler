Firmicutes     the firmicutes are a phylum of bacteria , most of which have the gram-positive type of cell walls . the group is typically divided into the clostridia , which are anaerobic , the bacilli , which are aerobic , and the mollicutes , a class of bacteria which do not have cell walls . on phylogenetic trees , the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic , as do their main genera , `` clostridium '' and `` bacillus '' . firmicutes make up the largest portion of the mouse and human gut microbiome . the division `` firmicutes '' as part of the gut flora has been shown to be involved in energy resorption and obesity .
