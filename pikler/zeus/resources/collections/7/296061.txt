Lepidodendron     lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive ( tree-like ) plant . they were the first large land plants , and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora . they were huge , over , and the trunks were often over in diameter . sometimes called 'giant club mosses ' , they are actually closer to the quillworts `` isoetes '' than to clubmosses . they thrived during the pennsylvanian sub-period of the carboniferous 315â€“300 million years years ago . the conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the amazon basin . the river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across pangaea 5000 km from eastern canada to the ukraine , and was 700 km wide . this would make the pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on earth today . the rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the pennsylvanian , and was replaced by a cooler , drier climate . the wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the gondwana continent against laurussia , causing the zone of contact to be raised . the end of the coal measures marks the end of the carboniferous period . china was too far away to be affected , and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years , into the early permian .
