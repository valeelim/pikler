Precocial     precocial in biology is a developmental strategy . it refers to species in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching . it applies mainly to mammals and birds . the opposite developmental strategy is called altricial , where the young are born or hatched helpless . these two categories are at ends of a continuum . all degrees exist in birds and mammals . with the tiny eggs of invertebrates , different strategies have evolved . many use some kind of metamorphosis , in which different stages of growth occupy different environmental niches . a checklist is used to score a species between precocial and altricial . in each case , 'yes ' means precocial : 1. down or fur present ? 1. eyes open ? 1. mobile ? 1. feed themselves ? 1. parents present ? the contrast between the two extremes is seen most clearly in birds . precocial species leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching . megapodes are a family of birds found in australasia . their eggs are not incubated by the parents . they are buried in compost , covered with sand and left , though the males test the temperature of the heap and make small adjustments . the eggs , which have a large yolk , hatch with full wing feathers . the hatchlings can run and purse prey , and many species can fly on their first day . these birds are super-precocial .
