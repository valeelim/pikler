Harmonic damper     a harmonic damper is a device connected to the free end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine . it is needed in engines with long crankshafts , such as straight-8 engines . it is used on most engines to reduce torsional vibrations that can occure at certain speeds . the damper consists of an inner hub attached to the end of the crankshaft . an round mass is attached to the hub by an elastic material . this become a spring-mass-damper system . by selection of the damping material and the size of the mass , the damper can be made to quiet the torsional vibrations . the overall appearance is that of a thick disk .
