Lactose intolerance     lactose intolerance is when a person can not digest milk or milk products ( such as cheese or yoghurt ) . lactose is a disaccharide sugar ( double sugar molecule ) , which must be split ( digested ) into two simple sugars ( monosaccharides ) , glucose and galactose . an enzyme called lactase is needed to break it down . people with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities . because of this they are unable to digest lactose . up to 75 % of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults . this loss of ability ranges from 5 % in northern europe , to over 71 % in sicily and to over 90 % in parts of africa and asia . there is no cure for lactose intolerance . people need to change their diet to only include food with very little lactose . there are many milk substitutes . milk is not a fermented product . if is not digested , then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy . amino acids are changed to other substances , which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy .
