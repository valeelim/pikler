Chromate     chromate is an ion that contains one chromium atom ( in its +6 oxidation state ) and four oxide atoms . its formula is cro . its overall charge is -2. dichromate is similar , but it contains two chromium atoms and seven oxide atoms ( therefore , cro ) . chromate and dichromate are strongly oxidizing in acidic conditions , but weakly oxidizing in basic conditions . chromates are generally bright yellow , while dichromates are generally orange or red . they can be made by reaction of chromium ( iii ) oxide and a metal oxide in a basic environment . they can be destroyed by reaction with reducing agents . the oxygen in the air boosts the chromium atom 's oxidation state from +3 to +6 . chromates and dichromates are harmful when powdered because the dust is carcinogenic ( it can cause cancer ) . this can be avoided by reducing chromate with something like iron ( ii ) sulfate . examples . - chromates - sodium chromate - potassium chromate - dichromates - potassium dichromate - ammonium dichromate other pages .
