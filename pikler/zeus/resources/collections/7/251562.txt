Avimimus     avimimus ( meaning `` bird mimic '' ) was a recently discovered maniraptoran . it was a very fast moving , light-weight , bird-like theropod dinosaur that lived in the late cretaceous in what is now mongolia , around 70 million years ago . that may have had feathers . the forelimbs were relatively short . the bones of the hand were fused together , as in modern birds , and a ridge on the ulna ( lower arm bone ) was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by kurzanov . kurzanov , in 1987 , also reported the presence of quill knobs , and while chiappe confirmed the presence of bumps on the ulna , their function remained unclear . kurzanov was so convinced they were attachment points for feathers that he concluded that `` avimimus '' may have been capable of weak flight . the presence of feathers is now widely accepted , but most paleontologists do not believe `` avimimus '' could fly .
