NFPA 704     nfpa 704 , also known as a fire diamond , is a diamond-shaped sign or picture that tells people about the hazards of a chemical compound . it was designed in 1960 by the national fire protection association , as a way of quickly telling firefighters and other emergency workers what kind of dangers might be nearby . the sign is made of four smaller diamonds : a red one on top , a yellow one on the right , a white one on the bottom , and a blue one on the left . numbers or symbols in these boxes tell how dangerous the chemical is . the red diamond tells how flammable the chemical compound is : how easily it catches fire . the yellow diamond tells about reactivity : how quickly the compound reacts with other materials . ( for example , some chemicals , like ammonium nitrate , explode when they touch water ; this is an example of reactivity . ) the blue diamond tells how dangerous the chemical is to a person 's health . each of these three diamonds - red , yellow , and blue - are given a score between 0 and 4. a score of 0 means there is no danger . a score of 4 means there is the worst possible danger .
