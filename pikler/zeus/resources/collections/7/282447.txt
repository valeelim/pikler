Matanuska-Susitna Valley     matanuska-susitna valley ( known locally as the mat-su or the valley ) is an area in southcentral alaska . it is south of the alaska range about from anchorage , alaska . it includes the valleys of the matanuska river , the knik river , and the susitna river . the matanuska valley has become a suburban community for many people who work in anchorage . it is now one of the most crowded areas in alaska and includes the towns of palmer , wasilla , big lake , houston , willow and talkeetna . there are three mountain ranges in the area . they are the alaska range , the talkeetna mountains and the chugach mountains . there are both working and old gold mines in the mountains . like many parts of alaska , the matanuska-susitna valley was carved by glaciers which left many lakes . both the matanuska and susitna rivers have lots of salmon . the local government is called the `` matanuska-susitna borough . '' most of the united states is divided into counties , but alaska uses `` boroughs '' instead , and some parts of it are not even in a borough . a few hundred alaska natives were joined by small numbers of `` alaska sourdoughs '' between 1900 and 1930 when hundreds of `` colonists '' were moved there by the united states federal government in the early 1930s . in the 1970 's lots of newcomers to alaska came to anchorage . later on a lot of them moved to the matanuska valley to live an `` alaskan country '' lifestyle .
