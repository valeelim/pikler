Baud     in telecommunications , baud is the unit to measure the symbol rate . if one symbol can be transmitted per second , this is equal to one baud . the unit is named after jean-maurice-Ã©mile baudot a french telecommunications engineer who invented the baudot code . the baud rate is different from the gross bit rate , measured in `` bits/second '' . various modulation schemes invented in the 20th century such as phase-shift keying can make bit rates much higher than signal rates . in another example , gigabit ethernet has a symbol rate of 125mbd . gigabit ethernet uses pulse-amplitude modulation and can transmit two bits of payload data per symbol . gigabit ethernet uses four wires for transmission . it can transmit formula_1 .
