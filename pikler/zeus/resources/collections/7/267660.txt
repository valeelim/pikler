Blast furnace     a blast furnace is a special type of furnace for smelting iron from ore. blast furnaces are very large . they can be up to tall and in diameter . the blast furnace is the biggest chemical reactor . blast furnaces are also called high ovens . a blast furnace is usually built with a steel case and bricks made of magnesia inside the case . magnesia is very resistant to heat . it does not melt . the furnace is cooled with water running inside part of the case and bricks . the process of making iron is simple . iron ore is basically iron oxide . iron is made by removing the oxygen . this leaves crude iron called `` pig iron '' . this process of removing oxygen is called smelting . carbon is used in the reduction process , with the ore heated to a high temperature . carbon easily takes the oxygen off the ore in high temperatures . ore , limestone and carbon in the form of coke are put into the top of the blast furnace in layers . at the same time , hot air called `` wind '' is blown inside the furnace . special nozzles called `` tuyeres '' are used to put the air in the furnace . the nozzles are at the bottom of the furnace . this process is called `` blasting '' . it is why it is called a `` blast furnace '' . the coke ignites ( = lights into fire ) and burns . this creates carbon monoxide because there is not enough oxygen to make carbon dioxide . the carbon monoxide then reduces the metal oxide to the metal and makes carbon dioxide . this process is used to make iron . the limestone forms a substance called slag with the rock of the iron ore .
