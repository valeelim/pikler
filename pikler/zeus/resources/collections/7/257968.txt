Calcium chloride     calcium chloride is a chemical compound made of calcium and chlorine atoms . it has the formula of cacl . it absorbs water from the air and releases heat when it is dissolved in water . it is used as a de-icer on roads to melt the ice . it can be formed by mixture of calcium oxide with hydrochloric acid , but this produces a version that is hydrated ( has water molecules attached to it ) . the anhydrous ( no water molecules attached ) form is needed most of the time . calcium chloride is melted at a high temperature and electrolyzed to produce calcium metal .
