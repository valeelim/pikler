Geological formation     a formation , or rock formation , is the fundamental unit of lithostratigraphy . a formation consists of a certain number of rock strata . they have similar lithology ( rocks ) , sedimentary facies ( appearance ) or other properties . formations are not defined on the thickness of the rock strata , and the thickness of different formations can therefore vary widely . the concept of formally defined layers or strata is central to stratigraphy . a formation can be divided into 'members ' and are themselves packed together in 'groups ' . formations were initially described as time markers , based on relative ages and the law of superposition . the divisions of the earth history # geologic time scale were the formations described and put in chronological order by the geologists and stratigraphers of the 18th and 19th centuries . rock formations are formed by sedimentary deposition in environments which may persist for hundreds of millions of years . for example , the hammersley basin in pilbara , western australia , is a proterozoic sedimentary basin where up to 1200 million years of sedimentation is preserved intact . here , up to 300 million years is represented by a single unit of banded iron formation and shale .
