Christian Dior     christian dior ( granville , manche , basse-normandie , 21 january 1905 â€“ montecatini , italy , 24 october 1957 ) , was the leading french fashion designer of the post-war world . he was the founder of one of the world 's top fashion houses , the `` house of dior '' ( now `` christian dior '' ) . during the german occupation of france in world war ii , christian dior dressed the wives of nazi officers and french collaborators . on 8 october 1946 he founded his own fashion house , backed by marcel boussac , the cotton-fabric magnate . for his first collection , in early 1947 , the phrase `` the new look '' was coined by `` harper 's bazaar '' , the fashion monthly . dior 's designs were more voluptuous than the economy shapes of world war ii , when fabric was rationed . dior was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes ; he said `` i have designed flower women '' . his look employed fabrics lined with percale ( a closely woven plain-weave fabric ) , boned , bustier-style bodices , hip padding , wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats . this made his dresses flare out from the waist , giving his models a very curvaceous form .
