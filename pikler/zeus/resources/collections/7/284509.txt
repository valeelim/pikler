Achondroplasia     achondroplasia is a form of dwarfism . it is part of the chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias family which makes bones in a human 's skeleton be too short or grow too slowly . it often affects the femur and humerus . it is caused by a dominant allele . that means only one parent has to have the gene . this gives a child a 50 % chance of getting the condition . if both parents have the gene the chances are increased to 75 % , but in 25 % of the cases , it is very unlikely that the child would live more than a few months . however , the condition can also occur without either parent having the gene . achondroplasia is caused by a change in the dna for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. this change affects the making of cartilage . now that the part of the dna that causes the condition is known , there is hope that new treatments may be developed .
