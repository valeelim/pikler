Random forest     random forest is a statistical algorithm that is used to cluster points of data in functional groups . when the data set is large and/or there are many variables it becomes difficult to cluster the data because not all variables can be taken into account , therefore the algorithm can also give a certain chance that a data point belongs in a certain group . this is how the clustering takes place . - of the entire set of data a subset is taken ( training set ) . - the algorithm clusters the data in groups and subgroups . if you would draw lines between the data points in a subgroup , and lines that connect subgroups into group etc . the structure would look somewhat like a tree . this is called a decision tree . - at each split or node in this cluster/tree/dendrogram variables are chosen at random by the program to judge whether datapoints have a close relationship or not . - the program makes multiple trees a.k.a . a forest . each tree is different because for each split in a tree , variables are chosen at random .
