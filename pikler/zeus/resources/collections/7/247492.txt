GNU Emacs     gnu emacs ( short for editing macros ) is a text editor that is common on many unix-based operating systems . emacs is primarily used by programmers . emacs is made powerful by emacs lisp , a built-in programming language that lets the user extend the capabilities of the editor . a common emacs joke is that all of the functions of the editor are crazy weird keystrokes ( such as `` control-meta-4 shift-left-p-semicolon-f1 '' to do something simple like cut and paste text ) . in reality , though , these keystrokes are relatively simple , though they can take some getting used to . there is an internet turf war between programmers that prefer emacs and programmers that prefer vim ( or vi ) , another common text editor .
