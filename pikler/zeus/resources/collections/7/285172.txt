Anna Pavlova     anna pavlova ( st petersburg , 12 february 1881 – the hague , netherlands , 23 january 1931 ) was a russian , and later english , ballerina of the early 20th century . she is widely regarded as one of the finest classical ballet dancers in history . she was a principal artist of the imperial russian ballet and the ballets russes of serge diaghilev . pavlova is most recognised for dancing the rôle of `` the dying swan '' . she danced this short ballet ( only four minutes ) about 4000 times . the choreography was by mikhail fokine . her interpretation influenced the way others danced odette in tchaikovsky 's `` swan lake '' . in the early 20th century , with her own company , pavlova became the first ballerina to tour ballet around the world . the young pavlova 's years of training were difficult , as classical ballet did not come easily to her . her severely arched feet , thin ankles , and long limbs clashed with the small , compact body favoured for ballerinas at the time . her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as `` the broom '' and `` la petite sauvage '' ( the little savage ) . undeterred , pavlova trained to improve her technique . she took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day . she was never a perfect technician , but had delicacy , lightness and grace .
