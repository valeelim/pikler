Peter Waldo     peter waldo , valdo , or waldes ( `` c '' . 1140 – `` c '' . 1218 ) , also pierre vaudès or de vaux , is believed by many to have started the waldensians . this was a christian spiritual movement of the middle ages . people are still alive in southern europe who come from this movement . because not much was written down about waldo while he was alive , people do not agree how important he was to the waldensians , because it may have been around before his leadership . also , the french historian thuanus thought waldo died in the year 1179. not many details are known about the life of waldo . some sources say that he was a rich man who sold clothes , and that he was a merchant from lyon . also , sources say that he had some education . sometime not long before the year 1160 he was inspired by some events . one of these was hearing a sermon on the life of st. alexius . another was when saying that one did not believe in transubstantiation ( which is the belief that , during communion , the bread and wine turn into the body and blood of jesus christ ) became a crime for which one could be punished by death . a third event was the sudden death of a friend during an evening meal . after this , he began living a radical christian life . he gave his property to his wife . he gave the rest of his things to the poor .
