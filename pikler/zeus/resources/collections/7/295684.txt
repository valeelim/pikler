'' he knew that his mother was watching the game on tv and he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her . he also asked for a priest . his life was saved when the team 's trainer , jim pizzutelli who was a former army medic who had served in vietnam . had reached into malarchuk 's neck and pinched off the bleeding . he did not let go until the doctors arrived to begin closing the wound . after the doctors spent 90 minutes and used over 300 stitches to close the wound he returned to practice four days later and was back in the net against the quebec nordiques after about a week . he said , `` doctors told me to take the rest of the year off , but there was no way '' , `` the longer you wait , the harder it 's going to be . i play for keeps '' . he made in time for the playoffs but the sabres lost to the boston bruins 4 games to 1 .
