Copper(II) hydroxide    copper ( ii ) hydroxide copper ( ii ) hydroxide , also known as cupric hydroxide , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is cu ( oh ) . it contains copper in its +2 oxidation state . it also contains hydroxide ions . copper ( ii ) hydroxide is light blue . it is rubbery when wet . when it is mixed with copper ( ii ) carbonate , it is greenish . it reacts with carbon dioxide to make copper ( ii ) carbonate when in air . it turns into copper ( ii ) oxide when wet . when it is dry , though , it only turns into copper ( ii ) oxide when it is heated . it reacts with ammonia to make a very dark blue solution . copper ( ii ) hydroxide can be made by reacting copper sulfate with sodium hydroxide . potassium hydroxide can be used , but it is more expensive . it can also be made by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a copper anode . copper ( ii ) hydroxide is used to kill mold in paints . it can be used to color ceramics . it can be used as a catalyst . it is not toxic in small amounts , but it can dissolve in stomach acid to make soluble copper , which can poison much more easily .
