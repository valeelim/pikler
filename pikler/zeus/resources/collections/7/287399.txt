Boyle's law    boyle 's law boyle 's law ( also called mariotte 's law and the boyle-mariotte law ) is a law about ideal gases . the law can be stated as follows : in other words , the volume of a constant mass of ideal gas at a constant temperature is inversely proportional to its pressure . in symbols , the law is : or where `` p '' is the pressure of the gas , `` v '' is the volume of the gas , and `` k '' is a constant . for a given mass of gas at a constant temperature , the product of the pressure and the volume is a constant . as the volume decreases , the pressure increases in proprotion , and vice versa . for example , when the pressure halves , the volume doubles . suppose you have a tank that contains a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure . when you decrease the volume of the tank , the same number of gas particles is now contained in a smaller space . therefore , the number of collisions increases . therefore , the pressure is greater . imagine you have a gas at a certain pressure ( p ) and volume ( v ) . if you change the pressure to a new value ( p ) , the volume changes to a new value ( v ) . we can use boyle 's law to describe both sets of conditions :
