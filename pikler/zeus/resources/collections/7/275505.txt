Top quark     top quarks or truth quarks are the heaviest known elementary particles ( particles that are so small that they can not be divided ) . all quarks are elementary particles , and since they are fermions ( which means that no two of them can exist in the same place at the same time ) , they have a spin of 1/2 . top quarks interact with all four of the fundamental forces , which are gravity , electromagnetism , strong force , and weak force . almost all of the time , top quarks will decay into a bottom quark and a w boson , although it can sometimes decay into a strange quark . one top quark weighs about as much as one atom of tungsten . since top quarks are so massive , scientists have been able to make predictions about the mass of the theoretical particle known as a higgs boson . unfortunately , top quarks are only believed to be able to exist for 5x10 seconds .
