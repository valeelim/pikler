Spiritual successor     a spiritual successor , sometimes called a spiritual sequel or a companion piece , is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first . spiritual successors still have the same elements , themes , and styles as the first . the nature of the publisher/maker system are basic in almost all computer games . as well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies . these are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made . this often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons . one of the reasons it the `` core '' of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks . a good example of this strategy is electronic arts . they have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks , such as bullfrog productions , origin systems , and westwood studios . to get around this , creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way , without copying the first directly . for example , the video games `` timesplitters '' and , `` perfect dark '' are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game `` goldeneye 007 '' .
