Future of the Earth     the future of the earth will depend on many things , including increases in the brightness of the sun , loss of heat energy from the earth 's core and change of the planet 's orbit by the other things in the solar system . the milankovitch theory says the planet will continue to go into glaciation cycles because of the planet 's difference in orbit from a perfect circle , the axis of the planet tilting , and pushing of the earth 's orbit . as part of the supercontinent cycle , plate tectonics may create a supercontinent within 250 million–350 million years . some time in the next 1.5 billion–4.5 billion years , the axis 's tilt may begin to change into bad versions , with changes in the axis 's tilt of up to 90° . one billion to two billion years in the future , the increase in solar radiation caused by the helium build-up at the core of the sun will result in the loss of the oceans and the cessation of continental drift . four billion years from now , the increase in the earth 's surface temperature will cause a bad greenhouse effect . by that point , most if not all the life on the earth will be gone . the most likely fate of the planet is being destroyed by the sun in about 7.5 billion years , after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet 's orbit .
