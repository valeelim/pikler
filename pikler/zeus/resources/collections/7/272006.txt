Traditional animation     traditional animation is much harder than today 's style of animation . it often uses a stop-motion camera to `` liven '' , or animate , the photos made by the producer . when movie-makers use stop-motion , they need to draw one picture for every scene . however , there are tools to help save time with movie-making . other types of animation , such as limited or digital animation , can also be used now . fps is the number of times a movie is shot in one second . the photographer first shoots out or edits many photos . these photos are combined to make the storyline . and as with all movies , not all scenes make it into the final movie . many people help out in the editing of a movie . but in old times , people had to draw the scenes on their own . then the stop-motion camera took a photo of a scene once a second . most movies or cartoons in the 1950 's required very hard work of the editors . to make things cheaper , though , people made limited animation that used two to three copies of the same image ( so the stop-motion process would be two to three times faster . )
