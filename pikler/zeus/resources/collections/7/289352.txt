Apterygota     the apterygota are a small subclass of primitive insects . they are insects which have never had wings at any time in their evolutionary history . their first known occurrence in the fossil record is in the rhynie chert of the devonian period , ~400 million years ago . while some other insects , such as fleas , also lack wings , these are descended from winged insects , and have lost them during the course of evolution . by contrast , the apterygotes are a primitive group of insects that diverged from other orders before wings evolved . they have some other primitive traits ( features ) . the nymphs ( younger stages ) go through little or no metamorphosis , so they look like the adults . they continue to moult throughout life , with multiple instars ( stages ) after reaching sexual maturity . all other insects have only a single sexually mature adult stage . their skin is thin , making them appear translucent . males deposit sperm packages rather than fertilising the female internally . currently , no species are listed as being at conservation risk .
