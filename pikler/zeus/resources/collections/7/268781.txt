Bugle     the bugle is a very simple brass instrument . it has no valves or other mechanisms , the only way the player has to control the pitch is changing the shape of his lips . this means that only notes from the harmonic series can be played . the bugle comes from instruments made from animal horns . the earliest bugles were shaped in a loop – usually a double loop , but sometimes triple or single – similar to the modern french horn , and were usually used to send messages during hunts . predecessors and relatives of the developing bugle included the post horn , the pless horn , and the bugle horn . the first use of a brass horn as a military signal was the halbmondblaser , meaning `` half-moon blower '' , used in hanover in 1758. it was u-shaped ( this is where its name comes from ) and easily carried with a shoulder strap . it first arrived in england in 1764 where it was slowly it became used often by foot soldiers . cavalry did not normally use a proper bugle , but instead used an early trumpet that made a sound which was easier to hear from nearby , but travelled less far .
