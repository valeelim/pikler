Vermiculite     vermiculite is a phyllosilicate mineral that is dug out of the ground in china , south africa , russia and brazil . when it is dug from the ground it is a hard rock . vermiculite gets bigger when it is heated and changes into a material that looks like worms . this was first done in the united states of america in the year 1824. when vermiculite has changed into small grains it is a very good material for insulation and is used to stop the escape of heat in things like ovens , furnaces and houses in cold countries . it is also very good at holding water so it is used in the soil of plants in pots and helping to grow seeds . because the vermiculite grains are spongy ( they can be pressed flat and then they open again ) but not hard they are used inside cases or boxes to protect articles from breakage when they are being transported . vermiculite is also used in hydroponics as a material for the roots of plants to hold on to . because it does not burn vermiculite is used with other materials in fillings in walls or ceilings ( the roof of a room ) to stop the spread of fire .
