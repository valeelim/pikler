Abstraction     abstraction is a process of removing or hiding details about something . it concerns the ways by which higher , less `` real '' concepts are derived from the usage and classification of literal ( `` real '' or `` concrete '' ) data or other information . abstractions may be formed by reducing the information content of a concept or a phenomenon as viewed , often to keep only the information which is needed for a particular purpose . for example , abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball will keep only the information on general ball attributes and behavior , omitting the traits of that particular ball . compare with word : `` generalizing '' . the opposite of the adjective `` abstract '' is commonly the word `` concrete '' . the first symbols of abstract thinking in humans can be traced to fossil objects dating between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago in africa . in philosophical terminology , `` abstraction '' is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects . abstraction uses a strategy of simplification , where formerly concrete details are left ambiguous , vague , or undefined ; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient .
