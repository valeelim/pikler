Tarbosaurus     tarbosaurus was a large carnivorous theropod dinosaur from asia , especially mongolia and china . it was a tyrannosaurid dinosaur which flourished between 70 and 65 million years ago , at the end of the cretaceous period . `` tarbosaurus '' lived in a humid floodplain criss-crossed by river channels . in this environment , it was a predator at the top of the food chain , probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur `` saurolophus '' or the sauropod `` nemegtosaurus '' . tarbosaurus is known from dozens of specimens , with several complete skulls and skeletons . these remains have allowed scientific studies on its phylogeny , skull mechanics , and brain structure . like its close north american relative tyrannosaurus rex , it had a large head and powerful jaws , but was not top heavy . its huge skull was comparatively light , with large air pockets . many of its bones were hollow , making them strong but light , so they did not add excessive weight to this large predator . its skull was similar to that of `` tyrannosaurus '' , but more rigid . also , because its skull was not so broad at the back , it did not have binocular vision like `` tyrannosaurus '' .
