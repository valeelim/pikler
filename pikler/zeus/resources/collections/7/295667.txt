'' in the united states the history of voir dire goes back to the massachusetts jury selection law of 1760. many cases that went to trial involved seditious libel . british officials in the colonies put anyone on trial who printed anything criticizing british rule . to get every conviction possible , the british government made sure to only pick jurors who would convict the defendant . the sheriff was made responsible to select a list of jurors favorable to the british crown . to counter this , the 1760 massachusetts law required the list the sheriff used to be selected by a town meeting . in those public meetings prospective jurors were questioned about any biases they might have . defendants were also able to question possible jurors before they were selected . this voir dire process made jury selection fair . in 1774 the british parliament cancelled the 1760 massachusetts law . they left jury selection up to the court . this gave the crown a free hand in making sure trials ended the way they wanted . but , two years later the americans declared their independence . the american system of voir dire was developed from that time on .
