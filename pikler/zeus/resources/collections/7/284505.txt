White matter     the central nervous system is made of two types of tissue : white matter and grey matter . grey matter contains nerve cell bodies , and white matter is made of the nerve fibres . when a sample is freshly cut , it usually slightly pink in appearance ( for both types ) . when preserved in formaldehyde , white matter appears to be almost white . white matter consists mostly of myelinated axons : . myelin is a lipid tissue ( a fat ) with capillaries . it helps to keep the electrical in the nerve fibre . this is important for fast and accurate sending of signals . in the brain white matter is surrounded by grey matter most of the time . in the spine , white matter is outside , and grey matter inside : the myelin sourrounds the nerve cells , and helps the transmission of nerve signals . white matter is used to connect different areas of grey matter . if a section of white matter is damaged , the brain may be able to find a different route to replace the lost connection . the brain contains a third kind of tissue , which appears darker . it is called substantia nigra , a part of the brain that is involved in pleasure & reward , addiction and movement .
