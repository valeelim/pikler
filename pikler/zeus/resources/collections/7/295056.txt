Blue plaque     the blue plaque is a scheme for remembering the links between famous people and buildings by placing commemorative plaques on the walls . the scheme was started by the royal society of arts in london , and the very first plaques was , in fact , of red terracotta placed on the outside of a former home of lord byron ( since demolished ) . the society erected 36 plaques between 1866 - 1901 , responsibility for them was transferred to the london county council ( 1901-65 ) ( which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue ) and later the greater london council ( 1965-86 ) and most recently english heritage . similar schemes are now operated in all the member countries of the united kingdom . english heritage looks after the blue plaque scheme in the london boroughs . similar schemes exist outside london , run by each local authority . the system has been adopted outside the united kingdom too , for example , in june 2010 a blue plaque was put on the home of guernsey artist peter le lievre .
