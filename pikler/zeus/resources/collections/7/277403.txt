Chimera (mythology)    chimera ( mythology ) the chimera ( greek : χίμαιρα , `` khimaira '' , from χίμαρος , `` khimaros '' , `` she-goat '' ) according to greek mythology , is a monstrous creature that was composed of several different animals . the chimera is only one of several famous mythological hybrids . as with all mythical creatures , there is the question of its origin . in some traditions , the chimera was one of the offspring of typhon and echidna and sister of such monsters as cerberus and the lernaean hydra . however , the chimera does not appear to have an existence in physical reality , save for the individual animals from which it is composed . the most common description of the chimera comes from homer 's `` illiad '' , in which the creature is said to have the head of a lion , the body of a goat , and tail of a snake . it is also believed to breath fire and be female , despite the mane adorning the lions head . the chimera was said to be incredibly vicious and powerful , especially since as one single creature , it possessed the abilities of three separate animals .
