Hexameter     hexameter is a metrical line of verse . it is usually made of six parts , called feet . it is the standard verse form used in ancient greek and latin literature . the iliad and aeneid use it , and so do ovid 's metamorphoses . the meter consists of lines made from six ( `` hex '' ) feet . in strict dactylic hexameter , each of these feet would be a dactyl , but classical meter allows for the substitution of a spondee ( two long syllables ) in place of a dactyl in most positions . specifically , the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely . the fifth foot is frequently a dactyl ( around 95 % of the time in homer ) . because of the strong pause at the end of the line , it is traditionally regarded as a spondee . thus the dactylic line most normally looks as follows : as in all classical verse forms , the last syllable can actually be short or long .
