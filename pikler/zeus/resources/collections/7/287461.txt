Sudo     the sudo command is a program for unix-like operating systems like linux distibutions which allows a user to run a program as the root ( the administator ) . it is an abbreviation for `` super user do '' . `` superuser '' means `` administrator '' . it is important to have a sudo command as it keeps normal users from making changes to the computer 's files that can seriously mess up the system , making it unusable . the sudo command must be used from the command line , but it can run together with any other commands and software that use the command line . for example , to delete a file ( example.php in this example ) that require permissions that normal users do not typically have , the user can type : typing the above would show up like this : after that , the program would ask for the password . when the password is entered correctly , the computer would then run the command . programs with a graphical user interface can also be run with sudo , but it may mess them up . various desktops for unix-like systems usually have their own version of sudo for such programs .
