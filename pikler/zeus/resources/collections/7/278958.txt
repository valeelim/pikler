Strict weak ordering     strict weak ordering is a binary relation on a set . such relations define a strict ordering , but they contain several elements of the same type . an example might be the relation `` costs less than '' , or `` is cheaper than '' . for any two elements that are `` of different types '' , the relation holds . on the other hand , there are some elements that can not be ordered that way , because they are of the same type . an example for such a relation may be the relation , `` costs less than '' : milk may `` cost less than '' bread , and bread may cost less than cake . two items of different types may cost less than another , but they can otherwise have the same price . two different algorithms that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters , but they will always give an ordering where the four-letter words come before the five-letter-words , and after the three-letter-words . time will give a strict weak ordering too ; events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen at the same time .
