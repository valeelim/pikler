Egyptian Islamic Jihad     egyptian islamic jihad ( eij ) , originally called al-jihad , is an egyptian terrorist group based on an extreme interpretation of islam . it has been active since the late 1970s . it is under worldwide embargo by the united nations as a group linked to al-qaeda . it is also banned by several governments around the world , including that of the russian federation . since 1991 it has been led by ayman al-zawahiri , who is now the leader of al-qaeda . according to zawahiri , the eij was `` different from the takfir wal hijra group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins . and we are different from the muslim brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government '' . the organization 's original main goal was to overthrow the egyptian government and replace it with an islamic state based on the way it thought islam should be . later it broadened its aims to include attacking the united states and israel , and other interests in egypt and abroad . islamic jihad was responsible for the assassination of anwar sadat in 1981. sadat 's sinai treaty with israel , which recognized the jewish state , made them very angry .
