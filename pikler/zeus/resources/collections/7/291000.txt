Luria–Delbrück experiment     the luria–delbrück experiment , 1943 , also called the 'fluctuation test ' , asks the question : are mutations independent of natural selection ? or are they directed by the selection ? max delbrück and salvador luria showed that in bacteria , dna mutations happen randomly . this means they happen at any time , rather than being a response to selection . so , darwin 's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms . delbrück and luria won the 1969 nobel prize in physiology or medicine partly for this work . in their experiment , luria and delbrück grew bacteria in tubes . after a period of growth , they put equal volumes of these separate cultures onto agar containing phage ( virus ) . if virus resistance were not due to random gene mutations , then each plate should contain roughly the same number of resistant colonies . this , however was not what delbrück and luria found . instead , the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically .
