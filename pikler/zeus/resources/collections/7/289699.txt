Royal Canadian Navy     the royal canadian navy ( rcn ) was the navy of canada from 1911 to 1968. from 4 may 1910 to 29 august 1911 the navy was known officially as the `` naval service of canada '' and operationally as canadian naval forces . during the early years of the 20th century , there was a lot of talk in the british empire as to the role the dominions would play in defence and foreign affairs . because of the developing naval arms race with germany , a key part of this discussion focused on naval issues . in canada , the naval debate came down to a choice between two options : either the young country could provide funds , support and manpower to the royal navy , or it could form its own navy , which could help support the royal navy if necessary . after extensive political debates , canadian politicians chose to set up their own navy . the royal canadian navy served with the royal navy in world wars i and ii , but during the suez crisis of the 1950s canada and the united kingdom had different political views . coupled with mutinies in 1949 partly linked to old british ways the canadian government started looking at making sure the canadian navy had a very separate identity from the royal navy . in august of 2011 the three services were once again separated , ending decades of confusion and low morale . the royal canadian navy , the canadian army and royal canadian air force were reinstated .
