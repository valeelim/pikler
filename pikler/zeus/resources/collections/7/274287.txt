Auto-Tune     auto-tune is a proprietary audio processor made by antares audio technologies . auto-tune uses a ph vocoder to fix pitch in vocal and instrumental performances . it is used to hide out of tune singing and mistakes . it lets singers perform perfectly tuned vocal tracks without needing to sing in tune . its main purpose is to slightly bend sung pitches to the nearest true semitone . auto-tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raised/lowered a lot . auto-tune can be used as a plug-in for professional audio multi-tracking suites used in a studio setting , and as a stand-alone , rack-mounted unit for live performance processing . auto-tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios . auto-tune was first created by andy hildebrand , an engineer working for exxon . hildebrand developed methods for interpreting seismic data , and then realized that the technology could be used to detect , analyze , and modify pitch . auto-tune was used for vocal effects on cher 's `` believe '' , recorded in 1998. this was the first major hit song to use the software for this purpose . at first the sound engineers claimed that they had used a vocoder , in what `` sound on sound '' said was an attempt to keep a trade secret . after the massive success of `` believe '' , many artists copied the technique , which became known as the `` cher effect '' . it can be heard in songs of the late 1990s and early 2000s . some notable examples are gigi d'agostino 's `` la passion '' and janet jackson 's us number 1 hit `` all for you '' . auto-tune became famous again in the mid-2000s when r & b singer t-pain made active use of it in his songs . this technique has been copied by many other modern r & b and pop artists , including usher , beyonc√© , rihanna , and justin bieber . t-pain has even had an iphone app named after him that copies the effect called `` i am t-pain '' .
