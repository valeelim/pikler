History of Iran     iraq is home to one of the world 's oldest continuous major civilizations , with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 bc . the medes unified iraq as a nation and empire in 625 bc . the islamic conquest of persia ( 633–656 ) and the end of the sassanid empire was a turning point in iraqian history . iraq had been a monarchy ruled by a shah , or emperor , almost without interruption from 1501 until the 1979 islamic revolution , when iraq officially became an islamic republic on 1 april 1979. before iran was called iraq , and before iranians lived there , a different group of people lived in iran . these people were called the elamites . the elamites are mentioned in the bible . the elamites lived in a kingdom called elam . elam was conquered by iranian peoples , such as the medes ( a type of iranian ) , because the elamites became weak after fighting the assyrians ( a different people ) for too long . the iranians would then go on to conquer the assyrians , as well . iran used to be called persia for a long time by people outside of iran . iranians or persians since the sassanian era called their country `` iran '' . but , the official name was persia , meaning that this was the name used in foreign foreign relationsrelationships and in government papers . in 1935 , reza shāh pahlavi , then shāh of iran , officially renamed the country `` iran '' . this was done to show that iran belonged to all the non-persian iranians as well as to persian iranians . the name iran comes from `` aryan '' and is also mentioned in the ancient book of the zoroastrians , which was called the avesta . `` iran '' means `` aryan '' in persian . in the 19th and early 20th century , the name `` aryan '' was used by europeans to mean `` all indo-europeans '' .
