Edwin Hubble     edwin powell hubble ( november 20 , 1889 – september 28 , 1953 ) was an american astronomer . hubble 's findings changed the scientific view of the universe . in 1925 he showed that there are galaxies beyond our own , the milky way . also , he developed a method for classifying galaxies . then he proved the galaxies were moving away from each other . hubble found the degree of doppler effect ( redshift ) from a galaxy increased in proportion to its distance from earth . doppler effect is the change in pitch or colour when an object or sound comes in ( higher pitch , brighter color ) or moves away ( lower and darker ) . redshift is observed in the light spectrum in 1929 hubble formulated what is called hubble 's law . the law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies , the greater their relative speed of separation . georges lemaître , a belgian priest and astronomer , had published the idea two years before in an obscure journal . nevertheless , the idea bears hubble 's name to this day .
