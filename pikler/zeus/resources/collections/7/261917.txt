Collective animal behaviour     collective animal behaviour describes and analyzes the behaviour of groups of animals . in these groups , the animals are often all of the same species . as an example , a school of fish will be made of mostly the same type of fish and a flock of birds will have the same type of bird . a herd is a large group of hoofed , herbivorous mammals . animals tend to behave in such a way because this behaviour offers them a benefit . the group of animals also behaves differently from a single animal . collective animal behaviour is about finding the rules each animal follows ; how it communicates with other members of the group and how a decision to do something is reached in the group . full-time colonial animals fall into this category in principle , but in practice the species of interest here are those who form temporary groups . colonial animals have been researched for many years , and are usually based on some kind of family relationship . temporary collective behavior is a well-known phenomenon , but little researched until now .
