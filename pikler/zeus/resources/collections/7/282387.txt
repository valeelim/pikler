Guppy     the guppy ( poecilia reticulata ) , also known as the millionfish , is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species . it is a small member of the poeciliidae family ( females 4–6 centimetres ( 1.6–2.4 in ) long , males 2.5–3.5 centimetres ( 1.0–1.4 in ) long ) . like all other members of the family , it is live-bearing . guppies are popular aquarium kept fish because of their inexpensive needs and beautiful color ranges . guppies , like all fish , have gills . the heart of a guppy is very different from that of a mammal , for instance there are two compartments instead of four . they are called the auricle and ventricle . when the fish breaths the ventricle contracts and blood is forced out to the gills which act as lungs . this is where the gas exchange happens . the blood receives oxygen and releases carbon dioxide . the blood that now carries oxygen goes through the dorsal artery , which divides into smaller and smaller vessels and go all over the body to then distribute the oxygen and gets carbon dioxide and waste . then , the blood is carried to the heart by veins and lymph vessels . then the cycle repeats over and over .
