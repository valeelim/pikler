Halteres     halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies . they vibrate during flight , and help the insect fly better . the halteres evolved from wings . ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings , like dragonflies , hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do . flies have only the front pair of wings . halteres help balancing and improve flight . they help flies to perform their fast aerobatics . in addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings , they also help stabilise the head during flight . they are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes , telling the insect about its body position during flight . every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration , a result of the coriolis effect . if the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis , the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body . the insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres . the two halteres vibrate in different planes , each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect . this increases the information got from the halteres .
