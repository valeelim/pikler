Phase-shift keying     phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information . this is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave . in such a system , the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information ; all information is present in the phase of the signal . in many cases , this allows to better use the bandwidth available . if we think of a wave as a wiggly line , ( like a sine wave ) , wiggling a specific amount of times a second , and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in . say if it is at the top of its wiggle , and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle , this is called a phase shift . we can use that change to carry information . by either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle , we can send either ones or zeros . this is called binary phase shift keying . if we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top , we can have this represent a 1. if we do n't change it at the top , we can have this represent a 0. we can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it . a radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text .
