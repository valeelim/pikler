Point Hicks     point hicks , once called cape everard , is a coastal headland on the east coast of victoria , australia . it is now a part of the croajingolong national park . point hicks is where , on 19 april 1770 , the continent of australia was first sighted by the men on captain cook 's `` endeavour '' voyage . cook wrote that it was lieutenant zachary hickes who first saw land , and cook named the point after him . hickes spelt his name with an `` e '' , cook wrote both `` hicks '' and `` hickes '' in different places . the spelling `` hicks '' is now in use for the point . when george bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point . it did not appear on the charts matthew flinders made of their voyages , and the name fell into disuse . the point came to be known as cape everard . the first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer john lort stokes who surveyed the coast in the `` beagle '' in 1843. it is thought he named it after fellow naval officer john everard home , but his maps do not use the name .
