Milankovich cycle     milankovitch cycles are small , slow but regular changes in the earth 's orbit round the sun , and the tilt of the earth 's axis . the dynamics are complex . the changes affect the 'insolation ' ( sunlight falling on parts of the earth ) . this leads to cycles of climate on earth , at about 21,000 , 41,000 years , 100,000 and 400,000 years . this whole field is still under active research . using applied mathematics , milankoviÄ‡ predicted that variations in eccentricity , axial tilt , and precession of the earth 's orbit caused climate patterns on earth . similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by joseph adhemar , james croll and others . however , there was at first no reliable dated evidence . the issue was not settled until deep-ocean cores were taken and a paper published in `` science '' in 1976. earth 's orbit is an ellipse . the eccentricity is a measure of the departure of this ellipse from circularity . the shape of the earth 's orbit varies in time between nearly circular and mildly elliptical .
