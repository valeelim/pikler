Erosion     erosion is a process where natural forces like water , wind , ice , and gravity wear away rocks and soil . it is a geological process , and part of the rock cycle . erosion occurs at the earth 's surface , and has no effect on the earth 's mantle and core . most of the energy that makes erosion happen is provided by the sun . the sun 's energy causes the movement of water and ice in the water cycle and the movement of air to create wind . erosion can cause problems that affect humans . soil erosion , for example , can create problems for farmers . soil erosion can remove soil , leaving a thin layer or rocky soil behind . erosion can also cause problems for humans by removing rocks or soil that support buildings . temperature changes cause pieces of rock to flake away from the surface . also , the acid in rainwater dissolves rocks containing calcium carbonate . these processes are called weathering . water erosion happens when water moves the pieces of rock or soil downhill . waves also carry away small pieces of material . a wave can wash up onto the surface of rock or soil and then carry away pieces of material as it flows back into the ocean or lake .
