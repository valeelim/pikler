Frederick William IV of Prussia     king frederick william iv of prussia ( ) ( 15 october 1795 â€“ 2 january 1861 ) was the eldest son and successor of frederick william iii of prussia . he reigned as king of prussia from 1840 to 1861. frederick william was educated by private tutors . he served in the army during the war of liberation against napoleon i of france in 1814 , but he was not interested in the army . he loved both architecture and landscape gardening and was a patron of several great german artists , such as architect karl friedrich schinkel and the composer felix mendelssohn . he married elisabeth ludovika of bavaria in 1823 , but the couple had no children . frederick william was romanticist , and had a nostalgia for the middle ages , therefore he was conservative already at an early age . he was against both liberalisation and unification of germany and preferred to allow austria to remain the first power in the german states . in the beginning of his reign he did not continue the reactionary policies of his father , he reduced press censorship and promised a constitution , but he did not want a popular legislative assembly , but preferred to work with the aristocracy . he was lutheran , but he released the imprisoned roman catholic archbishop of cologne , and he decided to help the construction of cologne cathedral . in 1844 , he attended the celebrations of the completion of the cathedral , so he was the first king of prussia who entered a roman catholic building . when he finally called a national assembly in 1847 , it was not a representative body , but rather a united diet which cold speak for all the provincial estates and had the right to grant taxes and loans but no right to meet at regular intervals .
