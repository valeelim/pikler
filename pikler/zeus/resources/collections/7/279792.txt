Tesla (unit)    tesla ( unit ) the tesla ( symbol t ) is the si derived unit used to measure magnetic fields . tesla can be measured in different ways ; for example , one tesla is equal to one weber per square meter . the tesla was first defined in 1960 by the general conference on weights and measures ( cgpm ) . it was named in honor of the physicist , electrical engineer , and inventor , nikola tesla . using only the seven base si units , the definition of a tesla is : using other si derived units , a tesla is also equal to : the units used are : a = ampere < br > c = coulomb < br > kg = kilogram < br > m = meter < br > n = newton < br > s = second < br > t = tesla < br > v = volt < br > wb = weber a tesla is also equal to 10,000 ( 10 ) gauss in the cgs system of units . example values . - 3.1×10–5.8 t – the earth 's magnetic field at its surface - 5×10 t – the strength of a typical refrigerator magnet - 0.3 t – the strength of solar sunspots - 1.25t – the strength of the surface of a neodymium magnet - 1.5−3 t – strength of medical magnetic resonance imaging systems
