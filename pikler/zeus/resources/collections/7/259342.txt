Tin(II) chloride    tin ( ii ) chloride tin ( ii ) chloride , also known as stannous chloride , is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is sncl . it has tin and chloride ions in it . the tin is in its +2 oxidation state . it is a colorless crystalline solid . it is a reducing agent . it is poisonous to mollusks like clams and oysters . it reacts with water to make tin ( ii ) oxide hydrate , which is white , and hydrochloric acid . that is why tin ( ii ) chloride is normally dissolved in hydrochloric acid . it reacts with oxygen in the air to make tin ( iv ) chloride and tin ( iv ) oxide . it reacts with silver and gold compounds to make silver and gold metal . it also reacts with ferric compounds to make ferrous compounds . it reacts with bases to make tin ( ii ) oxide hydrate , which is white ; if more base is added , the tin ( ii ) oxide hydrate dissolves to make a clear solution again . it is made when tin reacts with hydrochloric acid . it is used to electroplate tin on steel . it is used in the coloring of textiles . it is used to make silvered mirrors . a certain plastic uses it as a catalyst . it was used as a test for mercury ( ii ) ions . if it is added to a colorless solution of mercury ( ii ) , a white solid of mercury ( i ) would form . if more is added , a black solid of mercury metal would be made . it turns bright purple in a solution that has gold ions in it . it is used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent .
