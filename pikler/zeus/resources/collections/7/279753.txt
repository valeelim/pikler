Shonisaurus     shonisaurus is the largest ichthyosaur , and the largest extinct marine animal that has yet been found . it was found first in rocks of the upper triassic in nevada , and later in british columbia . fossils of `` shonisaurus '' were first found in a large deposit in nevada in 1920. thirty years later , they were excavated , uncovering the remains of 37 very large ichthyosaurs . these were named `` shonisaurus '' , ( `` lizard from the shoshone mountains '' ) . `` shonisaurus '' lived 216â€“203 million years ago . `` s. popularis '' was about 15 metres ( 50 ft ) long . a longer specimen is now placed in `` shastasaurus '' rather than `` shonisaurus '' . `` shonisaurus '' had a long pointed mouth that contained teeth only at the front end . it had a large whale-like body , a long dolphin-like snout , and its flippers were much longer , and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs . all of these features suggest that `` shonisaurus '' may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line . the first species discovered , `` s. popularis '' , was adopted as the state fossil of nevada in 1984. excavations , begun in 1954 under the direction of charles camp and samuel welles of the university of california , berkeley , were continued by camp throughout the 60s .
