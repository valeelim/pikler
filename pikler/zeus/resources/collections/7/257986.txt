Invertible matrix     in linear algebra there are certain matrices which have the property that when they are multiplied with another matrix , the result is the identity matrix . this matrix has ones on its main diagonal , and 0 everywhere else . the matrix which can achieve this result is called `` inverse '' : there are algorithms to calculate the inverse of a matrix , for example gaussian elimination . the problem is that finding the inverse is relatively `` expensive '' to do for big matrices . matrix inversion is used extensively in computer graphics .
