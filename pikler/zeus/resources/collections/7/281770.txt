Opossum     opossums are the largest order of marsupials in the western hemisphere , the didelphimorphia . they are often called possums , though that term is more properly applied to australian fauna of the suborder phalangeriformes . the virginia opossum was the first animal to be named an `` opossum '' : the word comes from the algonquian language , and means `` white beast '' . it was one of the few south american marsupials to establish itself permanently in north america after the great american interchange , and the only one to survive there today .
