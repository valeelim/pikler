Petrified wood     petrified wood ( from the greek root petro meaning `` rock '' or `` stone '' ; literally `` wood turned into stone '' ) is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation . it is the result of a tree having turned completely into stone by the process of per mineralization . all the organic materials have been replaced with minerals ( most often a silicate , such as quartz ) , while retaining the original structure of the wood . unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions , petrified wood is a three dimensional representation of the original organic material . the petrifaction process occurs underground , when wood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition .
