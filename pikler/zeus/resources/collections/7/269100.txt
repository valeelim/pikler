Futurism     futurism was a modern art and social movement which originated in italy in the early 20th century . it was largely an italian phenomenon , though there were parallel movements in russia , england and elsewhere . the futurists practiced in every medium of art , including painting , sculpture , ceramics , graphic design , industrial design , interior design , theatre , movies , fashion , textiles , literature , music , architecture and even gastronomy . the founder of futurism and its most influential personality was the italian writer filippo tommaso marinetti . marinetti launched the movement in his `` futurist manifesto '' , which he published for the first time on 5 february 1909 in `` la gazzetta dell'emilia '' . this article was reprinted in the french daily newspaper `` le figaro '' on 20 february 1909. marinetti was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni , carlo carr√† , giacomo balla , gino severini and the composer luigi russolo . marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old , especially political and artistic tradition . `` we want no part of it , the past '' , he wrote , `` we the young and strong `` futurists ! '' '' the futurists admired speed , technology , youth and violence , the car , the airplane and the industrial city , all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature , and they were passionate nationalists . they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation , praised originality , `` however daring , however violent '' , bore proudly `` the smear of madness '' , dismissed art critics as useless , rebelled against harmony and good taste , swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art , and gloried in science .
