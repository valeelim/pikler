Acrocanthosaurus     acrocanthosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in north america during the lower cretaceous period . its name means `` high-spined lizard '' . this refers to the spines on its vertebrae which formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive . its classification is uncertain . it was originally classified as a spinosaur , because the spines on its back looked like those of `` spinosaurus '' . however , `` acrocanthosaurus '' is now classified as a carnosaur . most paleontologists believe that it was a carcharodontosaurid . `` acrocanthosaurus '' was 39 feet long , almost as large as `` tyrannosaurus rex '' , and weighed about 6 or 7 short tons . it was the largest theropod in north america before the evolution of the tyrannosaurs . long , low ridges start at the nasal bones . they run along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye , and they continued onto the lacrimal bones . this is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids . there is a famous trackway in paluxy , texas , which shows tracks of what might be an `` acrocanthosaurus '' and its prey . while interesting and plausible , this hypothesis is difficult to prove and there are other explanations .
