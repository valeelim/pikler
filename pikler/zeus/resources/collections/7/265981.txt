Uppercut     an uppercut in boxing is a punch that usually aims for the opponent 's chin and therefore it is known in the common language also as hook to the chin ( for example in german : `` kinnhaken '' ) . in the technical language one does not use the expression `` hook to the chin '' , because as a rule one calls a `` hook '' a punch from the side with the lead hand and almost always the chin is the target of punches . the uppercut is often used to start or finish a set of punches . the uppercut is led from the region of navel in a going up move , therefore the shape of hook remains , before the fist reaches the opponent 's or body . other variants , for example in the thai boxing , are not striked from the region of stomach . instead , the boxer drops the fist from the cover only so long outside , as is necessary for shooting with enough force . pulling down the fist to the stomach extends the way , increases the needed time and therefore the opponent 's chance to use the open cover in his favor for a punch . an uppercut is very best performed in the closeness , then as the distance to the opponent increases the chance to not strike him arises . an uppercut causes as a rule the biggest damage , if it reaches the opponent 's chin , but also torso , nose and eyes are typical targets .
