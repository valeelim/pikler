Painful sexual act     painful sexual act is a medical problem where a person feels pain in their genitals before , during , or after a sexual act . doctors call this problem dyspareunia . it can have physical or emotional causes . both men and women can have dyspareunia . up to one-fifth of women ( one in every five ) may have dyspareunia at some point in their lives . when a woman experiences a painful sexual act , the pain may distract her from feeling pleasure and excitement . her vagina will be less lubricated ( wet ) and will not expand ( dilate ) as much as usual . when the vagina is dry and undilated , thrusting of the penis is painful . even after the original cause of her pain has disappeared , a woman may feel pain simply because she expects pain . in most cases , painful sexual acts have a physical cause at first . there are many physical problems that can cause or worsen painful sexual act . a doctor may be able to identify the cause by doing a careful physical examination and medical history . some of the most common physical causes are infections of the vagina , urinary tract , cervix , or fallopian tubes ; endometriosis ; scar tissue left by surgery ( like an episiotomy ) ; and ovarian cysts and tumors . common infections are mycoses ( infections caused by a fungus ) , candidiasis , chlamydia , trichomoniasis , urinary tract infections , coliform bacteria , monilial organisms and herpes ) . painful sexual act can also be caused by problems with a woman 's anatomy , like hymenal remnants ( pieces of the hymen that stay in the vagina ) or female genital mutilation , or when the entrance to the vagina has become too small for normal penetration ( sarrell and sarrell 1989 ) .
