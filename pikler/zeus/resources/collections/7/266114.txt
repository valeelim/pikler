Theodore Sturgeon     theodore sturgeon ( 26 february 1918 â€” 8 may 1985 ) was an american science fiction author . he used a special writing style called `` rhythmic prose '' . prose writing tells a story , but rhythmic writing is often poetry . his prose text would fit into a standard poetry rhythm , or meter . this made subtle shift in mood . usually the reader would not notice how the timing of the words changed their feeling . his most famous novel is `` more than human '' ( 1953 ) . sturgeon was born edward hamilton waldo in staten island , new york city in 1918. his name was legally changed at age eleven after his mother 's divorce and remarriage to william dicky ( `` argylle '' ) sturgeon . `` theodore sturgeon '' is occasionally misidentified as a pseudonym ; it was in fact his legal name . he sold his first story in 1938 to the mcclure syndicate , which bought much of his early ( non-fantastic ) work ; his first genre appearance was `` ether breather '' in `` astounding science fiction '' a year later . at first he wrote mainly short stories , primarily for genre magazines such as `` astounding '' and `` unknown '' , but also for general-interest publications such as `` argosy magazine '' . he used the pen name `` e. waldo hunter '' when two of his stories ran in the same issue of `` astounding '' . a few of his early stories were signed `` theodore h . sturgeon .
