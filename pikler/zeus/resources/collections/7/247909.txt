Ambient occlusion     ambient occlusion is a technique used in 3d computer graphics . the physics of how photons of light can occupy a space means that inner corners of objects ( or seams where 2 objects meet ) appear darker to the eye . because less light can occupy a corner . even when the corners are the same colour . imagine being inside a matte white cube with even light ; the surface colour is exactly the same so theoretically you should n't be able to see any corners or edges ; but because of the described effect you can .
