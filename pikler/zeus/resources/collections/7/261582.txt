Harlequin duck     the harlequin duck is a duck that lives in the sea . the female is plain , but the male has white markings . this is called `` disruptive coloration '' the male can be difficult to see against surfaces that are not a solid color , like water that ripples . the point is that it disrupts the appearance of body shape , but there are other explanations . in general , bright colours in male birds serve two main functions . one is sexual selection by the females , in which the colours act as evidence of the male 's suitability . the other is territory control by the males during the mating season . only experiments and long observation can decide which factors are in play .
