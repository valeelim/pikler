Natron     natron is a natural mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate ( naco·10ho , a kind of soda ash ) and about 17 % sodium bicarbonate ( also called nahcolite or baking soda , nahco ) along with small amounts of household salt ( halite , sodium chloride ) and sodium sulfate . natron is white or without color when it is pure . it can be gray or yellow with impurities . natron deposits are sometimes found in saline ( salty ) lake beds which arose in arid environments . throughout history natron has had many practical uses which are still used in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components . in modern mineralogy the word `` natron '' has come to mean only the `` sodium carbonate decahydrate '' ( hydrated soda ash ) which makes up most of the historical salt . the english word `` natron '' is a french cognate that came from the spanish `` natrón '' through greek νιτρων `` nitron '' , which came from the ancient egyptian word `` netjeri '' , meaning natron . the modern chemical symbol for sodium , na , is an abbreviation of that element 's new latin name `` natrium '' , which came from `` natron '' .
