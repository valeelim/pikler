Intron     an intron is a non-coding sequence in a gene . it is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by rna splicing to get the final rna product of a gene . the term `` intron '' refers to both the dna sequence within a gene , and the corresponding sequence in rna transcripts . sequences of coding dna which are joined together in the final rna after rna splicing are exons . they code for amino acids in the final polypeptide . introns are in the genes of most organisms and many viruses . they can be in a wide range of genes , including those that generate proteins , ribosomal rna ( rrna ) , and transfer rna ( trna ) . rna splicing takes place after transcription and before translation . - introns : parts of a gene which are discarded : non-working bits . - exons : parts of a gene which are expressed : bits of a gene which code for amino-acid sequences in a protein . the discovery of introns led to the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1993 for phillip sharp and richard roberts . the term `` intron '' was introduced by american biochemist walter gilbert .
