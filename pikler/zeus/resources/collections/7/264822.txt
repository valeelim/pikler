Yo-yo     the yo-yo is a popular toy made with of a length of string tied at one end to a flat spool . it is used by holding the free end of the string ( usually by inserting one finger in a slip knot ) and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn while it is hanging in mid-air , either winding or unwinding the string . it first became popular in the 1920s . in the simplest play , the string is wound on the spool by hand . the yo-yo is then thrown downwards , so that it goes down and unwinds the string . it then ( by inertia ) climbs back , winding the stringt up . finally the yo-yo is grabbed , ready to be thrown again . many other trick plays exist , most based on the basic `` sleeper '' trick . one of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is `` walk the dog '' . this is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor . english historical names for the yo-yo include `` bandalore '' ( from french ) and `` quiz '' . french historical terms include `` bandalore '' , `` incroyable '' , `` de coblenz '' , `` emigrette '' , and `` joujou de normandie '' ( `` joujou '' meaning little toy ) .
