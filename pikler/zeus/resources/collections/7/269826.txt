Evolutionary suicide     evolutionary suicide is not a standard term in evolutionary biology . it is not used in any standard textbook on evolution . it is the incorrect idea that the adaptation of an individual animal works in such a way that an entire species dies out . the idea is that evolution makes plants and animals pass on their genes to the next generation more efficiently , but it does not guarantee the survival of the population or the species . obviously , that is true , and extinction occurs often . evolution can not forsee the future . this is , however , nothing at all to do with suicide . a candidate for a future evolutionary suicide might be cod . cod is caught as fish by humans . the fish do not weigh as much as they used to , mostly because they do not survive long enough . they do , however , mature earlier . although this means the number of eggs per female fish is reduced , its effect depends rather on the extent of overfishing . data suggests that when fishing is controlled , cod numbers return to their former level . this was the lesson of world war ii , when cod fishing in many areas was greatly reduced , and pre-war cod numbers recovered .
