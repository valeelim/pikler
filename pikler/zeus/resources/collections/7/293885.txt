Levenshtein distance     levenshtein distance is a way to calculate how different two words are from one another . the simple way this works is by counting how many times you need to change one word to turn it into another word . for example , the levenshtein distance between `` kitten '' and `` sitting '' is 3 , since the following three edits change one into the other , and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits : 1. kitten → sitten ( substitution of 's ' for 'k ' ) 1. sitten → sittin ( substitution of 'i ' for 'e ' ) 1. sittin → sitting ( insertion of 'g ' at the end ) . this can be used by various websites when you change your password to make sure you 're not using a similar password that can decrease the security of the website . the given minimum distance between two passwords is recommended to be 5 , so that means that 5 changes need to take place between your old password and your new password for certain websites to accept your new password .
