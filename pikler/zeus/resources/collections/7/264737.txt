Hair follicle     a hair follicle is a part of the skin , which grows a hair by packing old cells together . attached inside the top of the follicle are sebaceous glands , which are tiny sebum-producing glands in almost all skin except on the palms , lips and soles of the feet . the thicker the hair , the more the number of sebaceous glands there are . also attached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber , called the `` arrector pili '' , which is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular ( upright ) to the surface of the skin . the muscle area can also cause the follicle to stick up slightly above the nearby skin ( piloerection ) with a pore incased with skin oil . this process results in goose bumps ( or goose flesh ) . stem cells are at the junction of the arrector and the follicle , and are principally responsible for the ongoing hair production during a process known as the anagen stage . the average growth rate of healthy hair follicles on the scalp is nearly per month .
