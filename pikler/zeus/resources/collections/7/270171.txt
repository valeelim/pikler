Roe v. Wade     roe v. wade was a 1973 landmark decision by the us supreme court . the court ruled that a state law that banned abortions ( except to save the life of the mother ) was unconstitutional . the ruling made abortion legal in many circumstances . the decision said that a woman 's right to privacy extended to the fetus/unborn child she was carrying . in the view of the court , during the first trimester an abortion was no more dangerous than carrying the fetus/child full term . the decision was 7-2 , with chief justice warren e. burger and six other justices voting for `` jane roe '' , and justices william rehnquist and byron white voting against it . the decision divided the nation and is still controversial today . people divided into pro-life and pro-choice groups . pro-life people said that abortions should not be allowed because it is the killing of unborn babies . pro-choice people said that a woman had the right to choose whether to have an abortion or not . roe was limited by a later decision called `` webster v. reproductive health '' ( 1989 ) , which allowed regulation of abortion in some cases . several states have considered laws banning abortions altogether .
