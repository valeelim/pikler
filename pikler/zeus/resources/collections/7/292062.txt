Bubble sort     bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm . it is simple to understand , so it is used as a training algorithm . it is not used in the real world , since it is not very efficient . to sort a list of numbers , the bubble sort goes through the list and compares every number to the next one . if those two numbers are in the wrong order , it will swap them . it will repeat this process , going back to the beginning every time it finishes , until the list is fully sorted . any list of numbers with the length `` n '' can be sorted in under `` n '' -1 rounds . first pass : second pass : third pass : this is pass optimized implementation of the algorithm . obviously , there is no necessity to do passes if array was sorted or became sorted after one of the passes . so in this implementation there is a flag `` swapped '' which signalize whether was swapped elements in the current pass or not . if not then cycle is ended . in the best case , then array is sorted already , complexity of this implementation is o ( n ) . in the worst case , then array sorted by descending , complexity is o ( n ) .
