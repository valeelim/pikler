Genetic code     the genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded within genetic material ( dna or mrna sequences ) is translated into proteins by living cells . biological decoding is done by the ribosome . this links amino acids together in an order specified by mrna . it uses transfer rna ( trna ) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mrna . the molecules read the mrna three nucleotides at a time . these nucleotide triplets are called codons . a codon specifies which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis . there are some exceptions , but usually a three-nucleotide codon represents a single amino acid . the genetic code among all organisms is very similar . it can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries . the genetic code decides the protein sequence for a given coding region ( gene ) . other regions in the genome can influence when and where these proteins are produced . related pages . - stop codon other websites . - the genetic codes â†’ genetic code tables
