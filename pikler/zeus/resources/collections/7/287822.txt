Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz     duchess louise of mecklenburg-strelitz ( german : `` luise auguste wilhelmine amalie herzogin zu mecklenburg '' ; 10 march 1776 â€“ 19 july 1810 ) was queen consort of prussia as the wife of king frederick william iii . after her husband 's ascension , louise developed many ties to senior ministers and became a powerful figure within the government as she began to command universal respect and affection . the queen always tried to stay informed of political developments at court , and from the very beginning of his reign the new king consulted louise on matters of state . though prussia had not fought in a war since 1795 , its military leaders were confident that they could win against napoleon 's troops . after a small incident concerning an anti-french pamphlet occurred , king frederick william was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the french emperor . prussian troops began mobilizing , culminating in the october 1806 battle of jena-auerstedt , which was a disaster for prussia , as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out . the king and queen had accompanied their troops into battle at jena ( with louise apparently dressed `` like an amazon '' ) , but had to flee from french troops .
