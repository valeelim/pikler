Eugène Dubois     marie eugène françois thomas dubois ( 28 january 1858 – 16 december 1940 ) was a dutch paleoanthropologist . he earned worldwide fame for his discovery of `` pithecanthropus erectus '' ( later redesignated `` homo erectus '' ) , or 'java man ' . although hominid fossils had been found and studied before , dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them . between 1887 and 1895 , dubois searched at potential sites near rivers and in caves , first on the island of sumatra , then on the island of java . in 1891 , dubois discovered remains of what he described as `` a species in between humans and apes '' . he called his finds `` pithecanthropus erectus '' ( `` ape-human that stands upright '' ) or java man . today , they are classified as `` homo erectus '' ( `` human that stands upright '' ) . these were the first specimens of early hominid remains to be found outside of africa or europe . in 1895 , dubois returned to europe and toured the continent to convince his colleagues that he had indeed found a missing link . although most anthropologists were intrigued , they did not always agree with dubois ' interpretations . after that , dubois refused others access to his fossils , until he was forced to do so in 1923 .
