Mercury-vapor lamp     a mercury-vapor lamp is a special lamp . it makes light by a spark in a tube that contains mercury . the spark makes the mercury atoms release ultraviolet and visible light . in some bulbs , the ultraviolet light shines on phosphors which make white light from it , although not all mercury-vapor lamps use phosphors . the eu wants to ban them because they contain large amounts of mercury and are not efficient like fluorescent bulbs . they last much longer though . they are the bluish streetlights . depending on the quality of the bulb , age of the bulb , phosphor used , and other chemicals added to the mercury , the color of the light can vary from blue-white to green-white , to almost pure white . a green tint usually indicates an older bulb , although it does n't necessarily mean that the bulb is about to burn out . the metal halide lamp is an improved version of the mercury vapor lamp that contains a metal halide ( usually sodium iodide ) in addition to the mercury . the metal halide produces orange light , which combines with the blue-white light from the mercury to produce a very pure white light .
