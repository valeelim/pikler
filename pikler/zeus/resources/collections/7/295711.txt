Artesian aquifer     an artesian aquifer is an underground layer which holds groundwater under pressure . this causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure . this type of well is called an artesian well . water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough , in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well . an aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel , limestone , or sandstone , through which water flows and is stored . an artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure . water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well . fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks . this is similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized . artesian wells were named after the old province of artois in france , where many artesian wells were drilled by carthusian monks from 1126 .
