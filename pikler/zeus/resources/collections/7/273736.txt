Sewage treatment     sewage treatment is the process of dealing with sewage so that is does not cause harm to people or to rivers . sewage flows in sewers from houses and factories . when it arrives at a sewage treatment works it passes through many stages . larger works often have more stages than a smaller works . large objects are removed using screens . the sewage then flows through a tank so sand can fall out . large objects and sand might damage machines in later stages . fats and solids are removed in the most important stage . sewage stays in a `` first '' tank until solids fall to the bottom . fat also floats to the top . fat and solids stay when the water leaves . water leaving the most important stage may be cleaned by bacteria and other very small animals and plants in the `` second '' important stage . these bacteria use oxygen from the air to eat chemicals from the sewage . cleaning bacteria may live in a small pond in simple works with enough land to build a pond . larger works use machines to help the bacteria find the chemicals . some works have rocks or pieces of plastic for the bacteria to grow on . water is pumped over the rocks or plastic .
