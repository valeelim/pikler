Passion play     a passion play is a religious drama of medieval origin dealing with the suffering , death , and resurrection of christ . early passion plays ( in latin ) consisted of readings from the gospel with interpolated poetical sections on the events of christ ’ s passion and related subjects , such as mary magdalene ’ s life and repentance , the raising of lazarus , the last supper , and the lament of the virgin mary . use of the vernacular in these interpolations led to the development of independent vernacular plays , the earliest surviving examples being in german . such plays were at first only preludes to dramatic presentations of the resurrection . the introduction of satan ( which became typical of german and czech plays ) , and thus of introductory representations of the fall of lucifer and the fall of man ( as in the early 14th-century vienna passion ) , and of scenes from the old testament and of the last judgment , led to development of cyclic plays similar to the corpus christi cycles . the great celtic passion cycles of cornwall and brittany , and the st. gall passion play ( which begins with the entry of st. augustine , who introduces the old testament prophets and patriarchs , and also includes the marriage at cana ) , exemplify this type of passion play .
