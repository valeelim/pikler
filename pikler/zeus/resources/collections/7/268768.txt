Galvanizing     galvanizing is the coating of a metal with a more reactive metal to stop corrosion . normally zinc is used to coat iron . the zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron , stopping the iron from corroding . even if the zinc is scratched , it does not corrode . metal corrodes after the paint is scratched . the zinc eventually corrodes all the way and then the iron starts corroding . galvanizing can happen in two ways . there is hot dip galvanising , where the object is dipped in a pool of liquid zinc . this makes a thicker coating that lasts a long time . it does not have a shiny clean surface , though , so some people would not like it as much . there is also electro-galvanizing . this is the electroplating of zinc onto an object . it is shiny but thinner , so it does not last as long . related pages . - electrolysis
