Gram-Schmidt process     the gram-schmidt process is a way of converting one set of vectors that forms a basis into another , more friendly one . suppose we have a set of vectors formula_1 that form a basis for formula_2 , and that we wish to convert these into a friendly basis . we begin by finding out which component of a vector is being unfriendly to a second vector , which we may do with inner products . if we have two vectors formula_3 , then we may find the component of formula_4 being unfriendly to formula_5 with formula_6 . by subtracting this from formula_5 , we get the component friendly to formula_4 . by returning to our abstract set formula_1 , we may make use of this observation to construct a general algorithm to convert an arbitrary basis into a friendly basis . like from our original set , each time we use the process on a new vector , it is guaranteed to be mutually friendly with all the previous vectors . define : formula_10 = formula_11 formula_12 = formula_13 et cetera , with the general term :
