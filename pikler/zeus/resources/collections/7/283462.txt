Royal Commission     in states that are commonwealth realms a royal commission is a major government public inquiry into an important issue . they have been held in the united kingdom , canada , australia , new zealand , kenya and saudi arabia . in hong kong , ireland and south africa , they are called a commission of enquiry or commission of inquiry . a royal commissioner has a lot of power , more than those of a judge but these are limited to the `` terms of reference '' of the commission . the commission is created by the head of state ( the sovereign , or his/her representative in the form of a governor-general or governor ) on the advice of the government . in practice–unlike other forms of inquiry–once a commission has started the government can not stop it . because of this governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish . royal commissions are called to look into very important matters and usually controversy . for example , these can be about government structure , the treatment of minorities , or the events that had received concern from the public or economic questions .
