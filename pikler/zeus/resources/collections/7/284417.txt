Ausonius     decimius magnus ausonius ( ca . 310–395 ) was a latin poet and rhetorician , born at burdigala ( bordeaux ) . ausonius was born in bordeaux in ca . 310. his father was a noted physician of greek ancestry . ausonius had a strict upbringing by his aunt and grandmother and received an excellent education , especially in grammar and rhetoric , but said his greek was not good . having completed his studies , he trained for some time as a lawyer , but he preferred teaching . in 334 , he established a school of rhetoric in bordeaux , which was very popular . his most famous pupil was st. paulinus of nola , who later became bishop of nola . after thirty years of this work , he was ordered by valentinian to the imperial court to teach gratian , the heir-apparent . the prince greatly respected his tutor , and after his accession bestowed on him the highest titles and honours that any roman ( besides from the royal family ) could attain , culminating in the consulate in 379. after the murder of gratian in 383 , ausonius retired to his estates near burdigala ( now bordeaux ) in gaul . these supposedly included the land now owned by château ausone , which takes its name from him . he appears to have been a late and perhaps not very enthusiastic convert to christianity . he died about 395 .
