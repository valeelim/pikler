International Auxiliary Language Association     the international auxiliary language association ( iala ) was founded in 1924 to promote widespread study , discussion and publicity in the establishment of an international auxiliary language , together with research and experiment . although it was created to determine which auxiliary language was best suited for international communication , it eventually determined that none of them was up to the task and developed its own language , interlingua . the iala continued to publish materials in and about interlingua until 1954 .
