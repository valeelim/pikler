Veil     a veil is a soft covering of all or part of the face . it has often been used by women in many cultures . it is often used by brides on their wedding day . it may have religious meaning , or it may be used for pleasure or dance . it is different from a mask because a mask is close-fitting , and often firm or hard , while a veil is soft and may fit loosely . veils are a kind of non-verbal communication . they always have some kind of unspoken message . some kinds of veil include a hood which covers the entire head , like a hijab . the point of covering the head entirely is to cover all parts which have any sexual meaning . a woman 's hair is one of her secondary sexual characteristics , and acts ( with her face , body and personality ) to attract the opposite sex . some religious groups believe that female sexuality should not be shown in public . the most important part of the head ( for the viewer ) is the face , because the human face takes part in communication . covering it says , in effect , 'this person is not available ' . that is why it has been used so often by women . because it is of soft material , the veil may be lifted back over the head or unclipped from one side . this is also a signal . it says 'now i am available ' . so brides lift their veil at the point when they are married .
