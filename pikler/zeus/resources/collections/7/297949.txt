Day of judgment     in the christian religion , the day of judgment is the day in the future when all people who are living or who have ever lived will be judged by god . it is often known as the last judgment , or sometimes it is called the day of the lord . in the old testament the prophets had said that one day god would send his son to forgive people for the wrong things they had done and to save their souls . in the early years of the christian church people thought that , although jesus christ had now visited the world and died for us on the cross , salvation will only be completed when the world ends and all people alive or dead will face god who will judge them . the day of the lord is mentioned several times in the old testament ( e.g . book of ezekiel chapter 13 v.5 and isaiah chapter 2 v.12 ) . in the new testament the coming of christ as judge of the world is mentioned very often . in paul â€™ s letters and in the revelation to john , the christians who are good will reign with christ for some time in this world . when christ comes his arrival will be announced by a trumpet call . he will come down from heaven . all the people who are alive will stay alive , and all the people who are dead will become alive again .
