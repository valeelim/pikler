Scroll lock     scroll lock is the name of a key on a computer keyboard that was meant to lock all scrolling methods . the scroll lock key is rarely used and only came about because the original ibm pc keyboard had it . it was supposed to change how the arrow keys work . for example , when the scroll lock mode was turned on , the arrow keys would scroll the contents of a text window instead of moving the cursor . today , the key does n't do anything in most programs , and as a result , many keyboards today , especially those on laptops , do not have the scroll lock key .
