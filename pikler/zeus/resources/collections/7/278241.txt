Liquid scintillation counting     liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique . it is used to measure radiation from beta ( alpha ) - emitting nuclides . it can also detect the auger electrons emitted from chromium-51 ( cr ) and iodine-125 ( i ) samples . samples of nuclides are dissolved or suspended in a `` cocktail '' . the `` cocktail '' is containing an aromatic solvent and small amounts of other additives known as fluors . beta ( alpha ) particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules . the molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors . the excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light . scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light . it makes it more easily detected . the samples are placed in small transparent ( often glass or plastic ) vials . they are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter . the counter has two photomultiplier tubes . they are connected in a coincidence circuit . the coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted .
