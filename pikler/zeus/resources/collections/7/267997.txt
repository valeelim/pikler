Body volume index     the body volume index is a proposed alternative to the body mass index ( bmi ) . the bmi is used as an indicator for weight problems such as being overweight or underweight . the bmi puts a persons total weight in relation to their height . this measure does not take into account where on the body the mass is located . recent studies have shown the limitations of bmi as an indicator of individual health risk . the bvi was made in 2000 as an alternative to the bmi . with the data , a computer should be able to check whether a person is obese . the bvi measures the bmi , the circumference of the waist , and the waist-hip-ratio . the bvi is used on a 3d full body scanner to determine the health risk of the person scanned . using the scanner , the bvi can differentiate between people with the same bmi , but with a different shape or weight distribution . the bvi is currently being tested in different hospitals in the us and europe ; a two-year project was started to see whether it would be as useful as the bmi .
