Lessepsian migration     lessepsian migration is the name given for the migration of marine species through the suez canal , between the red sea and the mediterranean . it is named after ferdinand de lesseps , who built the suez canal . the suez canal joined two biospheres that were separate before . many species migrated from the red sea to the eastern mediterranean . only a few species migrated in the other direction , from the mediterranean to the red sea . the migration can be seen most clearly when looking at fish species , even though other animals also migrated . when the suez canal was opened in 1869 , it created the first salt-water passage between the red sea and the mediterranean . the bitter lakes are two very salty ( hypersaline ) lakes about mid-way in the canal . at first , this blocked the migration of species from the red sea to the mediterranean . over the last decades , the salinity of the lakes changed , which made it easier for species to migrate . the red sea is higher than the mediterranean , at high tide , water flows from the red sea to the mediterranean . the red sea is also poor in nutrients , so species who migrate will find more nutrients . the waters of the red sea are saltier than that of the mediterranean . for these reasons , most species migrate from the red sea to the mediterranean , and only very few migrate in the other direction .
