Metastability     metastability has slightly different meanings in different fields of knowledge . the general idea , however , is that something is metastable if it is not changing , yet given a small force ( `` nudge '' ) it will transition to another , more stable state . for example , a block is sitting on a slope ( an `` inclined plane '' ) . it keeps sitting there until it is nudged , or the slope is gently struck , setting up vibrations . then the block starts to slide . at that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom . the block sitting at the bottom is stable . the block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable . and the block as it is moving is unstable . a real life example of this is an avalanche of snow . the avalanche is unstable ( the snow is sliding down the mountainside ) . when the avalanche is over the snow is stable . before the avalanche starts , the snow is metastable , since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability , but in fact was only metastability .
