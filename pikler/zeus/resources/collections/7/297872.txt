Conversion of units     the term `` conversion of units '' refers to changing an amount of a measurement unit into another unit . there are many different systems of units , so some conversions can be very complex . most conversions involve a `` conversion factor '' ( named `` m '' ) , and a shift amount ( such as `` b '' ) , to change from a unit `` x '' into a unit `` y '' by the general equation : y = mx + b. that type of conversion is known as a `` linear transform '' or a mathematical `` translation '' . a conversion factor is a ratio that lets you convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the amount . when a conversion factor is multiplied by the item you are converting , it cancels out the units you do not want and leaves those that you do . because the top and bottom of conversion factors are the same , conversion factors always equal 1. for example , a conversion factor of ( 1 day ) / ( 24 hours ) equals 1 , because 1 day = 24 hours . one of the most common conversions is to change meters ( or `` metres '' ) into feet , by multiplying the amount in meters by about 3.28 feet per meter ( ft/m ) :
