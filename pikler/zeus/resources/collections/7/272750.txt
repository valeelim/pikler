Wilderness     wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on earth which has not been much disturbed by humans . wilderness areas can be found in reserves , estates , farms , conservation areas , ranches , national forests , national parks and even in urban areas along rivers , gulches or any undeveloped areas . these areas are important for the survival of species , biodiversity , ecology , conservation , solitude , and recreation . wilderness is deeply valued for cultural , spiritual , moral , and aesthetic reasons . some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity . they may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos , gardens or laboratories . from this point of view , it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness . the mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being `` wilderness '' . many ecosystems that are , or have been , inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered `` wild . '' this way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference .
