8 track tape     the 8-track is a music format which first appeared in the 1960s . it is a tape format which was created so people could play music in their cars . unlike cassettes , 8 tracks are a continuous loop of tape . they did not need to be turned over to keep playing . there were four programs of music on each tape with two tracks on each program to create stereo sound . when the track was over , a very thin piece of metal in the tape would be sensed . this would cause the part of the player that read the tape ( the `` head '' ) to start reading the next track . 8 tracks became very popular in the early 1970s . they were used both in the home and car . in the 1970s , the cassette tape was improved . it eventually had better quality than 8-tracks . by the late 1970s , cassettes became more popular than 8-tracks . in 1980 , 8-tracks were rarely being made . they could still be bought through mail order record clubs until 1987. today there are still a small number of people who collect 8 tracks . the 8-track had many problems . unlike cassettes , the rubber roller was in the cartridge . it would often wear out . this could cause a gooey substance in the tapes . this also caused the tapes to wear out quickly . the spacing between the tracks were very narrow . music from tracks other than the one being played could often be heard . the sensing foil in the tape would sometimes break off . this would stop the tape from changing tracks .
