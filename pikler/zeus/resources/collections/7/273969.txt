Cowbird     cowbirds are birds of the genus `` molothrus '' . they are brood parasites , similar in life-style to the cuckoo . the entire family icteridae is limited to the new world . they lay their eggs in the nests of other birds . the birds whose nest is used by the cowbird is tricked into raising the young cowbirds . these birds feed on insects , including those stirred up by cattle . they lay their eggs in other birds ' nests . this means that the birds can more easily stay with the herd . the brown-headed cowbird has over 220 hosts . the other cowbird species have fewer known hosts , but all the species are generalists when it comes to choosing a host . this means that the eggs may look very different from the hosts ' eggs . it seems that brown-headed cowbirds periodically check on their eggs and young after they have deposited them . removal of the parasitic egg may trigger a retaliatory reaction termed 'mafia behaviour ' . cowbirds may penalise hosts which remove the cowbird egg : they often destroy the eggs or nestlings of those hosts .
