Chemiluminescence     chemiluminescence ( or chemoluminescence ) is a kind of luminescence . it is a process of making light from a chemical reaction . chemiluminescence in biological systems is called bioluminescence . the light made in chemiluminiscence is not directly related to heat . a simple two step example of a reaction of a , and b , that produces ; c , d , and light . c < /sub > is an excited state of c. this reaction is simpler than most chemiluminesence reactions . the excited state happens when electrons are pushed into a higher orbit by the energy of a chemical reaction . the excited state is less stable than the ground state . the electrons in the excited state fall to the ground state ( lower energy ) , emitting light . the amount of measurable light made is called `` radiant intensity '' : i ( calcium ) inside of different parts of cells like the mitochondria can make light when it reacts with a protein from jellyfish named aequorin . nitric oxide ( no ) is in cells and is a way for cells to talk to each other , this can be measured with the compound luminol .
