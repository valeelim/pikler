Goto     goto is a statement in many programming languages . it is a combination of the english words `` go '' and `` to '' . it is a way to jump to another line of code . many languages support the goto statement , and many do not . in java , goto is a reserved word , but can not be used . ( a `` reserved word '' is a word that is a `` part '' of the programming language and can not be used for other things like naming variables . ) in computer science , there is a theory called the structured program theorem . this theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with `` functions '' and `` methods '' ( smaller sub-programs ) instead of in one very big program and `` goto '' statements . the theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs . a goto statement is usually used with a `` label '' . a label is a word that identifies a place in a piece of code . a goto statement in code usually looks like this : in this example , the computer would jump to the location of `` label '' . many times the goto statement is combined with the if statement . in this case , the computer will only jump to another place in the code if something is true . for example :
