Medulla oblongata     the medulla oblongata ( or medulla ) is the lower half of the brainstem . it is just on top of the spinal cord . it connects the higher parts of the brain to the spinal cord ( see the picture at the right of this page ) . the cardiac , respiratory , and vasomotor control centers are in the medulla . this means that the medulla controls heart rate , blood pressure , breathing , and the size of the body 's blood vessels . if the medulla did not work , a person would die . the medulla does many important things . it relays nerve signals between the brain and spinal cord . signals from the brain tell the rest of the body what to do . signals from the spinal cord tell the brain what is going on in the body . without the medulla , none of these signals would get through . the medulla also controls autonomic functions ( things the body does automatically , without a person having to think about them ) . the medulla controls breathing . groups of neurons in the medulla tell the body when to breathe in , when to breathe faster , and when to breathe slower .
