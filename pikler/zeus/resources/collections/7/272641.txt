Battle of Artemisium     the naval battle of artemesium took place at the same time as the battle of thermopylae , in 480 bc . approaching artemisium towards the end of summer , the persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of magnesia and lost around a third of their ~1,200 ships . after arriving at artemisium , the persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of euboea in an attempt to trap the greeks , but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked . the main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements . the two sides fought all day , with roughly equal losses ; however the smaller allied fleet could not afford the losses . after the engagement , the allies received news of the defeat of the allied army at thermopylae . their strategy was to hold both thermopylae and artemisium . so , given their losses , the allies decided to withdraw to salamis . the persians overran boeotia and captured the now-evacuated athens . however , seeking a decisive victory over the allied fleet , the persians were later defeated at the battle of salamis in late 480
