Hydrogenation     hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to organic compounds . it is done to alkenes . vegetable oils have alkenes in them . alkenes are liquid and spoil easily . people making shortening add hydrogen to the alkene , turning it into an alkane . the alkanes are more solid and stable . a catalyst is used to react the hydrogen with the oil . this makes trans fats , though . margarine is an example of a hydrogenated spread . other things can be hydrogenated , too . hot nitrogen is reacted with hydrogen under high pressure with a catalyst , usually nickel to make ammonia gas .
