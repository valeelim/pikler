Chloroflexi     chloroflexi is one of four classes of bacteria that produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment , usually found in photosynthetic bodies . chloroflexi are typically filamentous ( they look like microscopic strings ) , and can move about through bacterial gliding . they are facultatively aerobic ( they can survive with oxygen or without it ) , but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light , or phototrophy . additionally chloroflexi have a different method of phototrophy ( photoheterotrophy ) than true photosynthetic bacteria . phylogenetic analysis ( looking at dna ) indicates that they had a separate origin .
