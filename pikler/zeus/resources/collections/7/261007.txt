Meqabyan     meqabyan ( amharic : መቃብያን ) , also called called ethiopic maccabees or ethiopian maccabees , are three books in the ethiopian orthodox old testament biblical canon . these books are very different in content from the books of maccabees in catholic and eastern orthodox bibles . the maccabees described in these books are not those of the hasmonean dynasty , and the `` five holy maccabean martyrs '' here do not match `` woman with seven sons '' , who were also called `` maccabees '' and are revered throughout orthodoxy as the `` holy maccabean martyrs '' . these books were only written in ethiopian languages for a long time , but have recently been translated into english . according to this book , a certain man from the territory of benjamin called meqabis had three sons abya ( amharic : አብያ- abijah ) , seela ( amharic : ሴላ- shelah ) , and pantos ( pantera ) , who opposed the tyrannical policies of the king and refused to worship his idols . their account consumes only a short section of the book , spanning chapters 2 through chapter 5. a second group of brothers are later introduced in chapter 15. they are called : yihuda ( amharic : ይሁዳ- judah ) , meqabis and mebikyas , and they are said to have lead a successful revolt against the ruthless king akrandis of midian . this appears to be a historical allusion to the king alexander i balas , who ruled the seleucid empire after the death of antiochius iv , and who supported the legitimacy of the maccabees cause . however , in this folk rendering of history , mebikyas enters the king 's military camp and decapitates him at his dinner table , while his food was still in his mouth . the remainder of the book , chapters 16 to 36 , have no dealing with the maccabees ( disambiguation ) revolt and offer no further historical narrative . their purpose is unknown , as they recount significant events from the old testament .
