Rock cycle     the rock cycle is the process by which rocks of one kind change into rocks of another kind . there are three main kinds of rocks : igneous rock , metamorphic rock , and sedimentary rock . each of these rocks can change into the other kinds by physical processes : cooling , melting , heat , weathering/erosion , compacting ( squeezing tightly together ) , cementing , and pressure . when heated deep under ground , rocks become magma ( liquid rock ) . above ground , it is called lava . sediment , the particles from rock erosion and weathering , is the basis for sedimentary rock of the future . igneous rock is hardened magma , which can happen above or below ground . it can melt into magma , erode into sediment , or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic . metamorphic rock is igneous or sedimentary rock that has been heated and squeezed . it can erode into sediment or melt into magma . it formed under extreme pressure and temperature deep inside mountain chains . sedimentary rock is compacted sediment which can come from any of the other rocks , plus remains of living things . it can erode back into sediment , or be pressurized into metamorphic rock .
