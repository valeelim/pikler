Der Wanderer     der wanderer is the name of a lied composed by franz schubert in october 1816 for voice and piano . the words are taken from a german poem by georg philipp schmidt von l√ºbeck . the lied is set in the key of c-sharp minor with the tempo marking `` sehr langsam '' ( very slow ) and the time signature alla breve . the piece has a total of 72 measures . schubert wrote another lied entitled `` der wanderer ; '' it is numbered d.649 . the song begins with a recitative , describing the setting : mountains , a steaming valley , the roaring sea . the wanderer is strolling quietly , unhappily , and asks , sighing , the question : `` where ? '' the next section , consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo , describes the feelings of the wanderer : he feels that he is a stranger everywhere . this 8 bar section was later used by schubert as theme for the second movement of the `` wanderer fantasy '' . next the music shifts to the key of e major , the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 6/8 . the wanderer asks : `` where are you my beloved land ? '' this place the wanderer longs for is described as green with hope , `` the land where my roses bloom , my friends stroll , my dead rise '' and , finally , `` the land which speaks my language , oh land , where are you ? '' towards the end of this section , the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song .
