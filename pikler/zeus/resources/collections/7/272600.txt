Piñata     a piñata is a type of decoration with bright colors . it is made from either clay or cardboard and is covered with papier-mâché . in puerto rico , ecuador , peru , venezuela , colombia and in some other latin american countries , piñatas are traditionally used only at children 's birthday parties . they are usually made of cardboard , colorfully decorated to match the birthday party theme and filled with candy , chocolates , small toys and confetti . colored strings ( long enough to reach the ground ) are attached to the bottom of the piñata , where a trap-door is hidden under the decoration . the piñata is then hung somewhere where everyone can see , but the strings are kept out of the reach of children . toward the end of the party , usually after the cutting of the cake , an announcement is made that the piñata will be 'broken ' and each child is given an empty party bag . all the children get together directly underneath the piñata and each child is given a string to hold . then , at the count of three , the children pull their strings all at the same time . this opens the hidden trap-door ( or 'breaks ' the piñata ) and the children receive a shower of candy and confetti while they rush to fill up their bags with the treats .
