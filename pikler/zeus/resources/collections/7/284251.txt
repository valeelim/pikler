Hoopoe     the hoopoe ( upupa epops ) , is a colourful bird that is found across afro-eurasia , notable for its distinctive 'crown ' of feathers . it is the only living species in the family upupidae . one insular species , the giant hoopoe of saint helena , is recently extinct , and the madagascar subspecies of the hoopoe is sometimes elevated to a full species . the english name is derived from latin `` upupa '' , which imitates the cry of the bird . the hoopoe is classified in the coraciiformes clade , a group that also includes kingfishers , bee-eaters , rollers , and woodhoopoes ( forming a clade with this one according to hackett `` et al . '' ( 2008 ) ) . a close relationship between the hoopoe and the woodhoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes . nine subspecies of hoopoe are recognised by the kristin 2001 ( in the `` handbook of the birds of the world '' ) . these subspecies vary mostly in size and the depth of colour in the plumage . two more subspecies have been proposed , `` u. e. minor '' in south africa and `` u. e. orientalis '' in north western india .
