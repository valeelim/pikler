Octopus's Garden    octopus 's garden `` octopus 's garden '' is a song by the beatles written by ringo starr from their 1969 album `` abbey road '' . george harrison worked on this the song with ringo starr ; perhaps because his own songs were not seen as good enough by john lennon and paul mccartney . harrison said : `` 'octopus 's garden ' is ringo 's song . it 's only the second song ringo has ever written , mind you , and it 's lovely . '' he added that the song gets very deep into your mind `` because it 's so peaceful . i suppose ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it . '' ringo starr got the idea for the song when he was on a boat owned by comedian peter sellers in sardinia in 1968. he ordered fish and chips for lunch , but instead of fish he got squid . it was the first time he 'd eaten squid , and he said , `` it was ok. a bit rubbery . tasted like chicken . '' the boat 's captain told ringo how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects to build gardens . the `` let it be '' movie had a scene where george harrison is shown helping ringo starr work the song out on piano .
