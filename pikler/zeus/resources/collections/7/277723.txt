Unconformity     an unconformity is a gap in the sequence of rocks in a geologic column . it is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages . it shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time , usually because the land was above sea level at that time . usually , the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger . however , the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary record . many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity . james hutton found examples of unconformity in scotland , at jedburgh in 1787 and at siccar point in 1788. the rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath ( unless the sequence has been overturned ) . an unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region . the local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area . the interval of geologic time not represented is called a `` hiatus '' ( = 'gap ' ) .
