Colony collapse disorder     colony collapse disorder ( ccd ) is an occurrence where worker bees from a beehive abruptly disappear . the exact cause of colony collapse disorder is unknown . however , chemicals , parasites , and `` varroa '' mites have been proposed as factors contributing to colony collapse disorder . early in 2013 , the european food safety authority issued a declaration that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honeybees , and the european commission ( ec ) proposed a two-year ban on them . david goulson , who led one of the key 2012 studies at the university of stirling said that the decision `` begs the question of what was going on when these chemicals were first approved . '' the chemical manufacturer bayer said it was `` ready to work with '' the ec and member states .
