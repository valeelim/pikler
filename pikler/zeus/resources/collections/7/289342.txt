Royal Victorian Order     the royal victorian order is a british honour . it is given by the queen , to people who have served her , or the monarchy personally . like the orders of the garter and thistle , the prime minister does not have a say on who should get the honour . the order was created in april 1896 , by queen victoria , as a way of rewarding personal service to her . today , people receive their award either privately from the queen or another member of the royal family , or during an investiture . often , and on a state visit , the queen will invest people in the country visited before returning to the united kingdom . the british ambassador and others who have helped the visit may be rewarded , as can foreigners , and it is often awarded by the sovereign during official tours overseas . the first foreigners to get the order were the prefect of alpes maritimes and the mayor of nice , during queen victoria 's visit to the south of france , in 1896. the chapel of the order is the queen 's chapel of the savoy , a 'royal peculiar ' , which for historic reasons is in the private possession of the sovereign , in his or her right as the duke of lancaster .
