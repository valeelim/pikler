Jersey (clothing)    jersey ( clothing ) in sport a jersey is a shirt worn by a member of a team , often with the wearer 's name and team number as well . many cycling jerseys of specific colour or pattern represent certain statuses in cycling , such as the `` maillot jaune '' ( yellow jersey ) of the leader of the tour de france , or the rainbow jersey . the world cycling union also says a champion must wear the champions jersey in a race , not the team jersey . cycling jerseys are usually made of special synthetic material to help sweat away from the skin . the main garment of an ice hockey uniform , which was traditionally called a sweater , is increasingly known as a hockey jersey . this garment , along with basketball jerseys which are usually sleeveless and baseball jerseys which are usually button up , have become fashion accessories . in some sports , such as baseball , basketball , and american football , a player 's jersey may be `` retired '' . when a jersey is retired that player 's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honour of that player 's accomplishment . the retiring of a jersey at one time included the retiring of the number on the player 's jersey leaving it unavailable for future players , to further honour that player . however , as jerseys are usually double digit ( 00-99 ) , that leaves only 100 possible numbersâ€”if the rules of the sport allow it . for example , in u.s. college basketball , only 36 distinct numbers are possible , as rules prohibit the use of any digits greater than 5. as such the practice of retiring the number has dwindled , and in most cases only the specific jersey is retired and put on display .
