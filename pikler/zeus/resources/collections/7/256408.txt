Building model     a building model is either a physical ( real ) or virtual ( computer ) model of a building . very often , the physical model is smaller than the original ( scale model ) . there are three basic types of building models : architectural , structural and mathematical ( virtual ) . an architectural model is a type of a physical model of a structure to study an architectural design or to share design ideas to clients , committees , and the general public . architectural models are a tool which may be used for show , presentation , fundraising , getting permits , and sale purposes . such models are a good tool for three-dimensional understanding of a design , used by architects , interior designers and exhibit designers . engineers who need scale models to test the likely performance of a design at an early stage of development without paying for a full-sized prototype . virtual model is a digital model of the object ( typically greatly simplified ) that can be used in a computer simulation or virtual reality .
