Dictyoptera     dictyoptera includes two orders of insects â€“ cockroackes and temites ( blattodea ) , and mantids ( mantodea ) . while all modern dictyoptera have short ovipositors , the oldest fossils of dictyoptera have long ovipositors , much like members of the orthoptera . the term dictyoptera is usually considered a superorder , with isoptera , blattaria and mantodea being its three orders . in some classifications , however , dictyoptera is shifted to order status . regardless , in all classifications the three constituent groups are the same , just treated at different rank . termites and cockroaches are very closely related , with ecological and molecular data pointing to a relationship with the cockroach genus `` cryptocercus '' . based on genetic evidence , the closest living relatives of the dictyoptera are the phasmids . if the dictyoptera are a superorder they might be included in it .
