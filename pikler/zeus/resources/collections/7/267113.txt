Fuji Speedway     fuji speedway corporation was established in 1963 , as japan nascar corporation . at first , the circuit was planned to hold nascar-style races in japan . the track was designed to be a high-banked superspeedway . there was not enough money to complete the project and only one of the banked turns was ever designed . mitsubishi estate co. ( a part of mitsubishi ) invested in the circuit . they took over the management rights on october 1965. the track was converted to a road course . fuji speedway opened in december 1965. the banked turn was somewhat dangerous , and caused several major accidents . according to vic elford `` the reason that banking was so horrific , was that at the end of the straight we went over a blind crest at around 190/200 mph and `` dropped into '' the banking . at other tracks ( daytona , monthlery , etc . ) you climb up the banking . '' a new part of track was built to fix the problem . the new course was more successful . in 1966 , the track hosted a usac indy car non-championship race , won by jackie stewart . the speedway brought the first formula one race to japan at the end of the season . mario andretti won the race , and james hunt earned enough points to win the world championship title .
