Horizontal gene transfer     horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) ( or `` lateral gene transfer '' ) is any process in which an organism gets genetic material from another organism without being the offspring of that organism . by contrast , `` vertical transfer '' occurs when an organism gets genetic material from its ancestor , e.g. , its parent or a species from which it has evolved . most thinking in genetics has focused on vertical transfer , but there is a growing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a significant phenomenon . amongst single-celled organisms it may be the dominant form of genetic transfer . artificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering . there are several mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer : - transformation , the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the introduction , uptake and expression of foreign genetic material ( dna or rna ) . this process is relatively common in bacteria , but less so in eukaryotes . transformation is often used in laboratories to insert novel genes into bacteria for experiments or for industrial or medical applications .
