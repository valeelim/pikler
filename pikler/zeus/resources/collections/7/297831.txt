First-past-the-post voting     first-past-the-post is a voting system used by some countries to elect their governments or the members of their parliaments . in a first-past-the-post system , a country is divided into constituencies , and in these constituencies people known as candidates , who each represent a different political party will stand for election to the country 's parliament . in the individual constituencies , the candidate who gets the most votes from people , wins the race to be elected to a seat in parliament . if a party wins over 50 % of the seats , it can form a majority government . if no single party wins over 50 % of the seats , then either the party with the most seats can form a minority government , or a coalition government can be formed from two or more of the other political parties who together have over 50 % of the seats . countries using first-past-the-post include the united kingdom , canada , india and partly in the united states . in a first-past-the-post system , candidate a wins because that candidate received more votes than anyone else .
