Parmigiana     parmigiana is a southern italian dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling , with cheese and tomato sauce on top , then baked . eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version . other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets , such as veal and chicken parmigiana , are popular in other countries , usually in areas with a lot of italian immigrants . the dish is claimed by both campania and sicily . while `` parmigiana '' means `` from parma '' ( in northern italy ) , the dish is not part of parma food . it is based on melanzane alla parmigiana ( alt . parmigiana di melanzane ) or eggplant parmigiana ( or eggplant parmesan ) , a classic southern italian dish . along with the many italian versions , different kinds of parmigiana have been developed across the world , most often in countries where large numbers of italians immigrated . examples of dishes developed outside of italy from the early parmigianas include veal ( veal parmigiana ) or chicken breast ( chicken parmigiana ) dipped in beaten eggs , breaded , shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce ( red sicilian tomato sauce ) and mozzarella . it is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown . the veal dish is known in italian as `` cotolette alla bolognese '' .
