Roman Kingdom     the roman kingdom ( ) was the monarchical government of the city of rome and its territories . no written records from that time survive . the histories about it were written during the republic and empire and are largely based on legend . therefore , not much is certain about the history of the roman kingdom . however , the history of the roman kingdom began with the city 's founding , traditionally dated to 753 bc , and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the republic in about 509 bc . what eventually became the roman empire began as settlements around the palatine hill along the river tiber in central italy . the river was navigable up to that place . the site also had a ford where the tiber could be crossed . the palatine hill and hills surrounding it presented easily defensible positions in the wide fertile plain surrounding them . all these features contributed to the success of the city . the traditional account of roman history is that in rome 's first centuries , it was ruled by a succession of seven kings . the traditional chronology is discounted by modern scholarship . the gauls destroyed all of rome 's historical records when they sacked the city after the battle of the allia in 390 bc or 387/6 , so no contemporary records of the kingdom exist . all accounts of the kings must be questioned .
