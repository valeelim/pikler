Circuito de Jerez     circuito de jerez is a spanish race track near jerez de la frontiera . it opened on december 8 , 1985 , and started holding motorcycling events and the spanish grand prix in formula one . the race was held in jerez until 1990 , since the circuit was in a remote ( rural ) area , and the spanish grand prix was moved to circuit de catalunya in 1991. however , in 1994 , when the autódromo juan y oscar gálvez was not finished for it 's grand prix , known as the argentine grand prix , jerez hosted the european grand prix that year . as well , a chicane was added in turn 11 to slow down the cars and to avoid possibly fatal ( deadly ) accidents , such as the one suffered by roland ratzenberger at the 1994 san marino grand prix . the european grand prix returned in 1997 , this time being the final race of the season , and the championship was going to be decided between michael schumacher and jacques villeneuve . however , during the podium celebrations , jerez 's mayor pedro pacheco disrupted the podium celebrations by presenting a trophy that was supposed to be presented by a dignitary from daimler-benz , which was related to mercedes , an engine supplier who won the race . this incident resulted on the track being temporarily banned from hosting a grand prix . it has never hosted another grand prix , but still holds winter testing during the pre-season , and still remains very popular .
