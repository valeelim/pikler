Unfinished building     an unfinished building is a building that was being built , but was either abandoned or is on hold . there are many different reasons why buildings have not been completed . the national monument in scotland was planned to be a war memorial for soldiers killed in the napoleonic wars . building started in 1826 , but the money ran out in 1829. the sagrada família , a church in barcelona , spain , was started in 1882 and is still not finished . it is not finished because when the architect , antoni gaudi , died in 1926 , and he did not leave many plans for the building . what was left was destroyed during the spanish civil war . the war also meant that there was not enough money to complete the project . some examples . - duomo di siena , sienna , italy - goodwood house , west sussex , england - herrenchiemsee , bavaria , germany - szkieletor , kraków , poland - woodchester mansion , stroud , gloucester , england - parliament house , wellington , new zealand - bishop castle , colorado , usa - super power building , clearwater , florida , usa
