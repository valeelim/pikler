Macaw     a macaw is a new world parrot . some of the species are large birds , the largest of the parrots . macaws are native to mexico , central america , south america , and formerly the caribbean . macaws , like all parrots , are unusually intelligent birds . the usual thing for parrots is to pair for life . they stay together even out of the mating season . they often fly in formation , one above the other . macaws eat a variety of foods including seeds , nuts , fruits , palm fruits , leaves , flowers , and stems . wild species may forage widely , over for some of the larger species such as `` ara araurana '' ( blue & yellow macaw ) and `` ara ambigua '' ( great green macaw ) , in search of seasonally available foods . in the western amazon , hundreds of macaws and other parrots descend to exposed river banks to lick clay almost daily , except on rainy days . it was suggested that parrots and macaws in the amazon basin eat clay from exposed river banks to neutralize toxins . the clay eating behavior of parrots was studied at clay licks in peru . apparently , macaws and other birds and animals prefer clays with higher levels of salt . sodium is a vital element which is scarce in environments over 100 kilometers from the ocean .
