Polymorphism     polymorphism in biology is when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species . the words `` forms '' or `` morphs '' are sometimes used . polymorphism is common in nature . the most common example is sexual dimorphism , which occurs in many organisms . another example is sickle-cell anaemia . in order to be classified as such , morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a population with random mating . the mechanism which decides which of several morphs an individual displays is called the `` switch '' . this switch may be genetic , or it may be environmental . taking sex determination as the example , in man the determination is genetic , by the xy sex determination system . in hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) , sex determination is by haplo-diploidy : the females are all diploid , the males are haploid . however , in some animals an environmental trigger determines the sex : alligators are a famous case in point . in ants the distinction between workers and guards is environmental , by the feeding of the grubs . polymorphism with an environmental trigger is called polyphenism .
