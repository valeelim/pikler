Millennium Bridge     the millennium bridge is a footbridge across the river thames in london . it is a steel suspension bridge which links bankside with the city . its position is between southwark bridge ( downstream ) and blackfriars railway bridge ( upstream ) . the bridge opened on 10 june 2000. it is the newest bridge across the thames . londoners nicknamed the bridge the wobbly bridge after people on a charity walk felt an uncomfortable swaying motion . the bridge was closed later that day . after two days of limited access the bridge was closed for almost two years . expensive and complicated changes were made to eliminate the wobble . it was reopened in 2002. the southern end of the bridge is near globe theatre , the bankside gallery and tate modern , the north end next to the city of london school below st paul 's cathedral . the bridge alignment is such that a clear view of st paul 's south facade is presented from across the river , framed by the bridge supports . the design of the bridge was the subject of a competition organized in 1996 by southwark council . the winning entry was by arup , foster and partners and sir anthony caro . the eight suspension cables are tensioned to pull with a force of 2,000 tons against the piers set into each bank â€” enough to support a working load of up to 5,000 people on the bridge at one time .
