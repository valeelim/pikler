Gorgoneion     in ancient greece , the gorgoneion ( greek : γοργόνειον ) was originally a magic pendant showing the gorgon 's head . ( the use of magic against evil , or bad luck is generally called apotropaism ) . the gorgoneion was linked with the gods zeus and athena ; both are said to have worn it as a pendant . it was also popular as a royal symbol , worn on shields and capes . these can be seen on the alexander mosaic and the gonzaga cameo . homer wrote about the gorgon on four occasions , but only about the head , as if the creature had no body . jane ellen harrison notes that `` medusa is a head and nothing more ... a mask . '' the body was added many years later . up to the 5th century bc , the head was shown as being very ugly , with her tongue sticking out , boar tusks , puffy cheeks , her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her . the direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient greek art . in some cases a beard , ( probably representing streaks of blood ) was added to her chin , making her appear as a wild and sexual god , like dionysus .
