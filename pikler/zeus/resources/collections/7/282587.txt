Bacterial conjugation     bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells . conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer , as are transformation and transduction , though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact . bacterial conjugation was discovered by nobel prize winners joshua lederberg and edward tatum . they showed that the bacterium `` escherichia coli '' entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information . bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction , since it involves the exchange of genetic material . during conjugation the `` donor '' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon . most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the `` recipient '' cell does not already contain a similar element . the genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient . benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites . such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts . other elements , however , may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread .
