Archimedes' principle    archimedes ' principle archimedes ' principle is named after archimedes of syracuse , the first to discover this law . when he did , he ran naked out of his bathtub . archimedes ' principle relates buoyancy to displacement . archimedes ' treatise , `` on floating bodies '' , proposition five states : for more general objects , floating and sunken , and in gases as well as liquids ( i.e . a fluid ) , archimedes ' principle may be stated thus in terms of forces : for a sunken object , the volume of displaced fluid is the volume of the object , and for a floating object on a liquid , the weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object . briefly : buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid . to use the principle to tell the difference between gold and another substance , the concept of mass ( in practice , weight ) must be added . apply this formula to a suitably pure piece of gold : that gives you the density of the gold sample . the only unknown is the `` density of the ( gold ) object '' ; the density of water is 1. repeat for the experimental object ( non-gold ) , when you get a different ( and usually lesser ) density .
