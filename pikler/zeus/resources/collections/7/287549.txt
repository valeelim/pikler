Network topology     network topology is the layout of the connections ( links , nodes , etc . ) of a computer network . there are two main types of topology . network topologies may be physical or logical . physical topology means the physical design of a network including the devices , locations and cables . logical topology is about how data is actually moved around in a network , not its physical design . the names used - such as ring or star - are only rough descriptions . the computers on a home network can be arranged in a circle but it does not necessarily mean that it represents a ring network . there are seven basic topologies : - point-to-point topology - bus ( point ) topology - star topology - ring topology - tree topology - full/partial mesh topology - hybrid topology which of these is chosen depends on what devices need to be connected , how reliable it has to be , and the cost associated with cabling . the shape of the cabling layout used to link devices is called the physical topology of the network . this refers to how the cables are laid out to connect many computers to one network . the physical topology you choose for your network depends on :
