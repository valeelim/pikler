Richard Owen     sir richard owen kcb ( lancaster , 20 july 1804–18 december 1892 ) was an english biologist , comparative anatomist and palaeontologist . owen is probably best remembered today for coining the word `` dinosauria '' ( meaning 'terrible reptile ' ) , and for his outspoken opposition to charles darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection . owen was the driving force behind the establishment , in 1881 , of the british museum ( natural history ) in london . owen 's technical descriptions of vertebrates were important . his `` comparative anatomy and physiology of vertebrates '' ( 3 vols . london 1866–1868 ) was a standard reference work for many years . his career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it under his own name . owen credited himself and georges cuvier with the discovery of the `` iguanodon '' , completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur , gideon mantell . this was not the first or last time owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own , when in fact it was not . owen was finally dismissed from the royal society 's zoological council for plagiarism .
