American Civil Liberties Union     the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) is a group of two non-profit organizations that fight for what they believe are important civil liberties issues . it was started in 1920 by crystal eastman , roger nash baldwin , and walter nelles . some issues that are important to the aclu are the first amendment to the united states constitution ( which says that people have free speech and freedom of religion , as well as other rights ) , privacy , the right of people to be treated fairly if they are accused of a crime and arrested , and the right for everybody to be treated the same under the law . one way the aclu tries to reach its goals is by helping people in court whom it believes are not being treated fairly by the law . the aclu has lawyers that file lawsuits for people it represents . the aclu also tries to change laws by teaching people about issues and by lobbying the government about what it believes . some people in the united states disagree with the aclu . some conservatives do not like that the aclu believes that people have the right to an abortion and that it believes in the separation of church and state . also , some of the people or groups that the aclu has represented in court have been unpopular , such as the westboro baptist church , which is famous for protesting the funerals of american soldiers who died at war .
