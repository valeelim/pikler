Tiger salamander     the tiger salamander is species of mole salamander . another name for this salamander is the eastern tiger salamander . eastern tiger salamanders are big , with a normal length of 6–8 inches ( 15–20 cm ) . they can grow up to 14 inches ( 36 cm ) in length . grown-ups are usually spotted with grey , green , or black , and have large eyes . they have short mouths , big necks , strong legs , and long tails . they eat small insects and worms . sometimes , grown ups eat small frogs and baby mice adults are almost never seen in open fields and often live in holes that are usually 2 feet from the top . tiger salamanders almost always stay on land as adults , and usually only return to the water to lay eggs . but also they live in both land and water . they also like to swim , even if they are on land . they also are good swimmers . like all ambystomatids , they are extremely loyal to their birthplace , and will travel long distances to go back . however , a single tiger salamander has only a 50 % chance of laying eggs more than once in its lifetime . males bump a female to initiate mating , and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom . the female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation . large-scale captive breeding of tiger salamanders has not been accomplished , for unknown reasons .
