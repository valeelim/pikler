Oxpecker     the oxpeckers are the two species of bird which make up the family buphagidae . oxpeckers are endemic to the savanna of sub-saharan africa . their names come from their habit of perching on large mammals ( both wild and domesticated ) such as cattle or rhinoceroses , and eating ticks , botfly larvae , and other parasites . according to the more recent studies of phylogeny , the oxpeckers are an ancient line related to the mimidae ( mockingbirds , thrashers & c. ) and starlings , but not particularly close to either . considering the known biogeography ( distribution ) of these groups , the most plausible explanation seems that the oxpecker lineage originated in eastern or southeastern asia like the other two . this would make the two species of `` buphagus '' something like living fossils . oxpeckers feed exclusively on the backs of large mammals . certain species seem preferred , whereas others , like the lichtenstein 's hartebeest or topi are generally avoided . the smallest regularly used species is the impala , probably because of the heavy tick load and social nature of that species . in many parts of their range they now feed on cattle , but avoid camels . they feed on ectoparasites , particularly ticks , as well as insects infecting wounds and the flesh and blood of some wounds as well .
