Nicola Pisano     nicola pisano ( also called niccolò pisano and nicola de apulia ) ( c. 1220/1225 – c. 1284 ) was an italian sculptor who is best known for the works that he made for pisa cathedral . at a time when most artists worked in the gothic style , nicola was influenced by the ancient roman sculpture that he saw at pisa , and copied the style into his own work . for this reason nicola pisano is sometimes said to be to be the founder of modern sculpture . nicola pisano 's birthdate and exact birthplace are unknown . a document in the archives of siena cathedral says that he was the son of petrus de apulia . in 1245 nicola was making sculptures at prato cathedral and then moved to pisa where his son giovanni pisano was born . around 1255 , nicola received a commission ( a paid job ) to make the pulpit in the baptistery of pisa cathedral . the baptistery was a very large circular domed building that stood near the west doors of the cathedral . nicola was assisted ( helped ) by other sculptors including arnolfo di cambio who later became a famous architect . the work was finished in 1260 and signed `` nicola pisanus '' which means `` nicholas of pisa '' .
