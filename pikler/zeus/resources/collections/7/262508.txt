William Langland     william langland ( ca . 1332 â€“ ca . 1386 ) was an english poet . he wrote a long and complicated poem called piers plowman . the poem is an allegory about the struggle to lead a virtuous christian life when the institution of the church is often corrupt . we do not know for sure that this poem was written by langland . the strongest evidence we have is one manuscript which says that the poem was written by 'willielmi de langlond ' , son of 'stacy de rokayle , who died in shipton-under-wichwood , a tenant of the lord spenser in the county of oxfordshire ' . other manuscripts also name the author as 'robert or william langland ' , or 'wilhelmus w. ' ( probably an abbreviation for 'william of wichwood ' , since wychwood is the village he probably came from ) . another piece of evidence is within the poem itself . at one stage the narrator says : 'i have lyved in londe ... my name is longe wille ' . scholars agree that this is a code for the poet 's name : longe-land , and wille meaning will , short for william . this may seem unlikely , but this method of hiding the poet 's name within a poem was used in roman times , and was quite common in late-medieval literature .
