Absorption spectroscopy     absorption spectroscopy is a technique used to find out what makes up a sample of a substance â€“ in other words , a chemical analysis . when a full spectrum of light ( light with all the colours , like light from the sun ) passes through the sample ( which is often a gas ) some specific colours do not show up on the other side . these colours of light are being absorbed by the sample . an image is created of the spectrum of light with black breaks where the light has been absorbed . these breaks are called absorption lines , and every element has its characteristic pattern of absorption lines . on an atomic scale , this happens because of the electrons in the atoms of the sample - an electron can absorb light to gain energy . from experiments , electrons only ever absorb certain amounts of energy , suggesting an electron 's energy must fit onto set , quantised , discrete `` energy levels '' . the process of an electron going to a higher energy level is called `` excitation '' . for any atom of a particular element , the energy needed to excite an electron from one specific energy level to another will be the same . this is important because it allows us to compare the absorption lines of say , the atmosphere of a far away planet , to the absorption lines of elements we know to exist in a lab . we can then reach a conclusion about what the distant planet 's atmosphere may be made of .
