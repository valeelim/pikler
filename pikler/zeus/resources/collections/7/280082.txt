Cold seep     a cold seep ( sometimes called a cold vent ) is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide , methane and other hydrocarbon-rich liquids leak out of the earth 's crust , often in the form of a brine pool . cold seeps form a biome supporting several native species . cold seeps change the shape of the ocean floor over time , where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs . these reactions may change when bacteria are present . cold seeps at different depths have different names . other kinds of cold seeps are : - oil/gas seeps - gas seeps : methane seeps - gas hydrate seeps - brine seeps are forming brine pools - pockmarks - mud volcanos cold seeps occur over cracks in the seafloor caused by the movement of the earth 's crust . oil and methane `` seep '' out of those cracks , get dissolved by tiny bits of rock , and emerge over an area several hundred meters wide . methane ( ) is the main part of what we commonly refer to as natural gas . but in addition to being an important energy source for humans , methane also forms the basis of a cold seep ecosystem .
