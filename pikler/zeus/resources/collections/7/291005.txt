Screen Actors Guild     the screen actors guild ( sag ) is an american labor union representing over 200,000 film and television principal performers and background performers worldwide . according to sag 's mission statement , the guild was created to negotiate and enforce reasonable salaries , benefits , and working conditions for its performers ; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members , and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances ; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members . the guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to end exploitation of actors in hollywood who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios that did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods , and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios ' discretion . these contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them , and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal .
