Selenic acid     selenic acid is a chemical compound . it is an acid . its chemical formul is hseo . it is normally a colorless solution in water . it is a strong oxidizing agent . it can turn into selenium trioxide when dehydrated carefully . it is a very strong acid . it reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine and selenous acid . it can dissolve gold to make gold selenate . when heated above 200Â°c , it releases oxygen and turns into selenous acid . it reacts with bases to make selenates . selenic acid is made by oxidation of selenium dioxide with hydrogen peroxide . it is hard to evaporate it , but when it is evaporated , it makes colorless crystals . it can be made by oxidation of selenous acid with a strong oxidizing agent , such as potassium permanganate , chlorine , or bromine . the hcl and hbr made as a byproduct can reduce the selenic acic to selenous acid again , though , so it has to be taken out . it can also be made by reacting selenium with chlorine in water . related pages . - hydrogen selenide
