Knut (polar bear)    knut ( polar bear ) knut ( 5 december 2006– 19 march 2011 ) was a polar bear who was born in captivity at the berlin zoo . because his mother rejected him when he was born , he was raised by zookeepers . people began to protest for him after a german newspaper called `` bild-zeitung '' quoted an animal rights activist saying the young cub had to die . both children and adults supported him , and e-mails and letters asking the zoo to let the cub live were sent from around the world . because of his fame , knut became a tourist attraction and commercial success . knut became very popular and the center of mass media attention called `` knutmania '' . many toys , dvds , and books were made about him . this brought in lots of money , about five million euros , to berlin zoo in 2007. more people went to the zoo , and that year was the most profitable year in its 163-year history . knut was born at berlin zoo . his mother was tosca , a 20-year-old polar bear . she was a circus performer from east germany , born in canada , and her 13-year-old mate , lars , was from a park in munich . tosca gave birth to knut and his unnamed brother on 5 december 2006. however , she left her cubs on a rock in the polar bear enclosure and did not take care of them . the zookeepers rescued the cubs with a fishing net , but knut 's brother died from sickness four days later . knut was only the size of a guinea pig , and had to spend the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper thomas dörflein began raising the cub .
