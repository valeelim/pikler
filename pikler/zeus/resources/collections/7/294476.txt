A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery     a philosopher lecturing on the orrery is an 18-th century oil painting by joseph wright of derby . the painting shows a teacher talking about the sun and planets to his class . wright later created his similar `` an experiment on a bird in the air pump '' ( national gallery , london ) in 1768. wright 's `` the orrery '' , caused a great debate , because in the past , only religious events were used to express awe . wright used science to do so . wright lived in the technological age , so he treated religious events and scientific miracles . in the orrery demonstration , the shadows created by the lamp mimic the sun , and it is a part of the display . he used a single candle to make his painting dramatic . in two later paintings , the lighting is normal . one person called wright `` a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way '' . `` the orrery '' was painted without payment . wright expected that washington shirley , 5th earl ferrers , an amateur astronomer , will buy the painting , because shirley had his own orrery , and wright 's friend peter perez burdett was staying with him . figures are considered to be portraits of burdett and ferrers . in the picture , burdett is taking notes and ferrers is seated with his son next to the orrery . ferrers purchased the painting for Â£210 , but the 6th earl sold it at an auction . it is now held by derby museum and art gallery as its permanent display .
