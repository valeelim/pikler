Global Hunger Index     the global hunger index is a measurement to measure the hunger situation in a country . it is a statistical tool . there are three numbers which are used to calculate the ghi . each number has the same importance : 1. the number of people who can not get their needed energy intake each day , out of the total poulation of the area . this is a percentage . 1. the number of children , under the age of 5 , which are underweight ; again taken against the total number of children of that age group . 1. the child mortality rate . to get the world hunger index , the weighted average of the three numbers is taken . this number will be between 0 and 100. higher numbers are worse . the numbers can be interpreted as follows : - values below 5 : there is little concern for a hunger situation - 5-9.9 : there is a moderate concern for a hunger situation - 10-19.9 : `` serious hunger situation '' - 20-29.9 : '' alarming hunger situation '' - 30 or above : extremely alarming hunger situation today , the highest values can be found in africa south of the sahara , and in south asia , with values of 22.1 , and 23.0. even though the numbers may be similar , the source of the problem is different . in sub-saharan africa the main problem is high child mortality rates , and a large number of people who can not meet their energy requirements . in south asia , the main problem is the high number of malnurished children under the age of five . this may also be a consequence of the fact that women have a poorer education , and baby girls are not fed as well as baby boys .
