Dirge     a dirge is a sad song or poem of unhappiness . they are usually sung at funerals . for example , a dirge was sung for the soldiers that had died in the battle of gettysburg before abraham lincoln delivered his gettysburg address . the word `` dirge '' came from the latin word `` dirige '' , which means `` direct '' . it is likely that `` dirge '' also came from the old expression `` dirige , domine , deus meus , in conspectu tuo viam meam '' ( `` direct my way in your sight , o lord my god '' ) . `` dirge '' , meaning `` to direct '' , is the same as a `` dirigible '' ( `` steerable '' ) airship . these two words became connected in 1937 because of the hindenburg disaster .
