Army ant     army ant ( or legionary ant or `` marabunta '' ) means over 200 ant species . they are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food , known as `` raids '' , in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place , attacking other animals `` en masse '' . most ant species make homes where they always live . army ants do not . they keep moving . all army ant species are members of the ant family , formicidae , but there are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior . this is called `` legionary behavior '' , and is convergent evolution . before , `` army ant '' meant ants from 5 different ant subfamilies : in two of these subfamilies , the ponerinae and myrmicinae , it is only a few species that show legionary behavior ; in the other three subfamilies , ecitoninae , dorylinae , and leptanillinae , `` all '' of the species are legionary . now , another subfamily leptanilloidinae , is called army ants . a 2003 study of thirty species ( by sean brady of cornell university ) shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid-cretaceous period in gondwana , and so the two subfamilies are now one called ecitoninae , but not everyone says this .
