Freon     freon is a word for chemical refrigerants . thomas midgley , jr. invented using freon as a refrigerant . `` freon '' is a registered trademark of dupont . freon was first used to describe chlorofluorocarbon ( cfc ) refrigerants , but it is now used to describe almost any kind of refrigerant . refrigerants may contain carbon , chlorine , fluorine and sometimes bromine . for example , freon 10 is carbon tetrachloride . many kinds of freon are not toxic to animals . they also are cheap and work well . however , most refrigerants can reduce the amount of ozone from the upper atmosphere . reducing ozone lets more ultraviolet light to come through . too much ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer and cataracts , and can kill off plankton in the oceans . the chlorine part of cfc refrigerants can reduce ozone . hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( hcfcs ) can also damage ozone . newer hydrofulorocarbon ( hfc ) refrigerants do not have chlorine in them and do not reduce ozone in the atmosphere . most refrigerants also increase global warming because they are powerful greenhouse gasses . these refrigerants increase global warming thousands of times more than carbon dioxide ( co ) .
