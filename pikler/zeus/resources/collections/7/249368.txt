Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts     many east asian scripts are written both horizontally and vertically . documents around the world have many different ways of writing . but there are mainly two ways of writing : writing horizontally ( 횡서 , 橫書 ) or vertically ( 종서縱書 ) . there are two kinds of horizontal writing . one kind can be read from left to right ( 좌횡서 , 左橫書 ) ; the other is read from right to left ( 우횡서 , 右橫書 ) . there are two kinds of vertical writing as well : from left to right ( 좌정서 , 左縱書 ) or from right to left ( 우정서 , 右縱書 ) . traditionally , the countries in the sinosphere ( such as korea , china , japan or vietnam ) write vertically from right to left . when it was necessary to write horizontally , they wrote horizontally from right to left . when the western culture began influencing them , they began writing horizontally from left to right , which is now used widely . today , letters that can be written both horizontally and vertically are not common . most western languages are written horizontally from left to right , but arabian and hebrew are written horizontally from right to left . mongol letters are written horizontally from left to right .
