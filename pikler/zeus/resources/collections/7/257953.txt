Potassium hydroxide     potassium hydroxide is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is koh . it contains potassium and hydroxide ions . it is a white powder . it dissolves easily in water to make a basic solution . it is corrosive to skin . it reacts with acids to give potassium salts . it is less common than sodium hydroxide . about 700,000 tons are made each year . it is hygroscopic , meaning that it absorbs water from the air and forms a solution . it is very hard to get the water out again . it releases heat when it is dissolved in water , similar to sodium hydroxide . it gradually reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form potassium carbonate . it melts easily . it feels greasy when it gets on the skin because it makes soap from the fat in your skin . it is made when potassium reacts with water . it is made by electrolysis of a potassium chloride solution . it can also be made by reacting calcium hydroxide with potassium carbonate . the calcium carbonate precipitates and is filtered , leaving potassium hydroxide .
