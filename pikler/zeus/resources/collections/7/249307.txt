Object (grammar)    object ( grammar ) an object in grammar is the target of an action , and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb . it is an element in the clause which follows the verb , as in : these are direct objects . the following are indirect objects : the structure of these sentences is ( s/v/o/o ) where s = subject , v = verb and o = object . the first object is an `` indirect object '' , the second is a `` direct object '' . notice that , in the last example , you sent a letter , not your son . the sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object . an equivalent sentence to the last example is : here some grammarians also see `` son '' as the indirect object ( `` letter '' is the term which can not be left out ) .
