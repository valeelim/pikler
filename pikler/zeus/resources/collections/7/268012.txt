Dinosaur brains and intelligence     dinosaur brains and intelligence are interesting topics . dinosaurs were once regarded as stupid animals , but it is now realised that some of the smaller carnivores had above average intelligence for reptiles . this idea led to exaggerated portrayals in films like jurassic park . the idea that `` stegosaurus '' had a `` brain the size of a walnut '' ( an oft-repeated phrase ) , was not quite accurate . it had a brain the size of a dog 's , but in proportion to its body , the brain was very small . in the 1880s a well-preserved `` stegosaurus '' braincase allowed othniel charles marsh to get a cast of the brain cavity , which gave an idea of the brain size . the endocast showed that the brain was indeed small : relative to body size , maybe the smallest among the dinosaurs . the fact that an animal weighing over 4.5 metric tonnes ( 5 short tons ) could have a brain of no more than 80 grams ( 2.8 oz ) led to the idea that dinosaurs were unintelligent , an idea now largely rejected . marsh also noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord , which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the famously small brain . this may have been used to coordinate the hind region in defence against theropod attack . this function for the `` second brain '' is not proved by any direct evidence .
