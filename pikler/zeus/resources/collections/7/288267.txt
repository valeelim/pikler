Modern English Bible translations     there are many translations of the bible in english . people do n't agree about what is the `` original bible '' . because there are many versions of greek and latin bibles , there are also many versions of the english bible . some translations are word-for-word from the original language . these translations are usually difficult to read . other translations are idea-for-idea . these translations change the ideas of the original bible into english . some idea-for-idea translations use very easy english . literal translations are difficult for some people to understand . but , non-literal translations can change the meaning . `` dynamic equivalence '' means making the bible easy to read , without changing the meaning . most english bible translations are written from a christian point of view . the authorized king james version ( kjv ) is very popular . it is a literal ( word-for-word ) translation . the kjv bible was translated from 1604 to 1611. since 1600 , many english words have changed . because the kjv bible is 400 years old , it is more difficult to read . but even though it is 400 years old , many expressions and idioms used in everyday modern english come from the kjv .
