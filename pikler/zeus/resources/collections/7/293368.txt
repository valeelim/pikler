Gallipoli Campaign     the gallipoli campaign was an allied attack on the gallipoli peninsula during world war i. the campaign took place between april 25 , 1915 and january 9 , 1916. the allies , the british empire and french forces , were fighting the ottoman empire . the reason for the campaign was to break the stalemate on the western and eastern front and to help the russians . the campaign started with a naval attack along the dardanelles . naval mines sank or damaged several ships and soon the turks fought back and stopped the allies from entering the sea of marmara . it was decided that if the russians were to receive any british help , a land invasion was necesary . on april 25 , 1915 , allied forces landed at various locations along the gallipoli peninsula . many british soldiers were landed in the wrong places resulting in heavy casualties . the british landed at cape helles and the anzacs landed at a place later known as anzac cove . however , the allies did not push on . instead , they were told to dig trenches and wait for a turkish attack . there was trench warfare until an evacuation of all allied troops was finally ordered . the campaign is widely viewed as an allied failure .
