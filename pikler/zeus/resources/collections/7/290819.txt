Platybelodon     platybelodon was a gomphothere . these were extinct large herbivores related to modern elephants . they are commonly known as shovel tuskers . `` platybelodon '' lived during the miocene , about 154 million years ago in africa , europe , asia and north america . `` platybelodon '' was previously believed to have fed in the swampy areas of grassy savannas , using its teeth to shovel up aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation . however , wear patterns on the teeth suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees . they may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the `` shovel '' more like a modern-day scythe , grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree .
