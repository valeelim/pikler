Time-domain spectroscopy     time-domain spectroscopy is a type of spectroscopy that measures the power of electromagnetic radiation as a function of time . normal spectroscopy is frequency-domain spectroscopy . it measures radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength . time-domain spectroscopy usually requires the use of fourier transforms . two monochromatic lights of different frequencies can combine to show interference patterns . at time t=0 , the waves interfere constructively . this gives a maximum in the added plot . the waves get more out of phase . this leads to destructive interference and a minimum in the added plot . from one peak maximum to the next is a `` cycle '' . so when looking at two monochromatic lights , they can be graphed as two lines in the frequency-domain ( this plot shows power , p ( Î½ ) , as a function of frequency ) . the same two lights can be plotted as the sum of their waves in the time-domain ( this plot shows power , p ( t ) , as a function of time ) . spectroscopy done with visible or infrared radiation involves wavelengths of 10 to 10 hz . phototransducers ( instruments that convert light to information readable by a computer ) can not make measurements that quickly . what is needed , then , is a way to make these high-frequency signals into low-frequency signals . for optical spectroscopy ( such as infrared spectroscopy ) the most common way to do this is by using a `` michelson interferometer '' .
