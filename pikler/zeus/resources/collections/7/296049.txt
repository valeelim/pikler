Shrew opossum     the order paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum . `` caenolestes '' is the main genus , and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids ' . they are small , shrew-like marsupials of the andes mountains of south america . 20 million years ago , there were at least seven genera in south america . today , just three genera remain . they live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high andes . insectivores were absent from south america until the great american interchange three million years ago , and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent . shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches . nevertheless , the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly . shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat ( 9â€“14 cm long ) , with thin limbs , a long , pointed snout and a slender , hairy tail . they are largely carnivorous , being active hunters of insects , earthworms and small vertebrates . they have small eyes and poor sight , and hunt in the early evening and at night , using their hearing and long , sensitive whiskers to locate prey . they seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways .
