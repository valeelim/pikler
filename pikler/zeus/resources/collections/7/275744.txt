Flavivirus     flavivirus is a genus of the family flaviviridae . this genus includes the west nile virus , dengue fever virus , tick-borne encephalitis virus , yellow fever virus , zika virus , and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis ( swelling in the brain ) . `` flaviviruses '' are named for the yellow fever virus - `` flavus '' means `` yellow '' in latin . ( yellow fever was named because it often caused yellow-colored skin , called jaundice , in its victims . ) `` flaviviruses '' share a common size ( 40-65 nm ) and symmetry ( shape ) , and they look similar under an electron microscope . they are made of single-stranded rna . humans get these viruses after being bitten by an infected mosquito or tick . usually , if a human who has a `` flavivirus '' gets bitten by a healthy mosquito or tick , the human will not have enough of the virus in their blood to infect the insect . this means humans do not help continue the virus 's life cycle ( by infecting insects who go on to infect other people ) . however , this is not true for yellow fever or dengue fever .
