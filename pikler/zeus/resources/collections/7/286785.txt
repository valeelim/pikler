Morganucodon     morganucodon is an early mammaliaform genus . it lived during the latest upper triassic or earliest jurassic . unlike many other early mammals , `` morganucodon '' is known from abundant and well preserved material . most of this comes from glamorgan in wales ( `` morganucodon watsoni '' ) . according to kemp , it is impossible to say whether the rock fissures ( cracks ) , where the remains were found , are latest triassic or earliest jurassic . `` morganucodon '' first appeared about 205 million years ago . `` it was a small animal with a skull 2-3 cm in length and a body length of about 10 cm [ 4 inches ] . in general appearance it would have looked like a shrew or mouse '' . fossils have also been found in the yunnan province in china ( `` morganucodon oehleri '' ) , in various parts of europe and north america and some at least closely related animals ( `` megazostrodon '' ) are known from exquisite fossils from south africa . from their size and teeth , they may have been insectivores . the small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation , which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur . nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat .
