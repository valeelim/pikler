Osteoarthritis     osteoarthritis normally affects older people : it is a disease where joints wear out . as the joint surface wears away , it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid . this causes the joint to swell . when the joint `` cartilage '' wears away , the core of the bone becomes exposed . the exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone . joints will be stiff and painful , and may be swollen . the pain may be worse after exercise . it may get harder to move the joint .
