Einstein field equations     the einstein field equations , or einstein-hilbert equations , or simply einstein equations are equations that describe gravity in the classical sense . they are named after albert einstein and david hilbert . the basic idea is to use geometry to model the effects of gravity . the usual form of the equations is that of nonlinear partial differential equations . such equations are usually solved by approximation . an exact solution can be obtained in special cases , where certain assumptions are dropped , or simplified . einstein used mathematical objects called `` tensors '' to describe the curvature of spacetime to define gravity . the equation below is the general form of the efe : formula_1 where r is known as the `` ricci curvature tensor '' , g is the `` metric tensor '' , `` r '' is the scalar curvature , λ is the `` cosmological constant '' , `` g '' is the gravitational constant , π is pi , c is the speed of light , and t is called the `` stress-energy tensor '' .
