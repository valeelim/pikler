Siphonophore     the siphonophores are an order of cnidarian invertebrates in the class hydrozoa . the portuguese man o ' war is an example . a siphonophore is not a single animal . it is a colony of four kinds of zooids . zooids are very small , highly modified individuals . all the zooids in a colony are genetically identical . these zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids . though structurally similar to other cnidarians , the zooids do not live by themselves : they are attached to each other . each type of zooid is not self-sufficient . it depends for survival on the others doing what it can not do by itself . so close do the zooids fit together that the colony looks like a single individual . it was a triumph of 19th century biology to discover the real nature of the siphonophores .
