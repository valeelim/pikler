Starling     the starlings are a family of small to medium-sized birds , the sturnidae . this family are passerine songbirds , whose best-known species is `` sternus vulgaris '' , the common starling . starlings occur naturally in the old world , from europe , asia and africa , to northern australia and the islands of the tropical pacific . several european and asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as to north america , hawaii and new zealand . in these new areas they compete for habitat with native birds , and are invasive species . starlings have strong feet , their flight is strong and direct , and they are very gregarious ( social ) . their preferred habitat is fairly open country , and they eat insects and fruit . several species live around humans , and are effectively omnivores . many species search for food by opening the bill after probing it into dense vegetation ; this behavior is called 'open-bill probing ' . plumage is usually dark with a metallic sheen and white flecks ( spots ) . most species nest in holes , laying blue or white eggs .
