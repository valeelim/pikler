Aphaenogaster     aphaenogaster is a genus of myrmicine ants . almost 200 species have been described . also , 11 fossil species are known . they live worldwide except from south america and southern africa . they are often confused with `` pheidole '' or `` pheidologeton '' . these two have major and minor workers , while `` aphaenogaster '' has only a single worker caste . `` pheidole '' has a 3-segmented club on its antenna . but `` aphaenogaster '' has four segments and a larger body size . `` pheidologeton '' has a 11-segmented antenna , while the antenna in `` aphaenogaster '' is 12-segmented . they make very thick , easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place . these entrances can have diameters of up to 4 cm and are up to 30 cm deep . this resulted in their common name funnel ants . these nests can be a bad problem for golfers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips , because the fragile ground easily breaks under pressure . `` aphaenogaster '' gets most of its food from tended aphids on the roots of plants . this explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels . the funnel-shaped openings could play a role in trapping arthropods , which are also eaten .
