Molecular vibrations     molecular vibrations are one of three different kinds of motion for molecules that include translational motion ( when the whole molecule goes in the same direction ) and rotational motion ( when the molecule spins like a top ) a vibrational motion for a molecule is when the bonds between atoms within a molecule move . think of the atoms as round balls that are attached by a spring that can stretch back and forth . an example of this motion is `` stretching '' , the simplest example of a vibration for a molecule and occurs between just two atoms . some examples of molecules that are like this include hydrogen h , nitrogen n and oxygen o if the molecule has more than two atoms , then things get more complicated . suppose just one more atom is added so now there are three atoms like in water ho where the two hydrogen atoms are both attached to the central oxygen atom . remember with hydrogen there was one kind of stretching , but in water there are two kinds of stretching and four other kinds of vibration called bending vibrations as shown below .
