Book of Wisdom     the book of wisdom ( also called wisdom of solomon or just wisdom ) is one of the books of the old testament . it has been grouped among the septuagint , or the seven wisdom books of the bible . a priest named st. melito , who lived in the second century ad , said that the book was considered canonical by jews and christians , and that naá¸¥manides was able to translate the book into hebrew when he wrote the pentateuch . the book was initially written in the greek language , but had the style of hebrew poetry . no one really knows who wrote the book , but some archeologists think that it was most likely solomon who had written it . this is based on some of the style and language of the book . for example , `` thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people , and a judge of thy sons and daughters : thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount ... '' the style here looks a lot like another book of the septuagint , called the ecclesiastes , `` i , koheleth , was king in jerusalem over israel , '' which also leaves out solomon 's name , but implies through the style . some christians at the time knew that king solomon was n't the author of the book , as told by the muratorian fragment that the book was `` written by the friends of solomon in his honor . '' that is why other people do not believe king solomon was the true author . a catholic encyclopedia also had said : `` at the present day , it is freely admitted that solomon is not the writer of the book of wisdom , which has been ascribed to him because its author , through a literary fiction , speaks as if he were the son of david . '' even though the book was called the wisdom of solomon , it was probably finished long after he died .
