Who Feels Love?    who feels love ? `` who feels love ? '' is a song by the rock band oasis . it was written by the band 's lead guitarist noel gallagher . it became the second single to be released from the album `` standing on the shoulder of giants '' . the song reached number 4 on the uk singles charts . the single was a success , but it failed to achieve a silver or better certification in the uk . the previous 11 british oasis singles had reached this level of certification . the album was noted for its psychedelic feel , and `` who feels love ? '' was the best example of this . mark stent was praised for his production on the song , creating a `` trippy '' feel like that found on beatles songs such as `` rain '' . with the psychedelic and eastern sound , the song also reminds of george harrison achievements like `` within you without you '' and also some of his solo work . however , despite the high-quality production , the song was not well received by the critics , `` nme '' said that the production `` triumphs over any real sort of feeling ... pure mock maharishi spirituality that not even liam can salvage from the realm of self-parody '' .
