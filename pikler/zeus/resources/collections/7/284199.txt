Microbial mat     a microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of microorganisms , mainly bacteria and archaea . they were first described by paracelsus ( ~1519 ) , but their full significance was not realised until the last quarter of the 20th century . microbial mats grow mostly on submerged or moist surfaces but a few survive in deserts . they colonize environments ranging in temperature from –40 °c to +120 °c . a few are endosymbionts of animals . although usually only a few centimetres thick , microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments . they consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or tolerate the chemicals at their level . in moist conditions mats are held together by slimy substances ( polysaccharides ) secreted by the microorganisms . some of the micro-organisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher . the best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites , but there are also spherical forms . microbial mats are the earliest form of life on earth for which there is good fossil evidence , from 3500 million years ago , and were for a long period the most important members of the planet 's ecosystems .
