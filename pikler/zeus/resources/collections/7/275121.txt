W and Z bosons     w and z bosons are a group of elementary particles . they are bosons , which means that they have a spin of 0 or 1. both had been found in experiments by the year 1983. together , they are responsible for a force known as `` weak force . '' weak force is called weak because it is not as strong as the strong force . there are two w bosons with different charges , the normal w , and its antiparticle , the w . z bosons are their own antiparticle . w bosons are named after the weak force that they are responsible for . weak force is what physicists believe is responsible for the breaking down of some radioactive elements , in the form of beta decay . in the late '70s , scientists managed to combine early versions of the weak force with electromagnetism , and called it the electroweak force . w and z bosons are only known to be created under beta decay , which is a form of radioactive decay . beta decay occurs when there are a lot of neutrons in an atom . an easy way to think of a neutron is that it is made of one proton and one electron . when there are too many neutrons in one atom nucleus , one neutron will split and form a proton and an electron . the proton will stay where it is , and the electron will be launched out of the atom at incredible speed . this is why beta radiation is harmful to humans .
