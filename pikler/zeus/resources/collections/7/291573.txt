Thermal power plant     a thermal power plant is a power plant where steam is used to drive a steam turbine . this turbine is connected to an electrical generator . after this , the water is condensed , and may be used again . this is known as the rankine cycle . there are different procedures that can be used to heat the water ; this gives different types of thermal power plants : components of a thermal power plant . - cooling tower - cooling water pump - transmission line ( 3-phase ) - step-up transformer ( 3-phase ) - electrical generator ( 3-phase ) - low pressure steam turbine - condensate pump - surface condenser - intermediate pressure steam turbine - steam control valve - high pressure steam turbine - deaerator - feedwater heater - boiler steam drum - superheater - forced draught ( draft ) fan - reheater - combustion air intake - induced draught ( draft ) fan fossil fueled thermal power plants produce a large part of man-made co2 emissions to the atmosphere , and efforts to reduce these are varied and widespread .
