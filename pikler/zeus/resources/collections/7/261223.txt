Albert Bridge     albert bridge is a road bridge over the river thames in west london . it connects chelsea on the north bank to battersea on the south bank . albert bridge was designed and built in 1873 as a cable-stayed bridge , it proved to be structurally unsound . between 1884 and 1887 sir joseph bazalgette added some elements of a suspension bridge . more work was done in 1973. as a result , the bridge today is a hybrid of three different design styles . built as a toll bridge , it was unsuccessful . six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership , and the tolls were lifted . the tollbooths remained in place , and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in london . its nickname is 'the trembling lady ' because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it . signs at the entrances warn troops from the nearby chelsea barracks to break step while crossing the bridge . with a roadway only wide , and with serious structural weaknesses , the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with motor traffic . despite this , albert bridge has remained open to vehicles , apart from brief spells for repairs . it is one of only two thames road bridges in central london which have never been replaced .
