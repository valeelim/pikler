Raymond Dart     raymond arthur dart ( 4 february 1893 â€“ 22 november 1988 ) was an australian anatomist and anthropologist , who worked for much of his life in south africa . in 1924 he discovered the first fossil of an australopithecine , at taung in northwestern south africa ( now botswana ) . it was `` australopithecus africanus '' , an extinct hominid closely related to humans . this was a great event in the study of human evolution . dart was born in brisbane , queensland , australia , the son of a farmer and tradesman . he studied at the university of queensland , the university of sydney and university college london , before taking a position as head of the newly established department of anatomy at the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg , south africa in 1922. because he was an australian , and not a part of the scientific establishment , and because he found the fossil in africa , and not europe or asia , where the establishment looked to for man 's origins , his findings were initially dismissed . dart 's closest ally was robert broom whose discoveries of further australopithecines ( and wilfrid le gros clark 's support ) eventually vindicated dart . so much so that in 1947 , sir arthur keith said `` ... dart was right , and i was wrong .
