Commodus     commodus ( lucius aurelius commodus antoninus , 31 august 161 â€“ 31 december 192 ) was roman emperor from 180 to 192. he also ruled as co-emperor with his father marcus aurelius from 177 until his father 's death in 180. his accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since titus succeeded vespasian in 79. commodus was the first emperor `` born to the purple '' , that is , born during his father 's reign . the reign of marcus aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare , even though he preferred books to war . that of commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife , and the arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself . in the view of dio cassius , a contemporary observer , his accession marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' . the historian edward gibbon took commodus 's reign as the beginning of the decline of the roman empire . despite his notoriety , commodus 's years in power are not well chronicled .
