Battle of Britain     the battle of britain was a continued attack by the german air force ( `` luftwaffe '' ) on great britain during the summer and autumn of 1940. the first objective of the campaign was to gain control of the air space above britain from the royal air force ( raf ) , especially fighter command . the name comes from a famous speech delivered by prime minister winston churchill in the house of commons : `` the battle of france is over . i expect the battle of britain is about to begin ... '' the battle of britain was the first major campaign to be fought only by air forces , and was also the largest and longest aerial bombing campaign to that date . from july 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres , such as portsmouth , were the main targets . a month later the `` luftwaffe '' shifted its attacks to raf airfields and infrastructure ( other useful war targets ) . as the battle progressed the `` luftwaffe '' also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure . coastal radar stations were bombed , so that at one point only one radar mast was standing . the british used a back-up system of human observers to get information to the headquarters of fighter command . most historians agree this part of the campaign went in germany 's favour .
