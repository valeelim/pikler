Walter Rudolf Hess     walter rudolf hess ( 17 march 1881 – 12 august 1973 ) was a swiss physiologist . he won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1949 for `` locating the areas of the brain involved in the control of internal organs '' . the prize was shared with egas moniz . hess was born on 17 march 1881 in frauenfeld , switzerland and died on 12 august 1973 in locarno , switzerland . by stimulating the hypothalamus of cats with tiny electric currents , hess induced behaviours . the behaviours ranged from excitement to apathy , depending on the position of the stimulation . he could induce different types of responses in the anterior ( lateral ) hypothalamus compared to stimulating the posterior ventromedial hypothalamus . when stimulating the anterior part , he could induce fall of blood pressure , slowing of respiration and responses such as hunger , thirst , urination and defecation . on the other hand , stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defensive behaviour . hess also found that he could induce sleep in cats – a finding that was highly controversial at the time but later confirmed . his work was important step in our understanding of neurosecretion .
