Calvin cycle     the calvin cycle ( also known as the calvinâ€“benson cycle ) is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis . the cycle is light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight . the calvin cycle is named after melvin calvin , who won a nobel prize in chemistry for finding it in 1961. calvin and his colleagues did the work at the university of california , berkeley . using the radioactive carbon-14 isotope as a tracer , calvin , andrew benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis . they traced the carbon-14 from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds . the single-celled algae `` chlorella '' was used to trace the carbon-14 . the calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds , not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed .
