Traction motor     traction motor refers to a type of electric motor . a traction motor is used to make rotation torque on a machine . it is usually changed into a straight line motion . traction motors are used in electrically powered rail vehicles such as electric multiple units and electric locomotives . they are also used in electric vehicles , such as electric milk floats , elevators , and conveyors . vehicles with electrical transmission systems such as diesel-electric locomotives , electric hybrid vehicles and battery powered electric vehicles . railroads first used dc motors . these motors usually ran on about 600 volts . high-powered semiconductors were developed to control the switching of ac motors . they have made ac induction motors a better choice . an induction motor does not require contacts inside the motor . these ac motors are simpler , and more reliable than the old dc motors . ac induction motors known as `` asynchronous traction motors '' . before the mid-20th century , a single large motor was often used to drive multiple wheels through connecting rods . this was the same way that steam locomotives would turn their drive wheels . now , the normal practice is to use one traction motor to drive each axle through a gear drive .
