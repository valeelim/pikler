Importance sampling     typically refers to a monte carlo method for sampling from a ( target ) distribution that can not be sampled from directly . the method works by sampling from a proposal distribution ( p ( x ) ) , which is ideally similar to the target distribution ( q ( x ) ) , and weighting each sample by the ratio of the likelihoods at the sampled point : w ( x ) = q ( x ) /p ( x ) .
