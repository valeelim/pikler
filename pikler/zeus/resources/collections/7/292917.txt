Stolen base     in baseball , a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate . in baseball statistics , stolen bases are displayed as sb . it is possible to steal second base , third base , or home plate , but not to steal first base . if the defense does not try to put the baserunner out ( for example , if the catcher does not even look his way ) , the play is called defensive indifference ( also called fielder 's indifference ) . no stolen base is credited to the runner in this case . defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run . mlb rule 10.07 ( g ) defines defensive indifference . a player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed , but also good base-running instincts , quickness , and split-second timing . the scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the major league baseball rule book .
