Lead acid battery     a lead acid battery is a secondary cell , meaning that it is rechargeable . it is very common in cars and trucks . it contains plates of lead and lead ( iv ) oxide in a sulfuric acid solution . the lead ( iv ) oxide oxidizes the lead plate , making an electrical current . lead-acid batteries are the cheapest rechargeable batteries and can produce much power . they contain toxic lead , though , and should be recycled . they are wet cells , and the dangerous acid can spill out . sealed lead acid batteries are batteries where the sulfuric acid is in a gel which stays in , even when the battery is turned up side down . reactions : 1. lead ( iv ) oxide + sulfuric acid + extra hydrogen ions → lead ( ii ) sulfate + water at cathode 1. lead + extra sulfate ions → lead ( ii ) sulfate at anode these reactions are reversed when the battery is charged . related pages . - wet cell - table of batteries
