Monarchy of Saint Kitts and Nevis     as a commonwealth realm , st kitts and nevis has the same monarch as several other commonwealth countries , queen elizabeth ii . in st kitts , or when representing st kitts in another country , she is known as the queen of st kitts and nevis , her full official title being : `` elizabeth the second , by the grace of god , queen of saint christopher and nevis and of her other realms and territories , head of the commonwealth '' . when acting as queen of st kitts , elizabeth ii only takes advice from the government of st kitts and nevis . this is because the statute of westminster of 1931 said that all commonwealth countries were independent of each other , and that the british government no longer had the right to interfere or give orders to the other countries . usually the queen 's constitutional roles are carried out by the governor-general of saint kitts and nevis . royal succession ( who is next in line to the throne ) is governed by the english act of settlement of 1701 , which is part of constitutional law .
