Burgess Shale     the burgess shale formation in the rocky mountains of british columbia is one of the world 's most celebrated fossil fields , and the best of its kind . it is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils . it is ~505 million years old ( middle cambrian ) , one of the earliest soft-parts fossil beds . the rock unit is a black shale , and crops out at a number of localities near the town of field in the yoho national park . the burgess shale was discovered by palaeontologist charles doolittle walcott in 1909 , towards the end of the season 's fieldwork . he returned in 1910 with his sons , and established a quarry on the flanks of fossil ridge . the fact that fossils were of soft-bodied forms , and the range of organisms new to science , led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. at this point , aged 74 , he had amassed over 65,000 specimens . describing the fossils was a vast task , pursued by walcott until his death in 1927. walcott , led by scientific opinion at the time , attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa . as a result , the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time . it was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted , by alberto simonetta . this led scientists to recognise that walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the burgess shale .
