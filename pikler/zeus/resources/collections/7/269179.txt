Normal force     normal force is the force that the ground ( or any surface ) pushes back up with . if there was no normal force , you 'd be slowly seeping into the ground . the normal force on a object is always perpendicular ( at a right angle ) to the surface the object is on . on a flat surface , the normal force of an object is formula_1 ( the object 's mass multiplied by the force of gravity ) . on an inclined plane , the normal force is reduced by the angle , and the normal force is formula_2 . note that on a flat surface , formula_3 would be 0 , and so formula_4 would be 1. so the two equations are equal .
