Plague doctor costume     the plague doctor 's costume was the clothes worn by a plague doctor to protect him from diseases spread through the air . the costume was made up of a coat which went down to the ankles and a mask . the mask looked like a bird 's beak . the beak was often filled with things which smelled sweet or strong ( often lavender ) . along with this , gloves , boots , a hat and something else to go over the jacket was worn . the beak was held in front of the doctor 's nose by straps . there were holes in the mask , filled with glass , so that the doctor could see . the mask had two small holes for the doctor to breathe . it was a type of respirator which was often filled with nice-smelling things . dried flowers ( such as roses and carnations ) , herbs ( such as mint ) , spices , camphor or a vinegar sponge could all be placed in the beak . the mask was supposed to keep away bad smells . at that time , it was thought that bad smells caused infection . doctors believed the herbs would take away the `` evil '' smells of the plague and stop them from getting it .
