Dejima     `` dejima dutch trading post '' is now a japanese national historic site . in 1543 portuguese traders were the first to set foot in japan , on the island of tanegashima . six years later jesuit missionary francis xavier came to the island of kyushu at kagoshima . at first portuguese traders were based in hirado . then they started a search for better port . in 1570 a powerful landowner or `` daimyo '' called ≈çmura sumitada became a catholic . ( he chose bartolomeu as his christian name . ) he made a deal with the portuguese to make nagasaki better for trading . soon the port was open . in 1580 sumitada gave the jurisdiction of nagasaki to the jesuits . the portuguese became the only ones trading silk with china through macau . shogun iemitsu ordered the creation of the artificial island in 1634. he did this at first to keep the portuguese merchants living in nagasaki in one area . after a rebellion of the mostly christian population in the shimabara-amakusa region , the tokugawa government banned all western nationals except the dutch employees of the dutch east india company ( `` vereenigde oostindische compagnie '' , voc ) . without the yearly portuguese ships from macau , the economy of nagasaki suffered heavily .
