Frankfurt Parliament     the frankfurt parliament ( , literally `` frankfurt national assembly '' ) was the first freely elected parliament for all of germany . session was held from may 18 , 1848 to may 31 , 1849 in the paulskirche at frankfurt am main . it was elected during the `` march revolution '' in the states of the german confederation . the assembly produced the so-called paulskirche constitution ( ) which proclaimed a german empire based on the principles of parliamentary democracy . this constitution fulfilled the main demands of the liberal and nationalist movements of the vorm√§rz and provided a foundation of human rights . the parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary emperor ( `` kaiser '' ) . the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iv did not accept the office of emperor when it was offered to him . he argued such an offer was an offence against the rights of the princes of the individual german states . in the 20th century , however , major elements of the frankfurt constitution became models for the weimar constitution of 1919 and the basic law for the federal republic of germany of 1949 .
