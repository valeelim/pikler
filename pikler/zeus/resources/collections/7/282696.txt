Leaf insect     the family phylliidae ( often misspelled 'phyllidae ' ) contains the living true leaf insects or walking leaves , which include some of the most remarkable leaf mimics in the entire animal kingdom . they occur from south asia through southeast asia to australia . there are different views about their taxonomy . leaf insects use camouflage to take on the appearance of a leaf . they do this so accurately that predators often are n't able to distinguish them from real leaves . in some species the edge of the leaf insect 's body even has the appearance of bite marks . to further confuse predators , when the leaf insect walks , it rocks back and forth , to mimic a real leaf being blown by the wind . they and stick insects go together in the order phasmatodea . the scholar antonio pigafetta may have been the first to document the creature . sailing with ferdinand magellan 's circumnavigational expedition , he studied and chronicled the fauna on the island of cimbonbon as the fleet hauled ashore for repairs .
