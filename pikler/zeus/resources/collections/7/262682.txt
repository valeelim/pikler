Henge     a henge is a neolithic earthwork . it has a ring bank and ditch , with the ditch inside the bank . they are not thought to be defensive . for defence , it would be much better to have the ditch outside the bank so attackers would need to climb up further . henges are typical of the british isles , but there are a few similar structures in continental europe . henges are divided into three types : 1. henge ( â‰¥20 m ) . there is typically little evidence of occupation in a henge , although they may contain ritual structures such as stone circles , timber circles and standing stones . examples of henges are at 1. avebury , in wiltshire , which contains the largest stone circle in britain , 1. the great circle at stanton drew in somerset , which contains the second largest stone circle in britain . 1. the ring of brodgar in orkney , which contains the third largest stone circle in britain . 1. notes : example of henges without other significant internal monuments are the three henges of thornborough henges in yorkshire . stonehenge is not a typical henge because the ditch is outside the main earthwork bank .
