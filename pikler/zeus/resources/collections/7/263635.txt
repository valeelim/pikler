Potassium manganate     potassium manganate is a chemical compound . its chemical formula is kmno . it contains potassium and manganate ions . potassium manganate is a green solid . it can disproportionate into potassium permanganate and manganese ( iv ) oxide . this happens in acidic ph . this reaction , because of its color change , is known as a `` chemical chameleon '' . it is made by reacting manganese ( iv ) oxide with very hot potassium hydroxide . sometimes oxygen or potassium nitrate is used as the oxidizing agent . this makes potassium manganate . normally the potassium manganate is converted to potassium permanganate . potassium permanganate is more common . potassium iodide can reduce potassium permanganate to potassium manganate . it can also be made by reacting hot potassium permanganate with potassium hydroxide . this makes oxygen and potassium manganate . potassium manganate does not have many uses . it is mainly made when potassium permanganate is made . potassium manganate is a moderate oxidizing agent . when it is reduced , it can made black or brown stains on glass , clothing , or skin .
