Battle of Finnburg     the battle of finnburg was a battle between the frisians and the danes . it was mentioned in two early medieval writings , the finnesburg fragment and `` beowulf '' . these may describe a real or a completelymythical event . according to the finnesburg fragment , the danish prince hnaef came with sixty followers to visit and spent the winter at the finnburg . finnburg was the fort of his brother-in-law finn , king of the frisians . there a fight started between the frisians and the danes . a battle took place that lasted for three days . the verses of the story that were found ( which is thought to be a small part of the original work ) do not explain why the fight started , nor do they give the outcome of the battle . in a passage of `` beowulf '' , a bard sings a song about the ending of the battle , here named `` freswael '' . this is the same story as in the finnesburg fragment . while in less detail , the `` beowulf '' episode is complete . here it is seen that the frisians won the battle . the danish prince hnaef and finn 's son died in the battle . after the fighting , the parties make peace , and the new danish leader `` hingest '' ( who some have identified as hengest ) is allowed to leave with the surviving danes .
