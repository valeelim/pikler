Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit     the melbourne grand prix circuit is a street circuit around albert park lake , only a couple of kilometres south of central melbourne . it is used once a year as a racetrack for the australian grand prix and associated support races . the circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle albert park lake , a small man-made lake just south of the central business district of melbourne . the roads that are used were rebuilt prior to the first race in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness . as a result , the albert park track has quite a smooth surface . the course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive . drivers have commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times . the flat terrain around the lake , coupled with a track design that features few true straights , means that it is not easy to pass another car on the track . watching the entire race track can only be done from a grandstand seat .
