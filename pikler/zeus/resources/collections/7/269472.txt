Karate belts     karate belts are a measure of a student/teacher ability . for example , a brown belt is higher than a blue belt . all styles of karate range from white to black . there are some theories about how belts came to be . some believe when a student graduated a kyu , he/she would dye their current belt the new , desired color . this was often done in japan during wwii when it was a very poor country . this is a theory that demonstrates how a student would , as they trained , dirty their belt overtime . more of a myth than a theory , a student started with a white belt . as sweat , dirt , and other debris occupied not only the belt , but the karate gi , his/her color appeared to get darker and closer to black .
