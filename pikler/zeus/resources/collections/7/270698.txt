Mussaurus     mussaurus ( meaning `` mouse lizard '' ) was an early , plant-eating prosauropod dinosaur from the upper triassic , about 215 million years ago . it was found in southern argentina . it gets its name from the small size of the skeletons first discovered . they were large-eyed hatchlings ( babies ) , only 9-16 inches long ( 18-37 cm ) ; these are the smallest dinosaur skeletons yet found . however , `` mussaurus '' is now known from adult specimens . the name is something of a misnomer ; adults possibly reached 3 m ( 10 ft ) in length , and weighed . `` mussaurus '' possesses anatomical features suggesting a close , possibly transitional evolutionary relationship with true sauropods .
