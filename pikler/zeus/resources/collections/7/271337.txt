Quebec Major Junior Hockey League     the quebec major junior hockey league ( french : `` la ligue de hockey junior majeur du qu√©bec '' , shortened as `` qmjhl '' in english , `` lhjmq '' in french ) is one of the three major junior ice hockey leagues which make up the canadian hockey league . because the name of the league is so long , it is sometimes called the `` q '' . there are 18 teams in the qmjhl that are in quebec , new brunswick , nova scotia , and prince edward island in canada , and maine in the united states . the winner of the qmjhl plays against the winners of the western hockey league and ontario hockey league for the memorial cup . many good players go from the qmjhl to the national hockey league , and nine players from the qmjhl are in the hockey hall of fame . the qmjhl was created in 1969 from two different junior leagues in quebec , the quebec junior hockey league and the metropolitan montreal junior hockey league . these two teams wanted to make a better junior league for the province , so combined teams from their leagues . eight teams were from the qjhl and two from the mmjhl and another team came from a town in ontario on the ontario-quebec border . nearly every team was within a close distance of montreal , the largest city in quebec , though no team played in montreal .
