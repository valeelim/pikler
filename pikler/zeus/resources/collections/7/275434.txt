The Rape of the Lock     the rape of the lock is a poem written by alexander pope , mocking heros and heroines . it was first published anonymously in `` lintot 's miscellany '' in may 1712. the poem is sarcastically laughing at the epic world of the gods . it was based on an incident that was remembered by pope 's friend , john caryll . arabella fermor and robert petre were both from catholic families at a time in england when anglicanism was very important . petre , lusting after arabella , had cut a lock of her hair to keep without permission , which made the two families have a big argument . this was because in those days , cutting off a lock of the lover 's hair was scandalous and symbolized improper love . pope , also a catholic , wrote the poem to make the two families reconcile and be happy again . he made the character belinda to represent arabella in the poem . pope 's poem mocks all the traditions of classics . although the poem is funny at times , pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile , and that just because belinda loses a lock of her hair she is very deeply hurt .
