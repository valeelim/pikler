Makaton     makaton is a set of simple sign language and black-and-white symbols ( pictures ) which are used alongside simple talk . makaton is a sign language that is free to teach other people but it is also sold , taught , guarded and checked up on by the business which started it . makaton started with simple ordinary english and british sign language hand-signs ; the pictures were added later . it is now used all over the world and changed for the country it is used in . it uses the same hand-signs as the sign language of the country it is used in but not in the same way . for example , in britain , makaton hand-signing is mostly made from bsl ( british sign language ) , but the signs are used in a different order alongside the simple spoken words . makaton is mainly taught to children and adults with special needs in speech and language , with or without hearing problems , by teachers , teaching assistants and childcare practitioners , carers or caregivers such as parents , grandparents , foster carers , other friends and family , and specialist clinicians such as speech and language therapists . makaton is also popular to use with babies - `` baby signing '' .
