Woody Bay railway station     woody bay was a station on the old lynton and barnstaple railway , a narrow gauge railway line that ran through exmoor from barnstaple to lynton and lynmouth in north devon . the station was inland , about 2 km from woody bay itself . it opened with the line ( as `` wooda bay '' until the name was changed in 1901 ) on 7 march 1898 , and closed when the line was closed on 29 september 1935. from 1923 until closure , the line was part of the southern railway . woody bay station was built in part to serve the expected development of a resort at woody bay , a mile or so to the north . a pier was built in the bay , although not much more building took place , and the pier was destroyed by storms before it properly opened . the development was stopped when the promotor went bankrupt in 1900 , and although a route was surveyed for a branch line to the bay , it was never built . after being bought by the lynton and barnstaple railway company in 1995 , restoration of the station began , and it opened as a visitors ' centre in 2003. an `` out and back '' service over a few hundred yards of track began in 2004 , and with the opening of a temporary station at killington lane , about one mile towards parracombe halt , a regular `` point to point '' service started in 2006 .
