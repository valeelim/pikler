Parallelogram     a parallelogram is a polygon with four sides ( a quadrilateral ) . it has two pairs of parallel sides ( sides which never meet ) and four edges . the opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length ( they are equally long ) . the word `` parallelogram '' comes from the greek word `` parallelogrammon '' ( `` bounded by parallel lines '' ) . rectangles , rhombuses , and squares are all parallelograms . as shown in the picture on the right , because triangles abe and cde are congruent ( have the same shape and size ) , in all parallelogram 's opposite angles are equal to each other . angles which are not opposite in the parallelogram will add up to 180 degrees . a simple ( non self-intersecting ) quadrilateral is a parallelogram if and only if any one of the following statements is true : - two pairs of opposite sides are equal in length - two pairs of opposite angles are equal in measure - the diagonals bisect each other - one pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length - adjacent angles are supplementary
