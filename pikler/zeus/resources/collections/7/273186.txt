Siberian Intervention     the siberian intervention ( 1918-1922 ) was part of a larger plan by the western powers and japan . they wanted to support the white russians against the bolshevik red army during the russian civil war . the allied forces left by 1920 , but the imperial japanese army stayed in siberia until 1922. the european soldiers went to the russian maritime provinces . the siberian intervention came quickly after the russian october revolution of 1917. the new bolshevik government signed a separate peace treaty with germany . that was a serious problem for the entente powers . the treaty ended fighting for the germans facing russia . germany could then move soldiers from east to west ; against europe . the peace agreement also allowed germany to get many supplies from murmansk , arkhangelsk and vladivostok . in addition , a 50,000 man czech legion had been fighting on the side of the allies . they became trapped . the czechs were trying to fight their way out to the east to vladivostok along the trans-siberian railway . however , the bolsheviks controlled that railway .
