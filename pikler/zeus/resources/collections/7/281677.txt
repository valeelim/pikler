Precision Approach Path Indicator     the precision approach path indicator ( papi ) is a visual system next to the touch-point on a runway . the purpose of the system is to lead a plane in correct approach . the papi creates ray of light which gives pilot information about his actual height . principle : - if plane is over correct approach line , pilot will see 3 white lights and 1 red . if he is higher , he will see all lights in white . - if plane keeps correct approach , pilot will see 2 white lights and 2 red . the right line is in the angle 3 degrees from axis of airport . - if plane is under correct approach line , pilot will see 3 red lights and 1 white . if he is lower , he will see all lights in red . the rules about the parameters are written in standard annex 14 icao . the brochure contains more specific information about intensity of ray , location where we can get device etc .
