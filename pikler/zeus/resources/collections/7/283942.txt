Sleepwalking     sleepwalking , or somnambulism , is a disorder belonging to the parasomnia family of sleeping problems . people with this disorder leave bed , without waking up , and walk around . in certain cases , people do things they also do in everyday life . according to research done , sleepwalking seems to be a problem related to the mechanism of waking up . the activities can be as simple as sitting up in bed , walking to the bathroom , and cleaning . sometimes they are dangerous ; examples include cooking , driving , extremely violent gesture or grabbing at hallucinated objects , or even homicide . generally , sleepwalking cases consist of simple , repeated behaviours ; occasionally there are reports of people performing complex behaviours while asleep , but the legitimacy of these claims is often disputed . in 2004 , sleep medicine experts in australia claimed to have successfully treated a woman who claimed to have sex with strangers in her sleep . in december 2008 , reports were published of a woman who sent semi-coherent emails while sleepwalking , including one inviting a friend around for dinner and drinks . sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the what they do , because they are not truly conscious . their eyes are open , but their expression is dim and glazed over . sleepwalking may last as little as 30 seconds or as long as thirty minutes .
