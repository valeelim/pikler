Child labour     child labour means that children are forced to work like adults and take part in an economic activity . according to the ilo international labour organization this is applied to people up to age fifteen , or seventeen in case of dangerous work . even though only about a fourth of the ilo members have ratified the respective convention , this age limit is generally accepted . child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood , interferes with their ability to attend regular school , and that is mentally , physically , socially or morally dangerous and harmful . child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children , like guarding other children , or helping here and there . child labour is forbidden in most countries . these days we see many minor boys and girls working in tea stalls , restaurants , hotels and other small shops . some work in huge factories like brick factories . this is caused due to child labour , and the main reason why child labour occurs is poverty .
