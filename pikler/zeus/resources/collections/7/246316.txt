Manic Street Preachers     manic street preachers ( often referred to as the manics ) are an alternative rock band from blackwood , wales , formed in 1986. they are james dean bradfield ( vocals , guitars ) , nicky wire ( bass , occasional vocals ) and sean moore ( drums , backing vocals , occasional trumpet ) . the band is part of the cardiff music scene . their biggest success was during the 1990s . the band were originally a four piece band : lyricist and rhythm guitarist richey edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 february 1995. in november 2008 , 13 years after his disappearance , he was officially declared presumed dead . the manics released their debut album `` generation terrorists '' in 1992. their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery , outspoken invective and songs about `` culture , alienation , boredom and despair '' soon gained them a loyal following and cult status . the band 's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style . they also adopted a broader alternative rock sound . enigmatic lyricist richey edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words `` 4 real '' into his arm with a razor blade ( narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches ) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic . the dark nature of 1994 's `` the holy bible '' showed the result of edwards ' instability .
