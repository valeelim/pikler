Fosse Way     the fosse way was one of the main roman roads in britain . it linked exeter ( `` isca dumnoniorum '' ) in south west england to lincoln ( `` lindum colonia '' ) in the east midlands . the road went via ilchester ( `` lindinis '' ) , bath ( `` aquae sulis '' ) , cirencester ( `` corinium '' ) and leicester ( `` ratae corieltauvorum '' ) . it joined akeman street and ermin way at cirencester , crossed watling street at `` venonis '' ( high cross ) south of leicester , and joined ermine street at lincoln . the word `` fosse '' is derived from the latin `` fossa '' , meaning `` ditch '' . for the first few decades after the roman invasion of britain in ad 43 , the fosse way marked the western frontier of roman rule in iron age britain . it is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road , or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length . it is remarkable for its extremely direct route . from lincoln to ilchester in somerset is a distance of 182 miles . the road is never more than six miles from a straight line .
