Quadrivium     the quadrivium is the mediaeval education which led to the master of arts ( ma ) degree . the quadrivium follows the trivium in a liberal arts education . the quadrivium consisted of four which were related to mathematics : - arithmetic ( numbers ) - geometry ( space ) - music ( time : harmonics ) - astronomy ( time and space ) these four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by plato in `` the republic '' . all the education was done in latin , which educated pupils learnt at school , or from a private tutor . latin was the `` lingua franca '' ( universal language ) of mediaeval europe : even the bible could only be read in latin . since the quadrivium was taught in universities , only boys could take it ( because only males took part in universities ) . the teaching was done by priests . if girls wanted education , it had to be done in their homes . in the modern form of liberal arts in the united states , both sexes are taught , although there are still a few single-sex institutions .
