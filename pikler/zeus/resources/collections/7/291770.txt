Electron crystallography     electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) . this method works in many cases where x-ray crystallography does not . the latter needs large 3-d crystals to work . protein structures are usually done from 2-dimensional crystals ( sheets or helices ) , polyhedrons such as viral capsids , or dispersed proteins . electrons can be used in these situations , whereas x-rays can not , because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than x-rays do . electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) . the method was invented by aaron klug , who won the nobel prize in chemistry for this , and his studies on virus structures and transfer rna , in 1982. the first electron crystallographic protein structure to be solved was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990. since then , several other high-resolution structures have been done by electron crystallography , including the light-harvesting complex , and the bacterial flagellum .
