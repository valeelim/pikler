Terrestrial locomotion     terrestrial locomotion has evolved as animals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial places . movement on land makes different problems than that on water , with less friction instead being the effects of gravity . there are three basic forms of movement found among land animals : - legged - moving by using legs - limbless locomotion - moving without legs , mostly using the body - rolling - rotating the bod movement on legs is the most common form of land movement . it is the simple form of movement of two big groups with many members , the vertebrates and the arthropods . there are a number of land and amphibious limbless vertebrates and invertebrates . these animals , due to lack of legs , use their bodies to move . these movements are sometimes called to as `` slithering '' or `` crawling '' . although animals have never have wheels for locomotion , some animals will move by rolling their whole body . the fastest terrestrial animal is the cheetah , which can get speeds of about 104 km/h ( 64 mph ) .
