Marcel Duchamp     marcel duchamp ( 28 july 1887 â€“ 2 october 1968 ) was a french artist whose work is most often associated with the dadaist and surrealist movements . duchamp 's output influenced the development of post-world war i western art . he advised modern art collectors , such as peggy guggenheim and other prominent figures , thereby helping to shape the tastes of western art during this period . a playful man , duchamp challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and art marketing , not so much by writing , but through subversive actions such as dubbing a urinal art and naming it `` fountain '' . this approach would 50 years later be called conceptual art , though he himself used the term 'ready-mades ' for this idea . he produced relatively few artworks , while moving quickly through the avant-garde circles of his time . the creative act is not performed by the artist alone ; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act .
