Casineria     casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago ( mya ) in the mississippian . it was a small animal , length about 15 centimeters . it lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now scotland . it had a mosaic of 'basal ' ( = primitive ) amphibian and 'derived ' ( = advanced ) amniote characters . `` casineria '' was at or very near the origin of the amniotes . it may have been one of the very first true amniotes . the only fossil lacks key elements : most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing . this makes exact analysis is difficult . `` casineria '' was an insectivore . this earliest amniote had five fingers with claws on each hand , and marks the earliest known clawed foot . its name , `` casineria '' , is a latin version of `` cheese bay '' , the site near edinburgh , where it was found . in 1992 , an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of cheese bay , scotland . for the next five years , the fossil waited at the national museums of scotland in edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects . in 1997 , work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone .
