Solder     solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature . there are two types of solder ; soft solder and hard solder . soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work . hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch . using solder is called soldering . there are two main types of soft solder ; lead solder and lead-free solder . lead solders have about 60 % ( or 63 % ) tin and 40 % ( or 37 % ) lead in them . they are toxic because they have lead in them . they melt at around 185°c . lead solder is cheap , so it used to be popular . in plumbing , a 50 % tin and 50 % lead mixture was used . people thought this was safe , but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water . now lead solder is illegal for water . lead solder was once used for food cans . after many years , the lead could come into the food . the cans poisoned people who ate the food . lead solder is still used in electronics . in 2006 the european union , china , and california banned lead in consumer products . lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places . lead-free solder was needed . many lead-free solders have tin , silver , and copper in them . they melt around 217°c . sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better , but indium is very expensive .
