Susumu Tonegawa     susumu tonegawa ( born 6 september 1939 ) is a japanese scientist who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1987. he discovered the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity . although he won the nobel prize for his work in immunology , tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training . in his later years , he has turned his attention to the molecular and cellular basis of memory . tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system . if each antibody was coded by one gene , it would take millions of genes to protect against antigens . instead , as tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 , genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies . the main mechanism is called rna splicing . antibodies have a 'variable region ' in their structure . tonegawa compared the dna of b cells ( a type of white blood cell ) in embryonic and adult mice . he found that genes in the mature b cells of the adult mice are moved around , recombined , and deleted to make the many versions of the variable region of antibodies .
