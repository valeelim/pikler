Odds     in mathematics , odds are the chance that an event will happen compared to the chance that it will not happen . for example , if there is an equal chance that it will rain or that it will not rain , the odds of it raining are 1:1 ( which is read as `` 1 to 1 '' ) . if it is twice as likely that it will not rain , then the odds of it raining are 1:2 ( read as `` 1 to 2 '' ) . odds are often used in gambling , especially in horse racing . ask dr. math : odds slang for probability ?
