Italic     italic script and type has a long history . it was based on handwriting . ludovico vicentino degli arrighi ( 1475â€“1527 ) was a papal scribe and type designer in renaissance italy . present day cursive writing style known as `` italic '' is based upon the style he developed . it has been said that the style of cursive known as `` italic '' got its name from this `` italian '' designer . modern day scribes , also known as `` calligraphers '' , study the work of arrighi to learn the structure of the style of writing known as `` italic '' , a modernized version of the chancery hand which was first perfected by roman scribes in the early part of the sixteenth century . in typography , italic type is a cursive font based on a kind of calligraphic handwriting . such letters normally slant slightly to the right . in modern texts , italics can emphasise key points in a printed text . one manual of english usage described italics as `` the print equivalent of underlining '' . calligraphy-inspired typefaces were first designed in italy , to replace documents written in a handwriting style called chancery hand . as the illustration shows , there were flourishes copied from calligraphy . an alternative is oblique type : the type is slanted but the letterforms do not change shape : this less elaborate approach is used by many sans-serif typefaces .
