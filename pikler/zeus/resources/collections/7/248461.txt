Jehol biota     the jehol biota includes all the living organisms – the ecosystem – of northeastern china between 133 to 120 million years ago ( mya ) . this is the lower cretaceous ecosystem which left fossils in the yixian formation , some 125–121 mya , and the jiufotang formation . it is also believed to have left fossils in the sinuiju series of north korea . the ecosystem in the lower cretaceous was dominated by wetlands and numerous lakes ( not rivers , deltas , or marine habitats ) . rainfall was seasonal , alternating between semi-arid , and mesic conditions . the climate was temperate . the jehol ecosystem was interrupted at times by ash eruptions from volcanoes to the west . the word `` jehol '' was the name given during the japanese occupation of north-east china , 1933–1946 . the jehol biota includes many types of fossils and large numbers of individuals of each species that have been recovered . the biota includes many species that were previously known only from the upper jurassic or earlier . these include the dinosaur `` sinosauropteryx '' , and the pterosaur `` dendrorhynchoides '' . there was even a primitive protomammal – a tritylodont therapsid – from lower cretaceous japan . tritylodonts were previously thought to have gone extinct in the middle jurassic . the biota also has the earliest and most basal ( primitive ) known members of groups which spread all around the world by the upper cretaceous , including neoceratopsians , therizinosaurs , tyrannosaurs , and oviraptors .
