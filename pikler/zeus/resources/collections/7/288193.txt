Bing cherry     bing is a cultivar ( farmed type ) of the wild or sweet cherry ( `` prunus avium '' ) that started in the pacific northwest , in milwaukie , oregon , united states . the bing remains a major cultivar in oregon , washington , and british columbia . it is the most produced variety of sweet cherry in the united states . the cultivar was created as a crossbred graft from the republican cherry in 1875 by oregon horticulturist seth lewelling and his manchurian chinese foreman ah bing , for whom the cultivar is named . ah bing was reportedly born in china and immigrated to the u.s. in about 1855. he worked as a foreman in the lewelling family fruit orchards in milwaukie for about 35 years , supervising other workers and caring for trees . he went back to china in 1889 for a visit . due to the restrictions of the chinese exclusion act of 1882 he never returned to the united states . some say ah bing developed the cultivar , others that it was developed by lewelling and named in bing 's honour due to his long service as orchard foreman .
