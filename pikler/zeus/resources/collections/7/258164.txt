Crankshaft     the crankshaft , sometimes casually called the `` crank '' , is the part of an engine which changes the up and down motion of the pistons into rotation . to convert the motion , the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts . the pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts . when the piston moves up and down , it pushes the offset shaft . this in turn rotates the crankshaft . the pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation . a crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel . the flywheel smooths out the rotation . sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft . this helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft . large engines usually have several cylinders . this helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes . for some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights . the counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance . while counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft , it provides a smoother running engine . this allows higher rpms to be reached and more power produced .
