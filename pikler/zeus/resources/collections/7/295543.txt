Arctic ecology     arctic ecology is the science that studies the ecology of the arctic . the arctic is all land and water north of the arctic circle ( 66 33 â€™ ) . this area is very cold and has little rain . in the winter there is almost no sunlight . the growing season , when farmers can grow crops , is very short . the arctic biomes are taiga , boreal forest , and tundra . many of the ecosystems in the arctic are fragile , and can be easily destroyed . these ecosystems are being hurt by global warming . the arctic environment includes both land and water . two important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost . sea ice is ice that floats in the ocean . it is made of frozen seawater . it is important because animals live and sleep on the ice , especially in winter . sea ice lasts all year and never melts completely . there is less ice during the summer than during the winter . lots of land in the arctic is frozen all year long . permafrost is a substrate ( layer of soil ) that has been frozen for two or more years . the dirt on top of the permafrost is called the `` active layer '' . this dirt melts during the summer and is important for plants to grow .
