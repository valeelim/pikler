Daedalus     daedalus was king minos ' head architect in ancient greece and son of athena . when king minos of crete was having some sovereignty problems , he asked poseidon , god of the sea , for an offering to sacrifice to him as a sign as true kingship . so poseidon sent a snow-white bull straight out of the sea foam . once the people of crete saw the bull , they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship . however , once king minos saw the bull , he refused to sacrifice the bull , kept it for himself , and sacrificed another bull to poseidon , thus angering him . poseidon put a curse on minos ’ wife , making her fall in love with the bull . she loved it so much that she wanted to mate with it . minos called for the help of daedalus , who built a wooden bull and put queen pasiphae inside it , thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull . she soon became pregnant with half-man , half-bull ( also called the minotaur ) . king minos was horrified and asked daedalus to build some kind of prison to keep the minotaur from destroying crete . so daedalus built a labyrinth that was so complicated that the minotaur could not get out . only daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth . minos was afraid that daedalus would tell the route through the labyrinth , and that he would tell that the minotaur was the son of minos ' wife , he imprisoned daedalus and his son icarus , in a high tower . daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and icarus ’ arms and together they escaped from the tower . however , icarus , forgetting his father ’ s words , flew too close to the sun , and the wax that held the feathers together melted . icarus fell into the ocean and drowned . daedalus landed safely on an island , and in grief , he named the sea that he and icarus had flown across the icarian sea .
