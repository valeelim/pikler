Ortac     ortac is a small uninhabited islet about 5 km west of the coast of alderney near to the islet of burhou . it measures about 50 by 70 metres ( 160 by 230 ft ) . a.h. ewen thinks that the rock 's name meant `` large rock at the edge '' from the norman language `` or '' ( edge ) + `` etac '' ( stack ) . alexander deschamps said that the french used to call it `` the eagle 's nest '' . ortac and alderney , along with the casquets , are part of the same sandstone ridge . paul naftel , a guernsey artist , drew ortac , and the drawing appeared in ansted & latham 's book , `` the channel islands '' ( 1862 ) . the writers themselves commented - if the sea bottom , which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep , were elevated 120 feet ( 37 m ) , the island of alderney , the burhou and ortac group , and the casquets would be connected by low land , and form a narrow island around 12 miles ( 19 km ) long . the 1906 book , `` the channel pilot '' states - between ortac , verte tÃªte and burhou island , are scattered many dangerous rocks , and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity .
