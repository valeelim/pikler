Gut flora     gut flora consists of microorganisms that live in the digestive system of animals . it is the largest reservoir of microbes in the human microbiome . the human body , consisting of about 100 trillion cells , carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines . the metabolic activities performed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ , leading some to call gut flora a 'forgotten organ ' . it is estimated that these gut flora have around 100 times as many genes in aggregate as there are in the human genome . bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and up to 60 % of the dry mass of faeces . somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut , with most estimates at about 500. however , it is probable that 99 % of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species . fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora , but little is known about their activities . research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal ( a non-harmful coexistence ) , but rather a symbiotic relationship . though people can survive without gut flora , the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions , such as fermenting unused energy substrates , training the immune system , preventing growth of harmful , pathogenic bacteria , regulating the development of the gut , producing vitamins for the host ( such as biotin and vitamin k ) , and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats . however , in some conditions , some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host .
