Molar mass     molar mass is the mass of a substance that has 6.022 x 10 atoms ( avogadro 's number ) . the mass number of an element is equal to the molar mass of the element . the molar mass of a chemical compound is the amount that has 6.022 x 10 molecules . it can be found by adding the molar masses of all of its elements . so sodium hydroxide 's ( naoh ) molar mass can be found by adding the molar mass of sodium , oxygen , and hydrogen .
