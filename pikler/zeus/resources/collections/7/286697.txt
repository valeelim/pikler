Westlothiana     westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod . it is a transitional fossil , with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters . its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards . it lived during the carboniferous period , about 350 million years ago . the type specimen was discovered in east kirkton quarry , bathgate , scotland , in 1984. it was named after the county of west lothian where it was found . this species probably lived near a freshwater lake , probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat . it was a slender animal , with rather small legs and a long tail . together with `` casineria '' , another transitional fossil found in scotland , it is one of the smallest terapods known , being a mere 20 cm in adult length . the small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote , as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals . there are derived ( advanced ) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians . these are : unfused ankle bones , lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth , a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull .
