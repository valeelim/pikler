L'Atalante basin     the l'atalante basin is a very salty 'lake ' at the bottom of the mediterranean sea . it is about 190 km ( ~120 miles ) west of the island of crete . it is called a 'lake ' because , though it is under more than two miles of water , it is almost completely separate from the sea above it . its huge salt content prevents the waters mixing . sometimes these lakes are called `` brine pools '' . they are found in many oceans ; there is one in the gulf of mexico . l'atalante is only one of several such lakes underneath the normal waters of the mediterranean . when the strait of gibraltar was closed , about six million years ago , the mediterranean dried up and became a huge salt lake , rather like the dead sea and the great salt lake are today . then it dried out completely , leaving an enormous amount of salt . when the straight of gibraltar opened again about five million years ago , water from the atlantic ocean rushed in to form the mediterranean we see today . even today , the atlantic feeds the mediterranean with water , because the evaporation from the 'med ' is greater than is provided by its rivers . with its huge supply of salt underneath , and the constant evaporation , the med is a high salt sea compared with the atlantic .
