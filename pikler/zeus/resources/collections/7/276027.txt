Anwar el Sadat     muhammad anwar el-sadat ( 25 december 1918 â€“ 6 october 1981 ) was the third president of egypt . he served from 15 october 1970 until he was assassinated by islamic extremists on 6 october 1981. sadat was born in 1918 into a family with 13 children , and attended a military school . after his graduation , he was sent to an outpost where he met and became a close friend of gamal abdel nasser . there , the two of them became part of a group of young soldiers who later became the free officers group that overthrew the muhammad ali dynasty in the egyptian revolution of 1952. nasser became the president after the revolution , and sadat served as one of nasser 's ministers until he died in 1970. sadat was chosen as president because nasser 's supporters saw him as someone who they could control . they did not think he would be president for very long . however , in his eleven years as president sadat changed a lot of the things nasser had set in place , and made egypt respected for its military strength and political power in the middle east . on 6 october 1973 , sadat started the october war together with syria , to try to take back the land israel had taken from them six years earlier in the six-day war . the egyptian army was very successful at the start of the war , and their advance across the suez canal into the sinai peninsula surprised israel and the rest of the world . this success made sadat a hero in egypt , and for a time throughout the arab world .
