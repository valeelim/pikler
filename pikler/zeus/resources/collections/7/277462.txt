Mudrock     mudrocks make up most of the sedimentary rocks on earth . they are a class of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks . the types of mudrocks include : `` siltstone '' , `` claystone '' , `` mudstone '' , `` slate '' , and `` shale '' . most of the particles are less than 0.0625 mm ( 1/16 mm or 0.0025 inches ) and are too small to study readily in the field . at first sight the rock types look quite similar ; however , there are important differences in composition and naming . there has been a great deal of disagreement about the classification of mudrocks . there are some reasons for this : mudrocks make up half of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record , and are easily the most widespread deposits on earth . fine sediment is the most abundant product of erosion , which is why mudrocks are so common . with increased pressure over time the platey clay minerals may become aligned , with the appearance of parallel layering ( fissility ) . this finely bedded material which splits readily into thin layers is called `` shale '' , as distinct from `` mudstone '' .
