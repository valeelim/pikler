Ötzi the Iceman    ötzi the iceman ötzi the iceman , or oetzi , is a well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago . the mummy was found in september 1991 by two german hikers in the schnalstal glacier , ötztal alps , near hauslabjoch on the border between austria and italy . he is also known as the iceman , similaun man , frozen fritz , and man from hauslabjoch . he is europe 's oldest natural human mummy , and has offered a new picture of chalcolithic ( copper age ) europeans . ötzi was found on a mountain ridge , at the border between austria and italy . after the first word war , austria had to give the southern part of tyrol to italy ; it is now known as trentino-alto adige/südtirol . at the time , the border was fixed on the watershed of that ridge . the problem with this is that the ridge is usually covered by a glacier , which was also the case in 1919 and 1920. when the border was fixed , the expert team supposed that the watershed was straight below the glacier . the border was fixed that way in 1922 and 1926. the body was found on the austrian side of the slope . measurements were done in 1993 ; they showed that the border is in fact 93 metres from the place where ötzi was found , on italian territory . since 2006 , there is a new contract which fixes the border between austria and italy : in the case of glaciers , the border is taken on the surface of the glacier , and no longer on the watershed below . this also means that the border is now variable , and depending on the state of the glacier , the place where ötzi was found is in austria or in italy .
