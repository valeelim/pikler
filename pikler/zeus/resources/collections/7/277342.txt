Chlorophyta     chlorophyta are a division of green algae . it includes about 7,000 species of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryote organisms . like the land plants , green algae contain chlorophylls `` a '' and `` b '' , and store food as starch in their plastids . most species are flagellate in at least one stage of their life cycle . they are related to the charophyceae ( also called charophyta ) and land plants , together making up the viridiplantae . the division contains both unicellular and multicellular species . while most species live in freshwater habitats and a large number in marine habitats , other species are adapted to a wide range of environments . watermelon snow , or `` chlamydomonas nivalis '' , lives on summer alpine snowfields . others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees . some lichens are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae . members of the chlorophyta also form symbiotic relationships with protozoa , sponges and cnidarians . some conduct sexual reproduction .
