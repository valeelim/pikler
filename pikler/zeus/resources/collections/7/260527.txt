Sodium phosphate     sodium phosphate is a group of chemical compounds . the phosphate atom can hold three other atoms . they can be three hydrogen ( phosphoric acid ) , two hydrogen and one sodium ( sodium dihydrogen phosphate ) , one hydrogen and two sodium ( disodium hydrogen phosphate ) , or three sodium ( trisodium phosphate ) . sodium dihydrogen phosphate , also known as monosodium phosphate , is a chemical compound with the formula nahpo . it is acidic . it is used in some baking powders . it is used as a laxative or a ph buffer ( something that keeps a chemical from getting more acidic or basic ) . it is made by reaction of a little sodium hydroxide with phosphoric acid . disodium hydrogen phosphate , also known as disodium phosphate is a chemical compound with the formula nahpo . it is about neutral ( not acidic or basic ) . it is used to prevent clumping in foods . it is made by reaction of some sodium hydroxide with phosphorus . trisodium phosphate , also known as sodium phosphate , is a chemical compound with the formula napo . it is basic . it formerly was used in detergents , but the phosphate fueled algal blooms . it is made by combining sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid .
