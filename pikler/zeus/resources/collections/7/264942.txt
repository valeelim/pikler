Gunnysacking     gunnysacking is a metaphor , used in conflict resolution , which involves the act of `` storing up '' grievances acquired in the course of a relationship , rather than resolve them when they first occurred . the word is based on the idea of using a gunny sack ( burlap bag ) storing a number of items . a typical example might occur in a marriage facing occasional difficulty . partners may have small grievances or annoyances , which by themselves are not critical . however , over time one partner gets less happy and more annoyed . then some incident occurs , and a full-blown argument follows . by analogy , this is the gunny sack bursting , with an 'overblown reaction ' . the term may also refer to bringing up past grievances when trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship . in which case , gunnysacking ( as a tactic ) has the dual effect of raising additional problems ( in what is typically already a volatile , difficult situation ) and presents a side-track obstacle to dealing with the current issues . additionally , once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship , other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior .
