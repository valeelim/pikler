Andromeda galaxy     the andromeda galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the milky way , our galaxy . andromeda is sometimes called m31 or ngc 224 by astronomers . it is about 2.6 million light years away from us . andromeda is the largest galaxy of the local group , which consists of the andromeda galaxy , the milky way galaxy , the triangulum galaxy , and about 30 other smaller galaxies . although the largest , andromeda may not be the most massive . recent findings suggest that the milky way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the grouping . the 2006 observations by the spitzer space telescope revealed that m31 contains a trillion stars ( 10 ) . this is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy , which is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion . andromeda is estimated to be 7.1 solar masses . in comparison , a 2009 study estimated that the milky way and andromeda are about equal in mass , while a 2006 study put the mass of the milky way at ~80 % of the mass of andromeda . at an apparent magnitude of 3.4 , the andromeda galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest messier objects , making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution . although it appears more than six times as wide as the full moon when photographed through a larger telescope , only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye . being both large and bright , it is one of the farthest objects that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars .
