Tea Act     tea act of 1773 was a law made by the parliament of great britain . the law was made to help the east india company which had massive amounts of tea stored in london which they could not sell . the law would make the company 's tea cheaper than other tea which was being smuggled into britain 's north american colonies . this was supposed to make people buy east india company tea on which the townshend duties were paid , thus implicitly agreeing to accept parliament 's right of taxation . the law gave the company the right to directly ship its tea to north america and the right to the duty-free export of tea from britain . the tax imposed by the townshend acts and collected in the colonies remained in force . it became law on may 10 , 1773 .
