Heisenberg's uncertainty principle    heisenberg 's uncertainty principle heisenberg 's uncertainty principle is one of the most important results of twentieth century physics . it relates to measurements of sub-atomic particles . certain pairs of measurements such as ( a ) where a particle is and ( b ) where it is going ( its position and momentum ) can not be precisely pinned down . albert einstein thought that such a quantum theory could give us only a partial description of nature . he thought that heisenberg 's discovery showed that human knowledge is limited , but he also thought that nature is absolute . that is , he thought that there is no `` uncertainty '' in nature , and that the uncertainty exists only in our knowledge about it . however , many other scientists disagree with einstein . heisenberg 's idea is that if something like an electron were shot into a big box with a certain speed and in a certain direction , then it would be possible to calculate a fairly accurate idea of what its path would be like in the future . however , if the box were made smaller then we would have a more certain idea of where it was located , and because of that we would have to have a less certain idea of how it was traveling . american physicist brian greene gave the analogy of a moth which flies placidly around in a large closet but who flies frantically back and forth and up and down when placed in a glass jar . another interesting uncertainty phenomenon , which makes possible many electronic devices , is called quantum tunneling . in our everyday life , people can not move through walls . however , electrons can move through solid walls . in the animation to the right , you can see a faint white puff on the right side of the wall after a big puff hits the wall from the left . that dim spot of light represents the photon or other atomic particle which tunnels through the wall .
