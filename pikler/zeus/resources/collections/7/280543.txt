CP violation     cp violation is the way that nature breaks the laws that say that when you change a system by c symmetry or p symmetry then some descriptions of the system should stay the same before and after the change . the 'violation ' is that they do n't stay the same and the amounts are not conserved . cp symmetry says that the laws of physics should act the same on a particle and on its antiparticle ( charge conjugation symmetry ) and if it was also turned around like in a mirror ( p symmetry . ) the 1964 nobel prize was given to james cronin and val fitch for finding cp violation in the way neutral kaons decay .
