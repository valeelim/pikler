Quena     the quena , also written as `` kena '' in english , is the traditional flute of peru and the andes . made of bamboo , it has six finger holes and one thumb hole and is open on both ends . to make a sound , the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between the chin and lower lip , and blows a stream of air downward , over a notch cut into the end . it is normally in the key of g major . g is the lowest note when all the holes are covered . it produces a very breathy or airy tone . the quenacho ( also `` kenacho '' in english ) is a bigger , lower sounding type of quena and made the same way . it is in the key of d major , a fourth lower than the quena . in most of andes ' towns `` vamos a ir a la quena '' ( we will go to the quena ) was used to threaten little children , because the quena was made of bamboo , a hard material . quena is mostly used in traditional andean music . in the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several nueva canción musicians . some groups such as illapu have used it regularly . in the 1980s and 1990s some post-nueva canción rock groups have also used the quena in some of their songs ; notably soda stereo in `` cuando pase el temblor '' and los enanitos verdes in `` lamento boliviano '' . the quena is also relatively common in world music .
