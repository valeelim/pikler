Spice trade     the spice route was a route between asia and europe . a few hundred years ago , the rich people wanted spices . spices did not grow in europe , so they had to be brought from asia . people made a route to go from europe to asia to buy spices . the route was very difficult and so the spices were expensive . people tried to find ways cheaper than the spice route , like going the other way around the world . this is how many things were discovered , like the western hemisphere . the spice trade was where countries traded spices for gold and other things . they did this so they could get new spices or gain money and gold by selling their own . sometimes people traded the spices because their country is running out of that certain spice .
