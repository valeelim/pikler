Sinterklaas     sinterklaas ( also called sint nicolaas ) is a traditional winter holiday figure in dutch-speaking europe ( netherlands and flanders ) , and is also well known in the former dutch colonies . every year he is celebrated in the netherlands , one day before saint nicholas died ( 5 december ) and on ( 6 december ) in belgium . his helper and best friend is black peter . sinterklaas is the basis of the mythical holiday figure of santa claus in the united states . sinterklaas has nothing to do with christmas . christmas will also be celebrated in the netherlands . so santa claus is not the same as sinterklaas ( in the netherlands ) .
