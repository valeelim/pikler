Max Delbrück     max ludwig henning delbrück ( september 4 , 1906 – march 9 , 1981 ) was a german-american biophysicist and nobel laureate . delbrück was one of the most influential people in the movement of physical scientists into biology during the 20th century . delbrück 's big idea was to explore genetics by means of the bacteriophage viruses which infect bacteria . this was important in the early development of molecular biology . delbrück was born in berlin , german empire . trained as a physicist , he got his ph.d. in 1930. he traveled through england , denmark , and switzerland . he met wolfgang pauli and niels bohr , who got him interested in biology . in 1937 , he moved to the united states to pursue his interests in biology , taking up research in the biology division at caltech on genetics of the fruit fly `` drosophila melanogaster '' . while at caltech delbrück became acquainted with bacteria and their viruses ( bacteriophage or 'phage ' ) . delbrück remained in the us during world war ii , teaching physics at vanderbilt university in nashville while pursuing his genetic research . in 1942 , he and salvador luria of indiana university demonstrated that bacterial resistance to virus infection is caused by random mutation and not adaptive change . this research , known as the luria-delbrück experiment , was also significant for its use of mathematics to make quantitative predictions for the results to be expected from alternative models . for that work , they were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1969 , sharing it with alfred hershey .
