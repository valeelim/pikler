Labyrinthodont     labyrinthodont is a term which was used for fossil amphibia . although it is no longer a formal term in taxonomy , it is still useful as an evolutionary grade , a kind of catch-all term . `` labyrinth '' mean a maze and `` dont '' means tooth . labyrinthodonts are often called temnospondyls . the labyrinthodontia is not a clade , because it is not monophyletic . it has been replaced in the classification by more correct terms . the labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the devonian to the lower triassic ( about 390 to 210 million years ago ) . the group is an evolutionary grade ( a polyphyletic or paraphyletic group ) of species which look rather similar . the name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentine and enamel of the teeth , which often fossilise . they are also have a heavily armoured skull roof ( so they also have an even older name `` stegocephalia '' ) , and complex vertebrae . the labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years . although there was much variation , these traits make their fossils distinct and easy to recognise :
