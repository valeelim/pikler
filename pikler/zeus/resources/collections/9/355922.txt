Papunya Tula     papunya tula artists is a co-operative of aboriginal australian artists . it is owned and run by aboriginal people of the western desert . it is famous for its development of the western desert art movement – widely referred to as `` dot painting '' – and is often credited with bringing aboriginal art to the world 's attention . the original group of artists started painting in the town of papunya , but today the company is based in alice springs . the origins of the company go back to 1971. geoffrey bardon , the school teacher at papunya , taught the children to paint a mural using the classical style of body and sand art . historically , paintings and designs are made by aborigines to depict stories and songs about the dreamtime . the co-operative was formed in 1972 by a group of men from bardon 's classes . they painted spiritual designs used in ceremonial art , but using modern instruments ( like acrylic paints on canvas ) . as this style of art started to become famous , many in the aboriginal community criticised the artists for revealing too many secrets from their sacred legends . aborigines of the western desert believe that the knowledge of these things is dangerous ; usually , a person must be initiated first , and this only happens when they are deemed `` ready '' by their community . in response , the artists changed or removed all detailed images of sacred symbols . in all works since then , these images have been hidden or left out completely .
