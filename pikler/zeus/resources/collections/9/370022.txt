Slave Coast     the slave coast is the name of the coastal areas of present togo , benin ( formerly dahomey ) and western nigeria . this is a fertile region of coastal western africa along the bight of benin . in pre-colonial times it was one of the most densely populated parts of the african continent . it was one of the most important places for the atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century . the slave trade became so large in the 18th and 19th centuries that an “ atlantic community ” was formed . slaves went to the new world , mostly to brazil and the caribbean . ports that exported these slaves from africa include ouidah , lagos , aného ( little popo ) , grand-popo , agoué , jakin , porto-novo , and badagry . researchers think that between 2 and 3 million slaves were exported out of this region . they were traded for goods like alcohol and tobacco from the americas and textiles from europe . religions , architectural styles , languages , knowledge , and other new goods were mixed at this time .
