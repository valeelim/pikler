Mute swan     the mute swan ( `` cygnus olor '' ) is a species of swan , and thus a member of the duck , goose and swan family anatidae . it is native to much of europe and asia , and ( as a rare winter visitor ) the far north of africa . it is also an introduced species in north america , australasia and southern africa . measuring 125 to 170 centimetres ( 49 to 67 in ) in length , this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange bill bordered with black . it is recognisable by its pronounced knob atop the bill . when swimming , the mute swan holds its neck in a graceful `` s '' curve with its bill pointing downward . the whooper swans usually carry their bill level with their neck erect . the male frequently arches his secondary wing feathers over his back in an aggressive display posture .
