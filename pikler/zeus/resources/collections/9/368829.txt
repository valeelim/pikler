Programming paradigm     a programming paradigm is a way or style of how computer programs are written . there are four fundamentally different programming paradigms : - object-oriented - imperative - functional - logic programming the models of computation are different ; object-oriented and imperative paradigms use a turing machine , functional programming is based on lambda calculus , and logic programming uses first order logic . today , many programming languages support more than one of the paradigms above . the choice of what paradigm to use to solve a problem is left to the software developer . designers of object-oriented system think of their program as a collection of interacting objects . people who use functional programming can think of it as a number of mathematical functions being applied . different software engineers have different opinions on what paradigm is best to use . this is the same for programming languages . very often , functional programming languages try to keep people from using assignments ; in this view , it is better to use recursion to solve a problem . another example is that of currying , used in functional programming . the idea there is to change a function taking many arguments into a number of functions , each one only taking one argument . these can then be called in turn , to get the same result .
