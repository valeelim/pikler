Lone pair     a lone pair is a group of two electrons that are not used in any bonds between atoms . they are always in the last shell of an atom , the valence shell . together with the electrons used in bonding they make up the total number of valence electrons . they are usually high in energy . a lone pair can be used to form new bonds between molecules . nucleophiles always have a lone pair that is used to attack an electrophile . lone pairs are also important for the shape of a molecule . they take more space around an atom than a bonding electron . lone pairs on a same atom want to be as far away from each other as possible .
