Chicago River     the chicago river is 156 miles long ( 251 km ) and goes through the city of chicago , illinois , including the center of the city ( the chicago loop ) . the river is not long , but it is known for being the reason why chicago became an important place , as the connection between the great lakes and the mississippi valley waterways . the river is the only river in the world to be reversed ( which is , made to flow backwards , in the opposite of its natural direction ) by civil engineering . in the 19th century through civil engineering , the flow of the river was reversed to head toward the mississippi river basin , away from lake michigan . this was done for reasons of sanitation . the chicago river is also noted for the local custom of dyeing it green on st. patrick 's day . the river is controlled for boats or ships going through the river . the river is memorialized , in part , by two horizontal blue stripes on the municipal flag of chicago . the river also serves as inspiration for one of chicago 's symbols : a three-branched , y-shaped symbol ( called the municipal device ) is found on many buildings and other structures throughout chicago ; it represents the three branches of the chicago river .
