Space colonisation     space colonisation is the idea of humans living outside of earth permanently . at present , there are no space colonies . however , many people have put forward ideas and thought about the first space colony . some national space programmes see space colonisation as a long-term goal . building colonies in space would require access to water , food , space , people , building materials , energy , transportation , communications , life support , simulated gravity , radiation protection and money . launching things from earth is expensive , so it is better if the materials come from the place of the colony . possible sites for space colonies include the moon , mars , asteroids and big , free-floating space stations . resources , such as solar energy and water , are available from or on the moon , mars , near-earth asteroids or other planetary bodies . people could use them to build the space colony and live there . mars is the most earth-like planet known , so the colonization of mars may be first . some celestial bodies might be terraformed . this means changing a body 's atmosphere , temperature , surface topography or ecology to be similar to the biosphere of earth , so that humans can live there .
