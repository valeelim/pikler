Multiplexing     multiplexing is the name for an operation or method which combines several signals into one , before that signal is sent over a telecommunications line . at the other end of the line , the combined signals are `` demultiplexed '' , that is , the combination of the signals is undone . there are different ways how this multiplexing can be done : - space division multiplexing : each channel can use its own part of the space exclusively . there are many channels , in different spaces . this is like people talking in different places . if the people talking are far apart , the conversations wo n't interfere . - frequency division multiplexing : different channels use the different frequencies . the sounds bats make use frequencies that humans can not hear . their conversations will therefore not interfere . - time division multiplexing : different channels use different time slots . in amateur radio , there will only be one person speaking at a time . different people who speak at different times do not interfere with each other .
