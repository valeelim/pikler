Physical system     in physics , a physical system is any object or part of an object that can be analysed with the laws of physics . an atom or the water in a lake can both be considered as physical systems . everything outside the system is called the environment , which in the analysis is ignored except for its effects on the system . all matter and energy in the universe could be treated as one big physical system , but often it is much much easier to look at the universe a few particles at a time , and treat these particles as their own quantum systems . there are many many different physical systems that physicists like to study . some examples are : - the earth 's atmosphere - a falling object - an hydraulic pump - the wing of an airplane - a glass of water - a crystal or other solids - the nucleus of an atom - fundamental particles like quarks . physical systems are different to conceptual systems , which study theoretical objects , ideas or concepts ( such as the turing machine ) . related pages . - system
