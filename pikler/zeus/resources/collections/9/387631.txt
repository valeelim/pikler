Substitution reaction     in chemistry a substitution reaction happens when an atom or a group of atoms is replaced by a different one . substitution reactions can be of many different types . in organic chemistry , the main ones are nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution . these take their names from electrophiles and nucleophiles . however , substitution reactions can also happen under other conditions . for example , photochemical reactions ( reactions that use light instead of heat ) are used to put halogens in a molecule . another example is using free radicals . choosing the correct solvent and temperature conditions is very important to make sure that the reaction happens . sometimes an elimination reaction can happen instead . the product of a substitution reaction is often called a substituted molecule . for example , phenol can be called a substituted benzene .
