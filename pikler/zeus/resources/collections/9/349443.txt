Bench press     the bench press is a weight training exercise for the chest muscles and some helping muscles in the shoulders and arms . the most people who have bad form in this exercise will push with the feet to make their back bent and lifted up off the bench . this moves up the stomach area over the chest and helps the lower chest muscles move the weight . this may hurt the low part of the back . good form is to keep the back and shoulders on the bench and not use the low part of the body to help at all . because the weight is directly above the body , a `` spotter '' or helper is used by many people in this exercise . the helper will stand behind the head of the person doing the exercise . if after doing some of the exercise the person doing the exercise can not move the weight , the `` spotter '' will help the person move the weight back up to the starting position by taking hold of the bar and lifting together with the person .
