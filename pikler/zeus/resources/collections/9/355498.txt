Ensatina     ensatina is a genus of lungless salamanders . they are a complex of subspecies of `` ensatina eschscholtzii '' , found in forests in british columbia , washington , oregon , california and baja california , mexico . the `` ensatina '' salamander is a ring species in the mountains around the californian central valley . the complex forms a horseshoe shape around the mountains . though interbreeding can happen between each of the 19 populations around the horseshoe , the `` ensatina eschscholtzii '' subspecies on the western end of the horseshoe can not interbreed with the `` ensatina klauberi '' on the eastern end . it is an illustration of `` nearly all stages in a speciation process '' ( dobzhansky ) . richard highton argued that `` ensatina '' is a case of multiple species and not a continuum of one species . subspecies . - yellow blotched ensatina — `` e. e. croceater '' - monterey ensatina — `` e. e. eschscholtzii '' - large blotched ensatina — `` e. e. klauberi '' - oregon ensatina — `` e. e. oregonensis '' - painted ensatina — `` e. e. picta ''
