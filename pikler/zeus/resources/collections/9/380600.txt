Addition reaction     in organic chemistry an addition reaction happens when two molecules come together to make a bigger one . this can only happen when one of the molecules already has a double or triple bond . these can be carbon-carbon bonds or even carbon-oxygen , carbon-nitrogen and others . one of the two molecules is called the nucleophile , and this is the one that gives the electrons to the other to make the new bond . the other molecule is called the electrophile , and this is the one that gets the electrons . an addition reaction is the opposite of an elimination reaction . common examples of addition reactions are the addition of water across a double bond and the nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl .
