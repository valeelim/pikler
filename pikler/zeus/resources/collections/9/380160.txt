GNU Hurd     gnu hurd is a multiserver kernel with the goal of providing users with as much freedom to do as they wish with the gnu operating system as possible . it was initially intended to provide a free alternative to unix ( gnu stands for `` gnu 's not unix '' ) . the hurd was the intended implementation of the gnu operating system before linux became the kernel of choice for gnu users . the current goal of the hurd project is : [ t ] o create a general-purpose kernel suitable for the gnu operating system , which is viable for everyday use , and gives users and programs as much control over their computing environment as possible . the hurd kernel consists of a microkernel that provides basic kernel services and a collection ( or `` herd '' ) of servers / daemons that provided services that are beyond basic . this design was meant to provide developers with freedom that unix and other unix-like operating systems did not . for example , this design allows developers to program servers in languages other than the one used by the kernel . gnu mach currently is the mircokernel being used in the hurd .
