Tarantula hawk     the tarantula hawk is a type of spider wasp which hunts tarantulas as food for its larvae . the tarantula hawk is any type of spider wasp which is in the genera `` pepsis '' and `` hemipepsis '' in the family pompilidae ( spider wasps ) . most species of tarantula hawks are around 5 cm ( 2 inches ) long , making it the largest type of wasp . they usually have a blue-black body and reddish-orange wings , but some have black wings . the color on their wings tells predators that they are dangerous ( aposematism ) . they have long legs which have hooked claws that are used for grabbing their prey . the sting of a female tarantula hawk can be as long as 7 mm long ; the stinger is said to be the most painful insect sting in the world . when a female tarantula hawk finds a tarantula it stings and paralyzes the tarantula . then the wasp drags the tarantula to her burrow or takes it to a specially made nest , where it lays a single egg on the tarantula 's abdomen . once the egg hatches the larva makes a hole in the tarantula 's abdomen . it then crawls into the tarantula and feeds on the insides . after a few weeks the larva pupates . after a while the wasp turns into an adult and comes out of the tarantula 's abdomen . tarantula hawks are also nectarivores , meaning they eat the nectar of flowers . unlike the females , males do not hunt for tarantulas . instead they feed on the nectar of flowers of milkweeds , western soapberry trees , or mesquite trees , which the females also feed on .
