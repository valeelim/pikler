Vaalbara     vaalbara is the name of earth 's first supercontinent , in the archaean era . vaalbara started to form about 3,600 million years ago ( mya ) . it formed by about 3,100 mya and broke up by 2,500 mya . the name `` vaalbara '' comes from the south african kaapvaal craton and the west australian pilbara craton . these cratons were combined in the vaalbara supercontinent . south africa 's kaapvaal craton and western australia 's pilbara craton are two of the best-preserved archaean cratons on earth . they have remarkably similar early precambrian rocks . identical radiometric ages of 3,470 Â±2 mya have been got from rocky material thrown out by meteorite strikes . similar structures from these two cratons have been dated between 3,500 to 2,700 mya . similar greenstone belts are found at the edges of the superior craton of canada , and across the cratons of the former gondwana and laurasia continents . palaeomagnetic data from rocks in the cratons showed that at 3,870 mya the two cratons could have been part of the same supercontinent . both the pilbara and kaapvaal cratons show extensional faults which were active about the same time during volcanism at the same time as the impact layers were formed .
