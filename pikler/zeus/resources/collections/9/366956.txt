Transfection     transfection is the process of deliberately introducing dna or rna into cells . the word is formed from transformation and infection . the term is used for : 1. transformation of bacterial cells with viral nucleic acids 1. transformation of animals cells in tissue culture with purified dna . the dna is added to the cells ' genome . 1. transformation of cells or embryos with single or double-stranded rna . this causes the building of particular proteins , or the silencing of particular genes . 1. gene therapy using a modified virus as a vector . transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells . transfection with rna molecules produces changes which can not be permanently transmitted down a line of cells . a dna construct is an artificially constructed bit of nucleic acid which is going to be 'transplanted ' into a target tissue or cell . it may include a dna insert , which contains the gene sequence coding for a protein of interest . the dna insert is the heart of the molecular biology vector . this is a general term for a vehicle used to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell . transfection of animal cells usually involves opening temporary pores ( holes ) in the cell membrane , to allow the cells to take up the vector .
