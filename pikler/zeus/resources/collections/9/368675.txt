Student's t-test    student 's t-test a t-test is a statistical hypothesis test . people use it when they want to compare a mean ( average ) of a measurement from one group a to some theoretical , expected value . people also use it when they want to compare the mean ( average ) of a measurement of two groups a and b. they want to decide if the mean in group a is different to the theoretical value or to the mean in group b. for example , pretend there are two groups of people . one group exercises a lot and the other does n't . do the people who exercise tend to live longer than those who do n't ? then the property of interest is the average life time . is the average life time of people who exercise different to the average life time of people who do n't ? a t-test can help answer this question . the t-test is used when the property 's variance in the groups is unknown . when people want to do the t-test they have to calculate the variance from the sample ( the collection of data ) . this calculated variance is almost always different to the true variance in the group . the t-test was created to care about this difference .
