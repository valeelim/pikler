Anonymus Valesianus     anonym [ o ] us valesianus is the name of a text , published by henri valois ( 1603-1676 ) in 1636. the text was published together with res gestae of ammianus marcellinus . the name is misleading : there are two texts , which have nothing in common , except the subject of history . they are labeled anonymus valesianus i and ii . anonymus valesianus i , also called origo constantini talks about the life of constantine the great , roughly the time of 301 to 337 ad . the author is unknown , and was probably pagan . most likely the text was written shortly after the death of the emperor . the author gives a good review of the life , and offers details which can be found in no other text . the text was written around 390 , and is regarded as a reliable source the second text gives a historic overview beginning with the reign of julius nepos . it ends with the death of theodoric the great , roughly 474-526. the author of the second text was probably roman catholic , and the text was written in ravenna , which was very important at the time.the text was written after 526 , probably between 550 and 560. it bears the heading `` item ex libris chronicorum inter cetera '' . the text mostly deals with the reign of the gothic king in italy , theodoric the great . `` ( even though it is ) poorly written ( the text ) is based on a no longer ( existing ) chronicle by the bishop of ravenna , maximianus , a highly ( learned ) and knowledgable scholar '' .
