Leaving group     in chemistry , a leaving group is an atom or molecule that leaves another molecule during a reaction . this reaction can be for example a nucleophilic substitution . in this case the leaving group gets a pair of electrons . some leaving groups are better than others . this is because some atoms or molecules like getting extra electrons . the halides are a good example of good leaving groups . the type of leaving group can change the type of reaction that happens . for example , bad leaving groups make an sn1 reaction more difficult , while they make an sn2 reaction easier .
