Sigma bond     a sigma bond ( σ bond ) is a type of chemical bond . it is the strongest one of the covalent type . in a sigma bond , the atomic orbitals from two atoms which are nearby go one on top of each other . this is different from a pi bond where they touch sideways . this is why a sigma bond is stronger . sigma bonds can involve s , p , d or f orbitals . they must however be of the right symmetry to be able to form the bond . since the σ bond is strong , the bonding orbital is low in energy . this also means that the antibonding orbital σ* is high in energy .
