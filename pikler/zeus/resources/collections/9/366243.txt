Thutmose II     thutmose ii ( sometimes `` thutmosis '' , or `` tuthmosis ii '' , which means `` born of thoth '' ) was the fourth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of egypt . he built some small monuments and began two small military campaigns but did little else during his rule and was probably strongly influenced by his wife , hatshepsut . he ruled from 1493 bc to 1479 bc . thutmose ii 's body was found in the deir el-bahri cache above the mortuary temple of hatshepsut with many other pharaohs . it can be viewed today in the egyptian museum in cairo . thutmose ii was the son of thutmose i and a minor wife , mutnofret . he may married his fully royal half-sister , hatshepsut , in order to secure his kingship . his armies stopped rebellions in nubia and the levant and defeated a group of nomadic bedouins . but these campaigns were led by the king 's generals , and not by thutmose ii himself . this is often seen as evidence that thutmose ii was still a child at his when he became king . thutmose ii fathered neferure with hatshepsut , and a male heir , the famous thutmose iii , by a lesser wife named iset before his death .
