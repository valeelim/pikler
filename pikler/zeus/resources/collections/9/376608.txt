Eureka effect     the eureka or aha ! effect refers to the moment of insight when a puzzling problem is suddenly solved . it is named after the greek polymath archimedes . archimedes was asked by the local king to detect whether a crown was pure gold , or if the goldsmith had added silver . during his trip to the public bath , he noticed how water got displaced when his body sank into the bath . the volume of water displaced equals the volume of the body immersed in the water . he suddenly realized that two objects which weighed the same in air might not weigh the same in water , because the less dense object would displace less water . this is known as archimedes ' principle . archimedes leaped out of a public bath , and ran home naked shouting `` eureka ! '' ( i found it ) . this story is thought by some to be a myth , but archimedes was indeed a most notable inventor . he would certainly have experienced the aha ! effect . there is some research on the aha ! insight . aha ! moments can not be predicted . insight is a psychological term describes the process in problem solving when a previously unsolvable puzzle becomes suddenly clear and obvious . often this transition from not understanding to sudden comprehension is accompanied by an exclamation of joy or satisfaction , an aha ! moment . a person using insight to solve a problem is able to give accurate , clear , all-or-nothing type responses , whereas individuals not using the insight process are more likely to produce partial , incomplete responses .
