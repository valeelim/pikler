Structured settlement     a structured settlement is an insurance or financial arrangement that is negotiated to end a lawsuit . it is a legal agreement through which an insurance company agrees to make regular payments to a specific individual over a period of time . structured settlements created as a way for insurance companies to payout settlements in installments as opposed to large lump sums . structured settlements may benefit injured people whose settlements might result in their owing taxes , by allowing them to reduce or delay tax payments . they may also benefit younger people or disabled people by providing periodic payments of money over an extended period of time . structured settlements require the paper holder ( a name for the person who receives payments from the settlement ) to wait before they will get money , by spreading payments over a number of years . however there are companies offering to buy such a structured settlement for upfront money . for example , a company might offer to buy a settlement that would be paid in 20 yearly payments for a one-time payment of lower value . such financing may need to be approved by judge and the insurance company .
