Epoxide     in organic chemistry , an epoxide is a molecule that has a ring with at least three atoms in total , two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom . these three atoms are bonded , or stuck together , in a small ring . the ring of atoms is shaped like a triangle , with all edges of the same length . because of this small ring , an epoxide is very reactive . epoxides can be made by oxidation of alkenes . there are many ways to do this . usually , a peroxide is used . some ways can even make only one enantiomer of the epoxide . epoxides like to react with nucleophiles . usually , when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile , the first thing it does is break one of its chemical bonds between the oxygen atom and the carbon atom . this makes the triangular ring pop open . with the ring open , the nucleophile gets stuck onto one of the carbon atoms . on the other carbon , the left over oxygen attaches to a hydrogen atom , turning into an alcohol . this is very useful , because it is easy to change an alcohol into many other functional groups .
