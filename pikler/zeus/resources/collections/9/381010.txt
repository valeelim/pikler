The Balcony     the balcony is an 1868 oil painting by the french painter édouard manet . it was exhibited at the paris salon of 1869. the painting depicts four figures . on the left is berthe morisot , who became in 1874 the wife of manet 's brother , eugène . in the centre is the painter jean baptiste antoine guillemet . on the right is fanny claus , a violist . the fourth figure in the background is possibly leon leenhoff , manet 's stepson . it was sold by gustave caillebotte in 1884. it hangs at this time in paris at the musée d'orsay . the painting was inspired by `` the majas at the balcony '' by francisco goya . it was created at the same time and with the same purpose as `` luncheon in the studio '' . the three characters were all friends of manet . they seem to be disconnected from each other . berthe morisot , on the left , looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine , the young violinist fanny claus and the painter antoine guillemet seem to display indifference . the boy in the background is manet 's stepson , léon . just behind the railings , there are a hydrangea and a dog with a ball .
