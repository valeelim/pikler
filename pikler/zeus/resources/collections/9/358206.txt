Wave function     in quantum mechanics , the wave function , usually represented by `` ψ '' , or `` ψ '' , describes the probability of finding an electron somewhere in its matter wave . to be more precise , the `` square '' of the wave function gives the probability of finding the location of the electron in the given area , since the normal answer for the wave function is usually a complex number . the wave function concept was first introduced in the legendary schrödinger equation . the formula for finding the wave function ( i.e. , the probability wave ) , is below : formula_1 where `` i '' is the imaginary number , `` ψ ( x , t ) '' is the wave function , `` ħ '' is the reduced planck constant , `` t '' is time , `` x '' is position in space , `` ĥ '' is a mathematical object known as the `` hamilton operator '' . the reader will note that the symbol formula_2 denotes that the partial derivative of the wave function is being taken . related pages . - schrödinger equation - quantum mechanics - bohr model
