Root (linguistics)    root ( linguistics ) the root in language is either a base word , or a part of a word to which affixes are added . or , it is the part left after affixes have been taken away . technically , it is the smallest unit which carries meaning : it can not be reduced into smaller units . it is the same as a free-standing morpheme . if a root is a whole word , then it is called a `` base word '' . it is the word which stands at the head of a dictionary definition , is the base of a word family . examples : in each case in bold - unhelp < /u/l > fully - react < /u/l > ion - receive < /u/l > - sci < /u/l > ence . this one is interesting because it is so ancient . it is a descendent of the indo-european root scei < /u/l > , meaning `` to cut '' or `` split '' . it comes to us via the latin language .
