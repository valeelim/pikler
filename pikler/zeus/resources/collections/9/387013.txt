Eye colour     eye color is a visible character caused by two factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris , and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris . in humans , the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black . this depends on the amount of melanin in the iris . the appearance of blue , green and hazel eyes result from the rayleigh scattering of light in the iris . a similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky . neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid . eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions , especially for lighter-coloured eyes . the brightly coloured eyes of many birds , reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments , such as pteridines , purines , and carotenoids . the view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect . two main gene loci code for the eye pigment : `` oca2 '' and `` herc2 '' . they sit next to each other on chromosome 15. mutations ( snps ) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour . `` oca2 '' mutations close to the 5â€² regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation . an intron in `` herc2 '' contains the promoter region for `` oca2 '' , affecting its expression .
