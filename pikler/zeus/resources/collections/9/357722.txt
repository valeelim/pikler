Australian Aboriginal astronomy     australian aborigines were some of the first people in the world to develop ideas with astronomy . it is possible that their interpretation of astronomy is the oldest still alive today . studying astronomical subjects – such as the sun , moon , stars and planets – and the way they appeared to move was used as a way to find and explain the relationship between people , nature and the sky . the ideas that came from this contributed to their basic perception of the universe ( their cosmology ) , and still form an important part of traditional culture and knowledge . many legends , art forms , music and ceremonies originate from interpretations of astronomical phenomena and objects in the sky . many aboriginal groups give spiritual or mythological meanings to these things . some groups used their knowledge of the movement of objects across the sky to develop practical tools like calendars . australian aboriginal culture is an oral tradition , so knowledge of astronomy has been passed down through stories , song and dance . a lot of knowledge is kept secret , only passed to those who have been initiated . as in all aspects of aboriginal society , some things are only known to men , other things are only known to women . the earliest written account of aboriginal astronomy was published in 1857. it was written by william edward stanbridge , an englishman who became friends with the boorong people of victoria .
