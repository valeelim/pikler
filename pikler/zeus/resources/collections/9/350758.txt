Atomic physics     atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus . it is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change . this includes ions as well as neutral atoms and , unless otherwise stated , for the purposes of this discussion it should be assumed that the term `` atom '' includes ions . the term `` atomic physics '' is often associated with nuclear power and nuclear bombs , due to the synonymous use of `` atomic '' and `` nuclear '' in standard english . however , physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and nuclear physics , which considers atomic nuclei alone . as with many scientific fields , strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of `` atomic , molecular , and optical physics '' . physics research groups are usually so classified .
