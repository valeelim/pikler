Metalloprotein     a metalloprotein is a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor . a large fraction of all proteins are members of this category , so the number is very large . it is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal . in another estimate , about one quarter to one third of all proteins are need metals to carry out their functions . thus , metalloproteins have many different functions in cells , such as enzymes , transport and storage proteins , and signal transduction proteins .
