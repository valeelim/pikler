Dominican Spanish     dominican spanish is spanish as it is spoken in the dominican republic and by the dominican diaspora . dominican spanish is based on canarian and andalucian dialects from south spain but with some influences from west african languages . the indigenous arawak language left very little influence on the language ; the only influence they left were some words , mainly for foods and names . examples of african-based syntax : - dominican spanish : `` como tu ta ? `` , spanish : `` ¿cómo estás tú ? '' - dominican spanish : `` como tu te llama ? `` , spanish : `` ¿cuál es su nombre ? '' or `` ¿cómo se llama usted ? '' - dominican spanish : `` p'onde ta ? '' or `` onde ta '' , spanish : `` ¿por dónde está eso ? '' or `` ¿por dónde estás ? '' words such as `` mangu '' ( mashed plantains ) , `` kamboumbo '' ( basket for clothes ) , `` guineo '' or `` guinea '' ( banana ) , and many more . note , most of these african words are either igbo or kikongo origins . the most dominant african languages that has had the most influence in the formation of the dominican spanish is the igbo , yoruba , kongo , twi , fon , ewe , mandinga , hausa , wolof etc . with the syntax being based off the yoruba language and mande languages , the phonetics heavily influenced by the kikongo , and the pronouciations of certain words containing some elements of the mandingas and the igbos . most schollars , just as all of the west indies have said that the kikongo language influenced greatly the formation of the dominican spanish .
