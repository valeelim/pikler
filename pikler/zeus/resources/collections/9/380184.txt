Elimination reaction     in organic chemistry , an elimination reaction is when some atoms or group of atoms are taken away from a bigger molecule . usually , a double or a triple bond are made by this reaction . there are two main ways to do an elimination reaction . the first is called e1 . it happens in two steps . if there is a good leaving group in the molecule , it can leave on its own . then , a base or another substance can take away the other group . the second way is called e2 . this happens only in one step . in this case , the base takes away one group while at the same time the leaving group goes away . a common elimination reaction happens with alcohols . if there is strong acid around , a molecule of water can be eliminated to form the double bond .
