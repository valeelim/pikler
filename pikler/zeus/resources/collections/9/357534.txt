Self-determination     the right of nations to self-determination ( from ) , or with less words , self-determination is the idea that nations have the right to choose their sovereignty ( who or what rules them ) and international political status without other countries telling them . most of the world used to be ruled by empires ( really big countries with more than one ethnic group , usually with one group having a lot of power over the others ) , and many of the countries that the empires ruled were considered colonies of the empire , but after the first world war ( 1914-1919 ) , and especially the second world war ( 1929-1945 ) , most of these empires collapsed ( fell apart ) and local populations ( people living in the `` colonies '' native to the area ) began to want independence and their country to be ruled by them , not someone very far away who they thought was mistreating them . lots of nationalist movements arose in these countries , usually in asia , africa , and the middle east , because people usually considered themselves as a separate group than the one who ruled them ( for example , arabs , not british , when the british empire had ruled a lot of arabia ) .
