The Ballet of the Nuns     the ballet of the nuns is the first `` ballet blanc '' and the first romantic ballet . it is an episode in act iii of giacomo meyerbeer 's grand opera , `` robert le diable '' . it premiered in november 1831 at the paris opéra . the choreography ( now lost ) was created by either filippo taglioni or jean coralli . the short ballet tells of deceased nuns rising from their tombs in a ruined cloister to seduce the knight , robert le diable . at the end of the ballet , the white-clad nuns return to their tombs . the ballet was created because officials at the paris opéra wanted to demonstrate the building 's newly installed gas lighting . the lighting was capable of creating ghastly effects . `` the ballet of the nuns '' starred marie taglioni as the abbess helena . although opening night was marred with a few mishaps , taglioni made her indelible mark on the ballet world in the role . she became known for her ethereal qualities and her moral purity , and is one of the most celebrated ballerinas in history .
