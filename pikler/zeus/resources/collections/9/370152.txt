Anal stricture     anal stricture ( also called `` anal stenosis '' ) is a medical problem that is not common ; it may be `` congenital '' ( a baby is born with a medical problem ) , but usually if it does happen it is after `` anorectal surgery '' , which is surgery in the area of the rectum and anus . this may cause `` stricture '' ( when a passage in the body becomes too narrow ) of the anal canal , which leads to hard or painful bowel movements . when anal stenosis does occur it is usually after a `` hemorrhoidectomy , '' which is the surgical removal of hemorrhoids ; this is the cause in 90 % of cases of anal stenosis . mild stenosis can be treated with stool softeners or fiber ( which come from plant foods ) supplements ( in pill or powder form ) . when the narrowing of the anal canal is not too much , an operation called a `` sphincterotomy '' can be done to correct the problem . this is an operation done on the internal anal sphincter muscle , a round muscle inside the anal canal . in cases where the anal canal becomes very narrow , an operation called an `` anoplasty '' is done . this is `` reconstructive surgery '' ( also known as `` plastic surgery '' ) of the anus .
