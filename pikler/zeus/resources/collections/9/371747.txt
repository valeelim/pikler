Courtship in animals     courtship in animals is the behaviour by which different species select their partners for reproduction . usually , the male starts the courtship , and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his `` performance '' . many animals have mate-selection courtship rituals . animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching , vocalizations , or displays of beauty or fighting prowess . one animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the bowerbird , whose male builds a `` bower '' of collected objects . another is the great crested grebe , whose courtship dances were first described by julian huxley . in cases like the great crested grebe , the pairs form life ( or at least long-lasting ) partnerships . in that case , there are also pair-bonding dances throughout the mating season , and through the whole period of raising the young . if pairs get separated , there are exceptionally vigorous dances when they come together . there are a number of `` dance routines '' which occur in the different circumstances of life . all this behaviour is inherited , though the individual bird remembers the place and the partner permanently .
