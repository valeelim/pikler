Mexican standoff     a mexican standoff is a three person duel . in a two person duel the person who shoots first has the advantage . in a mexican duel it is different . if person a shoots b , then person c has the advantage as they can shoot person a while they are busy . so in a mexican standoff nobody wants to be the first one to shoot . as well as this , nobody can take the risk of backing down . the term is often used to describe a confrontation between two equals , where neither side will gain a winning advantage by being the first to shoot , but neither side can risk backing down . the cold war between the usa and the soviet union is often described as being a mexican standoff , with neither country prepared to be the first to risk using nuclear weapons . the idea of a mexican standoff is often used as part of the plot in movies .
