Supervised learning     in machine learning , supervised learning is the task of inferring a function from labelled training data . the results of the training are known beforehand , the system simply learns , how to get to these results correctly . usually , such systems work with vectors . they get the training data and the result of the training as two vectors , and produce a `` classifier '' . usually , the system uses inductive reasoning to generalize the training data .
