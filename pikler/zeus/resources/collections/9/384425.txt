Gamma function     in mathematics , the gamma function ( γ ( `` z '' ) ) is an extension of the factorial function to all complex numbers except negative , integers . the argument of the function is shifted down by one . this means that if n is a positive integer the gamma function is defined for all complex numbers . but it is not defined for negative integers and zero . for a complex number whose real part is not a negative integer , the function is defined by : this improper integral is convergent . legendre first used the notation γ ( `` z '' ) . if the real part of the complex number '' z '' is positive ( re ( `` z '' ) > 0 ) , then the integral this means that the gamma function also has a duplication formula : this formula is a special case of the multiplication theorem a property of the function is that : a famous value of the function at a non-integral point is : this is found if we set '' z '' = 1/2 in the reflection or duplication formulas . if we simply make the substitution `` u = √t '' in the integral definition of the gamma function , we get a gaussian integral . in general , for non-negative integer values of '' n '' we have :
