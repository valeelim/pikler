C. Lloyd Morgan     conwy lloyd morgan , frs , usually known as lloyd morgan , ( 6 february 1852 â€“ 6 march 1936 ) was a british ethologist and psychologist . he is best remembered for the experimental approach to animal psychology now known as 'morgan 's canon ' , which is a specialised form of occam 's razor . his idea played a role in the later growth of behaviourism in psychology . lloyd morgan was born in london and studied at the royal school of mines and under t.h . huxley . he taught in cape town , but in 1884 joined the staff of university college , bristol as professor of geology and zoology . he quickly became interested in the field he called 'mental evolution ' , the borderland between intelligence and instinct . in 1901 he became the college 's first professor of psychology and education . in 1909 lloyd morgan became the first vice-chancellor of bristol university . he held the office for a year , then was professor of psychology and ethics until his retirement in 1919. under lloyd 's canon , animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way . for example , an animal should be considered conscious only if there is no other explanation for its behaviour . where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes , it might be explained by trial and error learning . an example is the skilful way in which his terrier tony opened the garden gate , easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour . lloyd morgan , however , had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response , and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it .
