MV Empire Windrush     the empire windrush arrived at tilbury on 22 june 1948 , carrying 493 passengers from jamaica wishing to start a new life in the united kingdom . the passengers ( including one stowaway ) were the first large group of west indian immigrants to the uk after the second world war . when the people from the `` windrush '' arrived at port , they were faced with discrimination and racism because of the colour of their skin . some people now call the `` windrush '' a new journey for them as they all went through the racism , but in the end , came out just as equal as everyone else . before 1948 , the ship , under the name of `` monte rosa '' , had been used for cruises in pre-war germany , and then as a german troopship and prisoner transport ship , before being captured by the british and taken as a war prize . she continued to be used as a british troopship after 1948 , but sank in the mediterranean sea in march 1954 after a sudden and catastrophic fire in her engine room , just off the coast of algeria .
