Virgo Supercluster     the virgo supercluster ( `` virgo sc '' ) or local supercluster is the large cluster of galaxies that contains the virgo cluster and the local group . at least 100 galaxies and clusters are in it . the diameter of virgo sc is 33 megaparsecs ( 110 million light-years ) . it is one of millions of superclusters in the observable universe . when the first large sample of nebulae was published by william and john herschel in 1863 , it was seen that there is a marked excess of nebular fields in the constellation virgo ( near the north galactic pole ) . in the 1950s , it was suggested that this excess was a large-scale galaxy-like structure , a `` local supercluster '' . debate went on during the 1960s and 1970s as to whether the local supercluster ( ls ) was actually a structure or a chance alignment of galaxies . the issue was resolved with the large redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 1980s , which showed a flattened concentration of galaxies along the supergalactic plane . in 1982 r. brent tully showed it consists of two components : a flattened disk with two-thirds of the supercluster 's luminous galaxies , and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining one-third .
