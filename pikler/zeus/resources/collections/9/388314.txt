Parcae     in roman mythology , the parcae ( singular , parca ) were the female personifications of destiny . they are often called the fates in english . their greek equivalent were the moirai . they controlled the `` thread of life '' of every mortal and immortal . even the gods feared the parcae . the names of the three parcae were : - nona ( greek equivalent `` clotho '' ) , who spun the thread of life on her spindle ; - decima ( greek `` lachesis '' ) , who measured the thread of life ; - morta ( greek `` atropos '' ) , who cut the thread of life and chose the way a person would die . the earliest known documents about these deities are three small stelae `` ( cippi ) '' . they were found near ancient lavinium shortly after world war ii . they have the inscription : `` neuna fata , neuna dono , parca maurtia dono '' the names of two of the three roman parcae are recorded ( `` neuna '' = nona , `` maurtia '' = morta ) and connected to the concept of `` fata '' . one of the sources for the parcae is `` metamorphoses '' by ovid , ii 654 , v 532 , viii 452 , xv 781 .
