Hyperbola     a hyperbola is a type of conic section . like the other three types of conic sections - parabolas , ellipses , and circles - it is a curve formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane . a hyperbola is created when the plane intersects both halves of a double cone , creating two curves that look exactly like each other , but open in opposite directions . this occurs when the angle between the axis of the cone and the plane is less than the angle between a line on the side of the cone and the plane . hyperbolas can be found in many places in nature . for example , an object in open orbit around another object - where it never returns - can move in the shape of a hyperbola . on a sundial , the path followed by the tip of the shadow over time is a hyperbola . one of the most well-known hyperbolas is the graph of the equation formula_1 . the two disconnected curves that make up a hyperbola are called arms or branches . the two points where the branches are closest together are called the vertices . the line between these two points is called the `` transverse axis '' or `` major axis '' . the midpoint of the transverse axis is the `` center '' of the hyperbola .
