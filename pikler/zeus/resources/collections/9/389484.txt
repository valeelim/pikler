Maximum and minimum     in mathematics , the maximum and minimum of a function are the largest and smallest value that the function takes at a given point . together they are known as the extrema ( singular : extremum ) . minimum means the least you can do of something . for example , if the minimum amount of dollars you must pay for something is seven , then you can not pay six dollars or less ( you must pay at least seven ) . you can do more than the minimum , but no less . maximum means the most you can have of something . for example , if the maximum amount of oranges you can juggle is five , you can not juggle more than five oranges . you can do the maximum or less . for a differentiable function formula_1 , if formula_2 is an extreme value for the set of all values formula_3 , and if formula_4 is in the interior of the domain of formula_1 , then formula_4 is a critical point , by fermat 's theorem .
