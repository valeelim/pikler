Honey War     the honey war was a bloodless border dispute in the 1830s between iowa ( first as a part of wisconsin territory , then iowa territory ) and missouri over their border . the honey war was caused by a disagreement over a wide piece of land covering the entire border ( see map ) . the disagreement was caused because 3 things were not easy to understand : the missouri constitution 's part about borders , the survey of the louisiana purchase , and treaties with the native americans . the united states supreme court ended the dispute in iowa 's favor . it said that the almost-straight border of iowa would follow the des moines river south for about until it reached the mississippi river near keokuk . during the war , the state militias faced each other , a missouri sheriff collecting taxes in iowa was arrested , and three honey trees were cut down . references . - `` state of missouri v. state of iowa , 48 u.s. 660 ( 1949 ) . - everett , derek r.
