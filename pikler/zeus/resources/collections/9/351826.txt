Nestlé     nestlé is the world 's largest food producer , by revenue . it was formed in the 1950s , when two companies merged . at the start in the 1860s , the company produced soluble milk that could be given to infants and babies . from about the 1930s , nestlé also produced soluble coffee . in 2010 , nestle 's revenue was about 109 billion swiss francs , and its net profit was about 32 billion swiss francs . food that is made to be used instead of breast milk is known as infant formula . there are many laws that regulate how infant formula products should be marketed . nestlé 's soluble milk is a product that falls under this definition . in the 1970s , nestlé marketed its soluble milk to mothers with infants . this was also done in developing countries . the marketing campaign led to a boycott known as nestlé boycott , which is still ongoing . in 1981 , the world health organisation published a guideline for advertising infant formula products . nestlé is being critizised because supposedly it does not respect this code of conduct . nestlé 's policy states that breast-milk is the best food for infants , and that women who can not or choose not to breast feed need an alternative to ensure that their babies are getting the nutrition they need . the problem is that stop breastfeeding will not be able to start again , after some time . they will become dependent on infant formula products to feed their babies .
