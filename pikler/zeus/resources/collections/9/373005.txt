Mantidfly     mantidflies are insects in the family mantispidae . they are small to moderate-sized insects in the order neuroptera . there are many genera with around 400 species worldwide , especially in the tropics and subtropics . only 5 species of `` mantispa '' occur in europe . some mantidflies are wasp mimics , but most are brownish with green , yellow and sometimes red hues . they get their name from their mantis-like appearance , as their spiny `` raptorial '' ( raptor-like ) front legs are modified to catch small insect prey and are very similar to the front legs of mantids . the adults are predatory insects that are often nocturnal , and are sometimes attracted by porch lights . they have four membranous wings which may sometimes be patterned ( especially in wasp mimicking species ) but are usually clear . adult mantidflies are predators of suitably sized insects , which they catch as mantids do . mantidflies are active hunters , but as with other neuroptera , they are cumbersome fliers . their larvae are either parasitoids or predators . subfamily symphrasinae larvae are parasitoids on bee , wasp or scarab beetle larvae . larvae of the subfamily calomantispinae are predators of small arthropods .
