Arranged marriage     an arranged marriage is when a couple are decided to wed by people other than themselves . in most cases , this is decided by their parents or other elders in their families , but can also be decided by religious figures , teachers , close friends of the family or others . it is mostly practised in southern asian , african , east and middle eastern cultures today , and in east and southeast asian cultures to some extent . arranged marriages are not just an alliance between two individuals , it is an alliance between families . unlike forced marriages , partners are usually only suggested to the single person in question . they can accept or refuse . many people in western cultures disagree with arranged marriages . it is the social norm in the west to form a deep , emotional bond with someone before marriage is even considered . however , recent studies have shown that although arranged marriages start with a low level of love ( using the american rubin love scale ) , they usually have twice the amount of love as non-arranged marriages within 10 years . whereas in non-arranged marriages the level of love seems to become less as time goes on .
