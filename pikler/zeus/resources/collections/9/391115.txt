Micropaleontology     micropaleontology ( also sometimes spelled as micropalaeontology ) is the branch of paleontology that studies microfossils . microfossils are fossils generally not larger than four millimeters , and commonly smaller than one millimeter . a microscope is used to study them . every kingdom of organisms is represented in the microfossil record . microfossils can provide important information about the ecology in the past . people who study micropaleontology are called micropaleontologists . taxonomy and statistics are important parts of micropaleontology . microfossils are most common in sediment that forms beneath water , particularly ocean water or lake water . very old microfossils may be found in rock . special techniques are used to separate microfossils from rock . for example , the shells of diatoms and some other organisms are made of silica ; other materials in the rock can sometimes be removed with acid , leaving just the silica shells . micropaleontology can be divided into four areas of study . the different areas of study use different techniques to separate the microfossils . this is because the microfossils are made of different minerals :
