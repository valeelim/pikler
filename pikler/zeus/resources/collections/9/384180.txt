Thioether     a thioether is a molecule with the group r-s-r. the first atom in r is a carbon . thioether take their name from ethers . they have a sulfur instead of an oxygen atom between the two r. thioethers can have very bad smells like thiols . they can also be called sulfides . the c-s-c bond is at nearly 90 degrees . thioethers are important in biology . they are present in some amino acids . petroleum has many thioethers in it as well . thioethers can be made in the laboratory by the reaction of a thiol with a base and an electrophile . they can do many interesting reactions . it is easy to oxidise them to sulfoxides and then sulfones . dimethyl sulfide is the simplest thioether . it is used in important reactions like the swern oxidation . this makes aldehydes starting from alcohols .
