Chancellor (education)    chancellor ( education ) a chancellor is a leader of a university or a college . this title is mainly used in the commonwealth nations . in other countries , such as the united states , it is more common to call him/her the university president . the chancellor is often just a ceremonial figure . this means he or she does not make many decisions inside the university . he/she is just a person who is chosen to represent the university at official events and with other organizations . in this case , the chancellor might not even live close to the university or take part in meetings there . for example , at the university of cambridge the chancellor is a person who has done something important in his life , and is in some way connected to the university . prince philip , duke of edinburgh was the chancellor at cambridge for 36 years . the vice-chancellor of a university is instead the chief executive . he/she is the one that makes all the decisions , goes at regular meetings and has the day-to-day duties to do . the vice-chancellor is often very closely linked to the university : for example , he/she might be a fellow there , who decides to take on additional responsibilities . the vice-chancellor might also represent the university at important events if the chancellor is not available .
