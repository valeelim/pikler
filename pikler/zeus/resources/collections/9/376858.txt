List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients     the medal of honor was first presented in the american civil war . president abraham lincoln signed a bill creating the medal . when it started it was for the united states navy . it was signed on december 21 , 1861. it was `` to be bestowed upon such petty officers , seamen , landsmen , and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamanlike qualities during the present war . '' another law was created to include the united states army . that law was signed by the president on july 12 , 1862. while the medal of honor is now the highest military decoration attainable by a member of the united states armed forces , during the civil war , it was the `` only '' one . this means it was often earned for reasons that would not meet modern criteria . for example , secretary of war edwin m. stanton promised a medal of honor to every man in the 27th maine volunteer infantry regiment who extended his enlistment . 311 men in the unit accepted . because there was no official list of their names , the war department issued 864. one for each man in the unit . in 1916 , a group of five retired generals reviewed army awards and recommended that these 864 and others be revoked .
