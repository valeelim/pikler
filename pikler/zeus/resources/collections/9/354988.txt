French Cathedral, Berlin    french cathedral , berlin the first parts of the actual `` french church '' were built from 1701 to 1705 for the huguenot ( calvinist ) community . at that time , huguenots made up about 25 % of berlin 's population . the `` french church '' was modelled after the destroyed huguenot temple in charenton-saint-maurice , france . in 1785 carl von gontard modified the church and built - wall to wall next to it - the domed tower , which - together with the french-speaking congregants - earned the church its naming . the domed tower is technically no part of the church , there is no access between church and tower , because both buildings have different owners . the tower , similar to that of deutscher dom , was simply built to give the gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design . the church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop . the domed tower , which is a viewing platform open to visitors , provides a panoramic view of berlin . a restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall . the tower also contains the huguenot museum of berlin .
