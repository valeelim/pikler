Naturalism (arts)    naturalism ( arts ) naturalism in art refers to the depiction of realistic objects in a natural setting . the realist movement of the 19th century advocated naturalism in reaction to the stylized and idealized depictions of subjects in romanticism , but many painters have used a similar approach over the centuries . one example of naturalism is the artwork of american artist william bliss baker , whose landscape paintings are considered some of the best examples of the naturalist movement . another example is the french albert charpin , from the barbizon school , with his paintings of sheep in their natural settings . naturalism began in the early renaissance , and developed itself further throughout the renaissance , such as with the florentine school . naturalism is a type of art that pays attention to very accurate and precise details , and portrays things as they are . some writers restrict the terms `` naturalism '' and `` realism '' for use as labels for period styles of the middle and late nineteenth century in europe and america , thus making available the terms `` naturalism '' and `` realism , '' all lowercase , for tendencies of art of any period so long as the works strive for an accurate representation of the visible world . thus , `` naturalism '' is tied to a time and place , whereas `` naturalism '' is timeless . as well as a major turning point in art .
