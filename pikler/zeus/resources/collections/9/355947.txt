Matter wave     in quantum mechanics , a branch of physics , a matter wave is when you think of matter as a wave . the concept of matter waves was first introduced by louis de broglie . matter waves are hard to visualize , because we are used to thinking of matter as physical object . de broglie revolutionized quantum mechanics by producing the equation for matter waves . based on the fact that light has a wave-particle duality , de broglie showed that matter might exhibit wave-particle duality as well ( simply meaning that matter is made of both particles and waves ) . basing his formula on earlier formulas , he arrived at the equation below . formula_1 where λ is the wavelength of the object , `` h '' is planck 's constant , `` m '' is the mass of the object , and `` v '' is the velocity of the object . an alternate but correct version of this formula is formula_2 where `` p '' is the momentum . ( momentum is equal to mass times velocity ) . these equations merely say that matter exhibits a particle-like nature in some circumstances , and a wave-like characteristic at other times . erwin schrödinger created an advanced equation based on this formula and the bohr model , known as the schrödinger equation .
