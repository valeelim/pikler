Rate-determining step     in a chemical reaction the slowest step is called the rate-determining step . this is the step for which the transition state has the highest energy . it can be thought of as the most difficult step to go through . it is also the step that must be used to calculate the activation energy . knowing which step is rate-determining is very important when studying a reaction mechanism . this is because if this step is changed the reaction can go much faster . this can be done for example by using a different reagent or changing the temperature or pressure . changing the conditions for any other step of the mechanism will not change the overall speed of the reaction at all . in the rate equation , which is an equation to calculate the speed of the reaction from the concentration of molecules , usually the only step that is important is the rate-determining one .
