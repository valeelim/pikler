Five color theorem     the five color theorem is a theorem from graph theory . it states that any plane which is separated into regions , such as a map , can be colored with no more than five colors . it was first stated by alfred kempe in 1890 , and proved by percy john heawood eleven years later . kempe also tried to prove it , but his proof failed . there are two restrictions which are placed on the maps : first , a country must be contiguous , there must be no exclaves , and secondly , countries that only touch in one point can be colored with the same color . there is also a four color theorem , which is stronger , and much more difficult to prove .
