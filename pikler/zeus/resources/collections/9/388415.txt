Stall (flight)    stall ( flight ) a stall is what happens when an aerofoil can not make enough lift to keep the aircraft in level flight . stalling is risky and can be dangerous during low-level flying . the stall is most likely to happen because of low air speed . to compensate for a decrease in air speed , for example , a pilot may raise the nose of the aircraft subsequently increasing angle of attack , which may increase lift coefficient and keep the same lift . however , after a critical angle of attack is passed ( often around 16 degrees ) the lift stops increasing and actually collapses , causing a stall . the critical angle of attack will always stall the aircraft . it does not matter whether the aircraft is going fast or slowly . the signs of the developing stall are : - low air speed , - high nose position , - less effective controls , - light buffet ( shaking ) in the stick and rudder pedals . the signs of a full stall are : - heavy buffet in the controls , - nose drops , - the aircraft descends ( falls ) . there is the chance of entering a spin if the aircraft controls are not coordinated .
