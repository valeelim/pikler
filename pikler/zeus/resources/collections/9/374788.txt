Bengali nationalism     bengali nationalism is the political expression of ethno-national consciousness of the bengali people . these people live in the region of bengal . the region 's territory is divided between bangladesh and the indian state of west bengal . the bengali language movement and its fallout had created a lot of cultural and political hostility between the two parts of a united pakistan . despite making up a majority of the pakistani population , bengalis were only a small part of pakistan 's military , police and civil services . ethnic and socio-economic discrimination against bengali people in east pakistan made them angry . because west pakistanis were influenced by perso-arabic culture , they saw bengali culture as too closely associated with hindu culture . one of the first groups demanding the independence of east pakistan was the swadhin bangal biplobi parishad ( free bengal revolutionary council ) . the restoration of a sovereign and independent state of west bengal as existed for several centuries prior to the advent of the british raj . the holding of a plebiscite in the western part of bengal to determine whether the nationalists bengali people wish to remain within the indian union under a distant and non caring nation or not . the bengalis were not asked whether they wished to join the dominion of india in 1947 ; it is hence imperative that this long overdue plebiscite be conducted now . the setting up a bengali parliament and the holding of elections in the bengal region of east india to determine the leaders of an independence west bengal state , the cessation of the incredible looting and pillaging of both territories or greater bangladesh by the corrupt and criminal mind of new delhi government . this can only be achieved by means of the establishment of a free state government based in kolkata in control of its own financial resources .
