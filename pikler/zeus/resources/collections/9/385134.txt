Thial     a thial , or thioaldehyde , is any molecule with the group rc ( s ) h. it is like an aldehyde with the oxygen atom changed with a sulfur . the sulfur has a double bond to carbon . it also keeps two lone pairs . thials are very reactive because they are very good electrophiles . it is difficult to make one , because they will react with themselves as soon as they are formed . they can do diels-alder reactions very quickly . however , if bulky r groups are used , the thial might be more stable . if the h is changed with another r group , then the molecule is called a thioketone . these are more stable .
