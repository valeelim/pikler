'' she was widely criticized for her militant tactics , but her work helped to achieve women 's suffrage in britain . after her husband died in 1898 , pankhurst founded the women 's social and political union ( wspu ) , an organisation dedicated to `` deeds , not words '' . the group became infamous when its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers . pankhurst , her daughters , and other wspu activists were sentenced to repeated prison sentences , where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions . as pankhurst 's oldest daughter christabel took the helm of the wspu , antagonism between the group and the government grew . eventually arson became a common tactic among wspu members , and more moderate organisations spoke out against the pankhurst family . in 1913 several prominent individuals left the wspu , among them pankhurst 's daughters adela and sylvia . the family rift never healed .
