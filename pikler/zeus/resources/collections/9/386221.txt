Phenol     phenol is the organic compound with formula choh . it is a white solid . it has an oh group ( hydroxyl group ) bonded to a benzene ring . it is an alcohol . because the aromatic group attracts electrons , it is quite acidic . phenol is produced from petroleum . it is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products . it is also used in detergents and herbicides . phenol has a pka of about 10. for normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. however , phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids . the reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion . phenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well . this is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile . because the lone pair is so high in energy however , sometimes phenol reacts too many times . phenol was first discovered in 1834. it was found as a product of burning coal . one of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery . it is still used today in some analgesics . during the second world war , phenol was also used by the nazis . they used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people .
