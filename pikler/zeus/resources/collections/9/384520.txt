Fertilisation of Orchids     fertilisation of orchids is a book by charles darwin the book was published on 15 may 1862 under the full title `` on the various contrivances by which british and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects , and on the good effects of intercrossing '' . darwin 's previous book , `` on the origin of species '' , had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised . this new idea was explored in detail for orchids . the field studies and practical scientific investigations were initially a recreation for darwin , a relief from the drudgery of writing . the work developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments , and he was helped by his family , friends , and a wide circle of correspondents . the book was his first detailed demonstration of natural selection . it explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the co-evolution of orchids and insects . the view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation . it influenced botanists , and revived interest in the long neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers . it supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation . although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low , it established darwin as a leading botanist . `` orchids '' was the first in a series of books on his investigations into plants .
