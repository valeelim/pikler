Riemann sphere     the riemann sphere is a mathematical model of the extended complex plane . the model is named after bernhard riemann . the extended complex plane is the plane of the complex numbers , plus a point at infinity . with this model , this point at infinity is `` close '' to very large numbers in the same way zero is `` close '' to very small ones . the extended complex numbers are useful for complex analysis : in certain cases , the division by zero is `` well-behaved '' , in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity . with this model , it is possible to change certain functions , so that they become continuous , which simplifies calculation . in geometry , the riemann sphere is a simple example of a riemann surface . it is also one of the simplest complex manifolds .
