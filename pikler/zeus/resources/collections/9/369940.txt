Tiger Palpatja     tiger palpatja ( born about 1920 – died 16 april 2012 ) was an australian aboriginal artist from the aṉangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara lands . tiger was born around 1920 ( though the exact year is not known ) . he was born in the bush , at a rockhole called piltati , which is close to what is now nyapaṟi in north-west south australia . his family were pitjantjatjara , and they lived a traditional , nomadic life in the bushland around piltati . when he was a teenager , tiger 's family settled at ernabella , which at the time was a presbyterian mission and a sheep station . tiger grew up on the mission , and learned to speak a little english in school there . he eventually got married to a woman named nyalapanytja , and they lived in ernabella for many years . tiger worked on the station , shearing sheep and building fences . in the 1970s , tiger and his family moved to amaṯa , closer to his homeland . when he got older , tiger became a `` ngangkaṟi '' ( traditional healer ) , an important and respected role in traditional pitjantjatjara communities . in 1997 , the women at amaṯa began a community art centre , originally called minymaku arts . the word `` minymaku '' means `` women 's '' , and they called it this because , at the time , pitjantjatjara men did not like to paint . after several men began painting in the early 2000s , the centre 's name was changed to tjala arts .
