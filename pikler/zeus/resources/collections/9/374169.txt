Enantiomer     in chemistry , an enantiomer is a molecule that looks exactly like another one when viewed in a mirror . the subject of mirror-image chemicals is known as chirality . if you try to put the two molecules on top of each other , they will not be the same ( they will not superimpose ) . this is because they have one chiral centre . it is important that they only have one , otherwise the two molecules are called diastereoisomers . both enantiomers of a molecule have the same basic properties . for example , they have the same boiling point and nmr spectrum . therefore they are difficult to separate . it is sometimes very important to separate them because in some drug molecules one enantiomer might have the right effect but the other might be dangerous . one famous example is thalidomide : one enantiomer of the molecule causes birth defects .
