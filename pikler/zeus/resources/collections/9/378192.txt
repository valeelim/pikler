Cao Dai     cao dai ( also caodaism or caodaiism ) is a new religious movement founded in vietnam . it mixes ideas from other religions . cao đài is a syncretistic , monotheistic religion officially established in the city of tây ninh , southern vietnam in 1926. the religion combines buddhism , christianity , taoism , confucianism and islam . the full name of the religion is đại đạo tam kỳ phổ độ ( great religion of the third period of revelation and salvation ) . cao dai uses ethical precepts from confucianism , occult practices from taoism , theories of karma and rebirth from buddhism , and a hierarchical organization ( including a pope ) from christianity . caodaiists ( believers of cao dai ) believe that the first disciples of the religion , ngô văn chiêu , cao quỳnh cư , phạm công tắc and cao hoài sang spoke to god and god spoke to them . god told them to establish a new religion that would commence the third era of religious amesty . because of this , caodaiist credit god for finding their religion . the ultimate goal of a caodaist is to rejoin with god the father , in heaven and to break away from the cycle of rebirth and death . women can only wear white dress as they have to be pure whereas men can wear coloured clothing once they reach higher in the religion . in the daily ceremony , the who women in the choir sing the bible in an accent that is difficult to understand and they are not allowed to marry .
