Red-eyed tree frog     the red-eyed tree frog ( `` agalychnis callidryas '' ) is a species of tree frogs . red-eyed tree frogs spend most of their time on large tropical leaves . they are not poisonous , and rely on camouflage to protect themselves . during the day , they stay still , cover their blue sides with their back legs , tuck their bright feet under their stomachs , and shut their red eyes . so they look almost completely green , and are well hidden amongst the leaves . the large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour . when a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator , it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator . the sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator , giving the frog a chance to flee . they are active at night . they like to eat small insects . during mating , the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process . the female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs . the male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released .
