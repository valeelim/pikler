Amphiuma     amphiuma is a genus of aquatic salamanders . they are the only genus still living in the family amphiumidae . they are sometimes called `` conger eels '' or `` congo snakes '' , which is not correct . amphiumas have one of the largest amounts of dna in the living world , around 25 times more than a human . amphiumas have a long body . they are generally grey-black in color . they do have legs but they are very small . amphiumas can be up to long , their legs are only up to about . it is because of this that they are often mistaken for eels or snakes . they also do not have eyelids or a tongue . female amphiumas lay their eggs in wet mud . they then stay coiled around them for about five months , until they hatch . the larvae have external gills . after about four months these external gills disappear and the lungs begin to work . amphiumas live in the southeastern part of the united states . in the past they have lived in more areas . fossils from the pleistocene time show that they once lived in europe .
