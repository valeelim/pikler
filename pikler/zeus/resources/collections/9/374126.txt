Dyke (geology)    dyke ( geology ) a dyke ( or dike ) in geology is a type of later vertical rock between older layers of rock . technically , it is any geologic body which cuts across : - flat wall rock structures , such as bedding . - massive rock formations , usually igneous in origin . dikes can therefore be either pushed in between ( intrusive ) or laid down ( sedimentary ) in origin . the most usual thing that happens is that later volcanic activity pushes lava through strata which were laid down earlier in a sedimentary fashion , or through earlier igneous rocks . on the isle of arran , for example , there are hundreds of igneous dykes giving rise to the term dyke swarm . alternatively , sedimentary rocks can be laid down in vertical gaps between strata . or , after underwater earthquakes , gaps caused by the earthquake can be filled in with breccia , that is , broken rocks . dykes are a common , almost universal , feature of the older palaeozoic rocks . another type of intrusion is the sill , where later rock is formed between older layers , not through them .
