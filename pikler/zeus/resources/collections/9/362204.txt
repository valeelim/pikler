Cartesian product     in mathematics , sets can be used to make new sets . suppose we have two sets `` a '' and `` b '' . then the cartesian product of `` a '' with `` b '' is written as `` a Ã— b '' and is the set of all ordered pairs whose first element is a member of `` a '' and whose second element is a member of `` b '' . for example , let `` a '' = { 1 , 2 , 3 } and `` b '' = { a , b } . then :
