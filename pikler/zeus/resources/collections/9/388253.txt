Cyanosis     cyanosis is a medical problem . when a person has cyanosis , their skin and mucous membranes turn blue or purple . cyanosis is a sign that the cyanotic ( blue ) parts of the body are not getting enough blood and oxygen . this can happen because there is not enough oxygen in the blood . it can also happen when small blood vessels in the body get smaller because of a medical problem ( this is called vasoconstriction ) . usually cyanosis is first seen in the extremities ( the parts of the body that are farthest away from the heart ) . usually the first parts of the body to become cyanotic are the fingertips ( especially under the fingernails ) , the toes , the lips , the tip of the nose , and the earlobes . as the body goes longer without oxygen , more of the body becomes cyanotic .
