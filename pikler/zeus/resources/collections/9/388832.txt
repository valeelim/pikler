MÃ¡ni     mani is a god in norse mythology . he was made when the sparks of the realm of fire were collected . the other gods were not pleased with mani and his sister sol . so the gods made them ride in carts . the purpose of the siblings being in the carts was to guide the moon and sun . the reason for the waxing and waning moons is because mani took two kids so they would cover parts of the moon . the reason for lunar eclipses is hati ( the offspring of fenrir who is to chase mani ) getting close to mani . at ragnarok , hati will finally consume mani .
