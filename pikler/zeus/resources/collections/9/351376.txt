Quartzite     quartzite is a hard metamorphic rock . it is formed when sandstone is squeezed and heated under a chain of mountains . although pure quartzite is white , it usually occurs in shades of pink and red . this happens when it contains some iron oxide ( feo ) . other colours , such as yellow and orange , are due to other mineral impurities . when sandstone is changed to quartzite , the individual quartz grains and cement material recrystallizes . most of the original texture of the sandstone is destroyed by the metamorphism . minor amounts of cementing materials , iron oxide , silica , carbonate and clay , often move when this is happening . it causes streaks and lens shapes to form in the quartzite .
