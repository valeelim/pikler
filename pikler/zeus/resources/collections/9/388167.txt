Coriaria     coriaria is a genus of plants . it is the only genus currently known in the coriariaceae family . about 15-20 species are currently known . most of the species are shrubs but some are subshrubs ( small shrubs ) or small trees . leaves are simple , opposite or whorled , with 3 to 9 major veins coming from the base . the fruits look like berries but they are small nuts ( achenes ) protected by enlarged and colored petals . fruits can not be eaten because their seeds are poisonous ; in some species , mainly those from new zealand , the petals that protect the true fruits can be eaten . several species of this genus can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria of genus `` frankia '' in their roots . the name of the genus `` coriaria '' was given by linnaeus in 1753 in `` species plantarum '' ( vol . 2 , page 1037 ) . the type species is `` coriaria myrtifolia '' l. `` coriaria '' comes from the latin word `` corium '' , meaning `` leather '' because these plants have a substance named tannin which is used to make leather from skins .
