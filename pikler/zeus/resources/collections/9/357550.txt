Apollo 6     apollo 6 was a space flight launched on april 4 , 1968. it was the second mission of the united states apollo program and last unmanned test flight of its saturn v launch vehicle . it was also the last unmanned apollo flight . it was an a-type mission . it was to show that the saturn v could carry the weight of the apollo fast enough and far enough into space to make a flight to the moon possible . it was also designed to show that the apollo command module 's heat shield could survive the high speed re-entry into the earth 's atmosphere . the project was designed to fly into space at the necessary speeds , turn around , and return in about 10 hours . however problems in the fuel lines of several saturn v second and third stage engines stopped it from reaching the speeds apollo would need to reach the moon . it was able to test the return speeds by using the apollo spacecraft 's engine . this had been done with apollo 4 , the first saturn v test . despite the engine failures , the flight gave nasa enough confidence in the saturn v to use it for manned launches . since apollo 4 had also tested the heat shield at a full speed re-entry , a third unmanned flight was cancelled .
