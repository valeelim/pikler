Jewish languages     jewish languages are the various languages and dialects that developed in jewish communities around the world . although hebrew was the daily speech of the jewish people for centuries , by the fifth century bce , the closely related aramaic joined hebrew as the spoken language in judea ( where the ancient jews , `` judeans '' ( where the word `` jew '' comes from ) lived ) and by the third century bce jews of the diaspora ( jewish people outside of their country ) were speaking greek , and soon afterwards hebrew was no longer used as a first language - for over sixteen centuries being used almost exclusively as a liturgical language ( for prayer ) until revived as a spoken language by eliezer ben yehuda in the palestine of the late 1880s and eventually becoming the official language of the state of israel . for centuries jews worldwide spoke the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to , often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branching off as independent languages .
