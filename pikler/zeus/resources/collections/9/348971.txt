Hash table     a hash table is one type of tool for storing information . in computer science , these tools for keeping track of information , or data , are called data structures . a hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to keep track of where data is put . each piece of information to be stored has a name , which is called a key . for example , a key might be a person 's name . each name is matched up to one piece of data called a value , like the person 's telephone number . the data is kept in another data structure called an array , which is like many boxes , or buckets , in a row to hold data . each box has a number starting from 0 and counting up . the idea behind a hash table is to figure out which box to put data by using only its name . this means , no matter how many boxes are filled up , you can always find information quickly if you have its name . the hash table uses a hash function to figure out which number to put data in from its name . the hash function reads a name and gives back a number .
