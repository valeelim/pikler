Kinetoplastid     the kinetoplastids are a group of single-cell flagellate eukaryotes . they include a number of parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals . there are also forms found in soil and aquatic environments . they are members of the phylum euglenozoa . their main distinguishing feature is the presence of a kinetoplast , a dna-containing granule inside the single mitochondrion at the base of the cell 's flagella ( the basal body ) . the kinetoplastids were first defined by honigberg in 1961 as the flagellate order kinetoplastida . they are traditionally divided into the biflagellate bodonidae and uniflagellate trypanosomatidae . the trypanosomatidae includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic . `` trypanosoma brucei '' causes sleeping sickness ; `` trypanosoma cruzi '' causes chagas disease , `` leishmania '' causes leishmaniasis , `` crithidia '' is parasitic on insects , and `` cryptobia '' is an ectoparasite on the gills of fish . `` bodo '' is typical of the free-living bodonids , and includes various species which feed on bacteria .
