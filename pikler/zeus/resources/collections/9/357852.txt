Abell 2142     abell 2142 is a huge , x-ray luminous galaxy cluster in the constellation corona borealis . it is the result of an ongoing merger between two galaxy clusters . the combined cluster is six million light years across , contains hundreds of galaxies and `` enough gas to make a thousand more '' . it is `` one of the most massive objects in the universe '' . the image on the right was taken in 1999 with the chandra x-ray observatory 's 0.3-10.0 kev advanced imaging spectrometer , and covers an area of 7.5 x 7.2 arc minutes . it shows a colossal cosmic `` weather system '' produced by the collision of two giant clusters of galaxies . for the first time , the pressure fronts in the system have been traced in detai . they show a bright , but relatively cool 50 million degree celsius central region ( white ) embedded in large elongated cloud of 70 million degree celsius gas ( magenta ) , all of which is boiling in a faint `` atmosphere '' of 100 million degree celsius gas ( faint magenta and dark blue ) . the bright source in the upper left is an active galaxy in the cluster .
