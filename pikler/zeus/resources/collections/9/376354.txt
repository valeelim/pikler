Cinnabar moth     the cinnabar moth ( tyria jacobaeae ) is a brightly colored arctiid moth . it is found in europe and western and central asia . it has been introduced into new zealand , australia and north america to control poisonous ragwort . this is because the larvae feeding on the ragwort . the moth is named after the red mineral cinnabar because of the red patches on its mostly black wings . cinnabar moths are about 20mm long and have a wingspan of 32â€“42 mm ( 1.3-1.7 in ) . cinnabar moths are day-flying insects . like many other brightly colored moths , it can not be eaten . the larvae use members of the genus `` senecio '' as foodplants . newly hatched larvae feed from under the ragwort leaves to the area of their old eggs . the larvae absorb toxic and bitter tasting alkaloid substances from the foodplants . this makes them unable to be eaten themselves . the bright colors of both the larvae and the moths act as warning signs . partly due to this they are seldom eaten by predators . an exception is among different species of cuckoo which eat hairy and poisonous caterpillars including cinnabar moth larvae .
