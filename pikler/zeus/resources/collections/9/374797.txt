Power line communication     power line communication ( or powerline communication ) uses existing electric power lines to send and receive data . the data signal is modulated and multiplexed over several carrier frequencies . there are different technologies that can be used : - low frequency transmission , over long distances : example uses are the power company reading out its meters from a distance , or controlling its equipment , which may be in remote locations that are difficult to access . modulation is at a few hundred kilohertz - medium frequency transmission , over short distances : home automation ( light switching , automatically controlled blinds ... ) - there are different technologies that propose to replace a local area network or wlan . the problem there is that technologies of different vendors can not talk to each other , and that the standard is only about as fast as fast ethernet
