Huronian glaciation     the huronian glaciation ( or makganyene glaciation ) lasted from 2400 million years ago ( mya ) to 2100 mya , during the palaeoproterozoic era . it was named after evidence was collected from lake huron region in north america . there , three separate horizons of glacial deposits are separated by non-glacial sediment . it was one of the most severe and longest ice ages in geologic history , similar to the snowball earth ice ages that happened in the neoproterozoic era . the glaciations were probably triggered by the great oxygenation event ( goe ) , which removed atmospheric methane ( a greenhouse gas ) , and eventually supplied free oxygen to the atmosphere . the alternate warm and ice age periods was probably caused by a repeating cycle . cyanobacteria flourished in the warm periods , producing huge amounts of oxygen . the oxygen removed the free methane , and used up carbon dioxide . this caused the temperature to crash . this slowed down the bacteria . so the temperature rose again ... however , it is also possible that there was a 250 million year lull in volcanic activity , resulting in lower carbon dioxide levels and so reduced greenhouse effect .
