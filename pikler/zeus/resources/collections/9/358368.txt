Pigou effect     the pigou effect is an economics term that refers to the stimulation of output and employment . it is caused by increasing consumption due to a rise in real balances of wealth . it often happens particularly during deflation . wealth was defined by arthur cecil pigou as `` the sum of the money supply and government bonds divided by the price level '' . he explained that keynes ' general theory was incomplete because it was not clarifying a link from `` real balances '' to current consumption . he also pointed out that it did n't include such a `` wealth effect '' would make the economy more 'self correcting ' to drops in aggregate demand than keynes predicted . because the effect derives from changes to the `` real balance '' , this is also called the real balance effect .
