Suspension of disbelief     suspension of disbelief is the willingness for a person to accept fantasy as it is presented to them in any form of media . reality is the world around us . fantasy is a world that only is in our minds , or recorded in some way onto or into something that can be passed along from one form to another . fantasy can not exist as something real , something that we can touch or see as it is . an example of something from fantasy is the white rabbit from lewis carroll 's `` alice in wonderland '' . because of our experience , that is , how we have lived our lives , it has not been proven that it can possibly be real . the white rabbit is an animal which stands on two legs ( in some stories ) , wears human clothing , and acts and speaks like a human . for us as humans , a normal rabbit does not speak , nor does it act or speak like a human . because of that , we think of the white rabbit as fantasy , it only can be living in a not-real world . suspension of disbelief is a way to enjoy a story . if one were to completely disregard a story as false , the entertainment value , what makes us like a story , would be lost . on the other hand , if one accepts a story as real for as long as the story goes on , then a connection to living in reality can be made , however big or small . returning to the subject of alice in wonderland , the story can be taken as pure nonsense , buematicst ideas involving math are hidden in the story .
