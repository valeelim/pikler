Interpretations of quantum mechanics     in quantum mechanics , the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically . however , there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics . there are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others , but there are some that are more accepted than others . `` main article : quantum mechanics '' the main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of schrödinger and heisenberg . the schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object . the equation can be given by formula_1 the basic meaning of this equation is that a particle , such as an electron , is not `` just '' a point-like particle , but also a type of wave . the philosophical implications will be explored shortly . another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the heisenberg uncertainty principle . this bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object can not both be known . the greater the certainty of the `` position '' of an object , the less the certainty of the `` momentum '' of the object . the mathematical formulation of this is given by
