Curse of Tippecanoe     the name curse of tippecanoe ( also known as tecumseh 's curse , the presidential curse , zero-year curse , the twenty-year curse , or the twenty-year presidential jinx ) is used to describe the death of presidents of the united states in office while elected or re-elected in a year ending in `` 0 '' . the `` curse '' began when president william henry harrison ( elected in 1840 ) died in office from pneumonia just one month after becoming president . according to a folk tale , the `` curse '' happened because then-general harrison had fought on native american grounds during the 1811 battle of tippecanoe . the battle was famous , and `` old tippecanoe '' became harrison 's nickname . but the battle made the native americans so angry that they cursed his name . the last president included in this `` curse '' to die was john f. kennedy . he was elected in 1960 and assassinated in 1963. two later presidents elected in `` 0 '' years—ronald reagan ( 1980 ) and george w. bush ( 2000 ) —survived assassination attempts .
