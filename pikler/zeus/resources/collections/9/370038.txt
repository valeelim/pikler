Zinc finger     zinc finger nucleases ( or zfn ) are a tool used to target genes and change dna . it is one of three methods of changing the genome with engineered nucleases . they have two parts . zinc fingers are man-made molecules made of a protein and zinc . each binds to a specific dna . zinc-finger nucleases ( zfns ) are enzymes got by fusing a zinc finger to a dna cleavage enzyme called a `` fokl '' . so the zfn binds onto a specific dna sequence , then snips it in two places . regular cell enzymes stick the ends together , minus the bit snipped out ( dna repair ) . each zfn is made to use on a single gene which is called a “ target gene ” or “ target dna ” . they can be designed to work on specific parts of genes to create a desired change . the two types of dna changes are mutations such as deletions and insertions . genetics research looks at mutated animal subjects to find out what the particular gene does . 'zinc finger ' is the name of many protein structures . the zinc atom binds the proteins and makes them more stable . zfns bind to dna base pairs . one zinc finger can bind about 3 base pairs by itself .
