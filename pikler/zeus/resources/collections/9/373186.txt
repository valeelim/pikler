Monopsony     a monopsony is a market form where there is only one buyer , but many sellers . much like with the monopoly this single buyer has a complete influence on the price . in practice , this market form does not occur often . one example may be a healthcare system where there is only one `` buyer '' of healthcare services ; which is usually the state , or a state-run institution . another example is defense industry , where the state is the often only buyer . still another is that of public transport : either the whole public transport is run by one ( usually state-owned ) company , or the state awards contracts to run a given line for a certain time period .
