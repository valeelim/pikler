Barnacle goose     the barnacle goose ( `` branta leucopsis '' ) belongs to the genus `` branta '' of black geese . this genus has species with largely black plumage , setting them apart from the grey `` anser '' species . the barnacle goose is a medium-sized goose , long . its wingspan is and the body mass is . it has a white face and black head , neck , and upper breast . its belly is white . the wings and its back are silver-gray with black-and-white bars that look like they are shining when the light reflects on it . during flight a v-shaped white rump patch and the silver-gray underwing linings can be seen . barnacle geese often build their nests high on mountain cliffs . this keeps them away from predators ( mostly arctic foxes and polar bears ) but also away from food . like all geese , the goslings are not fed by the adults . instead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings , the goslings are brought to the ground . unable to fly , the three day old goslings jump off the cliff and fall . their small size , feathery down , and very light weight helps to protect some of them from serious injury when they hit the rocks below . many do die from the fall . arctic foxes are attracted by the noise made by the parent geese during this time . they eat many dead or injured goslings . the foxes also stalk the young as they are led by the parents to wetland feeding areas .
