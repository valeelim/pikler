'' the national gallery of art continues : `` chardin has rigorously constructed his composition . the boys are framed by a rectangular stone window , the sharp rectangles offset by the hunched youth whose arms and head form a triangle . this triangular shape is echoed in the hat of the younger boy . the focus of the composition , however , is the circular , translucent bubble , which glistens against the warm brown tones of the canvas .
