Megasthenes     megasthenes ( , ca . 350 â€“ 290 bce ) was a greek ethnographer and explorer in the hellenistic period . he wrote the work `` indica '' . he was born in asia minor ( now turkey ) . arrian says that megasthenes lived in arachosia , with the satrap sibyrtius . he visited india from there : `` megasthenes lived with sibyrtius , satrap of arachosia , and often speaks of his visiting sandracottus , the king of the indians . '' arrian , `` anabasis alexandri '' at the beginning of his `` indica '' , he speaks about the older indians who know about when dionysus and hercules arrived in india . this story was very popular during the alexandrian period . what he says about the religions of the indians is important . he mentions the devotees of heracles ( lord krishna ) and dionysus ( lord shiva or king lord indra ) . however , he does not mention buddhists . this could mean that the religion was not well known before ashoka took power . writers like arrian , strabo , diodorus and pliny refer to `` indica '' in their works . arrian said the best things about megasthenes , but strabo and pliny do not treat him with as much respect .
