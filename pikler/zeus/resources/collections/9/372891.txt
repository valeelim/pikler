Bract     in botany , a bract is a modified leaf , especially one associated with a flower or inflorescence . bracts are usually different from normal leaves . they may be smaller , larger , or of a different color , shape , or texture . usually , they also look different from the parts of the flower , such as the petals and/or sepals . some bracts are brightly colored like petals , and attract pollinators like bees . examples of this type of bract include `` euphorbia pulcherrima '' ( poinsettia ) and `` bougainvillea '' : both of these have large colorful bracts surrounding much smaller , less colorful flowers . in grasses , each floret ( flower ) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts , while each spikelet ( group of florets ) has a further pair of bracts at its base called glumes . these bracts are the chaff removed from cereal grain during threshing and winnowing . a prophyll is a leaf-like structure , such as a bracteole , subtending a single flower or pedicel . the term can also mean the lower bract on a peduncle . the frequently showy pair of bracts of `` euphorbia '' species in subgenus `` lacanthis '' are the cyathophylls .
