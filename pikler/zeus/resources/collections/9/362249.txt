Great Oxygenation Event     the great oxygenation event ( goe ) was the introduction of free oxygen into our atmosphere . it was caused by cyanobacteria doing photosynthesis . it took a very long time , from about three billion years ago to about one billion years ago . photosynthesis was producing oxygen both before and after the goe . the difference was that before the goe , organic matter and dissolved iron chemically captured any free oxygen . dissolved iron ( of which there was a great deal ) became iron oxide and huge deposits of this are found as banded iron rock from the archaean and proterozoic eras . the goe was the point when these minerals became saturated and could not capture any more oxygen . the excess free oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere . oxygen was toxic to most of the earth 's anaerobic inhabitants at the time . as cyanobacteria produced oxygen , and built their stromatolites , they changed the environment for other protists . since the other protists had no way to deal with oxygen , most would have become extinct . another consequence was the effect of free oxygen on atmospheric methane , a greenhouse gas . the reaction removed the methane and caused the huronian glaciation , possibly the longest snowball earth episode ever . free oxygen has been an important part of the atmosphere ever since .
