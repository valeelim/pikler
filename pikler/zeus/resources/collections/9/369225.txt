Designer drug     designer drugs are legal drugs that are made and sold to have the same effects as illegal drugs . these drugs are chemicals that change the way a person acts and feels . the government does not regulate designer drugs and this makes them dangerous to use . designer drugs were first sold in the united states around 1925. they were made because a lot of popular drugs were no longer allowed to be used . the government passed a law making drugs like morphine and heroin illegal , causing people to find new drugs . ecstasy is another drug example . it was legal and used for psychotherapy until 1985 when it was banned . since 2005 , there are many more drugs like these being developed . now there are designer drugs for several alternative drug groups . these drugs have a lot of different effects and people choose each one for different reasons . there are different ways that these drugs effect the body . the user can smoke ( breathe in ) , inject , sniff ( breathe in the solid ) , or ingest ( eat ) the drugs . once they are inside and in the bloodstream the drug changes the way chemicals are sent throughout the brain . by changing the messages sent , the brain will respond in a way specific to each drug . some drugs and their effect will be felt in minutes and only last for a few hours . other drugs will be felt in around an hour and then their effects can last up to several days . the amount of the drug taken can also change how strongly the user reacts to it . too much of the drug can lead to drug tolerance . drug tolerance is when the user has taken the drug for a long time and can no longer get the same effect from only taking a small amount of the drug . this will cause the person to take more of the drug to have the same effect . doing this will eventually lead to an overdose . designer drugs can be highly addictive so it can be hard to stop taking them in dangerous amounts .
