Macedonians     macedonians are people who live in the republic of macedonia . macedonians also can mean the ethnic group which speaks the macedonian language . the slavic languages from which macedonian developed are thought to have grown in the region during the post-roman period . many parts of macedonian culture developed during the rule of medieval byzantine , bulgarian and serbian empires . each of these empires controlled the region for a time . macedonians ' genetic background is thought to be the same as balkan prehistoric and historic demographic processes . this background is also found in other south slavs , especially bulgarians , serbs , bosnians , montenegrins , but also in northern greeks and romanians . the appearance of slavs in macedonia and the balkans happened after the end of roman authority . migrations into the area happened , but on a smaller scale : `` it is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the balkans after the slavic `` invasions '' were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier , although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbours , including the byzantines '' .
