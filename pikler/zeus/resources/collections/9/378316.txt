Bagh-e-Jinnah     bagh-e-jinnah ( used to be called lawrence gardens ) is a large park in lahore , pakistan . it includes a botanical garden and other popular facilities , which were made during the british raj . the gardens were originally named after sir john lawrence , who was the first lieutenant-governor of the punjab and who did much to develop the city of lahore in colonial times . after pakistan 's independence , some people demanded that the gardens be renamed with a more 'patriotic ' name so during the 1980s , their name was finally changed to `` bagh i jinnah '' ( jinnah 's gardens ) , after muhammad ali jinnah , founder of the country . however , many people in lahore still continue to call the gardens as 'lawrence gardens ' , for the sake of historical accuracy .
