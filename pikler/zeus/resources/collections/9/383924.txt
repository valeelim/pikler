Carbene     a carbene is a molecule with a carbon atom that has two bonds and two other electrons that do not make any bonds . since the carbon has only 6 electrons around it , it is quite reactive . the general formula can be written as r- ( c : ) -r ' . a carbene can be a `` singlet '' or a `` triplet '' . in the first case , the two electrons that do not make bonds are like a lone pair . they both stay in the same orbital . in a triplet carbene instead , the two electron stay in different orbitals . here they both have the same spin . carbenes can do many reactions . they can be both electrophiles and nucleophiles . they like doing addition reactions on double bonds . they are also found in cheletropic reactions . most carbenes are very unstable . however , some can exist for a long time . a famous example is grubbs ' catalyst , which was developed by robert grubbs .
