Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv     the geddes plan for tel aviv was the first master city plan for tel aviv . it was designed in 1925-1929 by the scottish city planner sir patrick geddes . this program designed the center of tel aviv and the area now known as `` old north '' . in 1925 patrick geddes was commissioned to design a master plan for the city of tel aviv . the plan he produced was accepted in 1929. tel aviv turned out to be the only example of one of geddes ’ plans being built largely as he envisaged and is a good example of an early planned city . the area of tel aviv originally planned by geddes makes up approximately 7.5 % of the current day municipality of tel aviv and is now known as tel aviv ’ s “ old north ” . it was designed to be an extension of the much older neighboring arabic port town jaffa to the south and a home for the increasing population of jews emigrating from other parts of the world ( predominantly eastern europe ) . geddes , originally as biologist and sociologist was engaged to design a plan for the new city of tel aviv to be built adjacent to the ancient port town of jaffa . the principles he employed for the city were strikingly similar to what we now know as new urbanism ideas of planning - an emphasis was placed on pedestrians as opposed to motor car traffic , a sense of community and civic life was encouraged through the use of town squares and abundant planting of greenery provided significant focus on a minimal environmental footprint . private automobile traffic was minimised and the city was envisaged on a pedestrian-scale . this neighborhood identity has been crucial in the success of tel aviv as a city .
