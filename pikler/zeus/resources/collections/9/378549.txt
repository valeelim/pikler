Stew     a stew is a dish cooked for a long time , and served in the gravy produced by the cooking . the basic materials may be any meat and/or vegetables . it is ideal for tough meat like mutton and beef cuts which have marbling ( fat ) and connective tissue . also , the tougher vegetables should be used . it is traditional to start off with a simple sauce , such as a roux . even simpler , flour and an oxo stock cube can be stirred in some milk and water . it is usual for the tougher meats to start off by themselves , with vegetables added later . casseroles and stews are similar . casseroles often have a topping ; stews do not . stewing is a cooking process whereby heat is applied to the bottom of the cooking vessel ( typically over a fire or on a stove ) , whereas casserole cooking is generally baked in an oven where heat circulates all around the cooking vessel . stews have been made since ancient times . it figures in the roman cookbook by apicius . herodotus says that the scythians ( 8th to 4th centuries bc ) `` put the flesh into an animal 's paunch , mix water with it , and boil it like that over the bone fire . the bones burn very well , and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off . in this way an ox , or any other sacrificial beast , is ingeniously made to boil itself .
