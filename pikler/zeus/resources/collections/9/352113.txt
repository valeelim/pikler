Difference quotient     in calculus , an advanced branch of mathematics , the difference quotient is the formula used for finding the derivative . the derivative is the rate at which a function changes , and the derivative is based on the difference quotient . the difference quotient was formulated by isaac newton . simply put , the difference quotient can be described as the formula for finding the slope of a line that touches a curve ( this line is called the tangent line ) . if we are trying to find the slope of a perfectly straight line , then we use the slope formula which is simple the change in `` y '' divided by the change in `` x '' . this is very accurate , but only for straight lines . the difference quotient , however , allows you to find the slope of any curve or line at any single point . the difference quotient , as well as the slope formula , is merely the change in `` y '' divided by the change in `` x . '' the only difference is that in the slope formula , y is used as the y-axis , but in the difference quotient , the change in the y-axis is described by f ( x ) .
