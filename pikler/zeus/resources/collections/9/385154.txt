Limit (mathematics)    limit ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a limit is a guess of the value of a function or sequence based on the points around it . limits are used to define many topics in calculus , like continuity , derivatives , and integrals . limit are written like this : formula_1 and read as `` the limit of f of x , as x approaches c '' . limit is shortened to `` lim '' . other pages . - limit of a sequence - rate of convergence : the rate at which a convergent sequence approaches its limit - cauchy sequence - complete metric space - limit of a function - one-sided limit : a real variable `` x '' has two limits , as `` x '' approaches a point from above or below . this refers to one of those limits . - list of limits : list of limits for common functions - squeeze theorem : finds a limit of a function by comparing it with that of two other functions . - banach limit defined on the banach space that extends the usual limits . - limit in category theory - direct limit - inverse limit - asymptotic analysis : a method of describing limiting behavior
