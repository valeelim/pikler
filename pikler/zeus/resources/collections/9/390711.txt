Shapley Supercluster     the shapley supercluster or shapley concentration ( scl 124 ) is the largest concentration of galaxies in our nearby universe . it is a gravitationally interacting unit 650 million light years away ( z=0.046 ) . this means it pulls itself together , instead of expanding with the universe . it is an overdensity in the distribution of galaxies in the constellation of centaurus . in the late 1920s , harlow shapley and his colleagues at the harvard college observatory started a survey of galaxies in the southern sky , using photographic plates obtained at the 24-inch bruce telescope at bloemfontein , south africa . he found a 'cloud ' in the constellation of centaurus to be the most striking concentration of galaxies . in recent times , the shapley supercluster was rediscovered , in a survey of galaxies of galaxies at the university of cambridge in england . in this paper , the supercluster was named after shapley , in recognition of his pioneering survey of galaxies in which this concentration of galaxies was first seen . around the same time , others had noticed a remarkable concentration of clusters in the abell catalogue of galaxy clusters : they had named it the `` alpha concentration '' .
