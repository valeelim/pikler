Hyoid     the hyoid is a horseshoe-shaped bone in the front of the neck . between the chin and the thyroid cartilage ( adam 's apple ) . at rest , it lies at the level of the mandible in the front and the third cervical vertebra behind . unlike other bones , the hyoid is not directly connected to other bones . it is connected only to muscles and ligaments . the hyoid aids in tongue movement and swallowing . the hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above , the larynx below , and the epiglottis and pharynx behind . due to its position , the hyoid bone does not fracture easily . in a suspected case of murder , a fractured hyoid strongly indicates throttling or strangulation however , this is not the case in children and adolescents , because their hyoid bone is still flexible as ossification is yet to be completed .
