Morgan's canon    morgan 's canon morgan 's canon is a rule relating to animal behaviour , which states that it should be explained as simply as possible . it is named after british psychologist c. lloyd morgan . his idea was that people should only consider behaviour as , for example , rational , purposive or affectionate , if there is no other explanation possible . morgan saw that much insight and apparent problem-solving behaviour could be described using trial and error learning . a famous example is the skilful way in which morgan 's terrier tony opened the garden gate , easily taken by someone seeing the final behaviour as an insightful act . morgan , however , had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response , and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it . morgan 's canon is a forerunner of behaviourism . related pages . - behaviorism - occam 's razor
