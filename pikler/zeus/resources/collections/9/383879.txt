Melancholia     melancholia is a mental illness . a person with melancholia has intense or long-lasting feelings of sadness , for no clear reason . in the 20th century , the term `` melancholia '' was mostly replaced by `` depression '' ( also called major depressive disorder ) . the first person to describe melancholia was hippocrates , in the 4th century bc . in his `` aphorisms '' , hippocrates wrote that all `` fears and despondencies , if they last a long time '' , are symptoms of melancholia . the name `` melancholia '' comes from the old medical belief that there are four basic liquids in the body ( called humors ) . according to this belief , diseases happen when the humors are not balanced correctly in a person 's body . humors were also thought to determine personality types . according to hippocrates , melancholia was caused by having too much black bile in the body . the name `` melancholia '' means 'black bile ' . it comes from the ancient greek words μέλας ( melas ) , meaning `` dark , black '' , and χολή ( kholé ) , meaning `` bile '' . robert burton , a16th century scholar , wrote in detail about the condition in `` the anatomy of melancholy '' ( 1621 ) . it discussed melancholia from both literary and medical points of view . burton wrote that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness , especially melancholia .
