Electrophile     in chemistry , an electrophile is a molecule or an atom that is happy to take electrons from another one . many electrophiles have a positive charge . they are also called lewis acids . some examples of electrophiles are molecules where the atoms have a big difference in electronegativity , like hcl or a carbonyl , or also oxidizing agents . electrophiles get attacked by a nucleophile , which is the opposite kind of molecule . this happens for example in addition reactions .
