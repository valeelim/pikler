Avemetatarsalia     avemetatarsalia ( meaning `` bird toes '' ) is a clade name established in 1999 for all crown group archosaurs that are closer to birds than to crocodiles . an alternate name is panaves , or `` all birds '' , meaning all animals , living or extinct , which are more closely related to birds than to crocodiles . members of this group are basically the dinosaurs ( including birds ) , the pterosaurs , and some earlier animals which are a bit difficult to place . they are one wing of the archosaurs , the other being the crurotarsi . bird-line archosaurs appear in the fossil record early in the middle triassic about 245 million years ago ( mya ) , with the dinosaur-like `` asilisaurus '' . however , lower triassic fossil footprints reported in 2010 from poland may belong to a still more primitive type . if so , the origin of avemetatarsalians would be pushed back to around 249 mya . the oldest polish footprints were made by an unknown small quadrupedal animal , but slightly later footprints show that moderately large bipedal dinosauromorphs had appeared by 246 mya .
