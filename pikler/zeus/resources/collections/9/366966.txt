Antibiotic resistance     antibiotics can kill certain kinds of microorganisms . over time , those microorganisms often develop resistance to the anitibiotics . called antibiotic resistance , this is one of the most serious problems facing modern surgery and medicine . it is also one of the best examples of evolution in action . antibiotic resistance spreads very quickly , far faster than microbiologists expected . `` as long as new drugs keep coming , resistance is not a problem . `` but there has not been a new class of antibiotics discovered since the 1980s '' '' . it is now known that bacteria have a special mechanism , the integron , which speeds up the spread of resistance . a well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms . since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by alexander fleming , antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases . natural populations of bacteria contain , among their vast numbers of individual members , considerable variation in their genetic material , as the result of mutations . when exposed to antibiotics , most bacteria die quickly , but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible . if the exposure to antibiotics is short , these individuals will survive the treatment . this selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection .
