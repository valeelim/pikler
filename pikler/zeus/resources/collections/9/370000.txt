Bit (horse)    bit ( horse ) a bit is a type of equipment that is put in a horse 's mouth to help control it . it is attached to a bridle to hold it on the horse 's head , and to reins which the rider holds and allows them to control and cue the horse . the mouthpiece of the bit is the part that goes into the horses mouth . it is usually made of metal , but may also be made of plastic or rubber . there are many different types of bits , including snaffles , pelhams , and curb bits . they all work a little differently . some bits are `` softer '' than others , meaning that a pull on it is gentler to the horse than a `` harsh '' bit . for example , bits with a smooth mouthpiece are soften than those with a twisted mouthpiece . bits are not cruel when used correctly , but a rider that pulls too hard can hurt a horse 's mouth , especially if they use a harsh bit . if a rider is inexperienced , they should ride with a softer bit so when they make mistakes they do not hurt the horse . experienced riders who can follow the horse 's mouth as the horse moves and give very slight cues can use bits that are harsher . they have the skill to use the bits for very fine control over the horse , without hurting it .
