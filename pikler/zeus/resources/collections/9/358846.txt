Steering     steering is the collection of mechanical parts which allow a vessel ( ship , boat ) or vehicle ( truck , car , motorcycle or bicycle ) to follow the desired course . rail transport is an exception because the rail tracks provide the steering function . in vehicle steering , the user turning on the steering wheel directly controls the rate of the turn . response is immediate . submarines and ships operate in a fluid , and use control surfaces that work on the fluid . there is a delay between the steering controls and the time it takes for the system to respond .
