Linear B     linear b is an ancient script , used to write mycenaean greek , the oldest known form of ancient greek . this was proved by michael ventris in the early 1950s . linear b came before the greek alphabet by several centuries . the script is based on linear a , a script which can not be read today . the oldest texts written in linear b date from about 1450 bc . linear b was found mainly in the palace archives at knossos , cydonia , pylos , thebes and mycenae . it disappeared with the fall of the mycenaean civilization . there are about 87 signs in linear b that represent syllables . in addition , there are many ideographic signs : these represent objects or commodities . they do not represent sounds , and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence . linear b seems to have only been used for administration . in all the thousands of clay tablets , a relatively small number of different `` hands '' ( or writers ) have been detected : 45 in pylos ( west coast of the peloponnese , in southern greece ) and 66 in knossos ( crete ) . the script may have only been used by a guild of professional scribes . these scribes worked at the different palaces : when the palaces were destroyed , the script disappeared .
