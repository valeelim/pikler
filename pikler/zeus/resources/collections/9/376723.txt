Anointing of the Sick     anointing of the sick is a sacrament ( a sacred ceremony ) in roman catholicism and other christian denominations . it is given to people who are `` in danger due to sickness or old age '' . a person does not have to be dying to receive the anointing of the sick . it can be done for anyone with a medical problem which they could die from . anointing of the sick is also called unction . in the past , it was called extreme unction . ( `` anointing '' and `` unction '' are both words for putting oil on a person . oil is an important part of the ceremony . ) all four gospels in the bible say that jesus healed many people . catholics believe that even after his death , jesus is still able to heal people through the power of the sacraments . the main part of the bible that talks about anointing of the sick is : `` are any among you sick ? they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them , anointing them with oil in the name of the lord . and their prayer offered in faith will heal the sick , and the lord will make them well . and if they have committed sins , these will be forgiven .
