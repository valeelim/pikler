Rate equation     the rate equation ( or rate law ) is an equation used to calculate the speed of a chemical reaction . for a general reaction , the rate equation is : here , [ a ] and [ b ] are the concentrations of a and b . `` x '' and `` y '' depend on which step is rate-determining . if the reaction mechanism is a very simple one , where a and b hit each other and then go to products through one transition state , then `` x '' = '' a '' and `` y '' = '' b '' . `` k '' is the rate constant of the reaction . this changes with temperature , pressure and other conditions . the rate equation is a differential equation . if it is integrated , then an equation which tells how the concentration of reagents and products changes with time is found . in special cases , it is very easy to solve the equation and find `` k '' . for example , in a first-order reaction the equation is : integrating gives : so , a plot of formula_4 against time `` t '' gives a straight line with a slope of formula_5 . sometimes , experiments can be made so that the reaction looks like a first-order one . if the concentration of one reagent is kept at the same high value then it can be thought of as a constant . the equation becomes formula_6 where k ' is the pseudo-first order rate constant . then the method above can be used to calculate k ' .
