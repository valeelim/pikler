Condenser (apparatus)    condenser ( apparatus ) a condenser is a device used in the laboratory to cool hot gases into liquids . it is usually a long , circular glass tube . inside the tube there is another , smaller tube . the hot gas goes through the smaller , inside tube , while in the outside one cold water goes around . water can be put in from the tap , and goes from the bottom to exit at the top . this makes sure the tube is always full of water , so that cooling is quick . a condenser is used for example in distillation , where the hot vapour needs to be cooled down back to liquid to be collected . it is also used in reflux where it makes sure that the solvent used does not boil and go away .
