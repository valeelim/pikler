Positive-definite matrix     a positive-definite matrix is a matrix with special properties . the definition of the term is best understood for square matrices that are symmetrical , also known as hermitian matrices . a square matrix filled with real numbers is positive definite if it can be multiplied by any non-zero vector and its transpose and be greater than zero . the vector chosen must be filled with real numbers . examples . - the matrix formula_1 is positive definite . to prove this , we choose a vector with entries formula_2 . when we multiply the vector , its transpose , and the matrix , we get : formula_3 when the entries `` z '' , `` z '' are real and at least one of them nonzero , this is positive . this proves that the matrix formula_4 is positive-definite .
