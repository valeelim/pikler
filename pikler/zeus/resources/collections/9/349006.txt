Human microbiome     the human microbiome ( or human microbiota ) is the collection of microorganisms which live on us . they live on the skin , in the saliva and mouth , in the eyes , and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract . they include bacteria , archaea , fungi and single-celled eukaryotes ( 'protozoa ' ) . everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body . the human body has about 100 trillion cells , and carries about ten times as many microorganisms `` in the intestines alone '' . the microbiome is `` the ecological community of commensal , symbiotic , and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space '' . the term was originally coined by joshua lederberg . he thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important . many scientific articles distinguish `` microbiome '' and `` microbiota '' to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves , respectively . however , by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous .
