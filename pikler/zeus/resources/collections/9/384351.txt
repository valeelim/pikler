Non-deterministic turing machine     a turing machine is an idea from computer science that tries to describe how some computers work . deterministic turing machines use a function . given the current state of the turing machine , it selects another state the turing machine should have . in other words , from each state there is one other state the machine can have . a non-deterministic turing machine uses a relation . this means that from some states there are several other states that are possible .
