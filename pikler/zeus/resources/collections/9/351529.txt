Portland limestone     portland limestone is a limestone which was deposited in the latest stage of the upper jurassic period . it was first found on the isle of portland , dorset . however , it occurs over a much wider area , including france . the strata are beds of white-grey limestone separated by beds of chert . portland limestone was formed in a shallow , warm , sub-tropical sea on the continental shelf of what is now western europe . limestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate . this comes originally from the bodies of many small organisms which build their shells or framework out of caco crystals . an example is the type of protist called coccolithophores . on the continental shelves of the world photosynthetic organisms , like coccoliths , bacteria , and algae , produce calcium carbonate . many animals , like bivalves and coral reefs , then use it to make their shells or other structures . carbonates are rocks formed from these sources , plus any caco which is precipitated out of solution . florida bay , the shallow lagoon behind the florida keys , is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on the continental shelf . of course , all the species were somewhat different then but , as an ecosystem , it is similar .
