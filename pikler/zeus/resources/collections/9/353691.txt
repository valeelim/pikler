Ethnocentrism     ethnocentrism is when a person tries to judge the culture of other people from the point of view of their own culture . ethnocentrism can look at things like language , custom , religion and behavior . an ethnocentric person will use their own culture as the basis for judging other cultures . they see their own culture as the best and believe other cultures should change to be more like theirs . the term was first used by sociologist william g sumner . he defined it as “ the technical name for the view of things in which one 's own group is the center of everything , and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it ” . all people tend to use the values of the culture we were born in . one of the main goals of anthropology is to not use ethnocentric ideas . anthropologists try to see other cultures from the point of view of a person from that culture . this is also known as `` cultural relativism '' . it is the idea that goes against the idea that some things are always the same in every human culture ( human universals ) . cultural relativism says that all human action is relative to the culture where the action happens . anthropologists know that they have to not use the standards of their own culture if they want to understand another society correctly .
