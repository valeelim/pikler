Marbled cat     the marbled cat ( `` pardofelis marmorata '' ) is a small wild cat of south and southeast asia . its head and body length is 45 – 62 cm ( 18 - 24 '' ) and it weighs 2 – 5 kg ( 4 - 11 lb ) . genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related with the asian golden cat and the bay cat , which diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago . therefore , it may probably be transferred to the genus `` catopuma '' . its tail is extremely long and bushy . the background color of its fur varies from dark gray-brown through yellowish gray to red-brown . the flanks and back are strikingly marked with large , irregular , dark-edged blotches . the legs and underparts are marked with black dots , and the tail is marked with black spots and rings . there are spots on the forehead and crown , which merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck and irregular stripes on the back . the marbled cat is found in northern india , nepal , guangxi and yunnan provinces in china , and south through cambodia , laos , myanmar , thailand , vietnam , peninsular malaysia , sumatra ( indonesia ) , and borneo . throughout its range it is thought to be rare , although it has also been suggested that the perception of the marbled cat 's rarity may be caused by its secretive nature and its preference for remote forest areas .
