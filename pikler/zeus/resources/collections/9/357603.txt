Elliptical galaxy     an elliptical galaxy is a galaxy having an ellipsoidal shape , and a smooth , nearly featureless brightness profile . they are one of the three main types of galaxy originally described by edwin hubble in 1936. the others were spiral and lenticular galaxies . elliptical galaxies range in shape from nearly spherical to nearly flat , and in size from hundreds of millions to over one trillion stars . originally , edwin hubble thought that elliptical galaxies may evolve into spiral galaxies , but this turned out to be false . stars found inside elliptical galaxies are very much older than stars found in spiral galaxies . most elliptical galaxies are composed of older , low-mass stars , with a sparse interstellar medium and minimal star formation activity . they tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters . elliptical galaxies are believed to make up approximately 10â€“15 % of galaxies in the virgo supercluster , but are not the dominant type of galaxy in the universe overall . they are usually found close to the centers of galaxy clusters .
