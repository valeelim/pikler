Faraday's law of induction    faraday 's law of induction faraday 's law of induction is a law of physics proposed by english physicist michael faraday in 1831. it is one of the basic laws of electromagnetism . the law explains the operation principles of generators , transformers and electrical motors . faraday 's law of induction says that when a magnetic field changes , it causes a voltage . that phenomenon was also found by joseph henry in 1831. to describe the law , the magnetic flux and also a surface with a wire loop as border . this leads to the following surface integral : - φ is the magnetic flux - `` d '' a is a small part of the moving surface - b is the magnetic field when the flux changes , it produces electromotive force . the flux changes when b changes or when the wire loop is moved or deformed , or when both happens . the electromotive force can then be calculated with the following equation : - formula_3 is the electromotive force - n is the number of loops the wire makes - φ is the magnetic flux of one loop
