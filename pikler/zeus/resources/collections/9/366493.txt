Anfinsen's dogma    anfinsen 's dogma anfinsen 's dogma is a hypothesis in molecular biology suggested by christian anfinsen . the idea is that a protein folding into its native structure is done automatically by the protein 's amino acid sequence . it is only true for some proteins . for other proteins , chaperones are needed . anfinsen shared the 1972 nobel prize for chemistry for his work on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease a. the dogma suggests that , in the conditions at which folding occurs , the native structure is a unique and stable state . there are three conditions : - `` uniqueness '' : requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy . - `` stability '' : small changes in the surrounding environment can not give rise to changes in the minimum configuration . - `` kinetical accessibility '' : means the final shape can be got without going through any highly complex changes in the shape ( like knots , for example ) . how the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding , which has a related dogma called levinthal 's paradox . the levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large , such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed to explore all possible conformations ( 10 seconds ) and choose the appropriate one .
