Spaceport     a spaceport is a place for spacecraft to launch or land . it may have launch pads for rocket-like spacecraft , and many buildings for preparing and launching space flights . in real life , there are very few space ports across the world . they are mostly owned by government agencies ( like nasa ) , and used to launch scientific research missions and to launch man-made satellites . however , science fiction stories set in the future often have spaceports that are more like modern airports . in these stories , many spacecraft may come and go each day , and they may transport passengers like a real-life airline .
