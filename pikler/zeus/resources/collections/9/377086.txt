Fracking     fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is forcing fractures in a rock layer , by fluid that is put under pressure . it can happen naturally , but it is now used to force oil and natural gas from shale . some hydraulic fractures form naturally : certain dykes are examples . this lets gas and petroleum from source rocks get to reservoir rocks . the first use of hydraulic fracturing was in 1947. the modern fracturing technique , called 'horizontal slickwater fracturing ' , was first used in 1998. it made the extraction of shale gas economical . the energy from the injection of a highly pressurized fluid creates new channels in the rock , which increases the extraction rates and recovery of hydrocarbons . in 2010 it was estimated that 60 % of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured . as of 2012 , 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing jobs have been performed on oil and gas wells worldwide , more than one million of them in the united states . proponents of hydraulic fracturing point to the economic benefits from the vast amounts of previously out of reach hydrocarbons . opponents point to potential environmental effects , such as contamination of ground water , risks to air quality , the migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface , surface contamination from spills and flowback and the health effects of these . for these reasons hydraulic fracturing has come under scrutiny , with some countries suspending or banning it .
