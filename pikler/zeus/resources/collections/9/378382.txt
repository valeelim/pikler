Goryōkaku     `` goryōkaku '' was designed in 1855 by takeda hisaburō . his plan was based on the work of the french architect vauban . the fort is shaped like a five-pointed star . this allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional japanese fortress , and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire . the fort was built by the tokugawa shogunate to protect the tsugaru strait against a possible invasion by the russian fleet . goryōkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the boshin war ( `` goryōkaku no tatakai '' ) . the fighting lasted for a week ( june 20-27 1869 ) . other websites . - japan atlas : goryokaku fort
