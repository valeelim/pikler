Evolutionary grade     an evolutionary grade is a group of species at the same level of organisation . it refers to a group of animals or plants which are very similar , but which are not a clade . they have a similar morphological or physiological complexity , and they are often adapted to the same way of life . the term was coined by julian huxley , to contrast with clade , which is a strictly phylogenetic unit . the use of 'grade ' as a term in biology was strongly supported by ernst mayr , who also pointed out that the term had been used for some time before cladism . an evolutionary grade is a group of species united by similarities . these similarities led to their being given a name . but now to be a clade , the whole group from the first known member to the present day must be included . the most commonly cited example is that of reptiles . in the early 19th century , tetrapods were put in the four familiar classes of amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals . in this system , reptiles are defined by traits such as laying cleidoic eggs , having skin covered in scales or scutes , and having a 'cold-blooded ' metabolism .
