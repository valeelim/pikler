Mitochondrial Eve     mitochondrial eve is a term from genetics . it refers to a woman , whose mitochondrial dna is the parent of all living humans . according to current research , mitochondrial eve lived about 200.000 years ago . most likely she lived in east africa , when `` homo sapiens sapiens '' ( anatomically modern humans ) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species . mitochondrial eve lived later than `` homo heidelbergensis '' and the emergence of `` homo neanderthalensis '' , but earlier than the out of africa migration . the dating for 'eve ' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis , and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in africa and spread from there , replacing more `` archaic '' human populations such as neanderthals . as a result , the latter hypothesis became dominant .
