Luritja     luritja is the name of an australian aboriginal group of the western desert . they speak the luritja dialect of wati , the language of the western desert people . the dialect itself has several varieties . the luritja lands include areas to the west and south of alice springs . the region is centred on kings canyon . their neighbours are the arrernte ( east ) , the warlpiri ( north ) , the pintupi ( west ) , and the pitjantjatjara ( south ) . in recent decades , many from this group have inter-married with pintupi-speaking people . during the mid 20th-century , the pintupi were forced to leave their lands and were settled into government-built stations . papunya became a settlement for both pintupi and luritja . in the 1980s , many of these people moved back west to kintore . both communities now mainly speak a hybridised dialect known as pintupi-luritja . the name `` luritja '' is thought to come from the arrernte word `` lurinya '' , which means `` foreigner '' . over time younger generations have taken on the name as their ethnonym . the total population of luritja people ( including those at papunya ) is probably in the thousands . this makes them the third largest of the central australian aboriginal populations , behind the arrernte and pitjantjatjara .
