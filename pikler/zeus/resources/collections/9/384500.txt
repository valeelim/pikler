Brachiopod classification     the classification of brachiopods is being discussed at present . the following is an overview of the different schemes which are proposed . the `` traditional '' classification was defined in 1869. two further approaches were established in the 1990s : - in the `` traditional '' classification , the articulata have toothed hinges between the valves , while the hinges of the inarticulata are held together only by muscles . - a classification devised in the 1990s , based on the materials of which the shells are based , united the craniida and the `` articulate '' brachiopods in the calciata , which have calcite shells . the lingulida and discinida , combined in the lingulata , have shells made of chitin and calcium phosphate . - a three-part scheme , also from the 1990s , places the craniida in a separate group of its own , the craniformea . the lingulida and discinida are grouped as linguliformea , and the rhynchonellida and terebratulida as rhynchonelliformea . underlying the discussion are some basic principles :
