Flare star     a flare star is a variable star that becomes very much brighter unpredictably for a few minutes at a time . flares happen on flare stars in a similar way to solar flares . they are magnetic disturbances in the atmosphere of stars . the brightness increases across the spectrum , from x rays to radio waves . the first known flare stars were discovered in 1924 , they were v1396 cygni and at microscopii . still the best-known flare star is uv ceti , that star was discovered in 1948. today similar flare stars are classified as uv ceti type variable stars in variable star catalogs . flares can happen once every few days or , as in the case of barnard 's star , much less frequently . proxima centauri , the nearest star to the solar system , is also a flare star . most flare stars are dim red dwarfs , although research done not too long ago suggests that less massive ( lighter ) brown dwarfs might also be able to flare . the more massive ( heavier ) rs canum venaticorum variables ( rs cvn ) are also known to flare , but scientists understand that a companion star in a binary system causes these flares . this companion star disturbs the magnetic field . nine stars similar to the sun have also been seen to flare . there is a suggestion that this happens for similar reasons to the flares of the rs cvn variables . a companion causes the flares , this companion is a massive planet like the planet jupiter that orbits the flaring star closely .
