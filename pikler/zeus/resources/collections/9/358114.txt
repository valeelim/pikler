Irregular galaxy     an irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape , like a spiral or an elliptical galaxy . irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular types of the hubble sequence . they do not have a bulge in the centre , nor any trace of spiral structure . they are quite common : they may make up a quarter of all galaxies . most were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but were deformed by gravitational pull . irregular galaxies also contain abundant amounts of gas and dust . there are three sorts of irregular galaxies : 1. an irr-i galaxy ( irr i ) is an irregular galaxy that features some structure but not enough to place it cleanly into the hubble sequence . some of the irregular galaxies are small spiral galaxies that are being distorted by the gravity of a larger neighbour . 1. an irr-ii galaxy ( irr ii ) is an irregular galaxy that does not appear to feature any structure that can place it into the hubble sequence . 1. dwarf irregulars , this type of galaxy may be important , as they often have a low level of metallicity and relatively high levels of gas . this is similar to the earliest galaxies in the universe . they may be a local ( and recent ) version of the faint blue galaxies known to exist in deep field galaxy surveys .
