Steel mill     a steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant where steel is manufactured . steel is an alloy of carbon and iron . usually steel is produced in two stages : first , iron ore is reduced ( or smelted ) with coke and limestone . this is done in a blast furnace , and the result is pig iron . the part that is not used for pig iron is carried on as `` molten iron '' . impurities are removed , and alloying elements such as manganese , nickel , chromium and vanadium are added to produce the exact steel required . steel mills then turn molten steel into blooms , ingots , slabs and sheet through casting , hot rolling and cold rolling .
