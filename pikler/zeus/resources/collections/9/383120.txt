Deep diving     in deep diving , divers use a breathing apparatus ( a supply of air carried on their backs ) . or they may be supplied with breathing gas through a hose from above the water . this allows them to dive to some of the deeper parts of the ocean . commercial divers may use different gas mixtures ( helium-oxygen for example ) . they may also use deep diving suits pressurized to one atmosphere . a deep dive is considered anything below a depth below about . this is still not very deep compared with the deepest parts of the ocean . divers sometimes stay there for long periods of time . sometimes they do work on oil wells and pipelines . sometimes they explore sunken ships to see if they can retrieve items from the ship or help to bring the ship up to the surface . one of the dangers of deep diving is decompression sickness . that can happen if divers rise to the surface of the ocean too quickly . for that reason recreational divers need to be certified to show they have training to dive to a specified depth range . master scuba diver is the highest recreational diving certificate .
