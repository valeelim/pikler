'' . the children are free from fearing these horrors of the war . he took vermont neighbors as models for his series . this painting is the only one in the `` four freedoms '' series he had not specially painted for this subject . he first made it to illustrate the battle of britain of 1940. he did not want it to be published though , because he distasted the idea that american children were resting safely in their beds as europe burned .
