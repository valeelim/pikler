Gumbel distribution     the gumbel distribution is a probability distribution of extreme values . in probability theory and statistics , the gumbel distribution is used to model the distribution of the maximum ( or the minimum ) of a number of samples of various distributions . such a distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years . it is also useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake , flood or other natural disaster will occur . the gumbel distribution is a continuous probability distribution . gumbel distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form . these distributions differ in their `` location '' and `` scale '' parameters : the mean ( `` average '' ) of the distribution defines its location , and the standard deviation ( `` variability '' ) defines the scale . one recognizes the gumbel `` probability density function '' ( pdf ) and the gumbel `` cumulative distribution function '' ( cdf ) .
