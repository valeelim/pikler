Natterjack Toad     the natterjack toad ( `` epidalea calamita '' , formerly `` bufo calamita '' ) is a toad . they live in the sandy and heathland areas of europe . adults are 60â€“70 mm in length . they are different from other toads because they have a yellow line down the middle of the back . they have relatively short legs . this gives them a distinctive gait , which is different than the hopping movement of many other toad species . natterjacks have a very loud and distinctive mating call . natterjacks live for up to 15 years and feed on insects , worms and small reptiles . at night they move around open land with little vegetation . their tracks can often be seen in loose sand . they move large distances each night . the natterjack toad spawns between the end of april and july . they lay 'strings ' of eggs in shallow , warm pools . because the natterjack toad is often present in low numbers , its loud mating calls are important so that the sexes can find each other . for natterjacks , pools need to have a small slope with little vegetation on the banks and in the water . sometimes the larvae die when the pools dry out . the natterjack mates a few times each summer . the age of the young can vary from a month to 3 months in september .
