Gulf of Thailand     the gulf of thailand is a shallow arm of the south china sea . the gulf of thailand is bordered by cambodia , thailand and vietnam . the northern tip of the gulf is the bay of bangkok at the mouth of the chao phraya river . the gulf is about 320,000 kmÂ² . the boundary of the gulf is defined by the line from cape bai bung in southern vietnam to the city kota baru on the malaysian coast . the gulf of thailand is relatively shallow . its average depth is 45 m , and the maximum depth only 80 m. this makes water exchange slow . the strong water inflow from the rivers make the gulf low in salinity ( 3.05-3.25 % ) and rich in sediments . the main rivers which empty into the gulf are the chao phraya ( including its distributary tha chin river ) , mae klong and bang pakong rivers at the bay of bangkok , and the tapi river into bandon bay in the southwest of the gulf . the gulf of thailand has many coral reefs , and several diving resorts . due to the tropical warmth of the water , it is popular with tourists . some of the most important tourist places in the gulf of thailand are the islands of ko samui and ko pha ngan in surat thani province , pattaya in chonburi province , cha-am in phetchaburi province , hua hin in prachuap khiri khan province , ko samet in rayong province , and ko chang in trat province
