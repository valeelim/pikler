Labrador Sea     the labrador sea ( french : `` mer du labrador '' ) is an arm of the north atlantic ocean between the labrador peninsula and greenland . the sea is surrounded by continental shelves to the southwest , northwest , and northeast . it connects to the north with baffin bay through the davis strait . it has been described as a marginal sea of the atlantic . the labrador sea is about 3400 meters deep and wide where it joins the atlantic ocean . it becomes shallower , to less than towards baffin bay and passes into the davis strait . the water temperature varies between in winter and in summer . the salinity is relatively low , at 31â€“34.9 parts per thousand . two-thirds of the sea is covered in ice in winter . the northern and western parts of the labrador sea are covered in ice between december and june . the drift ice serves as a breeding ground for seals in early spring . the sea is also a feeding ground for atlantic salmon and several marine mammal species . shrimp fisheries began in 1978 , as well as cod fishing . the cod fishing quickly lessened the fish population in the 1990s and was stopped in 1992. other fishery targets include haddock , atlantic herring , lobster and several species of flatfish and pelagic fish such as sand lance and capelin . bigger amounts are in the southern parts of the sea .
