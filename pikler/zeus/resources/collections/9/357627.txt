Messier 87     messier 87 ( also known as m87 , virgo a or ngc 4486 ) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy . it was discovered in 1781 by the french astronomer charles messier , who catalogued it as a nebulous feature . the second brightest galaxy within the northern virgo cluster , it is about 16.4 million parsecs ( 53.5 million light-years ) from earth . unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy , messier 87 has no distinctive dust lanes . it has an almost featureless , ellipsoidal shape . luminosity diminishes with distance from the centre . at the core is a supermassive black hole . this is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation , particularly radio waves . a jet of energetic plasma known as a blazar is thrown out by the black hole at near the speed of light . it goes outward at least . in pictures taken by the hubble space telescope in 1999 , the motion of messier 87 's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light . this motion is probably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet .
