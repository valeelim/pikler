Conic section     in geometry , when a cone and a plane intersect , a conic section results . - preliminary : in elementary geometry , cones are assumed to be right circular . `` circular '' means that the base is a circle and `` right '' means that the axis passes through the centre of the base at right angles to its plane . contrasted with right cones are oblique cones , in which the axis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base . - definition : a conic is the curve got by intersecting a plane , called the cutting plane , with a cone . the cone is a right circular cone for easy description , but any double cone with some circular cross-section will do . there are three different types of sections , the parabola , the hyperbola and the ellipse . the circle is a special case of an ellipse . sometimes the circle is mentioned as a fourth type , because calculating with a circle is easier than with an ellipse , most of the time . the conic sections are known at least since 200 bc , when apollonius of perga ( ~262 bc to ~190 bc ) studied of their properties .
