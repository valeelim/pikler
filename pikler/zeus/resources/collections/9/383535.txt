Shizuka Gozen     shizuka gozen ( 1165–1211 ) , or lady shizuka , was one of the most famous women in japanese history and literature . she was a `` shirabyōshi '' ( court dancer ) of the 12th century , and a mistress of minamoto no yoshitsune . since she , like many others , are featured largely in the heike monogatari ( tale of heike ) , gikeiki ( chronicle of yoshitsune ) , and a number of plays of various traditions , her story is quite well known , but it is difficult to separate fact from fiction within it .
