Protein structure     protein structure describes how protein molecules are organised . this structure is what makes proteins work . proteins are important biological macromolecules present in all organisms . they are polymers formed from 20 possible amino acids by rna translation . protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids . after translation , proteins fold into specific shapes . this is not done by chemical bonds but by weaker forces such as hydrogen bonds . to understand how proteins work , it is often necessary to discover their three-dimensional structure . to do this biophysics uses techniques such as x-ray crystallography , nmr spectroscopy , and dual polarisation interferometry . a protein may switch from one shape to another as it does its job . the alternative states of the same protein are called conformations . an enzyme , for instance , will have at least two conformations : one with its co-enzyme and one without . the form with its coenzyme will have two conformations : one with its substrate and one without .
