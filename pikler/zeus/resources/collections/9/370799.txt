Oh-My-God particle     the oh-my-god particle was a really tiny portion of matter or energy ( undefined ) moving incredibly fast . it was first spotted on the evening of 15 october 1991 over dugway proving ground in utah and shocked many astrophysicists . it has an estimated energy of ( 50 j ) â€”in other words , a subatomic particle with kinetic energy equal to that of a baseball ( ) traveling at about . that amount of energy is also 50 times the energy that a collision in the large hadron collider would have . the speed of the particle was almost the speed of light . if a year were to pass in a race between a ray of light and the particle the distance will be 0.00000046 millimetre or be behind 0.00000000000000015 seconds . there have been at least 15 similar events recorded .
