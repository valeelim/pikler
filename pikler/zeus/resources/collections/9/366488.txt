Protein folding     protein folding is the process by which a protein gets its functional shape or 'conformation ' . it is mainly a self-organising process . starting from a random coil , polypeptides fold into their characteristic working shape . the structure is held together by hydrogen bonds . the stages are : 1. each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mrna to a linear chain of amino acids . this polypeptide lacks any developed three-dimensional structure ( left hand side of the top figure ) . 1. amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( right hand side of the figure ) . this is known as the native state . the resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence ( anfinsen 's dogma ) . without its correct three-dimensional structure a protein does not work . however , some parts of proteins may not fold : this is normal . if proteins do not fold into their native shape , they are inactive and are usually toxic . several diseases are believed to result from misfolded proteins . many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins , for the immune system does not produce antibodies for all possible protein structures .
