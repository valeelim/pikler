Free Church of Scotland     the free church of scotland or wee frees is the general name given to groups of worshippers who broke off from the official church of scotland . all these scottish churches are presbyterian , based on the ideas of john knox , and do not have permanent leaders such as popes or bishops . the breakaway groups , like the church of scotland itself , base their beliefs on the bible , but differ in how it should be understood . as a general rule , all the wee frees read the bible in a fairly literal way , more so than the church of scotland . the main free churches are : - free church of scotland ( 1843â€“1900 ) this was formed by a large group from the established church of scotland in 1843. eventually , in 1900 most of them joined with the u.p . and rejoined the church of scotland . - free church of scotland ( since 1900 ; known as the wee frees ) - free church of scotland ( continuing ) founded in 2000 , regards itself as the true continuation of the free church of scotland . - united free church of scotland ( founded 1900 from the u.p . and the earlier free church of scotland )
