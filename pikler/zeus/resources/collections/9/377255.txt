Nationalist Party of Australia     the nationalist party of australia was an australian political party . it began on 17 february 1917 when the conservative commonwealth liberal party and the national labor party ( nlp ) joined together . the nationalist party held government until 1929. it was the major opposition to the labor party . in 1931 it joined with a group who left the labor party led by joseph lyons and became the united australia party . this was the basis of the liberal party of australia which began in 1944. in october 1915 prime minister andrew fisher retired . the australian labor party ( alp ) chose billy hughes to be the new leader and prime minister . he was a strong supporter of australia 's participation in world war i. after a visit to britain in 1916 he decided that conscription was necessary to get enough soldiers for the australian army . most of his party , especially the trade unions , did not support conscription . there were also many irish roman catholics in the labor party who did not want to support the british government . this was because of the british government 's actions against the irish easter uprising of 1916. in october hughes held a plebiscite to get support to start conscription , but the plebiscite was narrowly defeated . melbourne 's catholic archbishop , daniel mannix , was his main opponent on the conscription issue . hughes continued to argue in favour of conscription . this produced a deep and bitter split within the australian community , as well as within the members of his own party .
