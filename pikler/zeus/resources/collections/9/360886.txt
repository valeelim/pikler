ENCODE     encode is the encyclopedia of dna elements . encode was launched in 2003 to identify all the functional elements ( working bits ) in the human genome . the work was done by over 400 scientists in 32 laboratories in the us , uk , spain , singapore and japan . their findings were published in 30 open-access papers in three journals , `` nature '' , `` genome biology '' and `` genome research '' . it is the most detailed analysis to date of the human genome . a simplified account of their main findings is as follows : 1. only 1 % of the genome codes for proteins . that is about 21,000 genes . 1 . 70,000 sequences code for 'promotor ' regions . they are upstream of the genes , where proteins bind to control gene expression . 1. there are about 400,000 'enhancer ' regions which regulate distant genes . 1. there are four million gene 'switches ' . these are dna sequences which control when genes are switched on or off . they are often a long way on the genome from the gene they control . 1. about 80 % of the genome has a definite biochemical function . the idea that most of the dna is `` junk dna '' is definitely wrong . `` the vast majority of the human genome does not code for proteins and , until now , did not seem to contain defined gene-regulatory elements . why evolution would maintain large amounts of 'useless ' dna had remained a mystery , and seemed wasteful . it turns out , however , that there are good reasons to keep this dna . results from the encode project show that most of these stretches of dna harbour regions that bind proteins and rna molecules , bringing these into positions from which they cooperate with each other to regulate the function and level of expression of protein-coding genes '' .
