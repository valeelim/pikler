Dendrochronology     dendrochronology is tree-ring dating . it is a method of dating which uses the patterns of growth rings in trees . in many types of wood , the time rings were formed can be dated to the exact calendar year . dendrochronology has three main uses : 1. radiocarbon dating , where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages . 1. archaeology , where it is used to date old buildings , etc . 1. palaeoecology , where it is used to determine certain aspects of past climates in some parts of the world , it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years , or even many thousands . the maximum for `` fully anchored chronologies '' is a little over 11,000 years from present . the term `` fully anchored chronology '' means the dates are absolutely certain . dendrochronology ( word derived from greek , `` dendron '' , `` tree limb '' ; , `` khronos '' , `` time '' ; and , `` -logia '' ) was developed during the first half of the 20th century originally by the astronomer a.e . douglass , who founded the laboratory of tree-ring research at the university of arizona . douglass researched sunspot activity . he expected changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth . the climate would be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns .
