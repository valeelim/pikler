The Spokesman-Review     the spokesman review is a newspaper based in spokane , washington , in the united states . it is a broadsheet newspaper , meaning it is a lot longer than it is wide . a new one is written every day . it is spokane 's only daily newspaper . `` the spokesman-review '' was started when two old newspapers merged ( meaning they joined together to make one ) . those newspapers were called `` spokane falls review '' and `` spokesman '' , and they were merged in 1893. the first newspaper to be printed as `` the spokesman-review '' happened in june 29 , 1894. it used to published three different newspapers each day : one for spokane , one for spokane valley , and one for northern idaho . however , downsizing in 2007 caused `` the spokesman-review '' to only print one paper a day from then on . `` the spokesman-review '' is thought to lean liberal , especially when it involves opinions on city hall and hate-groups in the eastern washington-northern idaho area . those hate groups did n't like that . in 1997 , three far right militants were convicted of bombing the spokane valley office of `` the spokesman-review '' .
