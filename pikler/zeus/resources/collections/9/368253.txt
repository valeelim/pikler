Byte order mark     byte order mark is an abstract character used to declare and recognize unicode encoding of a text file . it is encoded as unicode character u+feff byte order mark ( bom ) . bom use is optional , and , if used , should appear at the start of the text stream . the bom gives the producer of the text a way to describe the text stream 's endianness , and so its encoding such as utf-8 , or utf-16 . the need for a bom arises in the context of text interchange , rather than in normal text processing within a closed environment . a leading bom can defeat some legacy software , including unix shebang , php and java . a bom is commonly inserted by many software tools including notepad and visual c++ , or google docs .
