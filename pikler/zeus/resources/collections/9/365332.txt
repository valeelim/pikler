Emperor Antoku     there was a battle by an inland sea ( dan no ura ) on april 24th 1185 , between two powerful japanese clans . ( the ruling hekei and another clan called genji ) each asserted a superior claim to the throne . the hekei were badly outnumbered and out manoeuvered . antoku`s guardian was his grandmother , ( lady ni ) when it became clear the hekei had lost the battle , the boy emperor`s grandmother resolved not to be caught by the enemy alive. `` where are you to take me ? '' asked the boy emperor . blinded by tears , the child emperor recited a buddah prayer , then prayed to the east , then to the west to say farewell to the buddah . lady ni took him in her arms , and with the words : `` in the depths of the ocean is our capital . '' they jumped together into the sea and drowned . then followed a frenzied mass suicide by the remaining hekei forces . only 43 hekei survived , all women in waiting . they were reduced to selling flowers and other favours to the local fisher folk . each year on april 24th a ceremony is held , at a shrine near the scene of the battle , to commemorate the child emperor`s short life .
