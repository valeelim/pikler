Tent pegging     tent pegging ( sometimes spelled 'tentpegging ' or 'tent-pegging ' ) is a cavalry or equestrian sport of ancient origin . in the specific sport of tent pegging a mounted horseman , or at times a team of horsemen , rides at a gallop and uses a sword or a lance to pierce , pick up and carry away a small ground target ( a symbolic tent peg ) or a series of such small ground targets . the origins of tent pegging are ambiguous and subject to some controversy . some historians and other scholars believe it originated in arabia , others believe that it might have evolved in central asia , while others still believe in its indian origins . it is believed that people have practised the game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century bc , and over the ages middle eastern , asian and later european empires popularized the game around the world . the term `` tent pegging '' , however , historically emerged from the attacks by arabian muslim cavaliers on enemy camps at dawn or late night , where they would gallop to their tents and pluck out the pegs of their tents , so that these would collapse on them , thus causing havoc and terror in the camp . several old medieval arab books give descriptions of such tactics .
