Redundancy     in information theory , redundancy means that a message is encoded and tramsmitted using more bits that are necessary to emcode the message . if a piece of information is redundant , it can be left out , without loss of information . redudant information such as checksums can be used to detect and correct errors in transmission or storage . operations like data compression reduce redundancy . this can be good , as the data can be sent more quickly and take less space . it can also be bad , if an error can no longer be corrected automatically . when using databases , redundancies must be avoided , as they can lead to inconsistencies . in this case , the process is called normalisation .
