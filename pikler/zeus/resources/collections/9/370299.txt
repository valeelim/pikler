Foie gras     foie gras ( play /fwɑːˈɡrɑː/ ; french : [ fwa ɡʁɑ ] ) ; french for `` fat liver '' ) is a food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially fattened . foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by gavage ( force-feeding corn ) , although outside of france it is occasionally produced using natural feeding . foie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in french cuisine . its flavor is described as rich , buttery , and delicate , unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver . foie gras is sold whole , or is prepared into mousse , parfait or pâté ( the lowest quality ) , and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item , such as steak . there is concern in animal rights circles that the way of making it is cruel .
