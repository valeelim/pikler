Moral equivalence     moral equivalence is a term used in political arguments or debate . it is an informal fallacy . the phrase describes a kind of indirect proof , but the reasoning is flawed because it distorts issues . it draws comparisons between different things to make a point that one is just as bad as the other or just as good as the other . the user of the term imagines a kind of independent position above or beyond the two contenders . the moral equivalence theory allows someone using the term to appear both objective and detached at the same time . the general form of the context for the use of the trope is - the actions of a are morally equivalent to the actions of b , therefore a is just as good or bad as b , regardless of what the actual actions are . - doing x is morally equivalent to doing y , therefore someone doing x is just as good or bad someone doing y , regardless of what x and y actually are . the concept of moral equivalence is not a term of philosophy ; rather , it is only a logical fallacy used in arguments .
