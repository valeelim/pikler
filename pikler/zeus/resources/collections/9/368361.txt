Impatiens     impatiens is a genus of about 850–1,000 species of flowering plants , widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere and tropics . together with `` hydrocera triflora '' , they make up the family balsaminaceae . these plants derives their scientific name `` impatiens '' ( latin for `` impatient '' ) and the common name `` touch-me-not '' in reference to their seed capsules . when the capsules mature , they 'explode ' when touched , sending seeds several metres away . this mechanism is also known as `` explosive dehiscence '' ; see also rapid plant movement . impatiens have become one of the most popular garden annuals . hybrids , typically derived from `` busy lizzie '' ( the well-known `` i. walleriana '' ) and the new guinea impatiens ( `` i. hawkeri '' ) , have commercial importance as garden plants . `` i. walleriana '' is native to east africa , and was bred through selection by claude hope . the original series of impatiens bred by hope was the 'elfin ' series of cultivars , later improved as the 'super elfin ' series . double-flowered cultivars also exist . but in tropical islands , such as hawaiʻi , busy lizzie can also become a noxious weed .
