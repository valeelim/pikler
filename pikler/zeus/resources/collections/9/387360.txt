Mesh networking     mesh networking is a way computer and other networks are laid out . generally , this is known as topology . in mesh networking , each node is connected to one or more other nodes . information is passed from one node to the next , until it reaches its target destination . as in most cases , there is more than one path from one node to another , such networks are very reliable . when a node fails , the data will simply take another route . the disadvantage of such networks is that building them can be very expensive . if each node is directly connected to every other node , the network is called a fully connected . another type of a mesh network is mobile ad hoc network . in such a network the nodes are mobile , and they network may reorganize itself while it is running . related pages . - shortest path bridging
