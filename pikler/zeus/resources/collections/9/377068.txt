Protectionist Party     the protectionist party was an australian political party from 1889 until 1909. its policies were based on protectionism . it argued that australia needed protective tariffs to allow australian industry to grow and provide employment . it had its greatest strength in victoria and in the rural areas of new south wales . its most important leaders were sir edmund barton and alfred deakin , who were the first and second prime pinisters of australia . the protectionist party formed government australia 's first government with the support of the labor party . they agreed to put in place social reforms that were labor policy . labor 's program , however , was often too radical for the protectionists , and compromises had to be made . several changes of minority governments occurred . the protectionist vote had dropped by the 1906 federal election . labor formed its first government in 1904 and its second in 1908 under andrew fisher . many people believed an anti-socialist group was needed to oppose the labor party . deakin and anti-socialist party leader joseph cook , began talks to join their parties together . the more liberal protectionists , such as isaac isaacs and h. b. higgins , opposed a merger . the protection party was split by this issue . most members , including deakin , joined with the anti-socialist party to become the commonwealth liberal party . this became known as `` the fusion , '' . the more liberal protectionists supported labor . the fusion would form another minority government before fisher and labor achieved australia 's first federal majority government , and the first senate majority , at the 1910 election .
