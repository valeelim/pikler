Helium-4     helium-4 ( also written he ) is an isotope of helium . it is the most common isotope of helium in the universe . out of all the helium on the earth , 99.99986 % are helium-4 . the nucleus ( the center ) of a helium-4 atom is also known as the alpha particle . helium-4 is made of 2 protons ( the part of an atomic nucleus with a positive charge ) , 2 neutrons ( the part of an atomic nucleus with a negative charge ) and 2 electrons ( the part of an atom that goes around the nucleus with a negative charge ) . many helium-4 on earth is produced from alpha decay of heavy elements . in the sun and the whole universe , most helium-4 is made during the big bang , the event that created the universe . this `` big bang helium-4 '' is known as the `` primordial helium '' . helium-4 is also made in nuclear fusion at the center of stars . primordial helium is not much on earth , because most of it had escaped from the earth when it was created and the temperatures were very high . helium-4 on earth was made through radioactive decay ( when an atom breaks down into smaller atoms ) from other elements , and it is made after the planet cooled and became solid .
