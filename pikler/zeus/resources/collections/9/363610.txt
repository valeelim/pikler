Hospitality     hospitality is about people welcoming other people into their homes or other places where they work or spend their time . people who welcome visitors are called hosts . the people they welcome are called guests . the word `` hospitality '' comes from the latin `` hospes '' , which came from the word `` hostis '' , which originally meant `` to have power . '' hospitality is all about the art of entertaining or receiving guests . we talk about `` offering hospitality '' . there are many different ideas about how to offer hospitality according to the various cultures in the world . in the past , many societies taught that it was always right to offer hospitality to strangers who came to their door in need of food or shelter . this may seem a strange idea to many of us today , but it was an important way to survive in many societies , especially in lands where people travelled long distances , often far away from large towns . the words hospital , hospice , and hostel also come from the word `` hospitality '' . they are all about giving personal care to people who are away from their homes .
