First order logic     first order logic is type of logic , which is used in certain branches of mathematics and philosophy . first order logic allows to define a syntax which is independent of the mathematical or logical terms . in first order logic , reasoning can be done from two points of view : either using syntax alone , or including semantic terms . first order logic is different from predicate calculus : in first order logic , there are `` quantifiers '' , called `` for all '' and `` there is at least one '' . negation , conjunction inclusive disjunction , exclusive disjunction and implication are the same as those in predicate calculus . together with zermeloâ€“fraenkel set theory , first order logic is the foundation of many branches of mathematics today .
