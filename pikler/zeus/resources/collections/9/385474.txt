Exosphere     the exosphere is the highest and top layer of the earth 's atmosphere . it starts at 500 kilometers high and marks the edge of space . there are very few molecules in this layer . this means that it has the lightest atmospheric gases such as hydrogen , helium , carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen near the base of exosphere . the molecules collide so rarely , that the idea of atmospheric pressure has little meaning . there are two borders to the exosphere ; the lower boundary and the upper boundary . the lower boundary can be known as the exobase . it can also be known as the thermopause because it is in between the exosphere and the thermosphere . the molecules are moving very fast , so that the temperature in this zone is estimated to be thousands of degrees celsius .
