Insight     insight is the act of understanding the inner nature of things . it is a type of comprehension or learning . it can be used in several ways : - a piece of information : `` i have an insight into that problem. '' . - the way you come to know something , a kind of learning . - the answer to a question or problem . - a sudden realization : the eureka effect , named after archimedes . this is also known as an epiphany . higher intelligence ( higher iq ) has also been found to be associated with better performance on insight problems . however , those of lower intelligence benefit more than those of higher intelligence from being provided with cues and hints for insight problems .
