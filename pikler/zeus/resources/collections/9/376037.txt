Industrial Workers of the World     the industrial workers of the world , or iww , is a world-wide radical labor union . members of the iww are often called `` wobblies '' . the iww was started in 1905 in chicago , illinois , usa at a big meeting of many unions . for its first few decades , the iww had many thousands of members who led many of the most important fights against bosses . the united states government and other unions often worked together to enforce more conservative labor relations . partly because this happened membership dropped and there were few members for many years after . today the iww has grown back to a few thousand workers and has members in most continents of the world . the iww pushed many unique ideas when it started . it disliked the american federation of labor 's way of splitting workers by what kind of work they did even if they worked on the same job . instead , it believed that all workers should organize together in `` one big union '' in their industry and as workers altogether . the iww also focused less on winning contracts and more on giving workers more power against bosses on any job they work at .
