Spittal of Glenshee     the spittal of glenshee lies at the head of glenshee in the highlands of eastern perth and kinross , scotland where the confluence of many small streams flowing south out of the grampians form the shee water . for centuries , there has been a hostel or inn at the site and , in modern times , the small village has become a centre for travel , tourism and winter sports in the region , sited at a bend on the a93 trunk road which leads from blairgowrie north past the spittal to the glenshee ski centre and on to braemar . inhabitation in the neolithic period is indicated by a megalithic standing stone behind the old kirk , and the `` four poster stone circle '' on a nearby mound . when interest in ski mountaineering revived after the first world war and the scottish ski club was resuscitated in 1929 , they restarted weekly snow reports with reporters appointed at lix toll near killin , dalwhinnie , braemar and the spittal of glenshee . the dundee ski club used the `` spittal hotel '' as its meeting place , and pioneered improvements , setting up the first ski tows in britain at glenshee in december 1950. the hotel burnt down in 1959 , but spittal of glenshee has continued to provide accommodation near to the slopes .
