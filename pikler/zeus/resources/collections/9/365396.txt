Islam in Niger     more than 90 % of the people in niger ( or 9 out of every 10 people ) are muslims . most of the rest of niger 's people are animists . however , these numbers are not exact . in niger , many of the people who practice traditional religions have mixed some beliefs from islam into their religions . because of this , it is hard to say exactly how many people practice each religion . islam in niger began to spread around a thousand years ago . in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , islam became more common than niger 's traditional religions . since then , sufi brotherhoods have become the most common and powerful muslim organisations , like in many west african countries . because of this , there are many different interpretations ( or ways of understanding and practicing ) islam in niger . these different interpretations exist alongside each other , and alongside less common religions , usually peacefully . the government of niger is secular , or separate from any religion . at the same time , the government recognizes that islam is the most popular religion in the country .
