Peter Higgs     peter ware higgs ch frs frse ( born newcastle upon tyne , 29 may 1929 ) is an english theoretical physicist , and emeritus professor at the university of edinburgh . he was awarded the 2013 nobel prize in physics for predicting the existence of the higgs boson , the `` most sought-after particle in modern physics '' . higgs shared the prize with fran√ßois englert . higgs was appointed to the order of the companions of honour in 2013. in the 1960s , he proposed broken symmetry in electroweak theory . this explains the origin of mass of elementary particles in general . it also shows the origin of the w and z bosons . the theory known as higgs mechanism was proposed by several physicists at the same time . it proposes the existence of a new particle , the higgs boson . on 4 july 2012 , cern announced they had found a new particle much like the higgs boson in experiments , but that more work was necessary to analyse its properties and see if it had the properties expected from the standard model higgs boson .
