Moore's law    moore 's law moore 's law is that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years . intel executive david house said the period was `` 18 months '' . he predicted that period for a doubling in chip performance : a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster . the law is named after intel co-founder gordon moore , who described the trend in his 1965 paper . the paper stated that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965 and predicted that the trend would continue `` for at least ten years '' . his prediction has proved very accurate . the law is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development . the capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to moore 's law : processing speed , memory capacity , sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras . all of these are improving at ( roughly ) exponential rates as well .
