Integer overflow     integer overflow occurs in computers , when the number which is stored becomes larger than the capacity of the memory it is stored in . the most likely result is that the number will reset to 0 and start over . for example , start with the number 14 , using 4-bits integers . add 1 a few times , this wil result in an overflow , which causes it to reset the number to 0 .
