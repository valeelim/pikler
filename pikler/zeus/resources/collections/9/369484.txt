Diane Pretty     diane pretty ( 15 november 1958 - 11 may 2002 ) was a british woman who became known for a debate on laws of euthanasia . she had attempted to change british law so she could end her own life because of the pains and problems of the terminal illness motor neurone disease . over time , the disease worsened and made it impossible for her to move or communicate easily even though her mental faculties remained normal . the illness resulted in her having to be looked after continuously by her husband and nurses . pretty took her case to court using the human rights act to argue not to prosecute anybody involved in helping her to die . british courts did not accept pretty 's arguments , with the house of lords eventually turning her case down . the european court of human rights refused to acknowledge that the european convention on human rights provided a right to die , and her appeal to that court also failed . she died aged 43 , as a result of her condition .
