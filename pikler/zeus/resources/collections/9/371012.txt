Ballast tamper     a ballast tamper is a machine used to make railway tracks level . it is like the railway version of a road roller apart from it lifts the track out of dips instead of squashing the parts where it is too high . before tamping machines were made , tamping was done by lots of people with shovels . they make tamping quicker and the track is better than if tamping is done by hand . also , some new track is too heavy to be lifted by hand , so a tamper has to be used . new tampers can also move the track from side to side to make it smoother .
