Infrared spectroscopy     infrared spectroscopy ( sometimes called infrared spectrometry ) is a physical analysis method that uses infrared light . typically , infrared spectroscopy uses a wavelength between 800nm and 1mm . the method can be used for quantitative analyses of unknown substances , or of the structural properties of known substances . raman spectroscopy is another method that produces similar results . the main method used in infrared spectroscopy today is fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , which uses fourier transforms . infrared vibrational spectroscopy ] ] can be used to identify molecules by listing their chemical bonds . an ir spectrometer is a machine that shines infrared light from a set range of frequencies on a sample . it measures which exact light frequencies are absorbed by the sample . each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency which is characteristic of that bond . a group of atoms in a molecule may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole . if an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule , then it will absorb a photon which has the same frequency . the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light . typically , the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000â€“400 cm , the mid-infrared . the spectrometer records all the frequencies of absorption in a sample . this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity ( for example a wet sample will show a broad o-h absorption around 3200 cm ) .
