Second derivative     in physics and mathematics , the second derivative is the derivative of the derivative of a function , say formula_1 . the second derivative has many real-life applications , especially in the study of acceleration . second derivatives can be notated in several ways , some of which are other notations are used , but the above two are the most commonly used . if we have a function formula_4 , then the second derivative of the function can be found using the power rule for second derivatives
