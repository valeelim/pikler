Pinscreen animation     pinscreen animation is a technique used for making animated movies with a device called a pinscreen . this device is a screen lit by the two vertical sides and filled with a vast number of movable pins . the pins can be pushed back and forth , casting their shadows on the screen to create images . it makes unique visual effects , but because of the meticulousness the technique requires and its time-consuming side , it has been and always remains very rarely used . the pinscreen is a device invented in the early thirties by alexandre alexeïeff , a french engraver , illustrator and filmmaker of russian origin . alexeïeff conceived this device to make animation movies showing the same kind of textural effects that its engravings . the device is a white screen with a multitude of little holes on all its surface . each hole is filled with a pin that can slide back and forth and the screen is lit by the two vertical sides , allowing the pins to cast their shadow on the screen . if all the pins are pushed in the screen , they ca n't cast any shadow and the screen appears entirely white . conversely , if all the pins are pushed out of the screen , it 's total darkness . depending of how far the pins jut out of the front of the screen , their shadows are shorter or longer , allowing the artist to create images in different tones of gray .
