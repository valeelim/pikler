Pituitary adenoma     pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland . pituitary tumors are generally divided into three kinds dependant upon their biological functioning : benign adenoma , invasive adenoma or carcinomas , with carcinomas accounting for 0.1 % to 0.2 % , appoximately 35 % being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas . pituitary adenomas represent from 10 % to 25 % of all brain tumors and is thought to happen in about 17 % to 25 % of most people . non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign [ harmless ] ; but a recent large study ( fern√°ndez-balsells , `` et al . '' 2011 ) has shown there are few studies to prove if this is true or not . adenomas that are bigger than are called `` macroadenomas '' , and those smaller than 10 mm are called `` microadenomas '' . most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas . most pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an `` incidental finding '' [ which means found by chance ] , and are called `` incidentalomas '' .
