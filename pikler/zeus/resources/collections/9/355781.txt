Pintupi Nine     the pintupi nine were a group of aboriginal australians . they are said to have been the last aborigines in australia to come into contact with modern civilisation . the group lived a nomadic , hunter-gatherer way of life in the great sandy desert , before they met with their relatives near kiwirrkurra in october 1984. most other groups from this region had left the desert over 20 years before . they had been settled in towns to the east and west , but this group had stayed behind . the group belonged to the pintupi community . they lived on the western side of lake mackay , north of where kiwirrkurra is today . it was made up of a single family . the father of the group had recently died , leaving two widows and seven children , most of whom were young adults . the family was moving south , hoping to find some of their relatives . they came across another family setting up an outstation , but ran away after a misunderstanding . their relatives from kiwirrkurra went to find them and then brought them into modern society .
