Witenagemot     the witenagemot or witan was an institution in anglo-saxon england , from about the 7th to the 11th century . the name is old english and means `` council of the wise men '' . originally , witan was the plural of `` wita '' ( the wise man ) ; but it was used as a singular . the council was similar to the germanic assembly called `` thing '' . the purpose of the witenagemot was to give an opinion about the administration and the organisation of the kingdom . they talked about how law should develop . they elected or confirmed the king . the witenagemot also had the power to depose a king . this happened when they deposed sigeberht of wessex in 755. they also deposed Ã¦thelwald moll of northumbria in 765. witans were held at least once a year ; usually more often . in many respects they were similar to modern-day parliament . unlike parliament , the locations where they were held changed ; neither the witans nor the king had a permanent place to stay . when the normans invaded england in 1066 , they replaced the witenagemot with another institution . this institution was still known as witan or witenagemot until the 12th century .
