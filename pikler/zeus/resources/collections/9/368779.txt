Metabolic rate     metabolic rate is the amount of energy used by an animal per unit of time . basal metabolic rate ( bmr ) is the amount of energy used daily by animals at rest . about 70 % of a human 's total energy expenditure is due to the basal life processes within the organs of the body ( see table ) . about 20 % of one 's energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10 % from the digestion of food after eating . all of these processes require an intake of oxygen and coenzymes to provide energy for survival , usually from macronutrients like carbohydrates , fats , and proteins . the krebs cycle produces energy-rich atp molecules , and gives off carbon dioxide . basal metabolism is usually by far the largest component of total energy used . the release , and using , of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs , the heart , lungs , nervous system , kidneys , liver , intestine , sex organs , muscles , and skin . for the bmr , most of the energy is consumed in maintaining fluid levels in tissues through osmosis , and only about one-tenth is consumed for mechanical work , such as digestion , heartbeat , and breathing .
