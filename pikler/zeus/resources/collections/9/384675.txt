Prionosuchus     prionosuchus is a genus of extremely large temnospondyl amphibians from the middle permian ( 270 million years ago ) . its remains were found in brazil . the fragmentary remains of this animal were found in the parnaiba basin of northeast brazil . with an estimated length of 9 m ( 30 ft ) , `` prionosuchus '' is the largest amphibian ever found . it had an elongated and tapered snout , numerous sharp teeth , long body , short legs , and a tail adapted for swimming . cox and hutchinson re-evaluated `` prionosuchus '' in 1991 and thought it was synonymous with the genus `` platyoposaurus '' from russia . however , `` platyoposaurus '' had a total length of only 2.5 meters ( 8.2 ft ) , which suggested that the two animals were at least different species . the age of the sediments suggested the two were not comtemporaries . most paleontologists consider `` prionosuchus '' as a valid genus . `` prionosuchus '' lived in a humid and tropical environment as indicated by the petrified forest of the pedra do fogo formation in which the fossil was found . the strata of siltstones , shales and limestones were deposited in lagoonal and fluvial environments . other animals discovered in the same rocks include fish ( primitive sharks , palaeoniscids , and lungfish ) and amphibians .
