Photographic memory     a photographic memory , or eidetic memory , is the ability to remember images or objects in great detail after seeing them for only a short time . the existence of this ability is disputed . the claims made differ somewhat , but stress the recall of visual information . examples of the information include : pages from books , magazines , and license plate numbers . it is claimed that those with a photographic memory tend to have higher iqs than those without it . a person with this ability does not use mnemonics . the ability is said to occur in the early childhood of a small number of children ( between 2 percent and 10 percent ) and generally is not found in adults . some do not believe this skill exists . the american cognitive scientist marvin minsky , in his book `` the society of mind '' ( 1988 ) , thought that reports of photographic memory were an “ unfounded myth ” . adriaan de groot studied the ability of chess grandmasters to memorize the positions of chess pieces on a chess board . at first , people thought they had photographic memory because they could memorize far more information than nonexperts . however , arrangements of pieces that could never occur in a game , their recall was no better than nonexperts . this suggests that they only have an ability to remember certain types of information , rather than photographic memory .
