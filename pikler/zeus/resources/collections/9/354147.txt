Allometry     allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape . in particular , it refers to the rate of growth of one part of the body compared to other parts . in most cases , the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows . most allometric relationships are adaptive . for example , organs which depend on their surface area ( such as the intestine ) grow faster as the body weight increases . also , there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves . allometry is an important way to describe changes in gross morphology ( body shape ) during evolution . changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common . the trend is known as heterochrony . allometry was first outlined by otto snell in 1892 , d'arcy thompson in 1917 , and julian huxley in 1932. the relationship between two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law : where formula_3 is the scaling exponent of the law . jbs haldane 's 1926 essay `` on being the right size '' gives an overview of the way size interacts with body structure . haldane 's thesis is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have :
