Hamiltonian path     a hamiltonian path is a path in a graph which contains each vertex of the graph exactly once . a hamiltonian cycle is a hamiltonian path , which is also a cycle . knowing whether such a path exists in a graph , as well as finding it is a fundamental problem of graph theory . it is much more difficult than finding an eulerian path , which contains each edge exactly once . the problem of finding a hamiltonian path is np-complete . there are two classes of graphs : directed and undirected graphs . in directed graphs , an edge can only be travelled in one direction , in undirected graphs it can be travelled in both directions . the travelling salesman problem is an instance of this problem . its task is to find the shortest hamiltonian cycle , usually in a directed graph , with weight ( or distances ) attached to the edges . hamiltonian paths and cycles and cycle paths are named after william rowan hamilton who invented the icosian game . this game is also known as `` hamilton 's puzzle '' . it involves finding a hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron . hamilton solved this problem using the icosian calculus , an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternions ( also invented by hamilton ) . this solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs . however , despite being named after hamilton , hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by thomas kirkman .
