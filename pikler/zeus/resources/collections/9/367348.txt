Aputula, Northern Territory    aputula , northern territory aputula is a remote aboriginal community in the northern territory of australia . it is south of alice springs , near the border with south australia . it is east of the stuart highway . about 250 people live there . they are pitjantjatjara , yankunytjatjara , luritja , and lower southern arrernte people . the finke river passes nearby the town , but it is dry for most of the year , except during floods . the town was called finke until the 1980s . it began as a trading stop on the central australian railway . local aborigines traded dingo scalps , artefacts and tools for european goods . in the 1950s and 1960s , white farmers set up cattle stations around the town . most of the europeans left finke when the railway line was moved westwards in the late 1970s . this was done because the track was damaged during huge floods in 1973 and 1974 , so it was moved away from the river . the aboriginal people living in the town did not move , and the town came to be known as aputula . the name comes from a place called putula near the town , which used to be the site of a water soak . putula is an arrernte word . arrernte people used to get their water there , before the white people and the railway line came to the area .
