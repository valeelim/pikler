Aldol reaction     the aldol reaction is a very important reaction in organic chemistry . it allows to form new carbon-carbon bonds . it was discovered in 1872. the reagents are two carbonyl compounds together with a base . a proton is removed from one of them forming a negative charge on the α-carbon ( the carbon just next to the c-o double bond ) . the negative charge can then attack the other carbonyl compound , forming the bond . the product is a β-hydroxy carbonyl compound , a molecule with a c-o double bond and an alcohol two carbon atoms down the chain . this reaction is very powerful because it can form a big molecule from two smaller ones . modern ways of doing the aldol reaction also allow to control the stereochemistry of the product . this is a very good way to create new chiral centres .
