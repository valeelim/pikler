African forest elephant     the african forest elephant ( `` loxodonta cyclotis '' ) is an elephant which lives in the forests of the congo basin . it is often considered a separate species from the african bush elephant ( `` loxodonta africana '' ) a 2010 study said that the two elephants were two different species . however , since the two groups can interbreed successfully , they may only be separate subspecies of `` loxodonta africana '' . pygmy elephants of the congo basin are sometimes said to be a different species ( `` loxodonta pumilio '' ) . they are probably forest elephants whose small size is adapted to the rainforest conditions . the differences include that the african forest elephant has a long , narrow mandible ( the african bush elephant 's is short and wide ) , it has rounded ears ( an african bush elephant 's ears are more pointed ) , straighter and downward tusks , smaller size , and more toenails . the male african forest elephant rarely grows more than 2.5 metres ( 8 ft ) in height , while the african bush elephant is usually over 3 metres ( just under 10 feet ) and sometimes almost 4 metres ( 13 ft ) tall . the african bush elephant normally has 4 toenails on the frontfoot and 3 on the hindfoot , the african forest elephant normally has 5 toenails on the frontfoot and 4 on the hindfoot ( like the asian elephant ) .
