Inca Civil War     the inca civil war , the inca dynastic war , or the inca war of succession , was a civil war in the inca empire . it was fought between two brothers , huáscar and atahualpa , sons of huayna capac , over who would be the next emperor . the war came after huayna capac 's death in 1527 , and lasted from 1529 until 1532. when their father died , the empire was divided between the two brothers . huáscar got most part of it , with the capital cusco . atahualpa got the northern parts , including quito . huáscar started the war because he saw himself as the rightful heir to the kingdom . atahualpa proved to be a better war tactician than his brother , and commanded a much bigger army . the empire was reunited under atahualpa in 1532 , but he was executed by the spanish less than a year later . it was partly because of this civil war that the spanish conquistadors , under francisco pizarro , were successful . references . - notes - sources - hemming , john . `` the conquest of the inca '' . new york , ny : harcourt , inc. , 1970 , 28-29 .
