Basilar-type migraine     basilar-type migraine ( btm ) is a type of migraine with aura that causes a headache which usually starts in the `` occipital region '' which is in the lower back part of the brain . the symptoms that are believed to start in the brainstem , occipital cortex , and cerebellum and the pain may affect both sides of the brain at the same time . most people who have basilar-type migraine also have migraines with aura without the basilar symptoms . this type of migraine is usually more common in young people between about 10â€“19 years of age . the word `` basilar '' comes from the middle french word `` basilaire '' : of or related to the base . in medicine it usually refers to the base or bottom of a body part especially the skull . btm is called 'basilar-type ' because it was first described in the areas of the brain which receive blood from the basilar artery , which includes most parts of the brain in the `` posterior fossa '' and also the brainstem , which are in the lower , back part of the brain ( occipital region ) . but it was later seen that btm may also affect areas of the brain outside of the areas which receive blood from the basilar artery , and also no proof that problems in the basilar artery are the cause .
