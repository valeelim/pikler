Cawl     cawl is a welsh dish . it was traditionally eaten during the winter months in the south-west of wales . today the word is often used to refer to a dish containing lamb and leeks , but historically it was made with either salted bacon or beef , potatoes , carrots and other vegetables . cawl is widely considered to be the national dish of wales . the meat in the dish was normally cut into medium-sized pieces and boiled with the vegetables in water . the stock was thickened with either oatmeal or flour . it was then served , without the meat or vegetables , as a first course . the vegetables and slices of the meat would then be served as a second course . cawl served as a single course is today the most popular way to serve the dish . cawl is similar to `` lobsgows '' , cawl 's north wales equivalent . `` lobsgows '' differs in that the meat and vegetables are cut into smaller pieces . the stock is not thickened . `` cawl cennin '' , or leek cawl , can be made without meat but using meat stock . in some areas cawl is often served with bread and cheese . these are served separately on a plate . the dish was traditionally cooked in an iron pot or cauldron over the fire . it was eaten with wooden spoons . the word `` cawl '' in welsh is first recorded in the 14th century , and is thought to come from the latin ' , meaning the stalk of a plant , a cabbage stalk or a cabbage . in welsh , ' ( `` make a cawl of [ something ] '' ) means to mess something up .
