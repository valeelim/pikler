Stefan–Boltzmann law     in quantum physics , the stefan-boltzmann law ( sometimes called stefan 's law ) states that the black-body radiation energy emitted by a given object is directly proportional to the temperature of the object raised to the fourth power . the equation for this law is : r=σ '' t '' where σ is the stefan-boltzmann constant , which is equal to 5.670 373 ( 21 ) x 10 w m k , and where r is the energy radiated per unit surface area and per unit time . `` t '' is temperature , which is measured in kelvin scale . although this law is accurate and helpful , it is only usable for the energy radiated by blackbodies .
