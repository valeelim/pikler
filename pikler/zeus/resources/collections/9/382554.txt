Carbonyl     a carbonyl is the group c=o in a molecule . it is a carbon and an oxygen atom with a double bond between them . carbon has another two bonds , which can in general be with any other group . for example , a carbonyl is the c=o bit of a ketone , aldehyde or ester . because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon , the electrons in the bond are more towards it . this means that in acid , a proton will go on the oxygen atom . both the carbon and the oxygen in the group are sp hybridized . the carbonyl is a very important functional group , because chemists can do many reactions with it . it is easy to do nucleophilic additions to it , which makes the molecule bigger . it is also easy to do redox reactions , for example forming an alcohol . the alcohol then is also a very useful group . carbonyls are found in many natural substances and also in drugs and medicines . it is easy to check if a carbonyl is in a molecule . it gives a very strong signal in infrared spectroscopy . in carbon nmr spectroscopy , the signal is usually at very high frequency , away from many other peaks .
