Giant tortoise     giant tortoises have evolved on a number of tropical islands . they can weigh as much as 3 or 400 kg ( 660880 lbs ) and can grow to be 1.3 to 1.9 m ( 45.9 ft ) long ( accounts vary ) . they live , or lived ( some species are recently extinct ) , in the seychelles , the mascarenes and the galapagos . today , the world 's largest population lives on aldabra atoll in seychelles , where there are about 150,000 individuals . although looking similar , the tortoises represent separate branches of evolution . the seychelles and mascarenes tortoises came originally from nearby madagascar , while the galapagos tortoises came from nearby ecuador . their similarity is an example of convergent evolution . these tortoises are capable of living over 100 years in the wild . this makes them the longest-living vertebrates . the longest living survivor is 182 years old ( probably ) . the madagascar tortoise `` tu'i malila '' was 188 at death in tonga in 1965 . `` harriet '' was reported by the australia zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. also , on 23 march 2006 , an aldabra giant tortoise named `` adwaita '' died at alipore zoological gardens in kolkata . he was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of lord robert clive . he was around 255 years old when he died .
