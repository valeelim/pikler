XYZ Affair     france was taking american ships in 1797. president john adams wanted to avoid a war with france , so he sent officials to france to discuss the rights of neutral nations . however , charles maurice de talleyrand , the french foreign minister , sent three secret agents who insisted that america give a loan to france and pay a bribe . president adams would not do what france wanted . when he told the public in 1798 , he addressed the frenchmen as x , y , and z , hence the name of this affair . people hated the xyz affair , saying , “ millions for defense , but not one cent for tribute ! ” america soon quickly declined france ’ s offer . john adams decided to start preparing for war , but not declaring war so as to keep peace .
