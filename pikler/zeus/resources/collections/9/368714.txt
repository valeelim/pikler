Dervish     a dervish or darvesh is a type of sufi . it is someone living a sufi muslim ascetic way or `` tariqah '' . they are poor , and live simply . in this respect , dervishes are most similar to mendicant friars in christianity , or hindu/buddhist/jain sadhus . the whirling dance that is associated with dervishes is best known in the west by the performances of the mevlevi order in turkey . it is part of a ceremony known as the sema . it is also done by other orders . the sema is only one of many sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach religious ecstasy ( `` majdhb '' , `` fana '' ) . the name `` mevlevi '' comes from the persian poet rumi , who was a dervish himself . this practice , though not intended as entertainment , has become a tourist attraction in turkey .
