Participant observation     participant observation is a way of getting information about a group of people . a person doing participant observation will live with a group of people in their normal environment . they do this so they can learn about that groups way of life . one of the uses of participant observation is to understand the world from the point of view of a person from that group . this is done by watching the things they do every day . the product of participant observation is normally a piece of writing about what the researcher has seen . it is called ethnography . participant observers can live with the group for months or many years . the longer the researcher is with the group , the better the information they learn will be . in the first half of the 20th century , anthropologists bronislaw malinowski , margaret mead and edward evans-prichard started using participant observation . it is now the main way research is done by cultural anthropologists . in covert participation observation , the researcher lives with a group but does not tell the group that they are studying them . the research is done in secret . this method is good because the people will not act differently than they normally do if they do not known they are being studied . one problem with covert participation observation is that it can be unethical . the subject can not give the researcher their consent because they do not know they are being studied .
