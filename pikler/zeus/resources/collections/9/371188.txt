Superiority bias     superiority bias is when people think too much of themselves without good reason . they overrate their positive qualities and abilities , and underrate their negative qualities ( relative to others ) . other phrases for this are : illusory superiority , the above average effect , leniency error , sense of relative superiority , the `` primus inter pares '' effect , and the lake wobegon effect . this was named after garrison keillor 's fictional town where `` all the children are above average '' . illusory superiority has been found in education ( such as class performance , exams and overall intelligence ) , at work ( for example in job performance ) , and in social settings ( for example in estimating one 's popularity , or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits , such as honesty or confidence ) , as well as everyday abilities requiring particular skill . one problem is the ambiguity of the word `` average '' . it is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the mean if the distribution of abilities is highly skewed . for example , the mean number of human legs is slightly lower than two , because of a small number of people have only one or no legs . hence experiments usually compare subjects to the median of the peer group , since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median .
