Hyder Ali     hyder ali ( , , `` haidarālī '' ; , `` haidar alī '' ; c. 1720 – 7 december 1782 , 2 muharram 1197 in the islamic calendar ) was the `` de facto '' ruler of the kingdom of mysore in southern india . born hyder naik , he distinguished himself militarily , eventually drawing the attention of mysore 's rulers . rising to the post of `` dalwai '' , or commander-in-chief to krishnaraja wodeyar ii , he came to dominate the titular monarch and the mysore government , and eventually seized control of all of the reins of power . he expanded the kingdom 's borders at the expense of the maratha empire and nizam of hyderabad ( among others ) , and was one of the few local rulers to effectively blunt the military advances of the british east india company during two wars . in the first and second anglo-mysore wars he came within striking distance of the british outpost at madras . he was given a number of honorific titles , and was referred to as sultan hyder ali khan or hyder ali sahib . hyder 's rule of mysore was characterised by frequent warfare with his neighbours and rebellion within his territories . this was not unusual for the time , as much of the indian subcontinent was then in turmoil , with the hindu maratha confederacy struggling with the remnants of the muslim mughal empire . he was a shrewd leader , and left his son tipu sultan a kingdom that was significantly larger than when he first took it over . he organised his military in part along european lines , and was a pioneer in the military use of rocket artillery . he had at least two wives , and fathered at least three children .
