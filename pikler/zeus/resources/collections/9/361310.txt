Aristarchus of Samos     aristarchus ( 310 bc – about 230 bc ) , was an ancient greek astronomer and mathematician . his is the first known model that put the sun at the center of the known universe with the earth revolving around it ( see solar system ) . aristarchus was influenced by philolaus of croton , but he identified the `` central fire '' with the sun , and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the sun . his astronomical ideas were often rejected in favour of the geocentric theories of aristotle and ptolemy . his name is `` ἀρίσταρχος '' in greek letters , which transliterates to aristarchos . he was born on the island of samos , in the eastern aegean sea . heliocentrism is the idea of the sun at the centre . though the original text has been lost , a reference in archimedes ' book `` the sand reckoner '' describes another work by aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis . archimedes wrote : so aristarchus believed the stars were very far away , which is an important step . therefore , there was no observable parallax , that is , a movement of the stars relative to each other while the earth moves around the sun . the stars are much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times ; and the tiny amount of stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes .
