Diogenes Laërtius     diogenes laërtius was a historian . he wrote a `` history of greek philosophy '' , in ten volumes . very little is known about him as a person . probably he lived in the 3rd century bc . the last philiosopher found in this work is a student of sextus empiricus . sextus empiricus lived in the 2nd century . diogenes laertius does not list many roman philiosphers . he also does not talk about middle platonism , which must have been popular during that time .
