Complex plane     in algebra and calculus , the complex plane is the coordinate system in which complex numbers are graphed . the vertical axis is the `` imaginary axis '' , and the horizontal axis is the `` real axis '' . basically , in the complex number of the form `` a+bi '' , ( where the real part is `` a '' and the imaginary part is `` bi '' ) you go `` a '' spaces on the real axis , and `` b '' spaces on the imaginary axis . the complex plane can also be expressed in the form of polar coordinates , in which the magnitude of the line is equal to the square root of `` a squared '' plus `` b squared '' , and the direction is a specified angle , as in normal polar coordinates . every complex number of the form `` a+bi '' has a complex conjugate , which for the standard form ( a+bi ) is `` a-bi '' . the complex number and it 's conjugate can be represented on the complex plane .
