Palynology     palynology is the study of very small natural particles . the word literally means the `` study of dust '' . a palynologist is someone whose job is to identify what the particles are . samples of particles can come from the air or water or soil or rocks . they could be organic and inorganic . micropaleontology is a related area of study ; it involves very small fossils . a palynologist uses a microscope . they may also use chemical tests to find out what a particle is made of . the methods used to study fossils in micropaleontology and in palynology are often different . micropaleontology often involves breaking and dissolving rocks . palynology often involves soil or sediment . the main work of a palynologist is to identify each particle . many different kinds of particles might be in the same sample . they may include : - clay - pollen - algae with hard shells such as diatoms , dinoflagellates , golden algae - spores from plants , fungi , or bacteria - small seeds - pieces of larger organisms - tiny fossils
