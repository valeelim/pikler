Stentor     stentor is a genus of filter-feeding ciliates . they are usually horn-shaped , and reaching lengths of 2 millimeters , they are among the biggest known unicellular organisms . they are a type of protist ciliate in the heterotrich class . the old-fashoned name for them was trumpet animalcules . the body is horn-shaped , with a ring of prominent cilia around the anterior `` bell '' that sweeps in food and helps swimming . some reach several millimeters in length , making them among the largest single celled organisms . as in many freshwater protozoans , stentor has a contractile vacuole . because the concentration of salt inside the cell and in the surrounding freshwater is different , stentor must store water that enters it by osmosis and then discharge it from the vacuole . they can regenerate , and small fragments can grow into full organisms . each cell has one ( often elongated ) macronucleus and several micronuclei . having two types of nuclei is charcteristic of ciliates .
