Thiol     a thiol is a molecule that has a râ€“sh group . thiols are like alcohols with an oxygen atom changed with a sulfur one . they have often a very strong and bad smell . thiols are added to natural gas so that people can smell it . this is because methane does not have a smell but can explode very easily . thiols are very easy to oxidize . they are also quite acidic , more than alcohols . when the proton is taken away by a base , the thiol can become a nucleophile . it can do reactions like nucleophilic substitution . one of the natural amino acids , cysteine , has a thiol in its structure .
