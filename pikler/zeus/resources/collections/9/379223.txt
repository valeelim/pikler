Palaeodictyoptera     the palaeodictyoptera were large flying insects which are now extinct . they were common in the upper carboniferous , and became extinct at the end-permian extinction . their size varied from large to huge . for example , `` mazothairos '' had a wingspan of about . they were the first major group of herbivorous insects . they had long , beak-like , piercing mouthparts , and probably a sucking organ . the mouthparts match the signs of damage in fossil plant leaves and stems . in addition to the normal four wings , they had two `` pronota '' in front . these pronota were smaller than the regular wings , but had wing veins just like the real things . they did not move up and down , so maybe they helped gliding . the palaeodictyoptera are sometimes whimsically called `` six-winged insects '' . the actual wings are often boldly marked : the patterns of colour can be seen in fossils . these insects had paired `` cerci '' ( singular : cercus ) on their rear segment . the function of these is not clear . cerci often serve as sensory organs , but they may also be used as weapons or copulation aids , or they may simply be vestigial structures . the cerci on some species was longer than the rest of the insect .
