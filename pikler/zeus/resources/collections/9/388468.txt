Phosphorescence     phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light . this is in some cases the mechanism used for `` glow-in-the-dark '' materials which are `` charged '' by exposure to light . unlike the relatively swift reactions in a common fluorescent tube , phosphorescent materials used for these materials absorb the energy and `` store '' it for a longer time as the processes required to re-emit the light occur less often .
