Nimravidae     the nimravidae is an extinct family in the carnivora . it is a type of cat-like mammal in the suborder feliformia . they lived in north america , europe , and asia from the eocene through the miocene epochs , 42â€“7.2 million years ago ( mya ) . they lasted for about 35 million years . although some nimravids physically resembled the sabre-toothed cats of genus `` smilodon '' , they were not closely related , but evolved a similar form through parallel evolution . the ancestors of nimravids and felids diverged from their common ancestor about 50 mya . most had muscular , low-slung , catlike bodies , but with shorter legs and tails . some nimravids did evolve into large toothed cat-like forms with massive flattened upper canines and mandibular flanges . others had teeth similar to modern cats , with smaller canines . some had canines more intermediate relationship between the saber-toothed cats and felids . these differences must have reflected different methods of attacking their prey . not only did nimravids have varied tooth styles , but they also showed the same range of size size and shape as felids . some were leopard-sized , others the size of today 's lions and tigers , and one had the short face , rounded skull and smaller canines of the modern cheetah .
