Electoral college     an electoral college is a group of people who are chosen to elect a candidate to a particular office ( job ) . the electors usually have one vote each . often each elector represents a particular organization or entity . many times , though , the electors are simply important people whose wisdom would ideally make a better choice than a larger group of people . the electoral college can ignore the wishes of a general membership . a similar concept existed in the former holy roman empire , in which the holy roman emperor was elected by the rulers of various provinces of the empire , or their representatives . these rulers were referred to as electors . for instance , king george iii of great britain was also duke and prince-elector of brunswick-l√ºneburg ( `` hanover '' ) and later became king of hanover , though he never visited hanover . related pages . - u.s. electoral college
