Acceleration due to gravity     the acceleration which is gained by an object because of gravitational force is called its acceleration due to gravity . its si unit is m/s . acceleration due to gravity is a vector , which means it has both a magnitude and a direction . the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of earth is represented as `` g '' . it has a standard value defined as 9.80665 m/s . isaac newton worked out that resultant force equals mass times acceleration , or in symbols , formula_1 . this can be re-arranged to give formula_2 . the bigger the mass of the falling object , the greater the force of gravitational attraction pulling it towards earth . in the equation above , this is formula_3 . however , the bigger mass formula_4 ( on the bottom of the formula ) cancels out the greater force of attraction , so the acceleration is the same . in every situation , the formula_5 cancels down to the uniform acceleration of around 9.8 m/s . this means that , regardless of their mass , all freely falling objects accelerate at the same rate .
