Cartwheel galaxy     the cartwheel galaxy ( also known as `` eso 350-40 '' ) is a lenticular galaxy about 500 million light-years away in the constellation sculptor . it is about 150,000 light years across , slightly larger than the milky way . it has a mass of about solar masses , and rotates at . it was discovered by fritz zwicky in 1941. zwicky said his discovery was `` one of the most complicated structures awaiting its explanation on the basis of stellar dynamics '' . the cartwheel galaxy shows radio and optical spokes , but they are not the same spokes . the galaxy was a normal spiral galaxy before it had a collision with a smaller galaxy about 200 million years ago . when the nearby galaxy passed through the cartwheel galaxy , the power of the collision sent a strong shock wave through the galaxy . moving at high speed , the shock wave moved gas and dust . this made a starburst around the galaxy 's center . this explains the blue colored ring around the center , bright section . it can be seen that the galaxy is beginning to take the shape of a normal spiral galaxy again . spiral arms are spreading out from a central core .
