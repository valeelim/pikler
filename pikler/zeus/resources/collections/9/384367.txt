Nearest neighbour algorithm     nearest neighbour algorithms is a the name given to a number of greedy algorithms to solve problems related to graph theory . this algorithm was made to find a solution to the travelling salesman problem . in general , these algorithms try to find a hamlitonian cycle as follows : 1. start at some vertex , at mark it as current . 1. from the current vertex , take the shortest edge that connects it to an unvisited vertex v. 1. set the current vertex to v. 1. if there no unvisited vertices left , you are done . 1. else , go to step 2. such algorithms are easy to implement , but they do not always find the best solution . what is worse , the algorithm may not find a tour even if one exists .
