Very Large Telescope     the very large telescope ( vlt ) is a telescope operated by the european southern observatory . it is on cerro paranal in the atacama desert of northern chile . the vlt consists of four separate telescopes , each with a main mirror 8.2m across . they are often used separately , but they can be used together to get a very high angular resolution . the observatory also has four movable auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) of 1.8 m aperture . the vlt operates at visible and infrared wavelengths . each individual telescope can detect objects roughly four billion times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye . when all the telescopes are combined , the facility can achieve an angular resolution of about 0.001 arc-second . this is equivalent to roughly two metres at the distance of the moon . the vlt is the most productive ground-based facility for astronomy : only the hubble space telescope leads to more scientific papers in observational astronomy . among the pioneering observations carried out using the vlt are the first direct image of an exoplanet , the tracking of individual stars moving around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way , and observations of the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst .
