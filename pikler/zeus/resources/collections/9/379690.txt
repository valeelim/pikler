Archedictyon     archedictyon ( plural = archedictya ) is the name of a hypothetical scheme of wing venation of the common ancestor of all winged insects . the nature of the archedictyon is an important in the taxonomic classification of the large , primitive palaeozoic insects known as palaeodictyoptera . it was used for this purpose as early as 1854. a national museum of natural history database for the study of ants , wasps , bees and termites describes the archedictyon as : ... the primitive original vein network [ of ] the wings of many of the most ancient insect fossils ; the complex network of irregular veinlets between the veins in the outer [ three-quarters ] of both wings , including the anal lobe . according to a 1999 paper on the evolution of flght in palaeoptera the cross veins of some palaeodictyoptera may be an adaptive feature . the archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal veins , but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of fossil data and speculation .
