Dwarf galaxy     a dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of up to several billion stars . this is a small number compared to our own milky way 's 200â€“400 billion stars . the large magellanic cloud , containing over 30 billion stars , is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy and sometimes as a full-fledged galaxy orbiting the milky way galaxy . most galaxies , including dwarf galaxies , form in association with dark matter or out of gas containing metals . however , nasa 's galaxy evolution explorer space probe identified new dwarf galaxies forming out of gases lacking metals . these galaxies were in the leo ring , a cloud of hydrogen and helium around two massive galaxies in the constellation leo . dwarf galaxies can be pulled toward and ripped by neighbouring spiral galaxies till they ultimately merge . there are many dwarf galaxies in the local group : these small galaxies frequently orbit around larger galaxies , such as the milky way , the andromeda galaxy and the triangulum galaxy . a 2007 paper has suggested that many dwarf galaxies were created by tidal forces during the early evolution of the milky way and andromeda . tidal dwarf galaxies are produced when galaxies collide and their gravitational masses interact . streams of galactic material are pulled out away from the parent galaxies and the halos of dark matter that surround them .
