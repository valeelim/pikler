Telex (band)    telex ( band ) the belgian synth-pop group telex was formed in 1978 by marc moulin , dan lacksman , and michel moers . they mixed disco , punk and experimental electronic music . like kraftwerk , telex built its music entirely from electronic instruments . in 1980 telex 's manager asked the group to enter the eurovision song contest . the group entered and were sent to the finals . the group 's song `` euro-vision '' was a cheerful bleepy song with deliberately banal lyrics about the contest itself . the eurovision audience seemed unsure how to react to the performance . after the band stopped playing , there was mostly stunned silence . michel moers took a photograph of the bewildered audience . the band walked off to sounds of muttering . when vote-counting began , and greece awarded belgium three points . the announcer thought she misheard and tried to award the points to the netherlands . for its third album , telex got the help of us group sparks to help write the lyrics . however , the band still would not play live . this is common practice for techno music artists , but unusual in 1981. the fourth telex album , `` wonderful world '' , was barely distributed .
