Rodinia     rodinia , meaning `` to give birth '' , is the name of a supercontinent . it had most or all of earth 's landmass when the neoproterozoic era began . rodinia existed between 1.1 billion and 750 million years ago . it formed from parts of the older supercontinent , columbia . rodinia broke up in the first period of the neoproterozoic , the tonian . later its continental fragments were re-assembled to form pangaea 300250 million years ago . in contrast with pangaea , little is known yet about the exact position and history of rodinia . the extreme cooling of the global climate around 700 million years ago ( the so called snowball earth of the cryogenian period ) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the following ediacaran and cambrian periods may have been triggered by the breaking up of rodinia . the break-up of rodinia is better understood than its formation . extensive flood basalt flows and volcanic eruptions of neoproterozoic age are found on most continents . this is evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago . as early as 850 and 800 million years ago , a rift developed , eventually becoming an ocean in the ediacaran .
