Brush-tailed rock-wallaby     the brush-tailed rock-wallaby or small-eared rock-wallaby ( `` petrogale penicillata '' ) is a kind of wallaby . it is one of several rock-wallabies in the genus `` petrogale '' . it lives in the rocks and cliffs of the australia 's great dividing range from about 100 km north-west of brisbane to the grampians in south west victoria . its habitats include rainforest and dry sclerophyl forests . numbers of brush-tailed rock-wallabies have gone down in the south and west of its range . it remains locally common in northern new south wales and southern queensland . in victoria the species is nearly extinct with only four in the grampians national park , and 20 in east gippsland . in 1988 at jenolan caves in new south wales , about 80 wallabies were released into the forest , but by 1992 there were only seven left . in the late 1800s , governor grey introduced this and four other species of wallabies ( including the rare parma wallaby ) to islands in hauraki gulf , near auckland , new zealand , where they became well-established . in modern times , the wallabies have come to be viewed as exotic pests . they have caused problems for the native plants and animals and are being removed from the islands . between 1967 and 1975 , 210 rock-wallabies were captured on kawau island and returned to australia , along with thousands of other wallabies . rock-wallabies were removed from rangitoto and motutapu islands during the 1990s . another 33 rock-wallabies were captured on kawau during the 2000s , and returned to australia .
