Bharata Natyam     bharata natyam or bharatanatyam , is an indian classical dance . both male and female dancers perform this dance . the classical indian story-dance can be used to express a complex range of emotions which respond to the actions of the male heroes . this classical indian dance attracts interest and study in india and other parts of the world , including china europe and north america . `` bharata natyam '' comes from the state of tamil nadu . the dance ’ s origins are recorded in tamil literary texts of the sixth century bc . it was revived in the late 18th century and again in the early 20th century . ( the etymology in # 1 below for `` bharata '' is spurious . it only makes sense with the english spelling/pronunciation of `` bha '' , `` ra '' , and `` ta '' , which would be `` bhā-rā-tā . the actual pronunciation is bhə-rə-tə which does not make for a good story ) . the name was invented in the twentieth century by the great dancer rukmini devi and others . it is supposed to indicate that this style was the original style described in a book on natya by the sage bharata , i.e . `` bharata 's dance '' . the text describes poses but in the absence of illustration , the exact poses had to be re-imagined -- the quality of this re-imagination is a tribute to the intellectual and aesthetic abilities of rukmini devi and her teachers , but there is no other link between bharatanatyam now and the dances described in ancient tamil texts .
