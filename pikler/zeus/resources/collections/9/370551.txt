Lewis chessmen     the lewis chessmen , or uig chessmen , are 78 12th-century chess pieces , most of which are carved in walrus ivory . the hoard was discovered in 1831 on the isle of lewis in the outer hebrides , scotland . they may be some of the few complete , surviving medieval chess sets . they are owned and exhibited by the british museum in london , which has 67 of the original pieces , and the museum of scotland in edinburgh , which has the remaining 11 pieces . the pieces are figurative , like modern sets , and unlike the abstract arabic pieces . the set has made the transition to european figures , which lasts to the present day . in particular , the arrival of a female figure is a departure from the indo-arabic game , and the figure of a bishop is also significant . the chessmen were probably made in norway , perhaps by craftsmen in trondheim , in the 12th century , although some scholars have suggested other sources in the nordic countries . during that period the outer hebrides , and many other scottish islands , were ruled by norway .
