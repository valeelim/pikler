Phalanx formation     the phalanx formation is an ancient greek term for a block-like infantry formation . the greek hoplites ( heavy infantry ) were armed with spears , swords , or similar weapons . the mass of infantry marched forward as one entity against opponents . the system was used by city states , who often fought each other . cavalry were rare , partly because horses were a scarce resource , and partly because the lack of space on valley floors in the peloponnese left little room for cavalry manoeuvres . later , the macedonian phalanx was always supported by cavalry in the conquests of alexander the great . early battles with the phalanx usually resulted in similar formations pushing against each other until one broke . the potential of the phalanx to do more was shown at the battle of marathon ( 490 bc ) . facing the huge army of darius i , the athenians thinned out their phalanx and lengthened their front to avoid being outflanked . however , even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed persian infantry . after routing the persian wings , the hoplites on the athenian wings wheeled inwards , destroying the elite troop at the persian centre . this was a crushing victory for athens . throughout the greco-persian wars the hoplite phalanx continued to defeat the persian infantry ( e.g . the battles of thermopylae and plataea ) .
