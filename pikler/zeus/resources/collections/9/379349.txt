Flag football     flag football is a version of american or canadian football . the rules are not very different to those of the regular game . instead of tackling players to the ground , the other team must pull a flag or flag belt off of the player carrying the ball . flag football is a game played with no padding . full contact is not allowed . the first game of flag football was played in the 1930s . it was later played on military bases in the 1940s as a game for the military . flag football games are 36 minutes long . they are divided into two 18-minute halves . the only time the clock is stopped is in the last two minutes . to score a touchdown , a player must cross the ball over the goal line . this is worth six points . there are two options for an extra point . the scoring team can try to run the ball into the endzone from either the 3 yard line or the 10 yard line . the 3 yd line is worth 1 point and the 10 yd line is worth 2. if the flag of the player who has the ball is pulled while that person is in their own end zone , it is called a safety . the other team gets two points for this .
