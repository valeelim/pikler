Self-organization     self-organization is a process where some form of order arises out of a random system . the process is spontaneous : it happens on its own . it is not directed or controlled by any agent inside or outside the system . self-organization occurs in a variety of physical , chemical , biological , social and cognitive systems . a common example is crystallization . an example from biological chemistry is the lipid bilayer , which is the basis of the cell membrane , and so is of great importance . many self-organising things have properties which are `` emergent '' . what this means is that one ca n't predict what will happen , usually because the possibilities are too many to study . some examples : 1. protein folding : after rna translation , proteins fold themselves up into their working shape . for every protein there are one or two shapes which are stable , but it is almost impossible to predict the folding from the sequence of amino acids . 1. liberal economic theory argues that free market economies create a spontaneous order , `` a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve '' . friedrich hayek . this is the concept of the `` invisible hand '' ( adam smith in `` the wealth of nations '' ) . by acting on information with greater detail and accuracy than is possible for any centralized authority , a more efficient economy is created to the benefit of the whole society .
