RNA interference     rna interference ( rnai ) is a process in living cells . it adjusts ( moderates ) the activity of their genes . rnai molecules are a key to gene regulation . in 2006 , andrew fire and craig mello shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on rna interference in the nematode worm `` caenorhabditis elegans '' , published in 1998. two types of small rna molecules – microrna ( mirna ) and small interfering rna ( sirna ) – do the work . these small rnas bind to normal messenger rna ( mrna ) molecules and increase or decrease their activity . they can prevent a mrna from producing a protein . rna interference defends cells against foreign nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons . also , they control development , and gene expression in general . the rnai pathway is found in many eukaryotes including animals . rnai is a valuable research tool , in cell culture and in living organisms . synthetic dsrna introduced into cells can suppress specific genes of interest . rnai may be used for large-scale screens that shut down each gene to analyse cellular process or cell division . the pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology and medicine .
