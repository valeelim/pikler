Dynamic programming     dynamic programming is a method of solving problems , which is used in computer science , mathematics and economics . using this method , a complex problem is split into simpler problems , which are then solved . at the end , the solutions of the simpler problems are used to find the solution of the original complex problem . dynamic programming can be used in cases where it is possible to split a problem into smaller problems , which are all quite similar . richard bellman , an us mathematician first used the term in the 1940s , when he wanted to solve problems in the field of control theory . he also stated what is now known as : references . - r.bellman , on the theory of dynamic programming , proc natl acad sci u s a . 1952 august ; 38 ( 8 ) : 716â€“719 .
