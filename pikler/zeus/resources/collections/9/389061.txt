Mendeleev's predicted elements    mendeleev 's predicted elements in 1869 , professor dmitri mendeleev created the first periodic table of chemical elements . he arranged the elements from the lightest one to the heaviest one . when he proposed his periodic table , he placed empty spaces between some elements . he said that the empty spaces were for undiscovered elements . mendeleev had also predicted the properties of these undiscovered elements . mendeleev gave temporary names for the undiscovered elements . he used the prefixes eka- , dvi- and tri- and combined it with any known elements in the same group with the undiscovered element . eka- , dvi- and tri- are numbers 1 , 2 and 3 in the sanskrit language . the use of the prefix depends on how far the known element is from the unknown element . for example , germanium was called eka-silicon because silicon is placed one row above germanium , and rhenium was called dvi-manganese because manganese is placed two rows above rhenium . the names of these elements were changed after they were discovered .
