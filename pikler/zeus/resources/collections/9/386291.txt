Khrushchev's Secret Speech    khrushchev 's secret speech krushchev 's secret speech was the speech in which nikita krushchev denounced joseph stalin after the latter 's death . the speech was a spoken report to the twentieth party congress of the communist party of the soviet union on 25 february 1956. its title was on the cult of personality and its consequences . the report was known as the `` secret speech '' because it was delivered at a closed session of communist party delegates , with guests and members of the press excluded . although the text of the khrushchev report leaked almost immediately , the official russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev . the speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 xvii congress of the communist party of the soviet union . they were victims of the stalinist purges of the 1930s . estimates of stalin 's role in history were quite changed by the speech . many in the west who had been communist party member , or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers , resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of stalin . russian writers like solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy . the speech was a significant turning-point in history .
