Reptiliomorpha     reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians ( lissamphibians ) . unfortunately , different experts have used the term in several different ways . it has even been used for fossils of early amphibians . it is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs , but are not synapsids . otherwise precursors of reptiles ( sauropsids ) get lumped together with precursors of mammals ( synapsids ) . its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from . but gradually , as with `` seymouria '' , it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups .
