Robert Doisneau     robert doisneau ( 14 april 1912 - 1 april 1994 ) was a french photographer . in the 1930s he used a leica on the streets of paris . he and henri cartier-bresson were pioneers of photojournalism . as a young man doisneau attended the Ã©cole estienne in paris to learn the crafts involved in the book trade , but he always claimed that the streets of the working-class neighbourhood of gentilly provided his most important schooling . in 1929 , in an effort to improve his draftsmanship , he began photographing , just as modernist ideas were beginning to promote photography as the prime medium for advertising and reportage .
