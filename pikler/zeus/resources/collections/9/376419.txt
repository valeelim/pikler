Slogan     a slogan is a memorable motto or phrase . it is often used in a political , commercial , religious , and other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose . the word slogan is derived from `` slogorn '' which was an anglicisation of the scottish gaelic `` sluagh-ghairm tanmay '' ( `` sluagh '' `` army '' , `` host '' + `` gairm '' `` cry '' ) . slogans vary from the written and the visual to the chanted and the vulgar . their simple rhetorical nature usually leaves little room for detail . a chanted slogan may serve more as social expression of unified purpose than as communication to an intended audience . marketing slogans are often called `` taglines '' in the united states . they can be called `` straplines '' in the u.k. europeans use the terms `` baselines '' , `` signatures '' , `` claims '' or `` pay-offs '' .
