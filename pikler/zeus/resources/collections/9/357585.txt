Virgo Cluster     the virgo cluster is a cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 light years ( 16.5 ± 0.1 million parsecs ) away in the constellation virgo . the cluster forms the heart of the larger virgo supercluster , of which our local group is an outlying member . the virgo cluster has about 1300 ( and perhaps up to 2000 ) member galaxies . its mass is about 1.2 solar masses out to 8 degrees of the cluster 's center or a radius of about 2.2 million parsecs . many of the brighter galaxies in this cluster , including the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 , were discovered in the late 1770s and early 1780s . they were included in charles messier 's catalogue of non-cometary fuzzy objects . described by messier as nebulae without stars , their true nature was not recognized until the 1920s . many of the member galaxies of the cluster are visible with a small telescope . its brightest member is the elliptical galaxy messier 49 .
