Chemical kinetics     chemical kinetics , also called reaction kinetics , is studying how fast chemical reactions go . this includes studying how different conditions such as temperature , pressure or solvent used affect the speed of a reaction . chemical kinetics can also be used to find out about reaction mechanisms and transition states . the basic idea of chemical kinetics is called collision theory . this states that for a reaction to happen , the molecules must hit each other . ways of increasing the speed of the reaction must therefore increase the number of hits . this can be done in many ways . with experiments it is possible to calculate reaction rates from which you can get rate laws and rate constants . a rate law is a mathematical expression with which you can calculate the speed of a reaction given the concentration of the reagents . the equilibrium is dynamic in nature there are many types of rate laws , but the most common are : - zero-order reaction : the speed does not depend on the concentration
