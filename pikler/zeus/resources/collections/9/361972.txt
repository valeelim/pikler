Gini coefficient     the gini coefficient ( also known as the gini index or gini ratio ) is a measure of differences in income . it was developed by the italian statistician corrado gini in 1912. the gini coefficient is usually a number between 0 and 1 ( or 0 to 100 ) . 0 means a country where the income is equally distributed . on the other hand , 1 means that one person owns everything but the rest owns nothing . in reality , all scores are between 0.25 and 0.6 ( between 25 and 60 on the 0 to 100 scale ) . the table below is about the `` world '' gini coefficient ( not by single countries ) . the table below shows the income gini coefficient of the united states from 1947 to 2009 .
