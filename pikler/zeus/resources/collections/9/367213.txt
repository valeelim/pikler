Stereographic projection     in geometry , a stereographic projection is a function that maps the points of a sphere onto a plane . the projection is defined on the entire sphere , except for one point , called the `` projection point '' . intuitively , the stereographic projection is a way of picturing a sphere as a plane , with some inevitable compromises . because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications , so does the stereographic projection ; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis , cartography , geology , and photography . in practice , the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereonet or wulff net . a simple example of such a projection , encountered in everyday life is the sun casting a shadow of a globe onto the ground .
