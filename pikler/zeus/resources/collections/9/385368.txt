Idempotence     idempotence is a property that an operation in mathematics or computer science may have . it roughly means that the operation can be carried out again and again without changing the result . the word idempotence was made by benjamin pierce because he saw the concept when studying algebra . the meaning is different if we are talking about different kinds of operations . it can also be used to describe elements than an operation can take : - for a unary operation ( or function ) , that we label `` f '' , we say that `` f '' is idempotent if for any `` x '' in the domain of `` f '' it is true that : `` f ( f ( x ) ) = f ( x ) '' . for example , the absolute value : `` abs ( abs ( x ) ) = abs ( x ) '' . we say that an element `` c '' in the domain of `` f '' is an idempotent element if `` f ( f ( c ) ) = f ( c ) '' . this means that `` f '' is idempotent if every element of its domain is an idempotent element . - for a binary operation , that we label `` * '' , we say that `` * '' is idempotent if for any `` x '' which the binary operation can take the following is true : `` x * x = x '' .
