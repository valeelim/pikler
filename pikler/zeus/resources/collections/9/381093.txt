Euglenozoa     the euglenozoa are a large phylum of flagellate protists . they are part of the wastebasket taxon known as the protozoa , which contained many obviously different protists . euglenozoa include a variety of common free-living species , and some important parasites , of which a few infect humans . there are two main subgroups , the euglenids and kinetoplastids . euglenozoa are unicellular , mostly around 1540 µm in size , although some euglenids get up to 500 µm long . most euglenozoa have two flagella , parallel to one another in an pocket-like structure . in some there is a cytostome or mouth , used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms . this is supported by a microtubule from the flagellar bases ; two other tubules support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell . some other euglenozoa feed through the absorption , and many euglenids possess chloroplasts and so obtain energy through photosynthesis . these chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls `` a '' and `` c '' , along with other pigments , so are probably evolved from those of a captured green alga . reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division . during mitosis , the nuclear membrane remains intact , and the spindle microtubules form inside of it .
