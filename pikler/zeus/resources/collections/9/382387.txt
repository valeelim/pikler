Explanation     an explanation is an attempt to answer the question `` why '' . asked of a person , it is a question about motive : `` why did you do this ? '' . asked of a natural event , it is a question about natural causes ( causation ) . in science , an explanation is the link between an event which is a cause , and a second event , which is an effect . the phrase `` cause and effect '' refers to this . the relationship between the two events is known as causality . the philosopher mario bunge said , `` we do not rest content with finding facts but wish to know why they should occur rather than not '' . as a general rule , explanations move from what we know to what we do not know . this is important because it explains why different kinds of people may need different explanations . `` a child , a lay person and an expert may need different explanations of the same thing , since what is already familiar to them will differ '' . the asking of questions depends on language , and is peculiar to humans . it starts very soon after a child learns how to speak . a kind of game which young children play with adults is the 'why game ' . every parent gets the experience of their child asking a never-ending stream of why questions , until at last the adult says `` well , it just is !
