Btrfs     btrfs ( b-tree filesystem ) is a filesystem for linux . it is currently considered beta ( unfinished ) software , but is reasonably feature complete and the on-disk format is finalized . it has many features that ext4 lacked , such spreading one filesystem over multiple hard drives ( raid ) , and transparent compression , which compresses files without the user having to decompress them manually .
