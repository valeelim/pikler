Symphony No. 94 &quot;Surprise&quot; (Haydn)    symphony no . 94 & quot ; surprise & quot ; ( haydn ) the symphony no . 94 in g major ( `` surprise '' ) is a symphony by joseph haydn . it was first performed in london on 23 march 1792 under haydn 's direction . it is nicknamed the `` surprise symphony '' . it is sometimes called the `` kettledrumÂ­stroke symphony '' . the symphony 's nickname is derived from the sudden loud chord played by the entire orchestra in the second movement . this movement is a set of variations on a sweet , gentle theme . the chord was haydn 's afterthought ; it does not appear in the manuscript . one theory suggests haydn inserted this loud chord saying , `` that will make the ladies jump ! '' . another theory suggests he inserted it to wake up the music lovers who had dozed off after their dinners and drinks . another theory suggests he inserted it to make the symphony memorable in light of the competition he faced from a series of london concerts directed by ignatz pleyel . references . - woodstra , chris , et . al . 2005 . `` all music guide to classical music '' . all media guide , llc . pp . 574-575. isbn 0-87930-865-6
