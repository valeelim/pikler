Reverse transcriptase     a reverse transcriptase is an enzyme which works 'backwards ' from rna to dna . normal transcription involves the synthesis of rna from dna ; reverse transcription is the `` reverse '' of this . it is a dna polymerase enzyme that transcribes single-stranded rna into single-stranded dna . it also synthesizes a second strand of dna complementary to the reverse-transcribed single-stranded cdna . well studied reverse transcriptases include : - hiv-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( ) - m-mlv reverse transcriptase from the moloney murine leukemia virus - amv reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus - telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes reverse transcriptase was discovered by howard temin at the university of wisconsinâ€“madison in a cancer virus . it was independently isolated by david baltimore in 1970 at mit from two rna tumour viruses . for their achievements , they shared the 1975 nobel prize in physiology or medicine ( with renato dulbecco ) .
