Nucleon     in physics and chemistry , a nucleon refers to any subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom . for instance , protons and neutrons are nucleons , since they are in the nucleus of the atom . nucleons are made of quarks . the main types of nucleons are protons and neutrons . a proton , as its name suggests , has a positive electric charge , and a neutron has a neutral electric charge ( meaning that it has no charge ) . the two in the nucleus of the atom make a positive charge , since the neutron has no charge at all . electrons are not nucleons , because they are not in the nucleus of the atom . the other types of nucleons are `` antinucleons '' . these are the antiparticles of the nucleons . the fundamental force responsible for holding the nucleons together in the nucleus is called the strong force .
