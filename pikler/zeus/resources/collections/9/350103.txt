Pankration     pankration was a sport in ancient greece . eight of pindar 's odes were written in honor of pankratiasts . the pankration was a form of wrestling with one difference : the athletes were allowed to use their fists . they did not wear boxing thongs however . kicking and hitting were allowed but biting and gouging an eye or soft spot with a thumb or finger were forbidden . umpires flogged athletes who violated these rules . in spite of this punishment , violations often occurred . a greek wrestler aimed to throw his opponent ; a pankratiast however aimed to force his opponent to concede defeat . this might be done by getting an opponent in a hold that , if he did not yield ( give up ) , a bone would be broken or a joint dislocated . size and weight did not matter as much in the pankration as they did in boxing and wrestling because pankratiasts spent most of their time rolling around on the ground . the greeks loved the pankration . they considered it the greatest test of an athlete 's skill and strength . the pankration was also a favorite sport in roman imperial times . the most famous ancient pankratiast was arrichon of philageia in the 6th century bc . he won the pankration in two olympics , but died of a stranglehold in the olympics of 564 bc . he was awarded the victor 's wreath . both philostratus and pausanias told the story of his final bout . a statue in the olympia museum may be his .
