Great Artesian Basin     the great artesian basin is the largest and deepest aquifer ( artesian basin ; an underground layer which holds water under pressure ) in the world . it stretches over , with measured temperatures ranging from 30°c to 100°c . it underlies 23 % of australia , including most of queensland , the south-east corner of the northern territory , the north-east part of south australia , and northern new south wales . the basin is deep in places and is estimated to contain of groundwater ( water in the soil , below ground level ) . the basin provides the only reliable source of freshwater ( water that does not have much salt in it ) through much of inland australia . the great artesian basin coordinating committee ( gabcc ) coordinates activity between the various levels of government and community organisations . the water of the gab is held in a sandstone layer laid down by continental erosion of higher ground during the triassic , jurassic , and lower cretaceous periods . during a time when much of what is now inland australia was below sea level , the sandstone was then covered by a layer of marine sedimentary rock shortly afterwards , which formed a confining layer - thus trapping water in the sandstone aquifer . the eastern edge of the basin was uplifted when the great dividing range formed . the other side was created from the landforms of the central eastern lowlands and the great western plateau to the west .
