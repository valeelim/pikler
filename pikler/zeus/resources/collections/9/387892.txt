Symphony No. 41 &quot;Jupiter&quot; (Mozart)    symphony no . 41 & quot ; jupiter & quot ; ( mozart ) the symphony no . 41 in c major ( `` jupiter '' ) , k. 551 is a work for orchestra . it was written by wolfgang amadeus mozart in 1788. it is his last symphony . michael rodman writes in the `` all music guide to classical music '' that the first movement is `` characterized in part by the dramatic and effective employment of unexpected pauses in the rhythmic flow through the use of rests , [ and that ] irregular and changing phrase length contribute ... to the dramatic impetus . '' he writes that the serene f major second movement is disrupted by `` minor key episodes ... [ and that ] this light/dark conflict continues throughout '' . he points out that the gracefulness of the minuet can be attributed to the flowing , even accompaniment and the `` falling chromatic theme '' . the trio has an `` earthier , more overtly dancelike mood '' , he writes , but is `` interrupted by a suddenly more serious '' outburst from the full orchestra . the contrapuntal fourth movement is filled with `` great tension and dramatic impulse '' that is resolved only in the final bars .
