Diabetic retinopathy     diabetic retinopathy , is the most common eye disease caused by diabetes , it damages the retinas in both eyes , causing vision problems which may lead to blindness . it affects up to 80 percent of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more . however it is possible that at least 90 % of these new cases could be kept from becoming severe with early diagnosis and proper treatment . diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs . as new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a part of `` proliferative diabetic retinopathy '' ( pdr ) , they can bleed ( ocular hemorrhage ) and blur vision . the first time this happens , it may not be very severe . in most cases , it will leave just a few specks of blood , or spots , floating in a person 's visual field , though the spots often go away after a few hours . these spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood , which blurs vision . in extreme cases , a person will only be able to tell light from dark in that eye . it may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye , and in some cases the blood will not clear . these types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once , often during sleep .
