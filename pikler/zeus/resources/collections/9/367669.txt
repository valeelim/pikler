Rapid plant movement     rapid plant movement means quick movement of plant structures , usually under a second . for example , the venus flytrap closes its trap in about 100 milliseconds . some other carnivorous plants , such as the bladderworts , also have a rapid response to insects . the dogwood bunchberry , `` cornus canadensis '' , has a flower which opens its petals and fires pollen in less than 0.5 milliseconds . the record is currently held by the white mulberry tree , `` morus alba '' , whose leaves are used to cultivate silkworms . it is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen , which is launched at over half the speed of sound . the stamens act as catapults , releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 Âµs . `` this is the fastest motion yet observed in biology , and approaches the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants '' . the very widespread genus `` impatiens '' gets its common name , `` touch-me-not '' , from its seed capsules . when the capsules mature , they `` explode '' when touched , shooting seeds several metres away .
