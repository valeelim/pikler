Siegfried Sassoon     siegfried sassoon ( 8 september 1886 - 1 september 1967 ) was an english poet and novelist , who became widely known as a result of a protest against the first world war that he made in 1917. sassoon 's father , alfred , came from a very rich family , but they did not approve of his marriage and as a result he did not inherit any of the family fortune . sassoon 's mother , theresa , came from a family of artists . she and alfred had three sons : michael , siegfried and hamo , but alfred left her when the children were still very young . alfred himself died not long afterwards , leaving theresa to bring up the three boys . although they were not as wealthy as alfred 's family , they were able to live comfortably in a large house near the village of matfield in kent . as a young man , siegfried could afford to keep a horse and became a very skilled rider , but his greatest ambition was to be a successful poet . he did not succeed in finding a publisher for any of his work until just before the first world war broke out . at that point , he joined the army . he chose the sussex yeomanry , in order that his horse could go with him rather than being taken by the authorities for other uses . as a result of a riding accident during training , he was out of action for a while , and he then decided to join an infantry regiment and become an officer . the regiment he joined was the royal welch fusiliers , and he began with the rank of lieutenant .
