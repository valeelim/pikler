Wastebasket taxon     a wastebasket taxon is a term used by biologists for a taxon which has organisms that do not fit anywhere else . species or groups are put in the wastebsket taxon when they do not fit into one of the regular taxa . regular taxa are supposed to be monophyletic . by definition , wastebasket taxa are either paraphyletic or polyphyletic . their name may still be very useful to biologists , because its members may be an important evolutionary grade . antelopes are a group which is ecologically very important , and have many similar features . however , they are not monophyletic . species are called 'antelopes ' if they look like one . invertebrates are often called the `` everything-else '' category , meaning all animals without backbones . little-known fossil groups are sometimes later found to be wastebasket taxa . the crocodile-like triassic group rauisuchia is an example . loosely related animals often look rather alike . this is because they adapt to similar environments . this leads to convergent evolution .
