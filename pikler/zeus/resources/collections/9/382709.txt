Amine     an amine is a molecule which has a nitrogen atom that can behave as a base . an amine can be thought of coming from ammonia . the difference is that the three hydrogens in ammonia are changed to any group or atom . if only one of the hydrogens is changed , the amine is called primary . if two are changed , the amine is called secondary . if all three are changed then it is called tertiary . sometimes , a fourth group can be added to the nitrogen . this is called a quaternary ammonium cation . this is not an amine but is a salt . if one of the groups on the nitrogen is a carbonyl group , then the molecule is called amide . this has very different properties . amines are used a lot in chemistry . since the nitrogen has a lone pair , it can do many reactions . it can take protons away from some acids . it can also be a nucleophile . it can be changed into imines and other functional groups . amines are also found in many proteins . they are a part of every amino acid .
