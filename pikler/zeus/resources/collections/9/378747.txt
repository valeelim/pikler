Function composition     in mathematics , function composition is a way to make a new function from two other functions . if we let `` f '' be a function from `` x '' to `` y '' and `` g '' be a function from `` y '' to `` z '' then we say that `` g '' composed with `` f '' is written as `` g ∘ f '' a function from `` x '' to `` z '' ( notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would it expect it to be as we will explain below ) . the value of `` f '' given the input `` x '' is written as `` f ( x ) '' . the value of `` g ∘ f '' given the input `` x '' is written `` ( g ∘ f ) ( x ) '' and is defined as `` g ( f ( x ) ) '' ( which means our way of writing `` g '' composed with `` f '' makes sense ) . here is another example . let `` f '' be a function which doubles a number ( multiplies it by 2 ) and let `` g '' be a function which subtracts 1 from a number . these would be written as : `` g '' composed with `` f '' would be the function which doubles a number and `` then '' subtracts 1 from it : `` f '' composed with `` g '' would be the function which subtracts 1 from a number and `` then '' doubles it :
