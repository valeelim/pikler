Supermarine Spitfire     the supermarine spitfire is a british single-seat fighter aircraft . it was used by the royal air force and many other allied countries throughout the second world war . the spitfire was designed by r. j. mitchell as a short-range , high-performance interceptor aircraft . there were more spitfires made than any other british aircraft and it was the only british fighter that was being made throughout the war . the spitfire 's elliptical wing had a thin cross-section . this allowed a higher top speed than other fighters of the time , including the hawker hurricane . the elliptic shaped wing gives the aircraft a very low amount of induced drag . speed was seen as essential to carry out the mission of home defence against enemy bombers . the original airframe was designed to be powered by a rolls-royce merlin engine producing 1,030 hp ( 768 kw ) . because of its higher performance , spitfire units had a higher victory-to-loss ratio than units flying hurricanes .
