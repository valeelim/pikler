Independent Catholic churches     independent catholic churches is the name for a few christian churches which say that they have the traditions of the catholic church , but who are not recognised by the holy see . almost all of them say that their bishops have apostolic succession , that is that their legitimacy comes from an apostle . the first of these churches was the old catholic church , who did not agree that the pope was infallible , in religious matters . this was agreed at the first vatican council in 1870. most of the independent catholic churches split from the old catholic church . a notable exception is the society of st. pius x , a grouping of traditionalist priests , founded in the 1970s . communities such as the eastern orthodox , the oriental orthodox church , or the coptic orthodox church do not have the problem of recognition , as they are at least partially recognised by the roman catholic church . most independent catholic churches were created after 1870 .
