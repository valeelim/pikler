Fiscal policy     when a state uses taxes and government spending to influence the economy , this is known as fiscal policy in economics and political science . idea from john maynard keynes . the state can influence the following parameters : - aggregate demand and the level of economic activity - how resources are allocated - how wealth is distributed there are two basic kinds of taxes : those on revenue , and those on economic activity , usually called excise taxes . lowering the excise taxation will lead to increased economic activity , for example . changes in welfare also have an impact on economic activity . in general , fiscal policy is cyclic : effects which result from changes in fiscal policy need some time until they can be observed . certain schools of thought think that fiscal policy should not be used to influence the economy . this is the case for monetarism , which demands that keeping money at its value is the most important goal .
