Origen     origen ( or origenes , also origen ( es ) adamantius ) was an early christian scholar . he lived in alexandria in the 3rd century . he was born in the year 185 or 186 , and proably died around the year 254. today , he is regarded as one of the church fathers , but not as a saint . this is probably because he had some ideas , which were declared to be false later on . these ideas included that the human soul existed before conception , and entered the human body before birth ( generally known as pre-existence ) . another idea was that of the souls entering a different human body after death . a third idea , called apokatastasis , is that the reign of god would be restored when the world ends . these ideas were discussed by church fathers , but it was decided that they were false beliefs . the council of constantinople in 453 ce posthumously excommunicated origen , and the 2nd council of constantinople in 553 ce declared `` apokatastasis '' as heresy . however , in recent years the idea has found some reconsideration especially among restorationist christian groups .
