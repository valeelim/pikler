Division of Wills     the division of wills is an australian electoral division of victoria . the division includes the northern melbourne suburbs of brunswick , coburg , pascoe vale , fawkner , glenroy , and essendon airport . it was named after william john wills , of the burke and wills expedition . wills has been one of the safest labor seats in the country . it has been held by labor except between the 1992 by-election and the 1996 federal election . during this time it was held by independent phil cleary . the seat was held by prime minister bob hawke . the 1992 by-election is remarkable for a number of reasons . it was caused by bob hawke 's retirement from parliament . a record 22 people stood for election . it was won by an independent , phil cleary . however he was on unpaid leave from the state education system and the australian constitution forbids people employed by the government from standing for election . no replacement by-election was held as the court decision which threw out the results was made shortly before a general election was due .
