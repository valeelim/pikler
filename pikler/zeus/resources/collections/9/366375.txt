Mirage     a mirage is an image that is distorted by the atmosphere so that its form and location can look very different from the actual object . it is caused by the way light bends as it passes through layers of air of different temperatures . the words `` mirage '' and `` mirror '' come from the same root word , which means `` to look at . '' normally , light travels in a straight line , but it will change direction depending on what it passes through . this bending is called `` refraction . '' gases , such as air , become thinner as they get warmer . as a result , light tends to curve ( or refract ) towards the colder layer of air . this makes the image appear to come from a different direction than the original object . there are two basic types of mirage , depending on which direction the temperature changes , inferior and superior . an inferior mirage is arguably the most common type seen over land . air near solid ground is typically warmer than the air above it . when light from the sky passes through it , a shimmering , fragmented image of the sky may appear to come from the ground , resembling water .
