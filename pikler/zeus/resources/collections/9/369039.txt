Gene therapy     gene therapy means putting in a working gene to a person who has a damaged gene . the european commission has approved this method for one particular treatment . the treatment by the product `` glybera '' uses a virus to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene . the european commission has given `` glybera '' marketing authorisation , which means it can be sold throughout the eu . one in a million people have damaged copies of the lipase gene needed to break down fats . fat builds up in their blood ; this leads to pain and inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) . it is life-threatening . up to now , the only way to manage the condition is to have a very low-fat diet . when used in this way , a virus is a vector . that means it is a carrier ; the gene has been inserted into the viral genome , and the virus sticks it into the human cells . the technique is called transfection . this technique is different from the gene knockout technique , which does not use a viral vector . china was the first country to approve the commercial production of a gene therapy , in 2003. that gene therapy is for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) â€”a cancer that occurs in 10 % of new cancers in china . there are 2.5 million new cancer patients every year in china .
