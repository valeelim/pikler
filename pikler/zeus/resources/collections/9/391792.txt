Polyphenism     polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused a single genotype . the animal inherits the capability , but the environment determines which form develops . this contrasts with genetic polymorphism , where each morph ( form ) inherits a slightly different genome . polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch . the switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger . for example , the sex of crocodiles is determined by the prevailing temperature . their gender is a polyphenic trait , and is not determined by the usual sex linkage . the caste system of social insects is the division of labor between genetically identical individuals . polyphenism determines whether larvae develop into queens , workers , and in some cases soldiers . in the case of the ant , `` p. morrisi '' , an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen . this allows for control of the mating season , but like sex determination , limits the spread of the species into certain climates .
