La Reyne le veult     `` la reyne le veult '' ( `` the queen wills it '' ) or `` le roy le veult '' ( `` the king wills it '' ) is a norman french line used in the parliament of the united kingdom to show that a public or private bill has received royal assent from the monarch . the practice of giving royal assent came from william the conqueror to show that the king intended for something to be made law . norman french came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law , though latin continued to be used with it . the work of the parliament of england was conducted entirely in french until the latter part of edward iii 's reign ( 1327–1377 ) and english was only rarely used before the reign of henry vi ( 1422–61 , 1470–71 ) . royal assent was sometimes given in english , though more often in french . the practice of recording parliamentary statutes in french or latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in english ever since . during the period of the the protectorate , when the lord protector ( oliver cromwell and later his son richard ) governed the country , assent was given in english . the old practice of giving assent in norman french was resumed following the restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since . there has only been one attempt to remove it , when the house of lords passed a bill in 1706 `` for abolishing the use of the french tongue in all proceedings in parliament and courts of justice . '' the bill failed to pass the house of commons . although the use of french in courts was later abolished in 1731 , parliament 's practice was not affected .
