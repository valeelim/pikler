Eta Carinae     eta carinae ( η carinae or η car ) is a superbright hypergiant star in the constellation carina , about 7,500 to 8,000 light-years from the sun . the system contains at least two stars , of which the primary is a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) that initially had around 150 solar masses , of which it has lost at least 30. a hot supergiant of about 30 solar masses is in orbit around the primary . an enormous thick red nebula surrounding eta carinae makes it impossible to see this companion optically . the eta carinae system is inside the homunculus nebula , itself part of the much larger carina nebula . together they have a combined luminosity of over five million times the sun 's . it is not visible north of latitude 30°n and is seen moving round the pole south of latitude 30°s . due to its mass and the stage of its life , it is expected to explode as a supernova in the future . eta carinae was first recorded as a 4th magnitude star . it brightened from 1837 to 1856 in an event known as `` the great eruption '' . eta carinae became the second brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 march 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility .
