Temnospondyl     temnospondyls are an order of small to giant batrachomorph tetrapods . they lived worldwide from the carboniferous to the triassic . a few species continued into the lower cretaceous . the temnospondyls are similar or identical to the labyrinthodonts minus the lepospondyls . it is probably an evolutionary grade , not monophyletic . it is convenient to use , because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia . many in the early permian looked more like reptiles because they were adapted to life in a drier climate . nevertheless , they were amphibians , and many larval stages have been found . they are a large group of some 40 families and 160 genera . fossils have been found on every continent . their evolutionary history spans 210 million years . during this time , they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . fossils are known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . most temnospondyls were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . these temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . although temnospondyls are considered amphibians , many had characteristics such as scales , claws , and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have .
