Thioketone     a thioketone ( or thione ) is any molecule with the group rc=s . it is like a ketone with the oxygen atom changed with a sulfur one . the sulfur atom has a double bond with the carbon atom . it also keeps two lone pairs . thioketones are very reactive . this is because they are good electrophiles . many of them are unstable . they want to form rings . they do that with cycloaddition reactions , similar to the diels-alder reaction . if one of the r groups is hydrogen , the molecule is the sulfur version of an aldehyde . it is called a thial , and it is even more reactive than a thioketone .
