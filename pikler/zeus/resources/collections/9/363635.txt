Herero and Namaqua Genocide     the herero and namaqua genocide is considered to have been the first genocide of the 20th century . it took place between 1904 and 1907 in german south-west africa ( modern day namibia ) , during the scramble for africa . on january 12 , 1904 , the herero people , led by samuel maharero , rebelled against german colonial rule . in august , german general lothar von trotha defeated the herero in the battle of waterberg and drove them into the desert of omaheke , where most of them died of thirst . in october , the nama people also rebelled against the germans only to suffer a similar fate . in total , from 24,000 up to 100,000 herero and 10,000 nama died . the genocide was characterized by widespread death by starvation and thirst because the herero who fled the violence were prevented from returning from the namib desert . some sources also claim that the german colonial army systematically poisoned desert wells . in 1985 , the united nations ' whitaker report classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the herero and nama peoples of south-west africa , and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century . the german government recognized and apologized for the events in 2004 , but has ruled out financial compensation for the victims ' descendants .
