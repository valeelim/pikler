Wax tablet     a wax tablet is what the roman schools used instead of paper . they used a stylus to write with . the wax melted when warm , but was quite smooth when it set . wax tablets could also be used for messages , but ink on wood was more permanent ( see vindolanda ) . the romans also used ink on manuscripts , and could stitch the manuscripts together to make a codex . the earliest surviving example of a writing tablet dates to the later bronze age , 1400 bc . a boxwood writing tablet with an ivory hinge was found in 1986 , in the remains of a shipwreck , the uluburun shipwreck , near ka≈ü , turkey .
