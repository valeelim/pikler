Roman dodecahedron     roman dodecahedron is the name for dodecahedra which were found in europe . in total , over hundred such objects were found in all european parts of the roman empire . they date form the second or third century ce , and were made of bronze or stone . they are hollow , and each of the twelve pentangular faces has a hole in it . most of these were found on the territories of modern-day france and germany , but some were also found in hungary and great britain . they are between and in size . the function or use of the dodecahedra remains a mystery ; no mention of them has been found in texts or pictures of the time . speculated uses include candlestick holders ( wax was found inside one example ) ; dice ; survey instruments ; devices for determining the optimal sowing date for winter grain ; that they were used to calibrate water pipes ; and army standard bases . it has also been suggested that they may have been religious artifacts of some kind . this speculation is based on the fact that most of the examples have been found in gallo-roman sites .
