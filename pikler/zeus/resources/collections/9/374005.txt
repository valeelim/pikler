James Lovelock     james ephraim lovelock ch cbe frs ( born 26 july 1919 ) is an independent scientist who lives in devon . he became an environmentalist and futurologist . he is best known for proposing the gaia theory . this suggests the biosphere is a self-regulating system which keeps our planet healthy by controlling the environment . after the development of an instrument in the late 1960s , lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of cfcs in the atmosphere . he found a concentration of 60 parts per trillion of cfc-11 over ireland . he went on to measure the concentration of cfc-11 from the northern hemisphere to the antarctic aboard the research ship rrs `` shackleton '' . lovelock developed his gaia ideas after working for nasa on detecting life on mars . the gaia hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the earth form a complex interacting system that can be thought of as a single organism . named after the greek goddess gaia at the suggestion of novelist william golding , the idea is that the biosphere has a regulatory effect on the earth 's environment which acts to sustain life .
