Acarajé     acarajé is the most popular street food in the north eastern state of brazil , bahia . the recipe for acarajé was introduced to bahia by slaves who came from nigeria during the colonial period . in nigeria acarajé is named akara , and the women who sell it call out `` akara je '' , which means `` come and eat akara '' in yoruba . so when freed nigerian slaves started to sell acarajé on the streets , they used the same technique and brazilians assumed that they were selling acarajé . acarajé is made with black-eyed peas , garlic , ginger and salt , then deep fried in dende - a reddish oil from the palm fruit . when done , they are split in half and filled with vatapá , caruru , fried shrimp , salad and pepper . brazilians modified the recipe from nigeria a little and started to fill the acarajé with other afro-brazilian foods . in nigeria , none of the brazilian accompaniments are served ; just the bean cake is eaten , fried with palm oil or vegetable oil . acarajé are served on the streets by women who call themselves baiana do acarajé . they wear traditional clothes , white flowing dresses , sometimes turbans and colorful necklaces related to the rituals of the afro-brazilian religion candomblé . in nigeria , however , there is no ceremony and the women who sell akara wear whatever they like . nowadays , these baianas sell acarajé as a way of life and it ’ s something that helps to sustain their families .
