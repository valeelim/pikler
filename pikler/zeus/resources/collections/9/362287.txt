Toll-like receptor     toll-like receptors ( tlrs ) are proteins which act in the innate immune system and the digestive system . they are membrane-spanning , that is , they reach from the outside of the cell to the inside . tlrs recognize molecules which come from microbes . once microbes get through physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa , they are recognized by tlrs . the tlrs set up an immune cell response . tlr signalling leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response . in all , thousands of genes are activated by tlr signalling , and the tlrs are one of the most important means of gene modulation . toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells . most mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of toll-like receptors . thirteen tlrs ( tlr1 to tlr13 ) have been identified in humans and mice , and similar ones have been found in other mammalian species . tlrs are not identical in all mammals . for example , a gene coding for a protein like tlr10 in humans is present in mice , but seems to have been damaged at some time by a retrovirus . on the other hand , mice express tlrs 11 , 12 , and 13 , none of which is present in humans . other mammals may express tlrs that are not found in humans . non-mammalian species may have tlrs different from mammals .
