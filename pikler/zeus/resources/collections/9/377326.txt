Australian Labor Party (NSW)    australian labor party ( nsw ) the australian labor party ( nsw ) was an australian political party commonly known as lang labor . it was the new south wales branch of the australian labor party which broke away from the national party and acted independently from 1931 to 1936. in 1931 jack lang , the premier of new south wales , announced the `` lang plan '' . this plan would reduce the effects of the great depression . the main feature of the plan was to stop making loan repayments to foreign banks . this was the opposite of the policy of the federal labor government led by james scullin . as a result , lang 's supporters , led by jack beasley and eddie ward , were forced out of the federal caucus . this led to a split between the federal and state leaders of the labor party . in 1931 lang 's supporters voted with the united australia party opposition in the house of representatives to bring down the scullin government . this caused an early election . the new south wales branch ran candidates as the australian labor party ( new south wales ) . they were known as `` lang labor '' candidates . supporters of the federal party ( led in new south wales by ted theodore and ben chifley ) were known as federal labor candidates .
