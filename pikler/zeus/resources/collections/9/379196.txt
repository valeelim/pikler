Palaeoptera     the palaeoptera is the group of primitive ( basal ) winged insects which do not fold the wings back over the abdomen , as neoptera do . most of them are extinct ; the living ones are the ephemeroptera ( mayflies ) and odonata ( dragonflies and damselflies ) . the palaeoptera may not be monophyletic : the issue is not yet settled . on the other hand , the neoptera definitely are monophyletic . the absence of wing-folding does not necessarily mean the palaeoptera form a natural group . they may just be a group of insects that `` are not neoptera '' , in other words , a wastebasket taxon . as it stands , the relationship of the two living paleopteran groups to the neoptera is unclear . probably the concept of palaeoptera will be changed to better reflect insect evolution . in any case , three main palaeopteran lineages , traditionally treated as superorders , are recognized . of these , the palaeodictyopteroidea themselves might also be a paraphyletic assemblage of very basal pterygota . taxonomy . infraclass palaeoptera .
