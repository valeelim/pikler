Lens (optics)    lens ( optics ) a lens is a clear ( transparent ) object ( like glass , plastic or even a drop of water ) that changes the way things look by bending the light that goes through it . they may make things appear larger , smaller , or upside-down . some places lenses are used include spectacles ( eyeglasses ) , contact lenses , cameras , projectors , microscopes , telescopes , magnifying glasses , etc . each eye also has a lens . they work by refraction , or the bending of light . lenses have three main shapes . each different shape changes the image ( making it bigger or smaller ) . the three types are : - convex : the center part is thicker - concave : the center part is thinner - planar : flat the word `` lens '' comes from the latin word for `` lentil , '' because the earliest convex lenses in common use were shaped like the bean . the oldest written record of lenses is in the ancient greek play by aristophanes called `` clouds '' , where lenses were used with sunlight to make fire . galileo galilei is commonly believed to have used lenses to make the first known refracting telescope . however , he merely adapted and improved a design he learned from dutch lensmakers such as hans lippershey . he was probably the first to use telescopes to make accurate astronomical observations , though .
