Haplodiploidy     haplodiploidy is a sex determination system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid , and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid . haplodiploidy determines the sex in `` all '' members of the insect order hymenoptera ( bees , ants , and wasps ) , and the thysanoptera ( 'thrips ' ) . the system also occurs sporadically in some spider mites , coleopterans ( bark beetles ) and rotifers . in this system , sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives . an offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female , and an unfertilized egg develops as a male . this means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has , and are haploid . the haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities . most importantly , the relatedness between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. this means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems . it is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved . whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate .
