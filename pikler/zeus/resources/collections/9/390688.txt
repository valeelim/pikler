List of genetic disorders     this is a list of the most common genetic disorders in humans . if known , the type of mutation is shown , and the chromosome involved . - p – point mutation , or any insertion/deletion entirely inside one gene - d – deletion of a gene or genes - c – whole chromosome extra , missing , or both ( see chromosomal aberrations ) - t – trinucleotide repeat disorders : gene is extended in length many other conditions are known to be partly or wholly inherited , but their genetic basis is not yet clear . a good example is `` clefting '' ( cleft lip and palate ) , which occurs up to 4 per 1000 in native americans and some asian populations , but which is almost unknown in african populations . about 20 genes are under investigation .
