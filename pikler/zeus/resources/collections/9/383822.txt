Decompression sickness     decompression sickness is caused by bubbles which form in the blood and other body parts of people who have the pressure around them decrease too quickly . these bubbles may block the flow of blood and starve the body parts of oxygen , or the bubbles may cause damage by stretching , tearing , or pressing on the affected parts . decompression sickness is also called `` the bends . '' decompression sickness can happen to underwater divers who spend a lot of time in deep water , and return to the surface too quickly for the breathing gases dissolved in their bodies to escape without forming bubbles . people can also get decompression sickness if they are in a pressurised aeroplane or spacecraft and it is damaged and the air is lost . decompression sickness can be prevented by decreasing the pressure slowly . this allows the gases which have dissolved in the body to get out in the breathing air without forming bubbles . divers find out how slowly to come up by using decompression tables or a dive computer . they may need to stop on the way up to wait for enough gas to get out before it is safe to go up further . this is called a decompression stop . the tables or computer will inform the divers what depths they must stop at and how long they must stay at each depth .
