Delta Cephei     delta cephei ( δ cep , δ cephei ) is a binary star system about 887 light-years away in the northern constellation of cepheus , the king . at this distance , the apparent magnitude of the star is reduced by 0.23 as a result of gas and dust along the line of sight . delta cephei , found by john goodricke in 1784 , was only the second cepheid variable discovered . it is very important because its distance is extremely well known . this is partly because it is in a star cluster , close enough for the precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes to give a good result . as a result , it is known as a `` fundamental distance calibrator '' , or absolute candle . delta cephei is a classical , or type i , cepheid variable . the only cepheid variable closer to us is polaris , the north star , whose distance is still not exactly known . delta cephei is emitting around 2,000 times the sun 's luminosity . this is producing a strong stellar wind , which , with the pulsations and shocks in the star 's atmosphere , is ejecting mass at the rate of masses per year . this is the equivalent to the mass of the sun roughly every million years . the matter is flowing outward at a velocity of about 35 km s. this expelled gas forms a nebula about one parsec across , centered on delta cephei , and contains 0.07–0.21 solar masses of neutral hydrogen . a bow shock is being formed where the stellar wind is colliding with the surrounding interstellar medium .
