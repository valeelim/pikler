Pernicious anemia     pernicious anemia is a medical problem that causes a person to have too few red blood cells ( anemia ) because their intestines can not absorb vitamin b12 properly . a special protein , called intrinsic factor , helps the body get vitamin b12 from food such as meat , poultry and dairy foods . intrinsic factor is made by cells in the stomach . if there is not enough intrinsic factor , the small intestine is unable to get the vitamin b12 . there are several causes of pernicious anemia . these include a weakened stomach lining or a problem with the body 's immune system , which causes it to attack the intrinsic factor . in some rare cases it can be passed down through families . treatment is usually a regular injection of vitamin b12 . intrinsic factor was discovered by thomas addison .
