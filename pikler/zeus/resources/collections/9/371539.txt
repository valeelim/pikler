Binocular vision     binocular vision is vision in which both eyes are used together . it can mean having two eyes instead of one , but more often it means having a visual field which is put together by the brain with input from both eyes . this is the standard equipment for vertebrates and many other types of animals . humans have a maximum horizontal field of view of about 200 degrees with two eyes . about 120 degrees make up the binocular field of view ( seen by both eyes ) , and two side fields of about 40 degrees seen by only one eye . our system of vision gives precise depth information , called stereopsis . such binocular vision is usually accompanied by singleness of vision or `` binocular fusion '' , in which a single image is seen even though each eye has its own image of an object . stereopsis is the impression of depth we get when we look at a scene with both eyes . binocular viewing of a scene creates two slightly different images of the scene in the two eyes due to the eyes ' different positions on the head . these differences give information that the brain uses to calculate depth in the visual scene . the term 'stereopsis ' is often used as short hand for 'binocular vision ' , 'binocular depth perception ' or 'stereoscopic depth perception ' , though strictly speaking , the impression of depth associated with stereopsis can also be got under other conditions , such as when an observer views a scene with only one eye while moving . observer motion creates differences in the single retinal image over time similar to binocular disparity ; this is referred to as `` motion parallax '' .
