Resusci Anne     resusci anne , also known as rescue anne , resusci annie or cpr annie , is a training mannequin used for teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) . it is for both emergency workers and members of the general public . resusci anne was made by norwegian toy maker Ã¥smund laerdal . it was based on the research of peter safar and james elam . it was first used in 1960. the mannequin is made to be just like the human respiratory system and outer body in order to help training . since its first use , several different versions of resusci anne have been introduced . these include versions with computer monitoring , and versions that seem like other emergency medical conditions , such as severe wounds and trauma . trainees using the original resusci anne were expected to approach the mannequin . after getting no response , the trainees then administered cpr to the mannequin . this system was meant to teach trainees that not all victims require cpr . if a victim can respond when asked if okay , the victim does not need cpr .
