Minkowski spacetime     in special relativity , the minkowski spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold , created by hermann minkowski . it has four dimensions : three dimensions of space ( x , y , z ) and one dimension of time . minkowski spacetime has a metric signature of ( -+++ ) and is always flat . the convention in this article is to call minkowski spacetime simply spacetime . however , minkowski spacetime only applies in special relativity . general relativity used the notion of curved spacetime to describe the effects of gravity and accelerated motion . spacetime can be thought of as a four-dimensional coordinate system in which the axes are given by formula_1 they can also be denoted by formula_2 where formula_3 represents formula_4 . the reason for measuring time in units of the speed of light times the time coordinate is so that the units for time are the same as the units for space . spacetime has the differential for arc length given by formula_5 this implies that spacetime has a metric tensor given by
