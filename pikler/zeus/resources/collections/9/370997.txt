Ghost Dance     ghost dance was a new religious movement among native americans . it was active from about 1860 to about 1890. these people had been forced to change their ways of life , and had lost much of their culture and identity . the ghost dance promised them that if they performed the `` dance '' and lived the right way , they could re-unite the living and the dead , they would again be given most of the things they had lost to the whites , and the people who had caused such misery would be driven away from their land . there were also real dance rituals that they did to represent their spiritual path . there was a lot of activity twice : the first time around 1860 , and the second time around 1890. around 1860 , a native american ( paiute ) called `` wodziwob '' had a vision . he saw that the white people would be driven away , and the people would be reunited with their ancestors ' spirits , called `` ghosts '' . he was also told how to do the dance ritual . the movement spread rapidly . each tribe added its own elements into the ghost dance . the first phase ended around 1872 , because it did not have success , and wodzivob said that he was possibly wrong .
