Great Australian Bight     the great australian bight is a large bight , or open bay . it is off the central and western parts of the southern coastline of mainland australia . the bight 's boundaries are from cape pasley , western australia , to cape carnot , south australia . this is a distance of 1,160 km or 720 miles . the much more accepted name in australia for the connected waterbody is the southern ocean rather than the indian ocean . the settlements along the coastline with access to the bight and facilities are ceduna and eucla . some other locations on the eyre highway or on the nullarbor do not have facilities or easy access . the coast line of the great australian bight has cliff faces ( up to 60 m high ) , surfing beaches and rock platforms , ideal for whale-watching . the great australian bight receives very little of the runoff that fertilises most continental shelves . it is essentially a marine desert . it is probably best noted for the large number of sharks that frequent its coastal waters , as well as the increasing numbers of southern right whales that migrate in the region .
