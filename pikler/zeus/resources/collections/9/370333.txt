Sidney Altman     sidney altman ( born may 7 , 1939 ) is a canadian-american molecular biologist . he is currently professor of molecular , cellular , and developmental biology and chemistry at yale university . in 1989 he shared the nobel prize in chemistry with thomas cech for their work on the catalytic properties of rna . altman is of jewish descent . altman 's nobel prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme rnase p. rnase p is a ribonucleoprotein particle , part rna and part protein . originally it was thought that , in the bacterial rnase p complex , the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex . during experiments in which the complex was taken apart and put together in test tubes , altman and his group discovered a remarkable thing . the rna component , in isolation , was enough for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme . this was remarkable because , previously , it was thought that only enzymes could catalyse reactions in living cells . altman 's research showed that rna itself had catalytic properties . this was the discovery that earned him the nobel prize .
