Parable of the Mustard Seed     the parable of the mustard seed is one of the parables of jesus . it is found in three of the gospels of the new testament : gospel of matthew ( 13:31–32 ) , gospel of mark ( 4:30–32 ) , and gospel of luke ( 13:18–19 ) . the differences among the three tellings are minor . in matthew and luke , this parable is followed by the parable of the leaven . the parable of the leaven also has a theme about the kingdom of heaven growing from small beginnings . a version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical gospel of thomas 20. the parable from matthew reads : `` the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field ; which indeed is smaller than all seeds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . '' the parables from mark and luke are similar .
