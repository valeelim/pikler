Rigidly rotating disk paradox     in theoretical physics , a branch of physics , the rigidly rotating disk paradox , sometimes called the ehrenfest paradox , is a paradox concerning a rotating disk . basically , the paradox says that when a disk ( or any circular object in general ) is rotated , it will have a smaller circumference than 2πr , because the radius will remain the same , but the circumference is shortened due to the lorentz contraction . for a more detailed explanation , see below . if the rotating disk has an angular velocity of `` ω '' , and a radius of `` r '' , then the circumference of the disk is `` ω '' ·r . so the circumference will undergo a lorentz contraction of formula_1 . however , the radius , r , will not undergo a lorentz contraction since it is perpendicular to the direction of motion . therefore , the circumference divided by the diameter will end up being a little bit less than formula_2 . the simpler definition is given by the following . to an observer `` x '' riding on the edge of the rotating disk , the effects of high-speed motion are still in place . so , if `` x '' were to crawl along the circumference with a ruler and measure the circumference , his ruler will be shortened ( due to the lorentz contraction ) and he will have to lay out his ruler `` more times '' to measure the circumference . therefore , he will measure the circumference to be `` greater '' than he would measure it to be if the disk were stationary .
