Honeyeater     the honeyeaters are a large family of small to medium sized birds which feed on nectar . they are most common in australia and new guinea , but are also found in new zealand , the pacific islands as far east as samoa and tonga , and the islands to the north and west of new guinea . bali , on the other side of the wallace line , has a single species . honeyeaters and the australian chats ( epthianura ) make up the family meliphagidae . in total there are 182 species in 42 genera . about half of them live in australia , and many of the others are from new guinea . although honeyeaters look and behave much like other nectar-feeding birds around the world ( such as the sunbirds and flowerpeckers ) , they are not related . there is an important partnership between honeyeaters and australian flowering plants . a great many australian plants are fertilised by honeyeaters , particularly the proteaceae , myrtaceae , and epacridaceae . it is known that the honeyeaters are important in new zealand as well , and scientists believe they are just as important in other areas .
