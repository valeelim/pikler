Kepler-22b     kepler-22b is an extrasolar planet orbiting ( going around ) g-type star kepler-22 . it is located about 600 light years away from earth in the constellation cygnus . it was found by nasa 's kepler space telescope . it is also the first known planet to orbit within the habitable zone of a sun-like star . kepler-22b 's first transit in front of its host sun was observed on kepler 's third day of scientific operations in mid-2009 . kepler-22b 's third transit was detected in late 2010. the spitzer space telescope provided more data that confirmed kepler-22b 's transits . on december 5 , 2011 , the confirmation of the existence of kepler-22b was announced . kepler-22b 's radius is roughly 2.4 times the radius of earth . its mass and surface composition remain unknown , with only some very rough estimates established : it has less than 124 earth masses at the 3 sigma confidence limit , and less than 36 earth masses at 1 sigma confidence . it is thought that the object has a mass similar to that of neptune ( ~35 earth masses ) . another possibility is that kepler-22b is an `` ocean-like '' world . it might also be comparable to the water-rich planet gj 1214 b although kepler-22b , unlike gj 1214 b , is in the habitable zone . if it has an earth-like composition , the compression of material in the interior of the planet would give an overall mass greater than 40 earth masses . such a planet would also produce surface gravity greater than 7 times that on earth . this is ruled out to at least 1-sigma uncertainty by radial velocity measurements of the system , suggesting kepler-22b does not have earth-like composition . it is likely to have a more volatile-rich composition with a liquid or gaseous outer shell ; this would make it similar to kepler-11f , the smallest known gas planet .
