Human genome     the human genome is stored on 23 chromosome pairs in the cell nucleus and in the small mitochondrial dna . a great deal is now known about the sequences of dna which are on our chromosomes . what the dna actually does is now partly known . applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun . the human genome project ( hgp ) produced a reference sequence which is used worldwide in biology and medicine . `` nature '' published the publicly funded project 's report , and `` science '' published celera 's paper . these papers described how the draft sequence was produced , and gave an analysis of the sequence . improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005 , filling in to â‰ˆ92 % of the sequence . the latest project encode studies the way the genes are controlled . the human genome contains just over 20,000 protein-coding genes , far fewer than had been expected . in fact , only about 1.5 % of the genome codes for proteins , while the rest consists of non-coding rna genes , regulatory sequences , and introns .
