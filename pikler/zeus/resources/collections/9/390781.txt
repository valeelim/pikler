Thalassaemia     thalassaemia ( or thalassemia ) is a genetic disorder of the blood which originated in the mediterranean region . this disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells . this is caused by mutant genes which affect how the body makes haemoglobin . haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen . people with thalassaemia make less haemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal , which results in mild or severe anemia . thalassaemia can cause significant complications , including pneumonia , iron overload , bone deformities and cardiovascular illness . however , this inherited disease of red blood cells gives a degree of protection against malaria , which is or was common in the regions where the trait is common . this selective survival advantage for carriers ( known as heterozygous advantage ) is responsible for keeping the mutation in populations way above its mutation rate . carriers are heterozygous for the thalassaemia allele , meaning only one of their two alleles is mutant ( abnormal ) . there are a number of different versiona of thalassaemia . each one is caused by a mutation in a different position in the genome .
