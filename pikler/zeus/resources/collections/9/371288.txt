Lady Garden Park     the lady garden park ( originally ladies ' garden ) is a public park in abbottabad town , pakistan . the park was established soon after the foundation of abbotabad town itself ( january 1853 ) by major james abbott . as distinct from the `` company bagh '' ( east india company park ) which was also founded down in the main bazaar for the recreation of `` natives '' , the ladies garden was exclusively for the use of european or `` white '' ladies and families . it was laid out over a whole block of the urban military cantonment area , opposite to st luke 's church , abbottabad . a number of trees and flowers imported from england and other places were also planted here . while the british raj in india lasted , this park retained its exclusive character , but after the independence of pakistan in 1947 , it was opened to all the general public . the park is a very popular recreational place for the citizens of abbottabad . apart from the general , open area with lawns and walks etc. , a section has also been segregated for women and children , with swings , slides , see-saws and so on . a small snack-bar and benches are also placed in a pleasant location , under some fine old trees . a special feature of the park is the copy of the farewell poem written by major abbott , the town 's founder , which has been carved on a big stone slab beneath a majestic cedar tree . many tourists come to see and read this and get themselves photographed here ( see link below for abbott poem text ) .
