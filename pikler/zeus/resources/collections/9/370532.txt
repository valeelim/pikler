Thetford Hoard     the thetford hoard , or thetford treasure , is a hoard of romano-british metalwork found at gallows hill , near thetford in norfolk , in november 1979. it is now in the british museum . dating from the mid- to late-4th century ad , this hoard is a collection of thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers , twenty-two gold finger rings , four gold bracelets , four necklace pendants , five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps , a gold amulet designed as a pendant , an unmounted engraved gem , four beads ( one emerald and three of glass ) , and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr . a small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard . the find was made under unfortunate circumstances . the site had been recently cleared for building work , and the finder was using a metal-detector without the knowledge and permission of the owners of the site . the discovery was made late on a november day , in failing light . the finder recovered the material in great haste , probably overlooking some small items , because he knew he had no legal right to search in that area . he did not , as the law requires , report his discovery to the authorities . instead , he unwisely attempted to sell the objects he had found to private buyers .
