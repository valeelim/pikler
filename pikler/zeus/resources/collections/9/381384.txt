Ghost in the Machine     the `` ghost in the machine '' is a metaphor in philosophy . the philosopher gilbert ryle called mind the `` ghost in the machine '' , and the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken `` official doctrine '' . ryle was referring to ren√© descartes ' mind-body dualism . in dualist systems like descartes ' , mental activity carries on in parallel to physical action , but the means of interaction are unknown or speculative . ryle thought this was absurd , and as a kind of error which he called a `` category mistake '' . it is like saying something like `` cars move by motive spirit '' .
