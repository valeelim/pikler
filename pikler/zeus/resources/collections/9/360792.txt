Containerization     containerization is a system of freight transport based on a range of steel containers ( `` shipping containers '' , `` iso containers '' etc. ) . containers are built to standardized sizes . they can be loaded and unloaded , stacked , transported over long distances . they can be transferred from one mode of transport to another—ships , rail and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened . the system developed after world war ii . it led to greatly reduced transport costs , and supported a great increase in international trade . containerization has its origins in coal mining regions in england from the late 18th century onwards . `` loose boxes '' were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s , at places like the bridgewater canal . they were used for moving coal on and off barges . by the 1830s , railroads on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport . the liverpool and manchester railway in the united kingdom was one such . `` simple timber boxes , four to a wagon , they were used to convey coal from the lancashire collieries to liverpool , where they were transferred to horse drawn carts by crane '' . by the 1840s , iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones . the early 1900s saw closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail .
