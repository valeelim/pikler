Kerning     in typography , kerning is changing the space between two letters to make the text easier to read . usually , this means that letters look equally spaced , and two letters are never too close together or too far apart . if two letters are too close together or too far apart that would make it difficult to read the plain text message . the purpose of kerning , and most other typography is to make the printed or screen text more legible , that is , easier to read , and also more attractive . a related idea is typographic ligature . this is when two letters are formed so they fit together . in traditional metal type printing , ligatures were formed from lead in certain pairs . it is basically the same idea as kerning , but done automatically .
