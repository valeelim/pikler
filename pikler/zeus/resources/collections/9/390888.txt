Sylvanian Families     sylvanians were origanally set in japan in the 1950 's most of the families are rural middle-class with many luxuries and local buisnesses . they have many leisure activities such as horse riding , rowing and hosting garden parties . the simple caravan means that they can enjoy short stays on holiday . this means that they can be away from their house whether it is a small cottage or a multi-storey town house . in 1985 sylvanian families were launched in both japan and north america . they were such a success that in 1987 they moved over the atlantic to western europe and to the uk . by 1988 these small toys were a major success world wide , they went on to win london toy of the year award 3 times in a row this had never been achieved before or after . they were so popular that in the late 80 's an animated tv series was made , this was greatly watched and spain and the uk . in the 90 's it was aired on american tv . by the mid 90 's sylvanian families , despite their major success , had gone out of business in the uk . the production company tomy lost the rights to sylvanian families and american calico critters . in the late 90 's another company , flair , took over sylvanian families and reintroduced them into the uk . it was in 2007 that they celebrated their 20th birthday a special edition dalmation family ( that had not been sold since they went out of production ) with red party hats saying 'happy birthday ' . 2012 was the 25th birthday and they sold a celebration rabbit family in honour a birthday that they never have seen if it had n't have been for flair .
