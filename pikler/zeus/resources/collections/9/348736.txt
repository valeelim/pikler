Global dimming     global dimming is the slow decrease in the irradiance at the earth 's surface . irradiance is the power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area . one of the possible causes of global dimming is pollution . it affects the water cycle by decreasing evaporation and by decreasing the rain in some areas . global dimming also causes the earth to cool down . this cooling effect may cover the effect of greenhouse gases caused by global warming . air pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space . the pollutants can also become the core for cloud droplets . water droplets in clouds fuse around the pollutants . more pollutants create clouds with more number of smaller droplets . the smaller droplets make clouds to reflect more light . this causes more sunlight to be reflected back into space and less light reaches the earth 's surface . clouds stop the heat from both going in and out from the earth . this process is complex and it changes according to the time , location and the height above the sea level . during the day , more sunlight stops from going in . this cools down the earth . during the night , the heat in earth stops from going out . this slows down the heat from going out the earth .
