Glires     glires ( from latin `` glīrēs '' , dormice ) is a clade ( sometimes ranked as grandorder ) consisting of rodents and lagomorphs ( rabbits , hares , and pikas ) . this hypothesis that these form a monophyletic group has been long debated based on morphological evidence , although recent morphological studies strongly support monophyly of glires .
