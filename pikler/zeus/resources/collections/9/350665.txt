Chemical database     a chemical database is a database specifically designed to store chemical information . this information is about chemical and crystal structures , spectra , reactions and syntheses , and thermophysical data . chemical structures are usually shown using lines ( that indicate chemical bonds between atoms ) and drawn on paper . computer search algorithm and storage can not use this method . small molecules or ligands , are usually represented using lists of atoms and their connections . large molecules like protein are shown using their building blocks , amino acids and the order of these . large chemical databases for structures allow users to store and search for millions of molecules . therefore , they take up terabytes of memory . chemical literature connect structures or properties of chemicals to academic papers or patents related to them . examples of this type are stn , scifinder , and reaxys . crystallographic databases store x-ray crystal structure data . common examples include protein data bank and cambridge structural database .
