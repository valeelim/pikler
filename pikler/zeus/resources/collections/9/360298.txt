Danger triangle of the face     the danger triangle of the face is a triangle with two corners at both corners of the mouth and one corner in the middle of the nose between the eyes . the way the blood flows to the human nose is special , so it is possible ( but not likely ) for infections to spread directly to the brain from a cut , scratch or a popped pimple . the path this infection would take would be back up the wrong way of a vein ( called the ophthalmic veins ) that runs from an empty hollow in the middle of the head at the bottom of the skull called the cavernous sinus . the cavernous sinus lies partly inside the skull , under the layers of protection against infection . the cavernous sinus is a way a lot of blood flows away from the brain back down the neck . many people wrongly assume that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system . in fact , almost all people , but not all , have valves in the veins of the face . but even with one way valves , blood flow between the facial vein and cavernous sinus can spread infection from the face ; it is the direction of blood flow that is important .
