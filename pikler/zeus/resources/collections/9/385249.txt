Human Connectome Project     the human connectome project is a us-led effort to map the human brain . the hcp is a five-year project funded by the national institutes of health.on september 15 , 2010 , the nih announced that it would award two grants : $ 30 million over five years to a consortium led by washington university in saint louis and the university of minnesota , and $ 8.5 million over three years to a consortium led by harvard university , massachusetts general hospital and the university of california los angeles . the aim of the $ 40m programme is to map the entire human neural wiring system by scanning the brains of 1,200 americans . the project uses magnetic resonance imaging . like the human genome project , the data will be publicly released to scientists as the scans are processed . the first data from 80 to100 people will be released in a few weeks ' time . scientists at massachusetts general hospital are pushing the technique to its limits with a purpose-built scanner . it is one of the most powerful scanners in the world . the scanner 's magnets need 22mw ( megawatts ) of electricity enough to power a nuclear submarine . it was specially built for this project `` 4 to 8 times as powerful as conventional systems , enabling imaging of human neuroanatomy with much greater sensitivity than is currently possible '' .
