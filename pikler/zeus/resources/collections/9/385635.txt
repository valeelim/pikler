The Quarrymen     the quarrymen ( also written as `` the quarry men '' ) were a british skiffle and rock and roll band . it was formed by john lennon in liverpool in 1956. the band evolved into the beatles in 1960. originally , it consisted of lennon and several of his friends from school . the quarrymen took their name from a line in the anthem of their high school , quarry bank high school . lennon 's mother , julia lennon , taught her son to play the banjo and then showed lennon and eric griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo , and taught them simple chords and songs . lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the blackjacks , but changed the name before any public performances . some accounts credit lennon with choosing the new name ; other accounts credit his close friend pete shotton with suggesting the name . the quarrymen played at parties , school dances , cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before paul mccartney joined the band in october 1957. george harrison joined the band in early 1958 at mccartney 's recommendation , though lennon initially resisted because he felt harrison ( still only 14 when he was first introduced to lennon ) to be too young . both mccartney and harrison attended the liverpool institute .
