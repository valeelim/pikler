Alkyne     an alkyne is a molecule that has a triple bond between two carbon atoms . they have general formula ch . they are also called acetylenes . the smallest alkyne is acetylene , also called ethyne . alkynes are hydrophobic : this means they dissolve well in organic solvents but not in water . alkynes are more reactive than usual hydrocarbons . for example , they are more reactive than alkenes in many reactions . if the alkyne is at the end of a molecule , it is easy to remove the proton with a strong base . then , the alkyne can be used in addition reactions . for example , it can be added to a ketone . alkynes are also easy to reduce to double bonds . they can be made into both `` trans '' and `` cis '' double bonds . alkynes are also used a lot in pericyclic reactions . alkynes have a 180 degrees angle between the two carbon atoms . for this reason , they do not like to be in a cyclic compound . some examples of alkynes are shown below .
