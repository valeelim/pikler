Boeing 737 Classic     the boeing 737 classic is a family of boeing 737s . the boeing 737 classic series is made up of the boeing 737-300 , -400 and -500. these planes were not called the 737 classics until the boeing 737 next generation family was made . before the 737 next generation family , the 737 classics were called the 'new generation ' . the 737 classics were made from 1984 to 2000 . 1,988 aircraft were made . after the boeing 737-200 advanced was made , boeing wanted to make the 737 carry more passengers and fly further . boeing began designing the 737 classics in 1979. in 1980 , information about the 737 classic series was given at the farnborough airshow . the 737 classics had cfm56 turbofan engines . these engines were a very big improvement . they burned less fuel and made less noise . however , when the 737 is on the ground , the bottom of the plane is quite close to the ground . this meant that if the engines were not changed , they would be too close to the ground . boeing and cfmi solved this by putting the engine in front of the wing , instead of below it . they also moved some parts of the engine to the side of the engine , instead of the bottom . these changes mean that the front of the 737 engines are not circles .
