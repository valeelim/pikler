Sea of Marmara     the sea of marmara , also known as the sea of marmora or the marmara sea , is the inland sea that connects the black sea to the aegean sea . it separates turkey 's asian and european parts . the bosphorus strait connects it to the black sea and the dardanelles strait to the aegean . the sea has an area of 11,350 km² ( 280 km x 80 km ) with the greatest depth reaching 1,370 m. the salinity of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand . this is slightly greater than that of the black sea but only about two-thirds that of most oceans . the water is much more saline at the sea-bottom , averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand — similar to that of the mediterranean sea . water from the susurluk , biga ( granicus ) and gonen rivers reduces the salinity of the sea . there are two major island groups known as the princes ' and marmara islands . the south coast of the sea includes the gulf of izmit , the gulf of gemlik and the gulf of erdek . the north anatolian fault , which has started many major earthquakes in recent years , such as the izmit earthquake of 1999 , runs under the sea .
