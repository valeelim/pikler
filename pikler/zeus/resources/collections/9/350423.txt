Gallia Belgica     gallia belgica ( sometimes called belgica prima ) was a roman province . different parts of it are in several countries today , including belgium , the entire south of the netherlands , a part of france between paris , belgium , the english channel , and the ardennes , and the rhineland part of germany , which is between the rhine river in the east , and belgium and the netherlands in the west . in other words , it includes a large part of the part of europe called the low countries . the people who lived in gallia belgica were called the belgae . they were a group of tribes within the bigger country called gaul , which covered all of modern france . according to julius caesar , the belgae were different . he said that the border between belgica and the main celtic part of gaul was the marne and the seine rivers and that the border with germania was the rhine river . it is no longer certain what language or languages were spoken in gallia belgica , but historians know there was an influence of both celtic and germanic languages .
