Hydrometer     a hydrometer is an instrument used to measure the specific gravity ( or relative density ) of liquids ; that is , the ratio of the density of the liquid to the density of water . a hydrometer is usually made of glass and consists of a cylindrical stem and a bulb weighted with mercury or lead shot to make it float upright . the liquid to be tested is poured into a tall container , often a graduated cylinder , and the hydrometer is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely . the point at which the surface of the liquid touches the stem of the hydrometer is noted . hydrometers usually contain a scale inside the stem , so that the specific gravity can be read directly . a variety of scales exist , and are used depending on the context . hydrometers may be calibrated for different uses , such as a lactometer for measuring the density ( creaminess ) of milk , a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugars in a liquid , or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of alcohol in spirits .
