Gauss's law    gauss 's law gauss 's law ( or gauss 's flux theorem ) is a law of physics . the law is about the relationship between electric charge and the resulting electric field . in words , gauss 's law states that : the law was created by carl friedrich gauss in 1835. however , it was not published until 1867. it is one of the four maxwell 's equations on classical electrodynamics . the other three are gauss 's law for magnetism , faraday 's law of induction , and amp√®re 's circuital law . other websites . - mit video lecture series ( 30 x 50 minute lectures ) - electricity and magnetism taught by professor walter lewin . - section on gauss 's law in an online textbook - `` gauss 's law for spherical symmetry '' ( pdf file ) by peter signell for project physnet . - `` gauss 's law applied to cylindrical and planar charge distributions ( pdf file ) by peter signell for project physnet .
