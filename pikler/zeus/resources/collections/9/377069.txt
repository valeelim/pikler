Fallingwater     fallingwater is the name of the summer house frank lloyd wright designed in 1935 for the kaufmann family . it is in the woods over a waterfall in pennsylvania . it is a nationally listed national historic place , and some say it is the most famous private house in the world . the house actually sits low in the valley over the stream , but looks dramatic from further downstream . it has large terraces , and some of them stick straight out and hang right over the waterfall or the stream . there are windows and glass doors , with only narrow steel supports between them , wrapping all the way around the living room . there are also windows going all the way from the floor to the ceiling in all three stories of the tower . most of the house is made from stone . there are strong horizontal and vertical lines in the design of the house . it resembles the horizontal and vertical lines in the rock formations and other natural features . the waterfall can be heard everywhere in the house . wright wanted there to be a close connection between inside and outside , and for the house itself to be natural .
