Play (activity)    play ( activity ) play is a word used in psychology and ethology to describe voluntary activities associated with recreational pleasure and enjoyment , and with early learning in mammals . although everyone understands what the word means , it is extremely difficult to define . play is usually connected with children and their juvenile-level activities , but it can also be a useful adult activity , and occurs among other higher-functioning animals as well . many of the most prominent researchers in the field of psychology ( including william james , sigmund freud , carl jung , jean piaget and lev vygotsky ) have viewed play as endemic to the human species . play may be frivolous ; but it may be serious . a player can be intently focused on his or her objective ( `` in the zone '' ) , particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented , as in a game . accordingly , play can range from relaxed , free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive . there have been two major reviews of research into animal play , and both have said it is extremely difficult to define . play is almost universal in very young mammals , and also in some groups of birds such as parrots and ravens . therefore , it must have a function , but what is that function ? it is definitely not immediate survival . in fact , the young animals of many species may risk their lives playing . yet , since it survives in so many species , it must have survival value . that , as fagan says , is a paradox .
