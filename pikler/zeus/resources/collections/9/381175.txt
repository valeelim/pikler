'' chardin 's subjects were popular with all classes of society , including the aristocracy . the national gallery writes , `` perhaps their appeal rested in their sense of order , of things in their proper place . chardin anticipated the popularity of paintings of `` sensibility , '' which increased from the 1740s on , telling a colleague that `` one uses color , but one paints with sentiment .
