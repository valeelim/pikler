Badlands     badlands are a type of dry terrain which is extremely difficult to move across . it happens when softer rock is eroded by wind and water , leaving harder rock sticking up . canyons , ravines , gullies and other such geological forms are common in badlands . they are very difficult to cross by foot , on horse , or by car . dry badlands may have spectacular colour displays that range from dark black/blue coal strata to bright clays and sandstone . the term 'badlands ' is apt : badlands have steep slopes , loose dry soil , slick clay , and deep sand , all of which act against travel and other uses . they form in dry regions with infrequent but intense rain-showers , little vegetation , and soft sediments which get massive erosion . some of the most famous fossil beds are found in badlands , where erosion rapidly exposes the sedimentary layers and the scant cover of vegetation makes surveying and fossil hunting relatively easy . coal seams get exposed in some badlands , so some coal mining districts have developed in badlands areas . an example of this is the drumheller district of the red deer river in alberta , where the atlas coal mine historical site shows the last of 139 mines which operated in the badlands .
