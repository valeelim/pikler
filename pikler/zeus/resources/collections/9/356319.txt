Cornus canadensis     cornus canadensis is a herbaceous member of the cornaceae ( dogwood ) family . it has various common names , such as the bunchberry dogwood , canadian bunchberry , quatre-temps , or crackerberry . it is a widespread plant of the northern hemisphere . it grows about 20–30 cm tall and bears tiny flowers a few millimetres across . they form an inflorescence at the center of four white , petal-like bracts 3–4 cm diameter . each flower has highly elastic petals that flip backward , releasing springy filaments that are cocked underneath the petals . the filaments snap upward flinging pollen out in less than half a millisecond . the pollen experiences a force two to three thousand times the force of gravity . the bunchberry has one of the fastest plant actions found so far . it needs a camera capable of shooting 10,000 frames per second to catch the action . in other words , it is a mechanism for cross-pollination by air . the fruits are edible with a mild flavour somewhat like apples . the large seeds within are somewhat hard and crunchy . birds are the main dispersal agents of the seeds , consuming the fruit during their fall migration . in alaska , bunchberry is an important forage plant for mule deer , black-tailed deer and moose , which consume it throughout the growing season .
