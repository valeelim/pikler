Humoral immunity     the body 's immune system defends against invading organisms and other outside material that can infect the body . one part of the immune system is called the humoral immune system , which is specifically for defending against infectious invaders that are in the blood or other body fluids . the main cells that make it work are the b cells , which create and secrete antibodies that seek out the invaders and attach to them . once the invader is coated in antibodies , this targets the invader for destruction by other parts of the immune system . before the b cell can create antibodies , it first needs t helper cells to 'teach ' the b cell about details of the incoming invader . that way the b cell can then create antibodies that specifically target only that invading organism and do not accidentally target parts of your own body for destruction as well . of course this whole process takes time , about a day or two , so the humoral immune system does not create a quick defense against new invaders you have never encountered before . however , if your b cells have dealt with this specific invader before in the past , then the antibodies against that invader is already present in your blood , or the b cells that have fought this invader in the past can quickly create new antibodies against it again . so if your b cells have fought this invader in the past , then it can often fight off that invader again but quickly this time , so that the re-invader is killed quickly before it can start setting up house in your body again . this is why , in some cases , after a human has been sick with a specific illness and then fought it off , they can not get sick with it again . your b cells and the antibodies they produce make you immune to that specific invader infection .
