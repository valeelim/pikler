Thioester     a thioester is a molecule with a group c-s-co-c. they are like esters , but with a sulfur atom instead of an oxygen one . like esters , they can be made from carboxylic acids . in the synthesis , a thiol is used instead of an alcohol . thioesters are very important in biochemistry . they are made in the body during reactions that make fatty acids . they are also important intermediates in the production of atp , which is the molecule that gives energy to the body . in chemistry , thioesters can be also used as electrophiles . they are more reactive than esters and amides . they can also do aldol reactions .
