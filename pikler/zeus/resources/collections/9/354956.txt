Fax     fax ( short for facsimile ) , or telecopying , is the transmission of scanned printed material ( both text and images ) , to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device . the original document is scanned with a fax machine ( or a telecopier ) , which turns the contents ( text or images ) into a bitmap , then the bitmap is sent through the telephone system . the receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image , printing a paper copy . businesses usually have some kind of fax system , but the technology has faced increasing competition from internet-based methods . fax machines still retain some advantages , particularly in the transmission of sensitive material which , if sent over the internet , may be intercepted . however , encryption ( a secret coding system ) can make internet messages secure . in some countries , because electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are , fax machines enjoy continuing support in business .
