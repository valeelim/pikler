West Coast sea nettle     the west coast sea nettle ( `` chrysaora fuscescens '' ) , also known as the pacific sea nettle , is a type of scyphozoa which lives in the pacific ocean . for humans its sting is usually irritating , but rarely dangerous . the west coast sea nettle is found near the coasts of california and oregon , but some live in the waters north to the gulf of alaska , west to the seas around japan and south to the baja california peninsula . the west coast sea nettle have a golden-brown bell with a little shade of red . in the wild , the bell can grow to be larger than one meter ( three feet ) in diameter , but most are less than 50 cm . the long white arms and the 24 maroon tentacles may be as long as 3.6 to 4.6m ( 12 to 15 feet ) . like most cnidaria , the west coast sea nettle is carnivorous . they catch their prey by using their nematocyst-laden tentacles . the toxin ( poison ) in their nematocyst are effective against their prey and humans . since west coast sea nettles can not chase their prey , they must eat as they drift , by spreading out their tentacles like a large net , the west coast sea nettle is able to catch food as it passes by . when a prey brushes against the tentacles , thousands of nematocysts are released , launching barbed stingers which release a paralyzing toxin , then the oral arms begin digestion as they push the prey into the west coast sea nettle 's mouth .
