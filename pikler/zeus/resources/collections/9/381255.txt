Dido and Aeneas     dido and aeneas is a three-act english opera . the story and words were written by nahum tate . the music was written by henry purcell . the opera was probably written about 1684-1685 . `` dido '' is purcell 's only true opera . it was possibly modeled on john blow 's `` venus and adonis '' . blow 's piece was written and staged about the same time . marc-antoine charpentier 's little french operas may also have served as models . french music was appreciated at the english court . the opera was intended for performance at the court . the death of charles ii may have caused it to be postponed however . the first performance occurred in a chelsea girls ' school run by josias priest ( the dancing master at court ) in 1689. tragedy and comedy are deftly combined in `` dido '' . the lovers ' scenes are tense with emotion . the witches ' scenes are filled with comical cackling and mischief-making . the story of the opera is taken from virgil 's `` aeneid '' . it tells of the trojan aeneas ' tragic love for dido , the queen of carthage . the opera manuscript has been lost or destroyed . research and performance rely on earliest printed copies . some music is believed missing from these early copies . that music is composed afresh by modern composers in purcell 's style . sometimes music purcell composed about 1685 is inserted into the score to make up for the lack of the original music . `` dido and aeneas '' is purcell 's best known work .
