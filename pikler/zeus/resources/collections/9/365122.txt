Pegomastax     pegomastax ( `` strong jaw '' ) is a genus of small heterodontosaur dinosaur discovered in lower jurassic rocks in south africa . it is based on a skull in the iziko south african museum in cape town . it was collected during a 1966â€“1967 expedition but not named and described until recently . paul sereno , who had recognized it as unusual in the 1980s , published a description in 2012. the type species is `` p. africana '' . `` pegomastax '' differed from other heterodontosaurs by details of the skull . the lower jaw was robust , with a short beak . like most other heterodontosaurs , `` pegomastax '' had an enlarged canine-like tooth at the beginning of the lower jaw 's tooth row , which may have been used for defence . the rest of its teeth were those of a herbivore .
