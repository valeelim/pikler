Magma (mathematics)    magma ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a magma is kind of algebraic structure . it is a set with a binary operation on that set . a binary operation works by taking two elements from a set ( that do not have to be different ) and returning some other element of that set . if we give the set a label ( such as `` x '' ) and the binary operation a label ( such as • ) . then we give the magma the label ( `` x '' , • ) . the natural numbers with addition form a magma . because the set of natural numbers is written as formula_1 and addition is written as formula_2 the magma is written as formula_3 . the name of the magma would be `` the natural numbers under addition '' . the integers with multiplication form a magma . because the set of integers is written as formula_4 and multiplication ( in abstract mathematics ) is written as formula_5 the magma is written as formula_6 . the name of the magma would be `` the integers under multiplication '' . the real numbers under division do not form a magma . this is because numbers can not be divided by 0. a binary operation requires that `` any '' two elements can be taken from the set ( in this case in order ) to produce another element from the set . the real numbers without 0 is written as formula_7 . it can be shown that the formula_8 is a magma .
