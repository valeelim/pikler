Kyūdō     `` kyūdō '' is based on ancient archery ( `` kyū-jutsu '' ) . archery in japanese began in the jōmon period ; and it developed in the samurai or military class . at the beginning of the meiji era ( 1868-1912 ) , the samurai lost their position because the emperor meiji replaced the tokugawa family , the samurai , as a ruler of the nation . therefore , all martial arts , including kyudo , declined . before the meiji restoration , only the military class was allowed to do `` kyūdō '' . but after it , ordinally people could also do archery , so it spread outside the military class and it became an amusement . now , all japan kyudo federation plays a role in the promotion of kyudo as a sport . there are many styles , but most of kyudo players are learning the technique ruled by all japan kyudo federation ( `` shaho-hassetsu '' ) . in most cases , style means the kind of movement ( called `` taihai '' ) . this is a major style and is known as the style of mannar . most of the kyudo players play based on it . this style places importance on hitting and power .
