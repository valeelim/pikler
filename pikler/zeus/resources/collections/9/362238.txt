Jet (lignite)    jet ( lignite ) jet is a geological material considered to be a minor gemstone . it is originally a wood product called lignite , squeezed and heated by geological processes . the older definition of mineral did not apply to organic material . therefore , jet was not called a mineral , but instead a `` mineraloid '' . however , this view is changing , as so many crystalline materials have organic origin . the english noun `` jet '' comes from the french word for the same material : `` jaiet '' . jet is either black or dark brown , but may contain pyrite inclusions , which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre . the adjective `` jet-black '' , meaning as dark a black as possible , comes from this material .
