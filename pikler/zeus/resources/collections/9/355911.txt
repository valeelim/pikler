Pintupi     pintupi is an australian aboriginal group who are part of the western desert cultural group . their homeland is in the area west of lake macdonald and lake mackay in western australia . this is a very remote part of australian desert . because of this , the pintupi were among the last aboriginals in australia to leave their traditional way of life . most of the pintupi were displaced ( forced to leave ) their homeland in the middle of the 20th century , because of missile tests being done at woomera . they were moved into settlements to the east and west of their country , such as papunya , balgo , haasts bluff and even as far away as hermannsburg . they ended up scattered into different communities . within a few years , several hundreds of pintupi had died from foreign disease and infection . others had problems with alcoholism and violence â€“ having lived in small groups for most of their lives , they found it hard to deal with conflict . during the 1960s , the assimilationist policies of the menzies government had a major effect on the mentality of many pintupi . part of the policy led to hundreds of pintupi children being taken away from their parents and put into missions or foster care ( this is now known as the stolen generation ) .
