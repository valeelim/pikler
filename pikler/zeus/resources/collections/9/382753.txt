Pseudanthium     a pseudanthium ( greek for `` false flower '' ) or flower head is a special type of inflorescence . many flowers are grouped together to form a flower-like structure . the real flowers ( `` florets '' ) are generally small and greatly reduced , but can sometimes be quite large ( as in the sunflower flower head ) . pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family ( asteraceae or compositae ) . their flowers are either `` ray flowers '' or `` disk flowers '' . the disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium look like the centre of a normal flower . flowers on the periphery have one large petal . this sytem is unique to this family . either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some species : `` senecio vulgaris '' lacks ray flowers and `` taraxacum officinale '' lacks disk flowers . the pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the flowers . at a glance , a pseudanthium ( inflorescence ) looks just like a normal flower , but closer inspection shows it is composed of multiple flowers . thus , the pseudanthium represents an evolution of the inflorescence to a reproductive unit that may function in pollination like a single flower , at least in plants that are animal pollinated . the advantage of this `` flower '' is that it produces far more seeds than a normal flower , but needs only one act of pollination .
