Doomsday cult     a doomsday cult is a new religious movement or cult that says that the world is about to end . according to these cults , there will be a catastrophe . the only way to be saved is by joining the group , and by doing what it says . john lofland first used the term in 1966 , in a study of the unification church . some researchers believe that the term should not be used by mass media or by governments , because it will reinforce the beliefs of the respective group , and lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy . examples of groups said to be doomsday cults include the peoples temple , the movement for the restoration of the ten commandments of god , and aum shinrikyo . aum shinrikyo was responsible for an sarin gas attack on the tokyo subway in 1995 , where thirteen people died . the people 's temple organised a forced mass suicide in guyana , at a facility now known as `` jonestown '' , where over 900 people died . the movement for the restoration of the ten commandments predicted the end of the world would be on the 31st december 1999. when it did not come , people in the movement became sceptical , and wanted thir property back , which they had donated to the church leader beforehand . at a religious service on 17th march 2000 , the church where the service was held was put on fire , and 530 people died . during the equiry , the police found other people dead , at the properties of the movement ; they had likely been poisoned . in total , over 1000 people had died . the leader of the movement survived , and has not been seen since then .
