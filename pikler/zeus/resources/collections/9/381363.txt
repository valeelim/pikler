Schist     the schists are a group of metamorphic rocks which have lamellar ( plate-like ) minerals , such as micas , chlorite , talc , hornblende , graphite , and others . quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains so that a form called quartz schist is produced . by definition , schist contains more than 50 % platy and elongated minerals , often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar . schist often contains garnets . the individual mineral grains in schist , drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure , can be seen by the naked eye . schist is characteristically `` foliated '' , ( ~leaf-like ) meaning the mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs . the word `` schist '' is derived from the greek word `` σχίζειν schíxein '' meaning `` to split '' . this refers to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie . most schists have been derived from clays and muds which have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of shales , slates and phyllites as intermediate steps . certain schists have been derived from fine-grained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs . most schists are mica schists , but graphite and chlorite schists are also common .
