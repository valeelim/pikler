Aluminum wiring     aluminum wiring is electrical wiring made of aluminum , instead of the usual copper . it is widely and successfully used for electricity transmission and distribution . it is lighter and stronger than copper wire , which helps prevent the cables from sagging . it is also less expensive than copper wire . it has also been successfully used in aircraft wiring . in the 1960s , with the rising price of copper , electricians started to use it to wire homes and other buildings . aluminum wiring was not successful in this application and it is a major safety problem . because of the safety problems with aluminum wiring , it was discontinued for building wiring in the mid-1970s . over time , aluminum wiring can separate from the screws on electrical outlets , switches , or lights , creating a poor connection , which causes the wire to heat up . the heat can cause the aluminum to oxidize , creating an even worse connection and more heat , which can eventually start a fire . incorrect repairs to aluminum wiring , such as connecting aluminum wire to copper wire with twist-on wire connectors , can make the problem even worse . even twist-on connectors designed to connect aluminum to copper can be dangerous . the only proper way to repair aluminum wiring is to connect it to copper `` tails '' ( short pieces of copper wire ) with crimped or screw-on connectors specifically designed for this purpose .
