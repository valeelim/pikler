Crop (anatomy)    crop ( anatomy ) a crop ( sometimes called a croup or craw ) is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary canal used for storing food before digestion . it is found in many animals . it occurs in birds , some dinosaurs , and invertebrate animals such as gastropods ( snails and slugs ) , earthworms , leeches , and insects . in a bird 's digestive system , the crop is an expanded , muscular pouch near the gullet or throat . it is a part of the digestive tract , essentially an enlarged part of the oesophagus . as with most other organisms that have a crop , the crop is used to temporarily store food . not all birds have a crop . in adult doves and pigeons , the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds . scavenging birds , such as vultures , will gorge themselves when prey is abundant , causing their crop to bulge . they subsequently sit , sleepy or half torpid , to digest their food . most raptors , including hawks , eagles and vultures ( as stated above ) , have a crop ; however , owls do not . cropping is used by bees to temporarily store nectar of flowers . when bees `` suck '' nectar , it is stored in their crops .
