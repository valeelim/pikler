Division of Parramatta     the division of parramatta is an australian electoral division in new south wales . the division was created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. it is named for the locality of parramatta . the name `` parramatta '' is an aboriginal word for `` the place where the eels lie down '' . the division is in the western suburbs of sydney . it includes constitution hill , dundas valley , granville , harris park , holroyd , mays hill , north parramatta , oatlands , old toongabbie , parramatta , rosehill , rydalmere , telopea , wentworthville , westmead and parts of dundas , ermington , guildford , merrylands , merrylands west , northmead , north rocks , pendle hill , south granville and south wentworthville . the division lies between labor voting areas of western sydney and the liberal areas on the north shore . because of this , any change to the boundary can change the political balance in the seat . for example , in the 2006 boundary change , parramatta shifted from marginally labor to marginally liberal ( as defined by the australian electoral commission ) . nevertheless , as was expected julie owens held the seat for the alp with an increased majority .
