One-time pad     a one-time pad is a method of encryption . it is a 'symmetrical encryption ' , which means the same key is needed for encryption and decryption . a one time pad uses a key that is either as long or longer than the message it encrypts . if this method is used correctly , it is impossible to decrypt or break the encryption without the key . one-time pads were created all the way in 1882 by frank miller . after the invention in 1917 , gilbert vernam invented and patented an electronic version based on teleprinter technologies .
