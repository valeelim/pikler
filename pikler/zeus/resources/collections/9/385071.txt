Romance comics     romance comics is a genre of comics . stories are about love , courtship , marriage , divorce , heartbreak and other aspects of romance . most stories in the past featured teens and young adults . the stories were set in contemporary times . joe simon and jack kirby took credit for inventing the genre . they noticed many adults were reading comics after wwii , but only children 's comics were available on newsstands . the two created a title for adults called `` young romance '' . its success and popularity led other publishers to glut the market with love titles . the genre was unaffected by the senate subcommittee investigation into a supposed link between comic books and juvenile crime . the romance genre died in the 1970s with the last issue of `` young love '' and the onset of the women 's movement . some romance comics are still published . they are spoofs of the originals or take a more contemporary stance on love such as lesbian and gay romance .
