Commonwealth Liberal Party     the commonwealth liberal party ( clp ) was a political party in australia from 1909 to 1917. it was also known as the fusion , or the deakinite liberal party . it is the earliest direct ancestor of the modern liberal party of australia . the party was formed after the australian labor party formed its second government in 1908. business leaders told alfred deakin , the leader of the protectionist party , and joseph cook , leader of the anti-socialist party , to join forces to oppose the labor party . in 1909 , the protectionists and anti-socialists joined to form the clp . deakin was the new party 's first leader , with cook as deputy leader . several of the more liberal protectionists left and joined labor . the protectionists and anti-socialists had a majority of seats in the house of representatives . the new party used its numbers to force prime minister andrew fisher to resign . deakin became prime minister for the third time . however , the clp was defeated by labor at its first election , less than a year later in 1910 .
