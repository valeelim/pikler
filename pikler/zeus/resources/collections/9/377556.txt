Photochemistry     photochemistry is the study of chemical reactions that go with light . there are many natural examples of such reactions . one is photosynthesis , which is a very important process through which plants form oxygen from carbon dioxide and water . another is making vitamin d in the body . many times reactions go with heat : as you heat molecules , they start to move around and so hit other molecules which can then react . what molecules need is just some activation energy , a little energy to start the reaction . in the case of photochemistry , this energy is given by the light . a molecule or an atom absorbs at a certain wavelength . if light is given at this wavelength then the molecule or atom becomes excited . it is then easier for it to react . another way in which light can help reactions go is by changing the symmetry of a molecule . this can be tested with the woodwardâ€“hoffmann rules . some pericyclic reactions go with heat , some go only with light . in atmospheric chemistry , light is very important . this is because there is much more uv light at the top of the atmosphere . this allows reactions that do n't happen on the ground . for example , ozone can split in an oxygen molecule and one oxygen atom .
