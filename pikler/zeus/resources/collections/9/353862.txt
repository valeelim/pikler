Nazi songs     nazi songs were songs made for the nazi party ( nsdap ) of germany . some songs used by the nazis are very old , and so these songs are often thought of as to be a nazi song . an example would be `` deutschlandlied '' , which was written in 1841. the nazis used the `` deutschlandlied '' with the `` horst-wessel-lied '' . same with the song `` die wacht am rhein '' , which at that time was almost 100 years old . now in germany , it is illegal to sing any of these songs , and if you do , the punishment might by up to 3 years in jail . the `` horst-wessel-lied '' , also known as `` die fahne hoch '' ( the flag on high ) , was the anthem of the nazi party . the song was made by horst wessel , a sa leader , who was killed by a member of the communist party of germany . the song , as with many nazi songs , is banned in germany . `` es zittern die morschen knochen '' was made by hans baumann , was a very popular nazi song . the song was the official song of the hitler youth : which is why there are some attacks on the old people in the song . many germans know some of the song , but a lot do n't know the full song .
