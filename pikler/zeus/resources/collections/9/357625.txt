Solar flare     a solar flare or solar limb is a sudden brightening observed over the sun 's surface . it is a large energy release of up to 6 Ã— 10 joules of energy . the energy is about a sixth of the total energy that is released from the sun each second or 160,000,000,000 megatons of tnt . it can also be compared with the impact of comet shoemaker-levy 9 with jupiter . the release is then followed by a colossal coronal mass ejection also known as a cme . the first flare releases clouds of electrons , ions , and atoms through the corona of the sun into space . these clouds usually reach planet earth a day or two after this has happened . a solar flare is sometimes referred to another phenomena in other stars , such as stellar flare . solar flares affect all layers of the solar atmosphere such as the photosphere , chromosphere , and corona . solar flares produce radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum at all wavelengths from radio waves to gamma rays . most of the energy goes to frequencies outside it 's range and because of this most of the flares can not be seen by the naked eye . solar flares are observed ( looked at ) with special instruments . solar flares occur in active regions around sunspots . solar flares are powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that is stored in the corona . the same energy releases may produce coronal mass ejections ( cme ) , although the relation between cmes and flares is still not known .
