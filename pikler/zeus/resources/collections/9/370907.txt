Don't Break the Oath    do n't break the oath do n't break the oath is the second studio album by mercyful fate , a heavy metal band from denmark . some people who make music and people who talk about music think it is one of the best heavy metal albums ever . in the 1980s , there were a lot of bands in europe playing heavy metal . many of them were playing music like bands from the united kingdom , in a way that was called the new wave of british heavy metal ( or nwobhm for short ) . there were a lot of hard rock bands , too , and there were a lot of things hard rock bands and nwobhm bands both did . mercyful fate was one of the first few nwobhm bands to be different from hard rock bands on purpose . king diamond , the singer and leader of mercyful fate , painted his face with upside-down crosses and wrote lyrics about satan , hell , and things like that . hank shermann , the band 's guitarist , played very fast and with a lot of guitar solos to help make the band sound evil . mercyful fate had already started to do these things in 1983 with their last album , `` melissa '' .
