Steel Dragon 2000     the steel dragon 2000 is a steel roller coaster at nagashima spa land amusement park in mie prefecture , japan . it is the longest roller coaster in the world . steel dragon 2000 is the tallest coaster to use a traditional chain lift . because of the length of the lift hill , two chains are usedâ€”one for the bottom half and one for the top half . a single chain would have been too long , heavy and very slow , at least twice the weight of a single train . special brakes allow two trains to be on the lift at the same time . the building of steel dragon 2000 required much more steel than other coasters for earthquake protection . this put the cost of the coaster at over $ 50 million .
