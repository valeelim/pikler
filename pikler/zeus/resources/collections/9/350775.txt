Alioramus     alioramus is a genus of tyrannosaurid dinosaur . it was about 20 feet long . it lived during the upper cretaceous period in what is now mongolia . the type species , `` a. remotus '' , is known from a partial skull and three foot bones . they were got from mongolian sediments which were deposited in a humid floodplain about 70 million years ago . a second species , `` a. altai '' , known from a much more complete skeleton , was named and described in 2009. its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear . some evidence suggests that `` alioramus '' is closely related to the contemporary species `` tarbosaurus bataar '' .
