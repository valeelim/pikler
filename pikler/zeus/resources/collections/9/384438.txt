Farthing (English coin)    farthing ( english coin ) the farthing was a coin of the kingdom of england . it was worth one quarter of a penny , or of a pound sterling . the word 'farthing ' is derived from the anglo-saxon `` feorthing '' . it means a `` fourthling '' or `` fourth part '' . the anglo-saxon word was probably derived from the old norse , `` fjorthungr '' meaning a `` quarter '' . such coins were first minted in england in silver in the 13th century . they were used until the kingdom of england was merged into the new kingdom of great britain in 1707. early farthings were silver . the farthing was small ( only 10 millimeters in diameter ) and very light ( slightly more than 0.4 gram ) . surviving examples are rare . the first copper farthings were issued during the reign of king james i. in the late 17th century the english farthing was also minted in tin . in 1953 , the farthing 's low value forced its last minting . a londoner complained of abusive vendors when he tried to offer the coin for purchases . the coin ceased to be legal tender on 1 january 1961 .
