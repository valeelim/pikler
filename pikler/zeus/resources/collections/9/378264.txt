Oestrous cycle     the oestrous cycle ( u.s : estrous cycle ) is the reproductive system in most mammals . reproductive hormones cause the cycles to start after puberty in sexually mature females . they are interrupted by non-breeding phases or by pregnancies . usually estrous cycles continue until death . mammals share the same reproductive system , including the regulatory hypothalamic system that releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone in pulses , the pituitary that secretes follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone , and the ovary itself releases sex hormones like estrogens and progesterone . however , species vary in the details . one difference is that animals that have oestrous cycles reabsorb the endometrium if conception does not occur during that cycle . animals that have menstrual cycles shed the endometrium through menstruation instead . another difference is sexual activity . in species with oestrous cycles , females are generally only sexually active during the oestrus phase of their cycle . this is referred to as being 'in heat ' .
