Phaistos disc     the phaistos disc is a bronze age artifact . the disc is about in diameter and is made of clay . it is covered with many symbols . it is from the civilization of minoa on the greek island of crete , possibly from the 2nd millennium bc . the symbols cover both sides of the disc . they show everyday things . they were stamped onto the disc , pressed into the clay when it was still soft . they run in a spiral . this disc is the first known `` printed '' work in history ; in the sense that there was a re-usable set of characters and drawings . it is the only artefact of its kind . many questions have been asked about the disc , about its purpose , and if the signs shown actually represent writing . in total , there are 242 tokens on the disc , taken from a set of 45 unique signs . there are arranged in 61 groups , separated by lines . groups are between two and seven stamps long . because the `` text '' is very short , and the disc is unique , it is likely that it will not be deciphered .
