Type species     a type species is the species that contains the biological type specimen ( s ) . the type system is central to the scientific naming of living things ( organisms ) . how exactly it works is different depending on exactly what living thing is considered , but in a very general ( and imprecise ) sense it may be said that it fixes each name `` to a particular specimen '' , the type specimen . this helps in finding out what particular name is to be used for a particular living thing ( or a group of living things , a taxon ) . there are international codes of nomenclature which set out exactly how types are to be designated and used . for animals , the type species of a genus ( or subgenus ) is the type of that genus ( or subgenus ) . the species ( hopefully ) has a specimen ( or in some cases a group of specimens ) as its type , so the type species is the link between a genus ( or subgenus ) and a type specimen . for algae , fungi and plants , it is different : the type species of a genus is the species that has the same type ( specimen or illustration ) as the genus . for example , `` malus sylvestris '' , the european wild apple , is the type species of the genus `` malus '' . thus , for algae , fungi and plants , a type species plays no great role ; it is not an official term , but only a term of convenience .
