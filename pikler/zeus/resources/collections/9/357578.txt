Yellow-lipped sea krait     the yellow-lipped sea krait ( `` laticauda colubrina '' ) is a species of sea snake found in tropical indo-pacific ocean waters . the yellow-lipped sea krait is also known as the `` '' banded sea krait '' and the `` colubrine sea krait '' '' . banded sea kraits are often seen in large numbers in the company of hunting parties of giant trevally ( `` caranx ignobilis '' ) and goatfish . their cooperative hunting technique is similar to that of the moray eel . the kraits flush out prey from narrow crevices and holes . kraits need to drink fresh water and regularly come onto land for that purpose . while probing crevices with their head , they can not see approaching predators . but they can fool their potential enemies into thinking their tail is the head . both colouration and tail movements are like the head . female yellow-lipped sea kraits are longer than males . females can grow up to the length of 1.6 meters , while males grow up to the length of 1 meters . yellow-lipped sea kraits are light or dark blueish-grey on the top and yellow underneath with black bands running down the body and tail . the upper lip and snout is yellow ( hence its name ) while the rest of the head is black . they are very venomous but they are not aggressive and rarely ever bite divers or swimmers .
