Incisivosaurus     incisivosaurus ( `` incisor lizard '' ) is a genus of small , probably herbivorous theropod dinosaur from the lower cretaceous of what is now the people 's republic of china . the first specimen is a skull that was collected from the lowermost levels ( the fluvial lujiatun beds ) of the yixian formation . the beds were laid down 125 million years ago ( mya ) in the sihetun area , near beipiao city , in western liaoning province . the most significant , and highly unusual , characteristic of this dinosaur is its apparent adaptation to an herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle . its name refers to its rodent-like front teeth , which show wear patterns commonly found in plant-eating dinosaurs . the initial description of `` incisivosaurus '' showed that the skull , about 10 cm in length ( 4 inches ) , had the most complete dentition known for any oviraptorosaur . their cladistic analysis indicated that `` incisivosaurus '' lies at the base of the oviraptorosaurs , making it more basal than `` caudipteryx '' and `` oviraptor '' . the distinguishing skeletal features of `` incisivosaurus '' , include a long snout that made up about half the total length of the skull , a slender lower jaw with a long fenestra ( opening ) , and its distinctive , large , flattened front teeth . in addition to these unique features , `` incisivosaurus '' shared many traits with more typical oviraptorosaurs , so it is classified in that group .
