Pitchblende     pitchblende is a radioactive , uranium-rich mineral and ore. it has a chemical composition that is largely uo , but also contains uo and oxides of lead , thorium , and rare earth elements . it is known as pitchblende due to its black color and high density . it is also commonly referred to as uraninite . the mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the ore mountains , on the german/czech border . pitchblende found in germany was used by m. klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium . pitchblende contains a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium . because the uranium isotopes u and u will decay to form the lead isotopes pb and pb , pitchblende also always contains small amounts of lead . small amounts of helium are also present in pitchblend as a result of alpha decay . helium was first found on earth in pitchblende after having been discovered in the sun 's atmosphere . pitchblende is a major ore of uranium . some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the shinkolobwe mine in the democratic republic of the congo ( the initial source for the manhattan project ) and in the athabasca basin in northern canada . another important source of pitchblende is at great bear lake in the northwest territories of canada , where it is found in large quantities associated with silver . it also occurs in australia , germany , england , and south africa . in the united states it can be found in the states of new hampshire , connecticut , north carolina , wyoming , colorado , arizona and new mexico .
