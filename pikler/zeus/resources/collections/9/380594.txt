Bird feet     bird feet are adapted to the life they lead , and the patterns are often use in avian classification . they are derived from the basic limb of ancestral tetrapods , the pentadactyl limb . whereas humans ( and other primates ) have the original five fingers and five toes , birds all have only four toes . these four toes are arranged into four main patterns . 1. anisodactyly . this is the most common arrangement of toes in birds , with three toes forward and one back . it is the basic pattern in passerine birds , especially the songbirds , and hunting birds like eagles , hawks , and falcons . the anisodactyl arrangement enables the passerine birds to perch upon vertical surfaces , such as trees and cliffs . the hind toe joins the leg at the same level as the front toes . the leg arrangement of passerine birds contains a special adaption for perching . a tendon in the rear of the leg running from the underside of the toes to the muscle behind the tibiotarsus will automatically be pulled and tighten when the leg bends , causing the foot to curl and become stiff when the bird lands on a branch . this enables passerines to sleep while perching without falling off . this is especially useful for passerine birds that develop nocturnal lifestyles . certain species of passerines have stiff tail feathers , which help the birds balance themselves when perching on vertical surfaces . syndactyly is like anisodactyly , except that the third and fourth toes or three toes , are fused together . this is characteristic of coraciiformes ( kingfishers , bee-eaters , rollers , and relatives ) .
