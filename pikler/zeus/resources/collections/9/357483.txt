Water on Mars     there is less water on mars compared to earth . most of the water known is in the cryosphere ( permafrost and polar caps ) . there is no liquid water . there is only a small amount of water vapor in the thin atmosphere . the conditions on the planet 's surface do not support the long-term existence of liquid water . the average atmospheric pressure and temperature are far too low , which freezes water . however , it seems mars once had liquid water flowing on the surface . this would make large areas like earth 's oceans . there are a number of signs of water on or under the surface , now or in the distant past . these include stream beds , polar caps , spectroscopic measurement , eroded craters . also , there are minerals which are often formed when there is liquid water ( such as goethite ) , grey , crystalline hematite , phyllosilicates , opal , and sulfate . the mars flybys such as viking , mars odyssey , mars global surveyor , mars express , and the mars reconnaissance orbiter had cameras . they took pictures of what seem to be ancient lakes , ancient river valleys , and widespread glaciation . an orbiting gamma ray spectrometer found ice just under the surface of much of the planet . also , radar studies found ice that were thought to be glaciers . the phoenix lander showed ice on mars when it was landing . phoenix also showed ice melting , snow falling , and even saw drops of liquid water .
