Natural killer cell     natural killer cells ( or nk cells ) are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system . nk cells provide a rapid response to cells infected by viruses , or to bacterial cells . the response happens about 3 days after infection . nk cells also respond to tumour formation . nk cells are unique : they have the ability to recognise stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) . this allows for a much faster immune reaction . in early experiments in cancer patients and animals , investigators found what was called a `` natural '' reactivity . that is , a certain population of cells seemed to be able to kill tumour cells without previously being sensitized to them . at first many thought that these observations were artifacts . however , by 1973 , 'natural killing ' activity was established across a wide variety of species , and the existence of a separate line of cells with this ability was suggested . to control their cytotoxic activity , nk cells have two types of surface receptors : activating receptors and inhibitory receptors . when the nk cell is activated , it destroys the cells which have switched it on .
