Biblical inerrancy     biblical inerrancy is the doctrine that the bible in its original manuscripts , is accurate and totally free from error . `` scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact '' . some equate `` inerrancy '' with `` infallibility '' ; others do not . in 1978 300 scholars and protestant leaders met in chicago and produced an agreed statement . it states the bible is ' of infallible divine authority in all matters upon which it touches ... ' . most evangelical christians agree with this view , but liberal christians do not . jesus himself quotes the old testament often without question ( see gospel of matthew 5:17-20 ) , but judaism has never believed in the literal word of the hebrew bible . there are over 5,600 greek manuscripts containing all or part of the new testament , as well as over 10,000 latin manuscripts , and perhaps 500 other manuscripts in various other languages . additionally , there are the patristic writings which contain copious quotes , across the early centuries , of the scriptures . inerrancy is only applied to the original autographs ( the manuscripts written by the original authors ) rather than the copies . for instance , the chicago statement on biblical inerrancy says , `` we affirm that inspiration , strictly speaking , applies only to the autographic text of scripture .
