Backpropagation     backpropagation is a method of training neural networks to perform tasks more accurately . the algorithm was first used for this purpose in 1974 in papers published by werbos , rumelhart , hinton , and williams . the term backpropagation is short for `` backward propagation of errors '' . it works especially well for feed forward neural networks ( networks without any loops ) and problems that require supervised learning .
