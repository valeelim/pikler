Solar car     solar cars ( or solar vehicles ) are a special type of electric vehicle that only get their power from the sun . they use solar cells on the surface of the car to produce electricity and the electricity makes a motor turn , and that turns the wheels . they are not useful for normal driving , but once built , they can drive all day and not make any pollution . there are also some solar-powered vehicles for unusual cases , like the first rovers on mars . also , there are electric vehicles that can be charged from separate solar panels , and those panels can be as big as needed . this can work to power an electric car for most daily needs . but this is not called a solar car , since it does n't have the solar panels right on the car . the first competition was a trip from sydney , australia to perth in 1983. there are now several competitions to see who can build the best solar-powered car . some of these are for college students , some are open to anybody . it is not easy to build a good solar car . this is a good test of engineering skills , and helps improve the efficiency of cars and test solar equipment .
