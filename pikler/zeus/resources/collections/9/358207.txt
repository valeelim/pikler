Partial derivative     in calculus , an advanced branch of mathematics , the partial derivative of a function is basically the derivative of one named variable , and the unnamed variable of the function is held constant . in other words , the partial derivative takes the derivative of certain indicated variables of a function and does n't differentiate the other variable ( s ) . the notation formula_1 is usually used , although other notations are valid . usually , although not in all cases , the partial derivative is taken in a multivariable function , ( i.e. , the function has three or more variables , whether independent or dependent variables ) . if we have a function formula_2 , then there are several partial derivatives of `` f ( x , y ) '' that are all equally valid . for example , or , we can do the following related pages . - derivative ( mathematics ) - calculus - difference quotient
