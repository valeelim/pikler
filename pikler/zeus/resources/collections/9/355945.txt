Bohr model     in quantum mechanics , a branch of physics , the bohr model is the model of the atom proposed by niels bohr . bohr 's model is useful only when discussing the behavior of a hydrogen atom . bohr 's model is extremely useful in describing the hydrogen emission spectrum . the bohr model says that the angular momentum of an electron within a hydrogen atom can only be integer multiples of a certain number . where `` h '' is planck 's constant , Ï€ is pi , and `` n '' is the multiples ( 1,2,3 ... ) . this formula says that an electron will only be found on the energy levels predicted by the formula , and not anywhere in between . this means that if an electron jumps from one energy level to the next , it will never be in between energy levels , but will instantaneously be transported from one level to the other . bohr 's model is also useful because it explains the cause of light . bohr agreed with classical theory that light has a wave-particle duality ( meaning that it is made of both electromagnetic waves and particles called photons ) , but he said that light was given off when an electron in a hydrogen atom jumps from a higher energy level to a lower one . basically , if an electron with `` x '' amount of energy goes to a lower state of energy and loses `` y '' energy , then a photon with energy `` y '' is emitted by the atom and either becomes light or some other form of radiation .
