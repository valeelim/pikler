Chimaera (genetics)    chimaera ( genetics ) a chimaera or chimera is a single organism ( usually an animal ) made of two kinds of genetically distinct cells . the two types of cells may come from separate fertilised eggs or zygotes . chimeras that originate from distinct fertilised eggs fused together are called dispermic chimeras . when , on the other hand , the genetically distinct cell types originate from the same zygote , the organism is called a mosaic . dispermic chimaeras are formed from at least two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together . each population of cells keeps its own phenotype and the resulting organism is a mixture of the two phenotypes . microchimerism is a form of chimerism in which a host harbors a small set of genetically distinct cells . this often happens with blood transfusion or transplants , but also during pregnancy due to the two-way cell trafficking between the mother and the foetus . recently , epigenetic chimeras have been discovered in mouse models . germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own .
