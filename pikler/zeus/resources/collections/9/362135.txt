Lemma (linguistics)    lemma ( linguistics ) a lemma is a word which stands at the head of a definition in a dictionary . all the head words in a dictionary are lemmas . technically , it is `` a base word and its inflections '' . a lemma is the word you find in the dictionary . a lexeme is a unit of meaning , and can be more than one word . a lexeme is the set of all forms that have the same meaning , while `` lemma '' refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme . in english , for example , `` run '' , `` runs '' , `` ran '' and `` running '' are forms of the same lexeme , but `` run '' is the lemma . in english , the lemma of a noun is the singular : e.g. , `` mouse '' rather than `` mice '' . in languages with gender , the head word of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular . if the language also has cases , the lemma is often the masculine singular nominative . in many languages , the citation form of a verb is the infinitive : french `` aller '' , german `` gehen '' , spanish `` ir '' . in english it usually is the full infinitive ( `` to go '' ) although alphabetized without 'to ' ( `` go '' ) .
