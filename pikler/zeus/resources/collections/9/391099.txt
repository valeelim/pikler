Enterococcus     enterococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum firmicutes . enterococci are gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs or short chains . they look like streptococci . two species are regular gut flora organisms in the intestines of humans : `` e. faecalis '' ( 90-95 % ) and `` e. faecium '' ( 5-10 % ) . enterococci are `` facultative anaerobic organisms '' . this means they can live in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments . members of the genus `` enterococcus '' were classified as group d `` streptococcus '' until 1984. genomic dna analysis showed they were a separate genus . important infections caused by `` enterococcus '' include urinary tract infections , bacterial endocarditis , diverticulitis , and meningitis . sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with ampicillin , penicillin and vancomycin . urinary tract infections can be treated by antibiotics , but many virulent strains of `` enterococcus '' are resistant . from a medical standpoint , an important feature of this genus is the high level of antibiotic resistance . this rules out some important antibiotics .
