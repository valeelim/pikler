Norwegian Sea     the norwegian sea is a marginal sea in the north atlantic ocean , northwest of norway . it is between the north sea and the greenland sea . it joins the north atlantic ocean to the west and the barents sea to the northeast . in the southwest , it is separated from the atlantic ocean by a submarine ridge running between iceland and the faroe islands . to the north , the jan mayen ridge separates it from the greenland sea . unlike many other seas , most of the bottom of the norwegian sea is not part of a continental shelf . it is at a great depth of about two kilometres on average . rich deposits of oil and natural gas are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially . the coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the norwegian sea from the north atlantic for spawning . the warm north atlantic current gives stable and high water temperatures , so that unlike the arctic seas , the norwegian sea is ice-free throughout the year . the norwegian sea is a transition zone between boreal and arctic conditions . it has flora and fauna of both regions . the southern limit of many arctic species runs through the north cape , iceland , and the center of the norwegian sea . the northern limit of boreal species is near the borders of the greenland sea with the norwegian sea and barents sea . these areas overlap . some species like the scallop `` chlamys islandica '' and capelin tend to live in this area between the atlantic and arctic oceans .
