Chain rule     the chain rule is a way of finding the derivative of a function . it is used where the function is in another function . this is called a composite function . if f ( x ) equals two functions that we can take a derivative of , such as : then the derivative , f prime , is 1. find the derivative of the outside function ( all of it at once ) . 2. find the derivative of the inside function ( the bit between the brackets ) . 3. multiply the answer from the first step by the answer from the second step . this is basically the last step in solving for the derivative of a function . - example ; in this example , the cubed sign ( ) is the outside function and formula_7 is the inside function . the derivative of the outside function would be formula_8 , where the inside function is plugged in for x. the derivative of the inside function would be 2x , which is multiplied by formula_9 to get formula_10 .
