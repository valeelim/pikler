Brachylophosaurus     brachylophosaurus was a mid-sized herbivorous dinosaur , a member of the hadrosaur family . it is known from several skeletons and bonebed material from the judith river formation of montana and the oldman formation of alberta . they lived about 76.5 million years ago . this animal had a bony crest , a flat , paddle-like plate over the top of the skull . some individuals had crests that covered nearly the entire skull roof , while others had shorter , narrower crests . other notable features are the unusually long forelimbs and the beak of the upper jaw being wider than other contemporary hadrosaurs . otherwise , `` brachylophosaurus '' was a typical hadrosaur . it reached an adult length of 9 meters ( 30 ft ) . like other hadrosaurs , `` brachylophosaurus '' had cheeks to keep food in the mouth while it chewed with its hundreds of close-fitting teeth . these teeth could be used to chew efficiently , a feature rare among reptiles , but common among ornithischia like `` brachylophosaurus '' . in 2003 , evidence of tumors , including metastatic cancer , was discovered in fossilized `` brachylophosaurus '' skeletons . rothschild and co-workers tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening . several other hadrosaurs , including `` edmontosaurus '' , `` gilmoreosaurus '' , and `` bactrosaurus '' , also tested positive . although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner , the tumors were limited to `` brachylophosaurus '' and closely related genera . the reason for this is not known .
