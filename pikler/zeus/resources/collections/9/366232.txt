Lipid bilayer     lipid bilayers are important in biological cells . they are the basis of cell membranes , and they surround most cell organelles . lipid bilayers form automatically from phospholipids by self-assembly . the phospholipids have heads which mix with water and tails which reject water . so the tails come together in the centre of the double layer , and the heads on the outside are surrounded by water . the lipid bilayers stop most water-soluble ( hydrophilic ) molecules passing through . they also stop most ions . in cells , proteins are put in the bilayer by enzymes . the proteins decide which molecules come in and which go out of the cell . for example , cells control salt concentrations and ph by pumping ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps .
