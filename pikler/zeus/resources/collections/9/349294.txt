Hole in one     a hole-in-one in golf is when a player hits the ball from the tee and into the hole in one shot . it is most possible on a par-3 hole . some people have done it on shorter par-4 holes . nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot . getting the ball in the hole in two shots is called an albatross .
