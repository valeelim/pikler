True owl     true owls ( or 'typical owls ' ) are owls of the family strigidae . they are one of the two families of owls , with 189 living species in 25 genera . the other family is the barn owls . true owls are found on every continent except antarctica . the division of owls into these two groups is quite ancient . the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . typical owls vary greatly in size . the smallest is the elf owl . its weight is a hundred times less than the largest , the eurasian eagle owl and blakiston 's fish owl . most owls have very similar bodies . they have large heads , short tails , and round facial circles around the eyes . most live in trees ( with a few exceptions like the burrowing owl ) and get their food on the wing . the wings are large , broad , rounded and long . like other birds of prey many owls have females that are larger than males . they are nocturnal . because of this the plumage is not much different between males and females . the feathers are soft and the base of each is downy . this give them silent flight . hearing in owls is highly sensitive . the ears are asymmetrical which lets the owl localise a sound . owls have massive eyes relative to their body size .
