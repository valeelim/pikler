Tollund Man     the tollund man is the name for a mummy which was found in denmark , in the 1950s . the man lived in the 4th century bc , in what is known as the `` pre-roman iron age '' . the head and face were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim . twelve years before the discovery of tollund man , another bog body , elling woman was discovered in the same bog . below the body was a thin layer of moss . scientists know that this moss was formed in danish peat bogs in the early iron age , therefore , the body was suspected to have been placed in the bog more than 2,000 years ago during the early iron age . c radiocarbon dating was performed : it indicated that he died in approximately 375-210 bc . the acid in the peat , along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface , had preserved the delicate soft tissues of his body . examinations and x-rays showed that the man 's head was undamaged , and his heart , lungs and liver were well preserved . the silkeborg museum estimated that he must have been approximately 40 years old , and about tall , at the time of his death . this means he was relatively small , even for the time . it is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog .
