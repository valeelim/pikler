Draco (genus)    draco ( genus ) draco is a genus of agamid lizards that are sometimes called the flying dragons . the ribs and their connecting membrane can be extended to create a kind of wing . the hindlimbs are flattened and wing-like in cross-section , and a small set of flaps on the neck serve as a horizontal stabilizers . they live in forests , and eat insects . they can not fly , but often get lift as they glide . glides as long as 60 m have been recorded , over which the animal loses only 10 m in height . they are quite small . one species is only about 20 cm long . the only time a flying lizard comes to the ground is when a female is ready to lay her eggs . she descends the tree she is on and makes a nest hole by forcing her head into the soil . she then lays 2â€“5 eggs before filling the hole . she guards the eggs for approximately 24 hours , but then leaves and has nothing more to do with her offspring . there are about 38 species .
