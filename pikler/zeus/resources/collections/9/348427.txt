Bering Sea     the bering sea is a marginal sea of the pacific ocean . it has a deep water basin , which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves . the bering sea is separated from the gulf of alaska by the alaska peninsula . it covers over two million square kilometers , bordered on the east and northeast by alaska , on the west by russia 's siberia and kamchatka peninsula , on the south by the alaska peninsula and the aleutian islands and on the far north by the bering strait . the strait connects the bering sea to the arctic ocean 's chukchi sea . bristol bay is the part of the bering sea which separates the alaska peninsula from mainland alaska . the bering sea is named for vitus bering , a danish navigator in russian service , who in 1728 was the first european to systematically explore it . the bering sea ecosystem includes resources belonging to the united states and russia , as well as international waters in the middle of the sea . most scientists believe that during the most recent ice age , sea level was low enough to let humans and other animals move on foot from asia to north america across what is now the bering strait . this is commonly called the `` bering land bridge '' and is believed by some—though not all— to be the first point of entry of humans into the americas .
