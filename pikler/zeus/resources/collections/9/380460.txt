Golden Triangle (UK universities)    golden triangle ( uk universities ) the golden triangle is an unofficial name for a set of leading universities in the southern english cities of oxford , cambridge and london . the university of oxford and the university of cambridge ( 'oxbridge ' ) form two corners of the triangle . the third is london : imperial college , university college london , king 's college london and the london school of economics and political science ( lse ) . the last three are independent colleges of the university of london . the universities within the triangle ( with the exception of the lse ) attract the highest research incomes of all british universities . however , it has been argued that it should be replaced by a term like `` brilliant diamond '' , to include the university of manchester . the figures below suggest that both the universities of manchester and edinburgh belong in the same class . that might better reflect the geographical spectrum of the uk higher education . oxford , cambridge and some of the london institutions collaborate in research . the global medical excellence cluster ( gmec ) for biomedical research was formed by oxford , cambridge , imperial college , university college london , king 's college london and queen mary university of london .
