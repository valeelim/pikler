Transition state     in a chemical reaction , the transition state is the point where there is a maximum value of energy . this energy is called the activation energy . when two or more molecules are mixed , they will hit each other . if they hit with enough energy to go through the transition state , they will react and form new molecules . at the transition state , new bonds are formed while the old ones are broken . in a graph or a drawing , the transition state is often marked with the double dagger â€¡ symbol . it is very difficult to study a transition state . this is because it is so high in energy that the molecules will stay in that form for a very short time , usually femtoseconds . it is important not to confuse transition states with intermediates . intermediates are found at minimum points of energy , and they can live for a very long time . like a transition state , however , an intermediate is between reagents and products of a reaction . studying transition states is very important to understand reaction mechanisms . there are theories and computer programs that can be used to calculate how the transition state looks like . this is a part of chemical kinetics .
