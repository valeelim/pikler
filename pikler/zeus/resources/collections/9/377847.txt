Acanthostega     acanthostega ( meaning 'spiny roof ' ) was an extinct fishapod . it was one of the first vertebrates to have recognizable limbs . it appeared in the upper devonian about 365 million years ago , and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and the first tetrapods fully capable of coming onto land . `` acanthostega '' had eight digits on each hand linked by webbing , and six digits on the rear legs . it had no wrists to support the animal 's weight on land . `` acanthostega '' also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb . the front foot of `` acanthostega '' could not bend forward at the elbow , and so could not bear the full weight of the body . it was suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants . the animal had lungs , but its ribs were too short to give support to its chest cavity out of water . it had gills which were internal and covered like those of fish , not external and naked like those of some modern aquatic amphibians . there are many changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of `` acanthostega '' to become a weight-bearing structure . in ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached . in `` acanthostega '' there in contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column . these fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of water .
