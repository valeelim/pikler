Greek shield     the `` greek shield '' of ancient greece was called a hoplon or aspis . it was from this word that hoplite ( a greek soldier ) is derived . a hoplon shield was a deeply-dished shield made of wood . some shields had a thin sheet of bronze on the outer face . this was placed just around the rim . in some periods , the shield was decorated . at other times , it remained undecorated . these large shields were designed for a mass of hoplites to push forward into the opposing army , and it was their most essential equipment . probably the most famous decoration is the spartan . this was a capital lambda ( Î» ) . from the late 5th century bc onward , athenian hoplites usually used the little owl ( athena 's sacred bird ) . the shields of theban hoplites were sometimes decorated with a sphinx , or the club of herakles .
