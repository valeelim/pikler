Elasticity of substitution     elasticity of substitution is a measure of how easily something is able to be substituted with something else . it is often used in marketing and economics . a product has a low elasticity if it is unable to raise its price because similar products ( substitutes ) are available . a product that is unique is able to charge higher prices because there are not as many choices . for example , in a fish market , there are many fishermen selling many fish . the price is not elastic because there is competition between many suppliers of fish .
