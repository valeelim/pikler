Sill (geology)    sill ( geology ) in geology , a sill is a flat sheet-like intrusion . as molten magma , it pushed between older layers of rock . the older rock may be sedimentary rock , beds of volcanic lava or tuff , or metamorphic rock . the sill does not cut across preexisting rocks , unlike dykes . sills are fed by dykes as they form from a lower magma source . the existing rocks must split to create the planes along which the magma moves in . these planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet-like body of magma paralleling the existing strata . when it cools and crystallises , it is then a sill . < noinclude >
