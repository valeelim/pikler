Tesla Motors     tesla motors is a company based in palo alto , california which makes electric cars . it was started in 2003 by martin eberhard and elon musk ( who also co-founded paypal and is the ceo of spacex ) . eberhard no longer works there . today , elon musk is the chief executive officer ( ceo ) . it started selling its first car , the roadster in 2008. some car companies that were trying to start making electric cars in the early 2000 's tried to make a car that would n't cost very much , so that many people would buy it . but it is hard to for a new company to make many of something for a low price in the beginning . so tesla motors had a different idea . they would make a very expensive , very good electric car , and sell each one for a lot of money . then after they had made some money , they would start making cars that were n't as expensive , and eventually they would make cheap electric cars that most people could buy . they also had an unusual idea to make only one kind of car at a time . when they started making the less expensive car ( model s ) they stopped making the roadster . so far their ideas have been working , and they are one of the very few start-up companies that have been able to make electric cars and stay in business .
