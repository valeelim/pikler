Fixed-gear bicycle     a fixed-gear bicycle ( also called a `` fixie '' ) is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism ( allowing pedals to stay still while moving ) . it is a perfect bike to use in towns . this type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world . fixed-gear bicycles are very light . they are built without any unnecessary gadgets , such as chain rings or freewheel hub . when a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle , he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike . most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill . fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel . that means that the rider can not stop pedaling . when the rear wheel turns , the pedals turn in the same direction . this allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals , so that the mechanism will not rotate .
