Interferon     interferons ( ifns ) are proteins released by body cells in response to pathogens such as viruses , bacteria , parasites or to tumor cells . they allow cells to trigger the defenses of the immune system . ifns belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines . interferons are named after their ability to `` interfere '' with virus replication inside host cells . ifns also have other functions : 1. they activate immune cells , such as natural killer cells and macrophages ; 1. they increase recognition of infection or tumor cells by up-regulating antigen presentation to t lymphocytes ; 1. they increase the ability of uninfected host cells to resist new infection by virus . certain symptoms , such as aching muscles and fever , are related to the production of ifns during infection . about ten distinct ifns have been identified in mammals ; seven of these have been described for humans . all ifns are very important for fighting viral infections .
