Seven Bridges of Königsberg     the seven bridges of königsberg is a historically famous problem in mathematics . leonhard euler solved the problem in 1735. this led to the beginning of graph theory . this then led to the development of topology . the city of königsberg in prussia ( now kaliningrad , russia ) was set on both sides of the pregel river . it included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges . the problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once . the islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges . every bridge must have been crossed completely every time . the walk need not start and end at the same spot . euler proved that the problem has no solution . first , euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter . the only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed . so , he changed the problem to abstract terms . this laid the foundations of graph theory . he removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them . in the language of graph theory , he replaced each land mass with an abstract `` vertex '' or node . then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection , an `` edge '' . an edge ( road ) recorded which two vertices ( land masses ) were connected . in this way , he formed a graph .
