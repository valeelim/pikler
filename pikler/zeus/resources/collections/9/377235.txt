Loie Fuller     loie ( or loïe ) fuller ( january 15 , 1862 – january 1 , 1928 ) was a pioneer of modern dance . she had no dance training , but got experience acting on the stage . a chance experiment with an over-long skirt gave her ideas which she eventually developed into a dance . fuller was born marie louise fuller in the chicago suburb of fullersburg ( now hinsdale , illinois ) . she began her theatrical career as a professional child actress and later choreographed and performed dances in burlesque ( as a skirt dancer ) , vaudeville , and circus shows . fuller developed her own natural movement and improvisation techniques . fuller combined her choreography with silk costumes illuminated by multi-coloured lighting of her own design . although fuller became famous in america through works such as `` serpentine dance '' ( 1891 ) , she felt that she was not taken seriously by the public . her warm reception in paris during a european tour persuaded fuller to remain in france . a regular performer at the folies bergère with works such as `` fire dance '' , fuller became the embodiment of the art nouveau movement . an 1896 film of the `` serpentine dance '' gives a hint of what her performance was like ( the unknown dancer in the film is not fuller ) .
