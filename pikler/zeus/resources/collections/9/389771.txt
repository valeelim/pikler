Chemtrail conspiracy theory     according to a popular conspiracy theory , a chemtrail is a trail of chemicals left by an airplane at a high altitude . the chemicals are said to be deliberately sprayed for reasons that are kept secret by the government . most scientists and workers in the aviation industry say that the trails left by planes are just a form of condensation . these are called contrails ( condensation trails ) . people who believe the theory have speculated about what purpose chemtrails may serve . some say it is to change the weather or stop global warming . others say that it is to control the population by spreading chemicals that are harmful to the human reproductive system . some more recent versions of the theory say that chemtrails are being spread by companies that make genetically-modified ( gmo ) crops . the chemtrails supposedly contain herbicides that will only kill normal ( organic ) crops and will not affect the genetically-modified crops . some claim that specially modified planes , supposedly owned and operated by the government , are necessary to create a chemtrail . the chemicals are said to either come from the engine or from special nozzles on the plane . in some versions of the theory , the chemical is said to be barium or a barium compound , but in other versions it is aluminum oxide , or a mixture of barium compounds and aluminum oxide .
