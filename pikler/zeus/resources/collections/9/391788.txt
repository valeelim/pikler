Migratory locust     the migratory locust ( `` locusta migratoria '' ) is the most widespread locust species , and the only species in the genus `` locusta '' . it occurs throughout africa , asia , australia and new zealand . it used to be common in europe but has now become rare there . because of the vast geographic area it occupies , which comprises many different ecological zones , numerous subspecies have been described . however , not all experts agree on the validity of some of these subspecies . many other species of orthoptera with gregarious and migratory behavior are indicated with the name of 'locusts ' . the migratory locust is polyphenic . it has a solitary phase and a gregarious phase . this is a type of polymorphism where a single genotype produces two or more phenotypes . during development , an environmental factor causes a switch from one morph to another . for the migratory locust , the switch is caused by population density . as the density of the population increases the locust transforms from the solitary phase to the gregarious phase , with intermediate phases .
