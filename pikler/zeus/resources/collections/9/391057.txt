RR Lyrae     rr lyrae is a pulsating variable star in the constellation lyra . it is the model for the variable stars known as rr lyrae variables . it pulses over a short cycle of 13 hours , 36 minutes . each radial pulsation causes the radius of the star to vary between 5.1 and 5.6 times the sun 's radius . stars of this type are often found in globular clusters , and used as standard candles to measure distances to other galaxies . rr lyrae and its type are pulsating stars of spectral class a ( and rarely f ) , with a mass of around half the sun 's . it is thought they previously shed mass and consequently , they were once stars with similar or slightly less mass than the sun , about 0.8 solar masses . rr lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to cepheid variables , so the mechanism for the pulsation is thought to be similar . the nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different . unlike cepheids , rr lyraes are old , low mass , metal-poor `` population ii '' stars . they are much more common than cepheids , but also much less luminous . the average absolute magnitude of an rr lyrae is about 0.75 , only 40 or 50 times brighter than our sun . their period is shorter , typically less than one day , sometimes ranging down to seven hours .
