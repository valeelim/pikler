Rare earth element     rare earth elements ( `` rees '' ) are a set of seventeen chemical elements . they include the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium . scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements since they are often found in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and have similar chemical properties . although they are called rare , rare earth elements are not extremely rare on earth . they were called this because they are spread very evenly over the earth , so it is hard to find a lot in one place . promethium is rare , because it is radioactive , and decays . cerium , one of the lanthanides , is the 25th most common element in the earth 's crust . however , most rare earth elements are not found concentrated or in pure forms . a table listing the seventeen rare earth elements , their atomic number and symbol , the origin of their names , and some of their uses is provided here . some of the rare earths are named after the scientists who discovered them , and some are named based on where they were discovered .
