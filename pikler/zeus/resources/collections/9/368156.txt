Coraciiformes     the coraciiformes are a group of usually colorful `` near passerine '' birds . they include the kingfishers , the hoopoe , the bee-eaters , the rollers , and the hornbills . they generally have syndactyly , with three forward-pointing toes ( and toes 3 & 4 fused at their base ) , though in many kingfishers one of these is missing . this is largely an old world order , with the representation in the new world limited to the dozen or so species of todies and motmots , and a few of the more than 90 species of kingfishers .
