Galaxy cluster     galaxy clusters are large collections of galaxies . they consist of hundreds of galaxies and galaxy groups , bound together by gravity . galaxy clusters are much larger than galaxy groups , like our local group . clusters of galaxies should not be confused with either star clusters , which are `` inside '' galaxies , or with globular clusters , which usually orbit galaxies . notable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby universe include the virgo cluster , fornax cluster , hercules cluster , and the coma cluster . still larger than galaxy clusters are superclusters . a very large aggregation of galaxies known as the great attractor , dominated by the norma cluster , is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the universe ( hubble 's law ) . notable galaxy clusters in the distant , high-redshift universe include spt-cl j0546-5345 , the most massive galaxy cluster ever found in the early universe . galaxy clusters typically have the following properties . - they contain 50 to 1,000 galaxies , hot x-ray emitting gas and large amounts of dark matter . details are described in the `` composition '' section .
