Fragmentation (computer)    fragmentation ( computer ) fragmentation is the name given to a phenomenon that can be observed when a partition or logical volume is used over a longer period of time . in general , such a volume has a common file system . when data is written , the file system will try to keep logical blocks together as much as possible , using free space on the file system when this is available . when this is not possible , a file will be split into parts , which will be written to the volume . as the file is not stored in one part , accessing it will take a little longer . a process that saves all the files in one part per file is called defragmentation .
