Molecular cloning     molecular cloning is a type of work in molecular biology . it is used to assemble recombinant dna molecules , and to direct their replication within host organisms . the use of the word `` cloning '' means a dna molecule from a single living cell is used to make a large population of cells containing identical dna molecules . molecular cloning methods are central to many areas of modern biology and medicine . molecular cloning generally uses dna sequences from two different organisms : the species that is the source of the dna to be cloned , and the species that will serve as the living host for multiplying ( replicating ) the recombinant dna . in a molecular cloning experiment , the dna to be cloned is got from an organism of interest , then treated with enzymes in the test tube to get smaller dna fragments . these fragments are then joined with vector dna to produce recombinant dna molecules . the recombinant dna is then introduced into a host organism ( typically an easy-to-grow , benign , laboratory strain of `` e. coli '' bacteria ) . this produces a population of organisms in which recombinant dna molecules are replicated along with the host dna . because they contain foreign dna fragments , these are `` transgenic '' or genetically-modified microorganisms ( gmo ) .
