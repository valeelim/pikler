Natural Killer T cell     natural killer t cells ( nkt ) are cells formed from small lymphocytes . they are a type of t cell , and are different from natural killer cells ( nk ) . nkt cells are important , but make up only 0.1 % of all peripheral blood t cells . nkt cells are a subset of t cells which also have molecular markers normally associated with nk cells . they are important in recognizing glycolipids from organisms such as mycobacterium , which cause tuberculosis . nkt cells seem to be essential for several aspects of immunity because their dysfunction or deficiency leads to the development of autoimmune diseases ( such as diabetes and atherosclerosis ) and cancer . nkt cells have recently been implicated in the disease progression of human asthma . the clinical potential of nkt cells lies in the rapid release of cytokines that promote or suppress different immune responses .
