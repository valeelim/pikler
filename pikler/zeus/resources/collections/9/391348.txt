Corrective rape     corrective rape ( sometimes called curative rape ) is a hate crime where a person is raped , because of their perceived sexual orientation . people claim to be able to `` cure '' homosexuals by raping them . the people raping say that they can `` correct '' their orientation , to turn them heterosexual , or to make them `` act '' more in conformity with gender stereotypes . the term was coined in south africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of lesbians like eudy simelane and zoliswa nkonyana became public . there are many health problems associated with corrective rape , and although some countries have laws protecting lgbt people , corrective rape is often overlooked .
