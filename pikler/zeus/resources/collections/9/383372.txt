RSGC1     rsgc1 is a massive young open star cluster in the milky way galaxy . it was discovered in 2006 in the data from infrared surveys . there are 12 red supergiants identified so far . these are massive young stars undergoing helium burning in their cores . there is also one yellow hypergiant , and one intermediate . the cluster is in the constellation scutum at about 6.6 kpc from the sun . it is at the intersection of the northern end of the long bar of the milky way and the inner portion of the scutum–centaurus arm—one of its two major spiral arms . the age of rsgc1 is estimated at 10–14 million years . the observed red supergiants with the mass of about 16–20 solar masses will become type ii supernovas . the cluster is heavily obscured and has not been detected in the visible light . it lies close to other groups of red supergiants known as stephenson 2 , rsgc3 and alicante 8. the mass of rsgc1 is estimated at 30 thousand solar masses , which makes it one the most massive open clusters in the galaxy .
