Diastereomer     diastereomers ( also called diastereoisomers ) are stereoisomers which are not enantiomers . they are molecules which have the same atoms and bonds but different stereochemistry in at least one , but not all , of their chiral centres . diastereomers can have very different properties even though they look similar . this is different from enantiomers , that have exactly the same properties except when in a chiral environment like the human body . every chiral centre in a molecule has two possible ways of putting the groups in space . with only one chiral centre , there are two enantiomers . with two chiral centres , you can form 4 different isomers . when all chiral centres are changed at the same time , two pairs of enantiomers are formed . when only one chiral centre is changed at a time , sets of diastereoisomers are formed . with more chiral centres the possibilities are many more . diastereoisomers which are different at only one of more chiral centres are called epimers . for example , -threose and -erythrose ( see picture ) are diastereomers because they are different at only one of two chiral centres . because of this they can also be called epimers .
