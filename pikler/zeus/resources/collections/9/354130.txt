Causinae     the causinae , commonly known as the `` night adders '' , are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in sub-saharan africa . the family is monotypic , since it only has the genus `` causus '' . there are six species . the night adders can grow to around 60 to 90 centimeters ( 24 to 36 in ) long . they are usually dark gray , light gray , light brown , or black in color with gray or black blotches . even though they are called the night adders , they are usually active at day , but some are active at night . when they are attacked or disturbed , they usually coil up and start hissing at their enemy to scare it off . some may raise their head and neck off the ground , and with their tongue sticking out , move froward like a the cobra does . they eat mainly toads and frogs , but there are reports of some night adders eating almost everything they can find until they are completely unable to swallow any more food . all night adders are oviparous , which means they lay eggs . this is unusual for most vipers , because most vipers are viviparous , they give live birth . they lay around two dozen eggs at a time . these eggs take around four months to hatch , when they hatch the hatchlings are 4-5 inches ( 10-12.5 cm ) long .
