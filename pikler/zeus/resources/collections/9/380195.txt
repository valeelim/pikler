Reaction mechanism     a reaction mechanism is writing step by step how a chemical reaction works . usually , only the overall change can be seen in a reaction . the things made in between react too quickly to be seen . these are called intermediates , and in going from one intermediate to another a transition state is crossed . however , it is important to understand all the steps that make the total change . this is because then one can understand more difficult reactions or try to make a reaction work in a certain way . there are many type of reaction mechanisms . in organic chemistry , the more common ones are nucleophilic substitution , elimination and addition . people sometimes use arrow pushing to draw how electrons move around during a reaction . this makes it easy to see which bonds are formed and which are broken during the process .
