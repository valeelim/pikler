Elytra     elytra are the modified , hardened front wings of beetles and some bugs ( heteroptera ) . in most true bugs , the forewings are called hemelytra , as only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous . the elytra act as protective wing-cases for the hind wings underneath , which are used for flying . to fly , a beetle opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings , flying while still holding the elytra open , though some beetles in the families scarabaeidae and buprestidae can fly with the elytra closed . in some groups , the elytra are fused together , and the insect is flightless . some of the ground beetles ( family carabidae ) are a good example of this .
