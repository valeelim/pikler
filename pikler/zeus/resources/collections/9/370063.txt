Destructive cult     a destructive cult is a cult or other religious movement which has caused harm to its members or other people , or which will likely do so . there is a discussion of what `` harm '' really means in this context . for most researchers , it includes `` physical harm '' , so organisations who injure or kill their members qualify . some researchers also include mental abuse in this notion of harm , for example : `` a destructive cult is a pyramid-shaped authoritarian regime with a person or group of people that have dictatorial control . it uses deception in recruiting new members ( e.g . people are not told up front what the group is , what the group actually believes and what will be expected of them if they become members '' . psychologist michael langone defines a destructive cult as `` a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits '' . lifton 's `` eight criteria for thought reform '' are criteria to identify a destructive cult .
