Enol     an enol is an alkene that has an oh group attached to one end of the double bond . it is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away . enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes . tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom . enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base . they are quite unstable , because the c=o bond is stronger than the c=c bond . however , they can do many interesting reactions . the best example is the aldol reaction . enols of ketones can be made on two different sides . it is important to be able to choose which side to react . the side with less substituents is the easiest one to react : it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base . this is called the kinetic enolate . the other side , with more substituents , is more difficult to react . higher temperatures are needed . this is called the thermodynamic enolate .
