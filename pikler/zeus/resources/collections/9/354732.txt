Parable of the Prodigal Son     the parable of the prodigal son is one of the parables of jesus . it is found only in the gospel of luke at 15:11-32. the parable is about a son who wastes his share of his father 's estate . he loses all his money and gets work feeding pigs -- one of the lowest jobs a person can do according to the jewish religion . he repents and returns to his father 's house . he is welcomed and a feast is held . his older , dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son . his father reminds him that all he has is his . he says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them . in the western catholic church , this parable is usually read on the third sunday of lent . in the eastern orthodox church it is read on the `` sunday of the prodigal son '' . the parable is the subject of much art , music , literature , and stage works . this is the last of three parables about loss and redemption . it follows the parable of the lost sheep and the parable of the lost coin . jesus tells this parable after the pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with `` sinners . '' the father 's joy described in the parable reflects divine love , the `` boundless mercy of god , '' and `` god 's refusal to limit the measure of his grace . ''
