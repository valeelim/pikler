Burning Man     burning man is a festival that happens every year at black rock desert in northern nevada , in the united states . it lasts a week , and it starts on the last monday in august , and ends on the first monday in september ( which is also labor day in the u.s. ) . the festival is called burning man because a large wood sculpture of a man is set on fire on saturday . the festival has been happening every year since 1990. many people go to burning man ; in 2012 , over 55,000 people were there . the black rock desert is far from any cities or towns , and is very dry , so people who go to burning man have to bring their own water , food , and shelter . burning man started in 1986 at san francisco . an artist named larry harvey made a wooden sculpture of a man , and decided to burn it a nearby beach as a bonfire for summer solstice . it was a success , so he did it again at the beach the next year , and then again a couple years after that . each year the sculpture was made bigger . in 1987 “ the man ” was almost tall , and in 1989 it was almost feet tall .
