Economics of fascism     the term economics of fascism refers to the economic systems that are used by fascist regimes . in general , fascist regimes wanted to exert strong control over the economy , but also defend private property ; this attitude is generally known as dirigisme . the first cases of dirigisme happened in france . one of the first such movements is known as colbertisme , after jean-baptiste colbert ( 1619-1683 ) . colbert was the chief minister of finances of king louis xiv of france . the ideas of social darwinism had a strong influence on fascist regimes : some people and enterprises did better than others ; those that did better needed the support of the state , those that did not do as well , needed to be eradicated . since most fascist regimes were also influenced by racist ideas , the general tendency was to support the companies of the people of the `` better '' race . gaetano salvemini , an italian historian said in 1936 that fascism made taxpayers responsible to private enterprise , because `` the state pays for the blunders of private enterprise ... profit is private and individual . loss is public and social . '' fascist governments encouraged the pursuit of private profit and offered many benefits to large businesses , but they demanded in return that all economic activity should serve the national interest .
