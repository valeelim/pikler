Chemical weapons in World War I     chemical weapons were a major part of world war i. it was the first time that chemical weapons were widely used in warfare . the gas was very harmful to both sides because the gas would often blow back into the attackers front lines . for this reason the use of gas was feared by both sides . gas masks were used to stop the gas by preventing it from traveling to the lungs . the first masks were big and clumsy . this caused them to be hated . the soldiers and the public had been told that the first world war would have been over by december of 1914. in 1916 the war was still going on , and a stalemate had been reached . ‘ the triple alliance ’ and ‘ the triple entente ’ had to compete to create better technology to break the stalemate and to win the war . gas was a very effective way of attacking the enemy without direct contact . the first use of gas in the war was in 1914 , when the french used tear gas grenades against the germans . this sparked an idea for the germans , and on 31 of january 1915 , they first used gas on a large scale . over 18,000 shells filled with gas were launched towards the russians . chlorine gas saw its first use on the 22 of april 1915 by the germans against the french . the french thought it was tear gas so took not so much notice of it . as it hit them , they fled in fear and some were overcome with the poisonous gas . a big opportunity had opened up for the germans . they however had not thought chlorine gas add such deadly effects , so retreated , missing a huge opportunity .
