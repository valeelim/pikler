Bog     a bog is a wetland where peat builds up . peat is layers of dead plant materialâ€”often mosses , in most cases , `` sphagnum '' moss . it is one of the four main types of wetlands . other names for bogs include mire , quagmire and muskeg . frequently , as the illustration on the right shows , they are covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat . the gradual buildup of decayed plant material in a bog forms a carbon sink . bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients . in some cases , the water is got entirely from precipitation , in which case they are ( rain-fed ) . water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour , which comes from dissolved peat tannins . in general the low fertility and cool climate results in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower because of the saturated soil . so , the amount of peat increases . large areas of landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat . bogs have a distinctive group of plant and animal species , and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .
