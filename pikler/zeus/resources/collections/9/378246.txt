Ferromagnetism     ferromagnetism is a property of many materials like iron . they are magnets , so they are attracted to , or pulled towards other magnets . in physics there are many different type of magnetism . ferromagnetism is the strongest one . it is used every day in many technological objects , like television screens and credit cards . ferromagnets are materials that have some magnetization on their own . this means that at a temperature of absolute zero and without any magnetic field from other objects , they are still magnetic . the reason for this is that the electrons in a material have a spin . in ferromagnetic materials , the electrons like to have all the spins going one way , giving some magnetism . usually , as the temperature is increased , the magnetization goes down . this is because the temperature causes the electrons in the material to move around a bit more . they do not have the spins perfectly going in the same way anymore . the point at which there is no magnetization anymore is called the curie temperature . this changes with different materials .
