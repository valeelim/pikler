Genomics     genomics is the part of genetics which studies the genomes of organisms . this includes the entire dna sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping . the field also includes studies of genes working together . examples are heterosis , epistasis , pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome . genomics applies recombinant dna , dna sequencing methods , and bioinformatics to sequence , assemble , and analyze the function and structure of genomes . this is the `` complete '' set of dna within a single cell of an organism ) . in contrast , the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of molecular biology or genetics and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research . research of single genes unless it involves the entire genome . the united states environmental protection agency has a somewhat broader definition :
