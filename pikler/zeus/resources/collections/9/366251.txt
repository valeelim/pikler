Mantoux test     the mantoux test is a test developed to detect tuberculosis . in the year 1890 , robert koch developed tuberculin , as a treatment for tuberculosis . the substance proved ineffective to treat the disease , today it is commonly used to detect it , though . tuberculin is a substance based on the pathogen that causes tuberculosis . charles mantoux , a french physician , developed a test method , based on the work of koch . a positive test result simply says that the immune system came in contact with mycobacteria - this does not necessarily mean that people with a positive test result have been infected with tuberculosis . such a result , which shows as positive , even though the outcome should be negative is called `` false positive '' . the test shows the reaction of the immune system to tuberculin . this requires an intact immune system : people whose immune system is weakened , for example those with a hiv infection , may also show a `` false negative '' : their immune system may simply be too weak to react . similarly , the use of certain substances , such as steroids may lead to false negatives .
