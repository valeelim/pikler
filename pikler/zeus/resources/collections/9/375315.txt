Fundamental force     the four fundamental forces are the ways that all things in nature affect each other . these forces are called gravity , electromagnetism , the weak force , and the strong force . it is thought by most physicists that three of these forces ( electromagnetism , the weak force , and the strong force ) become a single force under very high temperatures . this idea is known as the grand unification theory . gravity is the force that pulls all common objects to each other .
