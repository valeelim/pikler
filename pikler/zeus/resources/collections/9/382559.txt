Ester     an ester is a carbonyl with an ether group on the carbon atom . the group can be written as coor . they can be made by reacting a carboxylic acid with an alcohol with some acid . esters are a very important functional group . they can be found in many substances . they are very common in fats and oils . they sometimes have a very strong , nice smell . they can be used to make perfumes . polyesters are found in plastics . esters can also do many reactions . it is very easy to change the ether part of the molecule with another similar one . it is also possible to reduce the ester to a ketone or an alcohol , which can do many different reactions . nucleophilic addition is also a good reaction , though a bit more difficult than with ketones . there are many ways to find out if a molecule has an ester group . infrared spectroscopy gives very sharp signals , which are different from other carbonyls . carbon nmr spectroscopy has similar characteristics .
