Ziegler Polar Expedition     the ziegler polar expedition of 1903–1905 was a failed attempt to reach the north pole . the party was stranded north of the arctic circle for two years before being rescued . all but one of its members survived . the expedition was paid for by william ziegler and led by anthony fiala . they left from tromsø , norway , on june 14 , 1903 , aboard `` america '' . ziegler chose anthony fiala , who was a photographer on an earlier mission , to lead his second polar trip . fiala calculated that the food for an eight dog team and driver would be at least 1100 pounds . this was an issue , as the most a sled could hold was 600 pounds . he planned to use ponies to carry the extra supplies . then to feed the dogs on horse meat when the supplies were low . in november 1903 severe weather started . the ship broke up , destroying the provisions and coal . the following spring , more tries were made to reach the pole by traveling both east and west . the conditions were too severe , and open water caused difficulties . supplies ran low , and the expedition headed south . they reached depots at cape flora , cape dillion , and camp ziegler .
