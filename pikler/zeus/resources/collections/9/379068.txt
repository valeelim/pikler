Koobi Fora     koobi fora is a region around koobi fora ridge , on the eastern shore of lake turkana , kenya . it is in the territory of the nomadic gabbra people . the term east turkana can be used for the whole area . the ridge is an outcrop of mainly pliocene/pleistocene sediments . it is composed of claystones , siltstones , and sandstones that preserve numerous fossils of land mammals , including early hominin species . the ridge is being eroded into a badlands terrain by a series of ephemeral rivers that drain into the northeast portion of modern lake turkana . in 1968 richard leakey established the koobi fora base camp on a large sandspit projecting into the lake near the ridge , which he called the koobi fora spit . a survey and numerous excavations showed the region was a source of hominin fossils from the last 4.2 million years . far exceeding the number of humanoid fossils are the non-humanoid fossils , which give us a look at the fauna and flora as far back as the miocene . in 1973 , the government of kenya reserved the region as sibiloi national park , establishing a headquarters for the national museums of kenya on koobi fora spit . the reserve is well-maintained and is well-guarded by friendly but armed park police . protection of sites and especially of wildlife are of prime concern .
