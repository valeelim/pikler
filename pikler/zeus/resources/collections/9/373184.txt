Oligopsony     in microeconomics an oligopsony is a market form where there are few buyers . there may be many sellers , but because there are few buyers , the decision each buyer makes influences the whole market . therefore this is an example of imperfect competition . one example of this is the market for cocoa : three companies ( cargill , archer daniels midland and callebaut ) buy most of the world production , usually from small farmers . other examples are that of tobacco or that of bananas . by extension the `` market for work '' also has this characteristic : there are few companies ( employers , `` buying work '' ) and many people `` offering to work '' . references . - bhaskar , v. , a. manning and t. to ( 2002 ) 'oligopsony and monopsonistic competition in labor markets , ' `` journal of economic perspectives , '' 16 , 155â€“174 . - bhaskar , v. and t. to ( 2003 ) 'oligopsony and the distribution of wages , ' `` european economic review , '' 47 , 371-399 .
