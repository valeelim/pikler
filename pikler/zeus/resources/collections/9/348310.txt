Barents Sea     the barents sea is a marginal sea of the arctic ocean . it is north of norway and russia . it was called the murman sea in the middle ages . the new name is from the dutch navigator willem barents . it is a rather deep shelf sea . the average depth is and maximum depth is . it is bordered by the norwegian sea in the west , the islands of svalbard ( norway ) in the northwest , and the islands of franz josef land and novaya zemlya in the northeast and east . novaya zemlya separates the kara sea from the barents sea . a lot of fossil fuel energy resources are in the barents sea area . the southern half of the barents sea stays ice-free year round due to the warmth brought by the north atlantic drift . this includes the ports of murmansk in russia and vard√∏ in norway . in september , the entire barents sea is mostly ice-free . until the end of the winter war , finland 's territories reached the barents sea . this made the harbor at petsamo finland 's only ice-free winter harbor . due to the north atlantic drift , the barents sea has a lot of plants and animals compared to other oceans of similar latitude . the spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early close to the ice edge . the fresh water from the melting ice makes up a water layer on top of the sea water . the phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton . the animals that eat zooplankton include young cod , capelin , polar cod , whales , and little auk . the capelin is a main food for animals such as the north-east arctic cod , harp seals , and seabirds such as common guillemot and brunnich 's guillemot . the fisheries of the barents sea , in particular the cod fisheries , are of great importance for both norway and russia .
