Darlington transistor     a darlington transistor , sometimes called `` darlington pair '' is a transistor circuit that is made from two transistors . sidney darlington invented it at bell labs . it is like a transistor but it has much higher ability to gain current . the circuit can be made from two discreet transistors or it can be inside an integrated circuit . the hfe parameter with a darlington transistor is each transistors hfe multiplied together . the circuit is useful in audio amplifiers or in a probe that measures very small current that goes through water . it is so sensitive that it can pick up the current in skin . if you connect it to a piece of metal , you can make a touch-sensitive button .
