Laetoli     laetoli is a site in tanzania , dated to the pliopleistocene . it is famous for its hominin footprints , preserved in volcanic ash . the site of the laetoli footprints is 45 km south of olduvai gorge . it was excavated by archaeologists louis and mary leakey in 1978 . “ the laetoli footprints ” got a lot of attention from the public because they are convincing evidence of bipedalism in pliocene hominins . dated to 3.6 million years ag , o they were the oldest known evidence of hominin bipedalism . now older evidence has been found , such as the `` ardipithecus ramidus '' fossils . the footprints and skeletal structure excavated at laetoli were clear evidence that bipedalism evolved before enlarged brains in hominids . although it is debated , it is believed the three individuals who made these footprints belonged to the species `` australopithecus afarensis '' . together with footprints were other hominin and animal skeletal remains and acheulean artifacts ( hand-axes ) . after debate , it was decided that `` australopithecus afarensis '' is the species of the three hominins who made the footprints at laetoli . this is based on the reconstruction of the foot skeleton of a female `` a. afrarensis '' hominin . detailed footprint analysis compared both human and bipedal animals such as bears and primates . gaits ( stride pattern ) , and foot structure were analysed . step length , stride length , stride width and foot angle showed that `` a. afarensis '' was more human-like in gait than ape-like .
