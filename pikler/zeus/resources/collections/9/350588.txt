Andreas Vesalius     andreas vesalius ( 31 december 1514 – 15 october 1564 ) was a flemish anatomist , physician , and author . he wrote one of the most influential books on human anatomy , `` de humani corporis fabrica '' ( `` on the fabric of the human body '' ) . vesalius is often called the founder of modern human anatomy . vesalius is the latinized form of andries van wesel . he is sometimes also called andreas vesal , andré vesalio and andre vesale . anatomies had been published before , but those of vesalius were in a different class . they were based on actual dissections of human bodies ( after death ) . and the drawings were artwork of the highest class . dissections of cadavers ( dead human bodies ) was forbidden for many centuries , and this limited previous work on anatomy . before vesalius , most information about the human body came from galen . by dissecting human bodies , vesalius showed that many of the things galen wrote about were wrong . galen was primarily misinformed about the human heart , liver and lower jaw bone . it was found that galen 's work was based on barbary apes , but he also dissected pigs , which led to even more inaccurate observations .
