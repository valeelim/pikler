Hygrometer     a hygrometer , also known as a psychrometer , is a device that is used to measure the humidity in the air . a common way these devices work is by using a material that attracts moisture , and that changes depending on how moist it is . the probably simplest method of these is to use a human hair . the hair will change length , depending on the moisture.hence , it calculates the relative humidity of a particular place . a hygrometer has two bulbs : one wet and one dry . both bulbs are traditional thermometers , though one is covered with a wet towel . after a period of time , the water on the wet bulb evaporates and at that time , the temperature is measured on each bulb . the difference between the temperatures is noted . then each is used on a chart to find the relative humidity of that temperature and area . a small difference between the temperature of the bulbs shows a high relative humidity coming from a low evaporation rate . in dry air , evaporation happens faster showing a large difference in temperature thus giving you a low relative humidity .
