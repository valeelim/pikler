World line     a world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time , usually called spacetime . as you probably know from special relativity , the faster an object goes , the more time slows down for that object . as you can see in the illustration to the right , the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object , the one which time passes much more slowly for . when an object reaches the speed of light , it will be zero on the `` t '' axis , meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction . basically , the world lines show that when the speed of light is reached , time stops for the observer . world lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity , as well as general relativity . the concept of world lines is used widely in theoretical physics , for it shows some interesting facts about high-speed motion . for example , the time dilation equation presented by albert einstein is algebraically undefined when an object 's velocity is the speed of light , but using world lines one can find that when the speed is the speed of light , time will stop . although einstein 's equation ( for time dilation ) does show that an object going faster than light goes backward in time , the same concept can be described using world lines .
