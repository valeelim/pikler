Sulfoxide     a sulfoxide is a molecule that has a sulfur atom bonded to two carbons and one oxygen atom . it comes from oxidising thioethers , without going all the way to the sulfone . like many molecules containing sulfur , sulfoxide can sometimes smell a lot . sulfoxides can be written with the general formula r–s ( =o ) –r ' . sulfur has a double bond with the oxygen , and single bonds with the carbons . that leaves a lone pair on the atom . this means that the shape at that atom is tetrahedral . it also means that the sulfur can be a chiral centre . sulfoxides are used as good ligands for transition metals . an important molecule of this kind is dimethyl sulfoxide . it is also called dmso . it is used as a solvent for many reactions , especially in biochemistry .
