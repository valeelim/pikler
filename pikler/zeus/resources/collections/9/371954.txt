Fen     a fen is one of the four main types of wetland , and is usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or groundwater . fens have neutral or alkaline water , with relatively high dissolved mineral levels but few other plant nutrients . they are usually dominated by grasses and sedges , and typically have brown mosses in general including `` scorpidium '' or `` drepanocladus '' . fens often have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as `` pinguicula '' . they may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants . the distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations . fens have a characteristic set of plant species , which sometimes provide the best indicators of environmental conditions . they are called `` fen indicator species '' . fens are distinguished from bogs , which are acidic , low in minerals , and usually dominated by sedges and shrubs , with abundant `` sphagnum '' mosses .
