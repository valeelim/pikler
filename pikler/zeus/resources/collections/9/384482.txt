Lingula     lingula is a genus of brachiopods in the class lingulata . `` lingula '' is known to have existed since the early ordovician period . `` lingula '' is a good example of a living fossil . like all brachiopods , it is a filter feeder . brachiopods are superficially similar to bivalves , both having two shells . brachiopods are easily distinguished from molluscs because they have ( different ) dorsal and ventral shells . bivalves have mirrored right and left shells . `` lingula '' and most brachiopods also have a stalk ( or peduncle ) that extends through a hole near the tip of one of its shells . bivalves may be attached to a substrate with byssus filaments , that extend from between the shells . the lingulata brachiopods have existed from the cambrian period to the present , a time span of over 500 million years ! modern species of `` lingula '' are very similar from their fossil ancestors .
