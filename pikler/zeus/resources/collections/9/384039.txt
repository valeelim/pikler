Oxford Circus     oxford circus is the busy intersection of oxford street and regent street in the west end of london . it is served by oxford circus tube station , which is directly beneath the junction itself . the circus was constructed in the beginning of the 19th century , and was designed by john nash . in 2009 , westminster city council started a £4m scheme for the area , allowing shoppers to cross the intersection diagonally as well as the usual 'straight ahead ' , turning it into a `` pedestrian scramble '' , much like tokyo 's shibuya crossing . the crossing opened on november 2nd of the same year , by which time the cost had risen to £5 million . the mayor of london , boris johnson , said it was `` a triumph for british engineering , japanese innovation and good old common sense '' . others noted that a similar crossing in balham , south london had opened in 2005 at a cost of only £98,000 .
