Anaerobic respiration     anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration which does not use oxygen . elements other than oxygen are used for electron transport . common replacements for oxygen are nitrates , iron , manganese , sulfates , sulfur , fumaric acid and carbon dioxide . `` escherichia coli '' uses nitrates and fumaric acid for respiration . for the electron transport chain to work , there must be a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain . this allows electrons to pass through the chain . in aerobic organisms , this final electron acceptor is oxygen . molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and so it is an excellent acceptor . in anaerobes , other less-oxidizing substances such as sulphate ( so ) , nitrate ( no ) , sulphur ( s ) are used . these terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than o , so less energy is released per oxidized molecule . anaerobic respiration is therefore less efficient than aerobic respiration except , of course , when oxygen pressure is low . if oxygen is not used at all , the process is called fermentation . examples of organisms using fermentation are lactic acid bacteria , and yeast . yeast is a fungi , not bacteria .
