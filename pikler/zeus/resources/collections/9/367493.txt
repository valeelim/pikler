Aldehyde     an aldehyde ( ) is an organic compound . it contains a formyl group . a formyl group is a part of a molecule with the structure r-cho . it is made of a carbon double bonded to oxygen . the oxygen is also bonded to hydrogen and an r group . a side chain is the rest of the molecule . the group without the side chain is called the aldehyde group or formyl group . aldehydes are different from ketones because the formyl group is at the end of the molecule in an aldehyde . ketones have the formyl group in the middle of the molecule . aldehydes are common in organic chemistry . many fragrances ( smell producing compounds ) are aldehydes . aldehydes have a carbon double bonded to an oxygen . because of this , they are slightly polar . this causes aldehydes to have a number of properties . one of the most important of these is solubility in water . the common names for aldehydes are not always the official names . the iupac names are useful , however . iupac recommends the following nomenclature for aldehydes :
