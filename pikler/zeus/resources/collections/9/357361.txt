Mars flyby     a mars flyby is when a spacecraft passes near the planet mars , but does not enter orbit or land on it . unmanned ( no humans on board ) space probes have used this method to collect data on mars . a spacecraft that is built for a flyby is also known as a `` flyby bus '' or `` flyby spacecraft '' . list of mars flybys . - dawn , closest approach was 549 km . - rosetta within 250 km - nozomi - mariner program spacecraft - mariner 4 , mariner 6 , and mariner 7 returned data from mars flybys - mars program spacecraft - two mars flyby attempts were made in 1960 under mars 1m ( mars 1960a and mars 1960b ) . - the third attempt at a mars flyby was the soviet mars 2mv-4 no.1 , also called mars 1962a or sputnik 22 , which launched in 1962 as part of the mars program . but it was destroyed in low earth orbit due to rocket failure . - mars 1 also launched in 1962 but communications failed before it reached mars . - mars 4 achieved a flyby in 1974 and detected a night-side ionosphere , although by that time mars was already orbited by other spacecraft .
