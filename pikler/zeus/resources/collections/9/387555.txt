Apatite     apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of oh , f , cl or ions , respectively , in the crystal . apatite is characteristic of biological systems . it is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems . it hardness defines 5 on the mohs scale . hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral . much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite . in this form most of the oh groups are absent , and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions . fluorapatite ( or fluoroapatite ) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite . in the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries . fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite . similarly , toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride anions ( e.g . sodium fluoride , sodium monofluorophosphate ) .
