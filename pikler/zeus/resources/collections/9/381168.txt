Water Lilies     water lilies ( or nymphéas , ) is a series of about 250 oil paintings by french impressionist claude monet . the paintings are of monet 's flower garden at giverny . they were the main focus of monet 's work during the last thirty years of his life . many of the works were painted while monet suffered from cataracts . the paintings are on display in museums all over the world , including the musée marmottan monet and the musée d'orsay in paris , the metropolitan museum of art in new york , the art institute of chicago , the carnegie museum of art and the national museum of wales , among others . as part of his extensive gardening plans at giverny , monet had a pond dug in his garden and planted with lilies in 1893. he painted the subject in 1899 , and thereafter it dominated his art . he worked continuously for more than twenty years on a large-scale decorative series , attempting to capture every observation , impression , and reflection of the flowers and water . the series captures the blooms at different times of the day , and under different atmospheric conditions . after much hesitation , monet exhibited a group of 48 water-lily paintings in 1909 at the paris gallery of his art dealer , paul durand-ruel . the series became an enormous financial , popular , and critical hit . by the mid-1910s , monet had achieved a completely new , fluid , and somewhat audacious style of painting in which the water-lily pond became the point of departure for an almost abstract art .
