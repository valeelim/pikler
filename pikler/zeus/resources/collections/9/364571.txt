Martin Frobisher     sir martin frobisher ( 1535 or 1539 – 15 november 1594 ) was an english seaman who made three voyages to the new world to look for the northwest passage . all landed in northeastern canada , around today 's resolution island and frobisher bay . on his second voyage , frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried 200 tons of it home on three ships , where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of £5.1 per ton . encouraged , frobisher returned to canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around frobisher bay . he carted 1,350 tons of the ore back where , after years of smelting , it was realized that both that batch of ore and the earlier one he had taken were worthless iron pyrite . as an english privateer/pirate , he collected riches from french ships . he was later knighted for his service in repelling the spanish armada in 1588 .
