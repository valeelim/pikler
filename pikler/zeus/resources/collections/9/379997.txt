Havre Boucher     havre boucher ( ) is a canadian village in antigonish county , nova scotia . the village takes its name from `` havre boucher '' , a natural harbour that opens onto st. george 's bay to the north . the original community of havre boucher is located to the west side of the harbour , although it now includes the communities of auld 's cove , cape jack , east havre boucher , west havre boucher , frankville and linwood . havre boucher is a rural area , largely dependent upon the fishing industry , as well as serving as a service centre for local communities . the construction of the canso causeway , which opened in 1955 , saw the canadian national railway mainline from truro-sydney diverted from linwood north through havre boucher and cape jack , before following the strait of canso to the causeway . before 1955 , the railway ran from linwood to mulgrave where a ferry service operated to point tupper . havre boucher saw the construction of a large railway yard , which remains in operation today by the cape breton and central nova scotia railway .
