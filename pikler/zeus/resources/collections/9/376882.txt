Lev Vygotsky     lev vygotsky ( â€“ 11 june 1934 ) was a russian psychologist . he worked on child development , play and language . he also developed a holistic theory of human cultural and biosocial development . vygotsky 's early death to tuberculosis left many manuscripts . sorting them out has taken many years . perhaps vygotsky 's most important work was the inter-relationship of language development and thought . this establishes the connection between speech and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness . vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from normal ( external ) speech . although vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech by a gradual process , with younger children only really able to `` think out loud '' . language starts as a tool external to the child used for social interaction . the child guides its behavior by using a kind of self-talk or `` thinking out loud '' . initially , self-talk is very much a tool of social interaction and this tapers to negligible levels when the child is alone . gradually , self-talk is used more as a tool for self-directed and self-regulating behavior . because it gets internalized , self-talk is no longer present when the child starts school . self-talk `` develops along a rising not a declining , curve ; it goes through an evolution , not an involution . in the end , it becomes inner speech '' .
