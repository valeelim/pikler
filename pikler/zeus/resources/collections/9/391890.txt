Ketogenic diet     a ketogenic diet is a diet that derives most of its calories from fat and only a small number of calories from carbohydrates . the diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates for energy . normally , the carbohydrates you eat are turned into glucose in the body , which is used for energy around the body and in the brain . but , if you do n't eat enough carbohydrates , your body has a back-up system of burning fat instead . the liver can use stored fat and the fat you eat for energy . stored fat is broken into two parts , fatty acids , and ketone bodies . ketone bodies power the brain instead of glucose . this state of having a lot of ketone bodies in your blood is called `` ketosis . '' the regular ketogenic diet has two to four times more fat by weight than protein , and very little carbohydrates every day . this means not eating foods that are made from starch or sugar . high-carbohydrate foods are foods like fruits , bread , pasta , grains , cookies , and ice cream . also , you have to increase your intake of fatty foods , like oils , butter , and fatty meats . it 's also important to not eat too much protein . you should only eat just enough protein so you do n't lose muscles . too much protein reduces the ketone bodies in your blood and blocks fat burning .
