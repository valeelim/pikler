Padmashali     padmashali ( ) is a telugu-speaking hindu artisan community . the community members are traditionally weavers who specialise in weaving cloth of all kinds . the community is related to the brahmins . they originally come from the indian state of andhra pradesh and later some of the community members also moved to the neighbouring indian states of karnataka , tamil nadu , maharashtra , chhattisgarh and odisha . most padmashalis speak telugu , except in the dakshina kannada district of coastal karnataka , where they speak tulu . the padmashali community profess to have been following all the religious rites prescribed for brahmins till the beginning of kali yuga . one of the members of their caste named padmasaka declined to reveal the virtues of a miraculous gem which lord brahma had given to their caste to ganesha who sought to learn the secret which they had been enjoined to keep , and who on his wish not being gratified cursed them to fall from their high status . it is said however that one parabrahmamurti born in srirama agrahara pleased ganesha by his tapas , who relaxed the curse , so that after 5000 years of kali yuga , they should regain their brahminical status . this parabrahmamurti , otherwise known as padmabavacharya , it is said redistributed the caste into 101 gotras arranged in eight groups and established four mathas with gurus for them .
