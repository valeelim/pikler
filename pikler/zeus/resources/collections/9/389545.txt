Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST)    moscow center of sparc technologies ( mcst ) mcst ( ) is a microprocessor company that was set up in the 1992s . different types of processors made by mcst were used in personal computers , servers and computing systems . mcst develops microprocessors based on 2 different instruction set architecture ( isa ) : `` elbrus '' and `` sparc '' - `` elbrus 1 '' ( 1973 ) was the fourth generation soviet computer , developed by vsevolod burtsev . implements tag-based architecture and algol as system language like the burroughs large systems . a side development was an update of the 1965 besm-6 as elbrus-1k2 . - `` elbrus 2 '' ( 1977 ) was a 10-processor computer , considered the first soviet supercomputer , with superscalar risc processors . re-implementation of the elbrus 1 architecture with faster ecl chips . - `` elbrus 3 '' ( 1986 ) was a 16-processor computer developed by boris babaian . differing completely from the architecture of both elbrus 1 and elbrus 2 , it employed a vliw architecture . - `` elbrus-90micro '' ( 1998-2010 ) is a computer line based on sparc instruction set architecture ( isa ) microprocessors : mcst r80 , r150 , r500 , r500s and mcst-4r working at 80 , 150 , 500 and 1000 mhz .
