Ambient intelligence     ambient intelligence is an idea from computer science to create an environment of machines that meaningfully interact with people . the idea is that these machines help people solve the problems they have , and that people can interact with the machines in a natural way . an example would be a camera that recognizes the owner of a house or apartment , and that is able to turn off the alarm , and unlock the door . the systems that control the camera , the alarm system and the door lock are all connected to each other . when the camera sees the person , it works with the other systems to make the person 's life easier . in order for the idea to work well : - computer hardware should be small - different networks of computers and home appliances need to be connected so they can communicate with each other - computer networks are easy to control and program . new devices in the networks should configure themselves automatically , or their configuration should be easy to do , without the need to understand how they all work .
