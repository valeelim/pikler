Chairlift     a chairlift is a type of public transport . it is like a chair that runs on cables . the cable is placed over the chair to lift it from the ground and they run between two ( or more ) stations . the cable is moved around by motors and lifted from the ground by towers . there are many chairs on the cable so that many people can be transported . chairlifts are found in skiing resorts , where they make skiers go up the mountain . they are sometimes better than gondola lifts because the skier does not need to remove the skis . he/she can sit down on the chair and then leave it at the top of the mountain very quickly . old chairlifts are small and slow . newer ones can carry up to 8 people . they are also faster overall , but they slow down at the station , making it easier to get on and off . sometimes they even have a glass bubble that can be closed to keep people warm inside . related pages . - gondola lift - cable car
