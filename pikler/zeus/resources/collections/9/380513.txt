Lady Elizabeth Delmé and Her Children     lady elizabeth delmé and her children ( 1779 ) is an oil on canvas portrait by joshua reynolds . it hangs in the national gallery of art , washington , dc . the sitters in the picture are lady elizabeth delmé and her children john and isabella elizabeth . they sat for their portraits in april and june 1777. reynolds was paid three hundred pounds for the work in 1780 , and touched up and re-varnished the picture in 1789. reynolds believed in the what was called the `` grand manner '' . the two years involved in completing the portrait would have aged the children . `` but reynolds worked from abstract principles of design rather than observation of nature , '' the national gallery of art writes , `` one of his conceptions for grand manner likenesses was : `` each person should have the expression which men of his rank generally exhibit . '' reynolds therefore suppressed psychological individuality to gain a grandeur appropriate for these aristocrats . '' reynolds alluded to the madonnas of raphael ( such as the `` madonna of the goldfinch '' ) in the triangular configuration of the sitters . this was another attempt to evoke the grand manner . rembrandt and titian are hinted at in the browns of the background .
