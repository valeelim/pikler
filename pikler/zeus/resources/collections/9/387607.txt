Conserved sequence     conserved sequences are similar or identical sequences which occur in dna , and cause sequences in rna , proteins and carbohydrates . these sequences occur across species . this shows that the sequences has been maintained in evolution despite speciation . the further back up the phylogenetic tree a particular conserved sequence occurs , the more highly conserved it is . since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny by genes , a conserved sequence implies that there is a conserved gene . conservation of a sequence happens when mutations in a highly conserved region lead to non-viable life forms , that is , a form which is eliminated through natural selection . in other words , the product of the gene is vital to life , and its function is destroyed by almost all changes ( mutations ) to the sequence . the basic theory , widely agreed , is that highly conserved dna sequences must have functional value , though the role for many of these highly conserved non-coding dna sequences is not known . one recent study that eliminated four highly conserved non-coding dna sequences in mice yielded viable mice with no significant phenotypic differences ; the authors described their findings as `` unexpected '' . so there is clearly something here which is not understood .
