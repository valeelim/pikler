Solo concerto     the solo concerto is a concerto that includes a single soloist , with accompaniment from the entire orchestra . it originated in the baroque period , and remained throughout the years to be popular among many composers . although it is not true for many solo concerti , it could be said that the genre typically has three movements , the first and the last being fast-paced and lively , broken up by a more lyrical , slower second movement . giuseppe torelli was one of the first composers to write solo concerti , written in 1698 ; however vivaldi could be credited to making the three-movement form as typical of this genre . later , handel wrote many solo concerti for different types of soloist , as before then they had mainly been only for violin . the classical period then used solo concerti to great effect , and developed to make the solos more virtuosic . many of beethoven ’ s and mozart ’ s more famous works were solo concerti . the early romantic period had many solo concerti , written by well-known composers such as mendelssohn , and were not too different from those of the classical era . however , later in this period , the solos became even more virtuosic , meaning that only brilliant players could ever play them . along with this , the structures and textures became denser , helped by the excessive size that was commonplace during the era .
