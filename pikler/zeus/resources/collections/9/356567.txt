Iberian lynx     the iberian lynx ( `` lynx pardinus '' ) is a feline . it is similar to other versions of the genus `` lynx '' . the iberian lynx has almost no threats except man , but it is almost extinct . it is the most endangered cat species in the world . iberian lynx hunt rabbits . one of the strategies aimed at saving the species is to change the use of land in such a way that it becomes more attractive to rabbits , which can then be hunted by the lynx . this strategy also benefits other endangered species , such as the spanish imperial eagle . in 2014 , the iberian lynx is treated as a species inside the famly of lynx by many biologists , mainly because of its independent development on the iberian peninsula . this has not always been the case : beforehand , it was seen as a subspecies of the eurasian lynx . in 2002 , the jerez zoo confirmed it had three females and was developing a plan for a captive breeding program . one of those females was saliega , captured as a cub in april 2002. she became the first iberian lynx to breed in captivity , giving birth to three healthy kittens on 29 march 2005 at the el acebuche breeding center , in the doñana nature park in huelva , spain . over the following years , the number of births grew and additional breeding centers were opened . in march 2009 , it was reported that 27 cubs had been born since the beginning of the program . in 2009 , the spanish government planned to build a €5.5 million breeding center in zarza de granadilla . portugal established a breeding center in silves .
