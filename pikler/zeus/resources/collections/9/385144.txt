Automata theory     automata theory is a branch of theoretical computer science . automata theory is concerned with the study of abstract machines called automata , and with the problems that can be solved using such machines . an automaton is characterized by a number of states it can be in , a number of transitions between those states , and an alphabet of symbols it accepts . one state is special : it is the state the automaton is in at the start . there are a number of states that are called final states or exit states ; if at the end of the input , the automaton is in one of those states , it is said to accept the word just processed , otherwise it is said to reject it . example problems of automata theory include : - the question to know whether a given automaton is the smallest possible , that accepts a given number of words . there are algorithms that permit to reduce the number of states , by combining different states that are equivalent . related pages . - cellular automaton
