Cepheid variable     cepheids are a type of very luminous variable stars . there is a strong direct relationship between a cepheid 's luminosity and pulsation period . this makes cepheids important standard candles for the galactic and extragalactic distance scales . cepheid variables are divided into several subclasses which exhibit clearly different masses , ages , and evolutionary histories : 1. classical cepheids 1. type ii cepheids 1. anomalous cepheids 1. dwarf cepheids the first cepheid known was delta cephei in the constellation cepheus , found by john goodricke in 1784. delta cephei is of great importance because its distance is extremely well known , thanks in part to it being in a star cluster , and the precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes . classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cephei variables ) pulsate with very regular periods of the order of days to months . classical cepheids are population i variable stars which are 4–20 times more massive than the sun , and up to 100,000 times more luminous . cepheids are yellow supergiants of spectral class f6 – k2 . when they pulsate , their radii change by ~25 % . for the longer-period i carinae this means millions of kilometers for a pulsation cycle .
