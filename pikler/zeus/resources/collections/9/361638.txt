Evolutionary arms race     an evolutionary arms race is when two species ( or populations ) are so linked that a change in one indirectly causes a change in the other . it is a metaphor drawn from the so-called arms race between the west and the soviet union , after the second world war . evolutonary arms races are a kind of co-evolution . examples . - predatorprey evolution is the classic example . a new twist by the predator must be answered with a new defence by the prey . - conifers grew tall , to some extent out of the reach of sauropod dinosaurs . dinosaurs grew taller and continued eating the conifers . - gazelles run fast and so do cheetahs ; both have been under a continual series of similar changes which increase their running speed . - the rough-skinned newt , the garter snake and toxin resistance is a well-researched case study . where the two species live together , the newt produces more toxin , and the snake has evolved to resist it ; where they live separately the newt toxin is milder , and the snake has little resistance . the snakes pay a price for their resistance : their digestion and body metabolism is slower than related species . `` really resistant snakes have slower crawl speeds than snakes with little or no resistance '' .
