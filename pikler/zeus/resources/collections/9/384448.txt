Stock-Keeping Unit     sku ( often pronounced `` skew '' ) is an acronym for stock-keeping unit . this is the barcode found on things sold in stores . it is made in a way that laser scanners in the check-out lane can read the code . the code is then used to find the price . the bar code is made of vertical bars , some are thick , some are thin . the scanner can see these bars and the pattern of the bars tells them what the numbers are . the patterns are made in a way that the scanner can read it forwards or backwards , so it does n't matter how the product is held , it can still read the number . the numbers are often also written underneath the bars , so that people can read the sku . there are two parts to the number . the first part is who made the product , the second part is what the actual product is .
