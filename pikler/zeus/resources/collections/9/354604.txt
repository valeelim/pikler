Outstation movement     in australia , the outstation movement is the movement of australian aboriginal people from large towns to much smaller communities , called outstations . it is mostly seen in the northern territory and amongst the people of the western desert . before the 20th century , most aboriginal families lived by themselves or in groups of 20â€“30 people . they were nomadic ( moving from place to place ) , hunting and foraging across the deserts . as euro-australians started to build roads , towns and farms on aboriginal lands , the native people were forced out . they had to move off their lands into towns or missions . there , the government would give them food , water and clothes . this way of life did not suit them . in the towns , there were many conflicts between different ethnic groups , people became addicted to alcohol , and many of them died from foreign diseases . many groups were also far away from their traditional homelands , which were important to them and their spirituality . from the 1970s , many families started to move away from the towns . they returned to the places they grew up , and set up smaller communities .
