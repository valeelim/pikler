Emeritus     emeritus is a title given to a professor , bishop or other person with an important office . the title says that these people , while still holding their title , no longer practice their function . usually , this is done because of old age . usually the `` emeritus '' is put after the official title of the person , as in `` professor emeritus '' . in the time of the roman empire , it was used for soldiers , to say that they no longer needed to serve in the army . that way , a bishop emeritus no longer needs to take part in the celebration of the mass , but he is still able to perform confirmations or to ordain priests .
