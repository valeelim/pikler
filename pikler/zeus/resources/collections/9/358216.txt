String (physics)    string ( physics ) in string theory and theoretical physics , strings are hypothetical objects that are believed to be the elementary particles of the universe . if they exist , they would not be point-like particles , but rather 1-dimensional `` strings '' of energy that vibrate in various dimensions . the image to the right illustrates the various possible dimensions that a string could vibrate in . ( currently , physicists accept the fact that there are at least 11 dimensions in our universe : 1 time dimension and 10 spacial dimensions . ) the length of the strings would be determined by planck length : it is still not known whether these strings actually exist . they are pretty much the main topic of string theory . related pages . - string theory - calabi-yau manifold - m-theory
