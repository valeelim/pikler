Pyramid (geometry)    pyramid ( geometry ) a pyramid is a three-dimensional shape . it has triangular sides that come together in a point at the top , call the `` apex '' . a pyramid with a square base ( bottom ) and four sides is called a square pyramid . a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides is called a tetrahedron . the formula for the volume of a pyramid is : this means that one must find the volume by multiplying the base ( b ) by the height ( h ) , then dividing the product by three . the base is also known as the product of the length and the width , thus this formula could alternatively be written : either way works , but the technical formula for the volume of a pyramid is the former , due to its use of the capital b , which is shorthand for length and width as previously mentioned .
