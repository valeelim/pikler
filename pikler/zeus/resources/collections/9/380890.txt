Workhouse     the workhouse was a place which offered housing and work to people who did not have any . they began in england and wales during the 17th century . the first use of the word `` workhouse '' was in a report by the mayor of abingdon in 1631 on the building of a workhouse in the town . the beginnings of the workhouse got back to the poor law act of 1388. this was designed to help solve a shortage of workers after the black death . it made it difficult for them to move about the country , and stopped them from looking for higher paid work somewhere else . this led to the state being responsible for the welfare of the poor . after the napoleonic wars there was a lot of unemployment . there was also unemployment caused by machines taking over work from farm workers . in the 1830s there was also a series of bad harvests . these things put too much pressure on the existing ways of looking after poor people . new laws were passed , the new poor law of 1834 , to try to deal with the problem . people would only be given help if they went into the workhouse to live . some places hoped to make a profit from the workhouse by using the free labor of the people . most did not have skills to get normal jobs , so workhouse jobs included breaking rocks into small stones , breaking bones to make fertilizer , or pulling apart old rope to reuse the fibre . this old rope known as oakum , was used to pack joints in ship building to keep them watertight . a metal spike was used to unpick the rope , and the nickname for the workhouse was the spike .
