Activation energy     the activation energy of a chemical reaction is the minimum energy that is needed to make the reaction happen . it usually has the symbol e and it is measured in kilojoule per mole . it can be thought of as a barrier between the reagents and the products of a reaction . the activation energy is the difference in energy between the transition state and the starting reagents . this equation is a way of calculating the activation energy . its form is : here , `` k '' is the rate constant of the reaction ( which can be measured using chemical kinetics ) , `` a '' is a frequency factor , `` r '' is the universal gas constant , `` t '' is the temperature . if we measure how fast the reaction goes at different temperatures , then we can make a graph and calculate the activation energy using this equation . when using a catalyst the activation energy is made smaller . this means that the reaction can go faster at the same temperature . the catalyst does not change the energy of the reagents or the products . also , the catalyst does not change in the reaction . therefore , it can be used again and again and only a small amount of a catalyst is needed .
