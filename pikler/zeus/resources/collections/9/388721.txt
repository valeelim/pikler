Coefficient of friction     a coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects that are involved . it is a value that is sometimes used in physics to find an object 's normal force or frictional force when other methods are available . the coefficient of friction is shown by formula_1 . in that equation , formula_2 is the frictional force , formula_3 is the coefficient of friction , and formula_4 is the normal force . the coefficient formula_5 can be two different things . it is either the coefficient of static friction formula_6 , or the coefficient of kinetic friction formula_7.the coefficient of static friction is the friction force between two objects when neither of the objects is moving . the coefficient of kinetic friction is the force between two objects when one object is moving , or if two objects are moving against each other . the coefficient of friction is dimensionless , meaning it does not have any units . it is a scalar , meaning the direction of the force does not affect the physical quantity .
