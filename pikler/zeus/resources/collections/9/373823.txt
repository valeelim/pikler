Vibraslap     the vibraslap is a percussion instrument . it is a modern version of the jawbone . due to the fragile nature of the jawbone , the vibra-slap was created to provide a stronger alternative with a similar sound . it has been used mainly in popular music . several rock bands have used this sound for the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century . it is also popular in latin music . the vibraslap is made of a cowbell-shaped hollow box ( acting as a resonator ) and a wooden ball connected by a steel rod . the steel rod is bent in an `` l '' shape that allows the performer to hold the rod in one hand and strike the ball with the palm of their other hand . the steel rod acts as a sort of spring that vibrates the box on the other end . the box acts as a resonating body for a metal mechanism placed inside with a number of loosely fastened pins or rivets that vibrate and rattle against the box , much like the teeth of the jawbone . the vibraslap is produced in a number of sizes using different materials such as wood , metal or composite materials .
