Child-headed family     a child-headed family or child-headed household is a family in which a minor ( child or adolescent ) has become the head of the household . they are most common in developing countries and areas of war , where the children 's parents have been killed by conflict or disease . in some cases , relatives of the children adopt them after the parents die . situations where a child , usually the eldest , has to provide for the family happen when there are no adult relatives to take the children or the relatives can not afford to support more children . whether and how much the government helps the orphaned family depends on the country . most help comes from charity and aid organisations like unicef . child-headed families are most common in africa . the hiv/aids epidemic has led to many situations where both parents have died and left behind a family of orphans . the children may begin taking over their parent 's responsibilities before the last surviving parent has died , when the parent is sick or too weak to work . the eldest children often have to stop going to school and get a job instead in order to gain income for the family . a study by cornell university in 2005 showed that , in namibia , the average age of the children acting as parents in their families was 17 ; some were as young as 9 years old . the number of children heading households in sub-saharan africa is reported to be growing . a survey in south africa in 2006 showed that 122,000 ( 0.67 % ) of the country 's children were living in child-headed households .
