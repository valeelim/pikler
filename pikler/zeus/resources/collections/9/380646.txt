Inferno (operating system)    inferno ( operating system ) inferno is a distributed operating system made by bells labs and vita nuova holdings based on ideas and technology from plan 9 from bell labs . the three main principles behind inferno 's design are : - resources as files : all resources are represented as files within a hierarchical file system - namespaces : the application view of the network is a single , coherent namespace that appears as a hierarchical file system but may represent physically separated ( locally or remotely ) resources - standard communication protocol : a standard protocol 9p is used to access all resources , both local and remote as a distributed operating system ( i.e . an operating system working across and connecting multiple machines and devises together ) , inferno is also designed to be able to operated on a variety of computer architectures . it can also be operated on top of other operating systems , such as unix , microsoft windows , or google 's android operating system . in order to make inferno applications as portable to other computer architectures as the inferno operating system , inferno applications are written in a programing language called limbo and run inside inferno 's dis virtual machine .
