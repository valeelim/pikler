Steric effects     steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space . when atoms are put close to each other , this costs energy . the electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other . this can change the way molecules want to react . it can also change the shape ( or conformation ) of the molecule . the amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the `` steric bulk '' . an example of steric effects is steric hindrance . this is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work . for example , an s2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents . steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing . sometimes , chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one . a bulky group can block a position . it can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made . steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects . these affect the molecule 's shape and reactivity as well , but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds .
