Holism     holism is the idea that natural systems ( physical , biological , chemical , social , economic , mental , linguistic , etc . ) and their properties , should be viewed as wholes , not as collections of parts . this often includes the view that systems somehow function as wholes and that their functioning can not be fully understood solely in terms of their component parts . reductionism is often viewed as the opposite of holism . reductionism in science says that a complex system can be explained by `` reduction '' to its fundamental parts . for example , the processes of biology are reducible to chemistry and the laws of chemistry are explained by physics . social scientist and physician nicholas a. christakis explains that `` for the last few centuries , the cartesian project in science has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits , in the pursuit of understanding . and this works , to some extent ... but putting things back together in order to understand them is harder , and typically comes later in the development of a scientist or in the development of science '' .
