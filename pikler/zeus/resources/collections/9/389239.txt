Punched tape     punched tape is a medium for data storage . it is made of a long strip with holes in it . the holes are used to represent information . the principle is the same as that of a punched card , except that the length is variable . punched tape was widely used in the 1950s and 1960s , but was later replaced by other media . punched tape was first used to program looms , in the 18th century . similar looms are still used for waving tartans , but the punched tape is made of metal platelets today . another use of punched tape is in barrel organs . 20th century teleprinters also use punched tape . herman hollerith used punched tape for a census , in 1890. gilbert vernam , a telecommunication engineer developed the vernam cipher in 1917. this cipher could be used with punched tape . vernam combined a character of the punched tape , with one of a key , to give the encoded character . combining the ecoded character with the key again gives the plain text . this is in fact an exclusive disjunction , even though vernam used a different name . it was an automated one-time pad . the nsa has called this patent `` perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography .
