Hypostatic model of personality     the hypostatic model of personality is a way of viewing the many sides of a person 's character . the model says that a person can behave and appear to others in many ways , depending on how that person is , but also on how someone looks at that person . it says that people are not one-sided , but are a little bit of everything . for example , today someone can be mean , and tomorrow he can be good . how someone appears also depends on things and people around him or her . for example , sometimes the most coward person may become the greatest hero , if he is called to save someone 's life . all these `` sides '' of a person have to be known by scientists so they can change them for the better .
