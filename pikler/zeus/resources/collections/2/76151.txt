Metamorphic rock     a metamorphic rock is a type of rock which has been changed by extreme heat and pressure . its name is from 'morph ' ( meaning form ) , and 'meta ' ( meaning change ) . the original rock gets heated ( temperatures greater than 150 to 200 Â°c ) and pressured ( 1500 bars ) . this causes profound physical and/or chemical change . the original rock may be sedimentary rock , igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock . there is always more pressure and higher temperature under the earth 's surface . in the root of a mountain chain or a volcano these forces will be enough to change shape of the strata and the minerals it is made of . sedimentary rock which has been near such forces often looks as if a giant had twisted it and heated it over a fire . examples of metamorphic rock : - marble is a metamorphic rock formed from limestone . - slate is a metamorphic mudstone or shale . - quartzite is a metamorphic sandstone . the recrystallisation of minerals after heating generally causes the destruction of any fossils the rocks might have contained .
