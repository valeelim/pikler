Laserdisc     a laserdisc , like a dvd , can play video of a higher quality than vhs . a laserdisc is much larger than a dvd . to play laserdisc movies , a laserdisc player is needed . laserdisc was first produced by mca in 1978 , and became well known in the 1980s . movie companies stopped making laserdisc movies when dvds became well known in the late 1990s . today some of the better laserdisc players still sell for $ 1,000 usd or more . laser discs work like a regular cd-rom . the surface of the disc is covered with small holes that are read by a laser . this sequence of holes and no holes is turned into pictures and sound by the laserdisc player . most laserdiscs can hold about 30 minutes to an hour of video per side for a total of 1 to 2 hours per disc . the early laserdisc players used a helium-neon laser to read the disc , but the later models used infrared lasers . the first units that were made with the infrared laser had some problems such as skipping , strange colors spots , and fuzziness . these problems were fixed in later models .
