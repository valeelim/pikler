Intonation (music)    intonation ( music ) intonation , in music , can have two different meanings : 1. in plainchant , intonation is when a solo singer - usually the priest - sings the first phrase of a piece of music before the choir start to sing . the intonation is the tune on which the music is based . for example , when the choir sings a piece called `` gloria '' the priest first sings `` gloria in excelsis deo '' ( `` glory be to god '' ) by himself , unaccompanied . then the choir continue singing with the words `` et in terra pax ... '' ( `` and peace on earth ... ) . 1. the word `` intonation '' is used in music to describe whether someone who is playing a musical instrument is playing in tune . this is not used for instruments such as the piano which are tuned already , but for an instrument such as the violin there is a lot of skill and practice needed to play with good intonation ( to play well in tune ) . a violinist needs to put his or her fingers in exactly the right place on the fingerboard , otherwise the note will be sharp ( too high ) or flat ( too low ) . musicians playing in a group will need to listen to one another so that their tuning ( intonation ) is good . players of wind instruments and singers all need to pay careful attention to their intonation .
