'' when they want an encore . the word `` encore '' is the french word for `` again '' . an encore is usually a short piece . often it is a fast piece to finish the performance off happily , but if a musician has just played a very energetic , loud piece , then the encore might be a quiet piece . a concert given by a solo performer or small group of performers is more likely to finish with an encore than a concert with an orchestra , but a lot depends on the tradition from one country to another . although `` encore '' is a french word , in france the audience shout `` bis !
