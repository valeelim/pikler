Giant tube worm     giant tube worms are annelids . they live on the floor of the oceans ( mainly pacific ocean ) , usually near black smokers or hydrothermal vents ( which also means black smoker ) . they can tolerate extremely high temperatures and levels of sulfur . they live in symbiosis with certain bacteria . the bacteria enter the mouth of a young tube worm , but when the worm gets older its mouth and gut seal up , trapping the bacteria forever . these bacteria are fed with sulfur compounds and oxygen . the bacteria then turn these compounds into organic molecules on which the host worms feed .
