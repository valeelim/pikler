Occam's razor    occam 's razor occam 's razor ( or ockham 's razor ) is a principle from philosophy . suppose there exist two explanations for an occurrence . in this case the simpler one is usually better . another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make , the more unlikely an explanation is . occam 's razor applies especially in the philosophy of science , but also more generally . william of ockham , a franciscan friar who studied logic in the 14th century , first made this principle well known . in latin it is sometimes called lex parsimoniae , or `` the law of briefness '' . william of ockham supposedly ( see below ) wrote it in latin as : - `` entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem . '' this translates roughly as : - `` more things should not be used than are necessary . '' this means that if there are several possible ways that something might have happened , the way that uses the fewest guesses is probably the right one . however , occam 's razor only applies when the simple explanation and complex explanation both work equally well . if a more complex explanation does a better job than a simpler one , then you should use the complex one .
