Tuple     in mathematics , a tuple is a finite sequence of objects . sometimes the finite sequence is also called an `` ordered list '' . each of the objects in the list has a certain type . a tuple consisting of `` n '' entries is called an n-tuple . tuples are used to describe mathematical objects that are made of certain , well-defined components . they are also used very frequently with databases . tuples are different from sets : - a certain element can be in a tuple more than once . - the order in which the elements appear is important . in other words , tuples are like ordered multisets .
