M1 Garand     the m1 garand is a semi-automatic rifle that was mostly used by the us army during world war ii and the korean war . it has an internal eight-bullet box magazine , which is loaded with clips of 8 bullets . when the last round is shot , the empty clip is ejected , making a `` ping '' sound . a common misconception ( seen in video games such as call of duty ) is that the clip can only be removed by shooting all the bullets , but the clip may be removed at any time ( but it is hard to do ) . general george patton described it as the greatest battle implement ever designed . it was replaced by the m14 rifle in the late1950 's . other websites . - ww2db : m1 garand - m1 garand - encyc
