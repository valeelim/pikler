County borough     a county borough was a type of local government district in england until abolished in 1974. local government powers were divided between county councils and urban or rural districts . for example : rural districts may not be able to maintain footpaths or street lighting because of their size . urban districts were based in a town and were able handle these jobs . schools were the responsibility of county councils because districts were too small to run all types of schools themselves . a county borough was a town big enough to run all its own local government , so the local county council had no power inside the county borough .
