Ethnic cleansing     ethnic cleansing is a type of crime against humanity . in an ethnic cleansing , ethnic or religious groups are forced to leave an area by a more powerful ethnic group . the goal of an ethnic cleansing is to get rid of everyone who does not belong to the more powerful ethnic group . then the more powerful group can have the area they `` cleansed '' for themselves , and only members of their group will live there . in an ethnic cleansing , perpetrators may use different ways of getting rid of people . they may force people to move ; deport people ; threaten them until they leave ; and use rape and mass murder . usually , the perpetrators will also try to destroy any signs that the victims lived in the area they are `` cleansing . '' they may destroy homes , farms , infrastructure , monuments , cemeteries , and places of worship . the united nations defines ethnic cleansing this way : - it is done on purpose , as part of a plan - it is done by one ethnic or religious group - that group uses violence and terror to force other ethnic or religious groups to leave certain areas
