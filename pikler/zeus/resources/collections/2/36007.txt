Fugue     a fugue is a piece of music written for a certain number of parts ( voices ) . the word “ fugue “ comes from the italian “ fuga “ meaning “ flight “ . a fugue is based on one particular tune . this tune is called the subject . each part has an equal share in playing the subject . when we talk about the “ parts ” in a fugue we do not mean the “ sections ” of the piece but the number of voices needed to sing it or instruments to play it . a “ 3 part fugue ” means a fugue written for three voices or instruments . fugues can be in 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or even 6 parts . the more parts there are the harder it is to write a fugue because each part has to sound interesting by itself , but together they must also make sense . 3 , 4 and 5 part fugues are usual . a fugue always starts with just one part playing the subject . then the other parts come in one at a time until they are all playing . when the second part comes in it will always be half an octave higher or lower than the beginning ( musicians say : “ on the dominant ” , meaning that it starts on the 5th note of the scale instead of the “ tonic ” or 1st note ) . this called : the answer . the third part to come in will be the “ subject ” ( in the tonic once again ) and the fourth part will be another answer , etc .
