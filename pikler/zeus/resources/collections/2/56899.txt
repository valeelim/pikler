Razor     a razor is a tool with one or more blades used by men for shaving the hair from their face , and by women for shaving hair from their legs and underarms . the earliest razors known are from the bronze age . they were made of bronze and had an oval shape . there are different kinds of razors today , including straight razors , which are rarely used , and safety razors and electric razors . a slightly different type of electric razor is used to trim and cut hair from the head , because hair can be cut much more quickly with electric haircutting razors than with scissors . before the 20th century , straight razors were widely used . a straight razor consists of a knife blade , which can be reused . since this blade is usually very sharp , there is a high risk of cutting oneself with the razor while scraping off the hair . today , such razors are rarely used any more , except by barbers . in the late 18th century , french engineer jean-jacques perret invented the safety razor . with this system , the skin is protected , from all but the edge of the blade . this makes cutting much harder . the first such razor was released in 1875 by the campfe brothers . in 1901 , king camp gillette invented the first razor with disposable razor blades . the blades were thrown away after several uses . the number of times a disposable blade can be used depends on beard coarseness and shaving technique , but the average is about one week . the company , gilette still makes such razors today . they sell the razor relatively cheaply , and make big profits on the razor blades .
