Anton Webern     anton webern ( born vienna 3 december 1883 ; died mitterill 15 september 1945 ) was an austrian composer . webern and alban berg were the most famous pupils of arnold schoenberg , the composer who had invented the twelve tone system . this style of composition is often called the “ second viennese school ” . webern was probably schoenberg ’ s first pupil , and berg joined them a few weeks later . webern used the rules of the twelve tone system very strictly in his music . his compositions had a lot of influence on composers of the mid-20th century who were interested in serialism , especially karlheinz stockhausen and pierre boulez . most of webern ’ s compositions are very short . anton was born anton von webern . webern ’ s father was a mining engineer who later got an important government job . the family had belonged to the nobility which is why they had “ von ” before the family name . in 1918 a law was made in austria to stop people from using “ von ” as part of their name , and so from then onwards he was always known as “ anton webern ” . anton learned to play the cello and the piano . they had a country house where the family spent the summer , and the young boy spent a lot of time composing , especially songs to the poems of famous german poets such as stefan george and richard dehmel . together with his friend and cousin ernst he read the philosophical books of friedrich nietzsche , studied modern paintings and listened to the music of richard wagner . his father took him to the bayreuth festival .
