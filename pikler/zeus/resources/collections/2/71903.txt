Electrostatics     electrostatics ( also known as `` static electricity '' ) is the branch of physics that deals with apparently stationary electric charges . electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces . although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate , the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow . this is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive surface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects to be observed . these charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to the ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge : e.g. , the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock ' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with non-conductive surfaces . examples . - the attraction of plastic wrap to ones hand when one has removed it from a package .
