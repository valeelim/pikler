Home run     a home run is a term in baseball for when the batter hits the ball and touches all the bases without an error being made by the team on defense . the most common way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit the ball over the outfield fence in fair territory . if the ball goes over the outfield fence but it is ruled a `` foul ball '' , it does not count as a home run . another way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit what is called an `` inside-the-park '' home run . if the batter touches all four bases after he hits the ball and it stays on the field , he scores a home run . this is an inside-the-park home run as long as no error is committed by the fielding team on the play .
