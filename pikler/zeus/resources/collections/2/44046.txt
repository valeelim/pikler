Anurognathus     anurognathus was a genus of small rhamphorhynchoid pterosaurs which lived 150 million years ago , in the upper jurassic period . it had a short head with pin-like teeth for catching insects . it was found in the solnhofen limestone , the same place as `` archaeopteryx '' . they grew up to 35 cms wingspan . although it is in the long-tailed pterosaur group rhamphorhynchoidea , its tail was comparatively short . this was an adaptation which made it more manoeuvrable in hunting . according to d√∂derlein the reduced tail of `` anurognathus '' was similar to the pygostyle of modern birds . with an estimated wingspan of fifty centimetres ( 20 inches ) and a nine centimetre long body ( skull included ) , its weight was limited : forty grammes for a specimen with a 35 centimetre wingspan . later a second , smaller , specimen was found , probably of a subadult individual . its slab and counterslab are separated and both were sold to private collections . this second fossil is more complete and better articulated . it shows impressions of a large part of the flight membrane and under uv-light remains of the muscles of the thigh and arm become visible . it provided new information on many points of the anatomy . the skull was shown to have been very short and broad , wider than long .
