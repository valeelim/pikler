Ninja     a ninja is a kind of spy or assassin who lived in japan beginning in the 14th century . ninja ( or shinobi ) were a mystery in the history of japan . the correct japanese word for these warriors was shinobi-no-mono . ninja is easier to say ; this is why it is more widely used . ninja warriors created secret associations and participated in many political killings . their mystery comes from two ideas : 1 ) they always participated in secret spy operations and political killings ; 2 ) ninja were hired by heads of armies as paid warriors ( mercenaries ) . the art of fighting which was used by ninja was called ninjitsu , which was a combination of shinobi-no-jitsu and shinobi-jitsu . ninja were considered more than ordinary men who were able to fly and who possessed supernatural skills . ninja existed during the entire history of japan , but ninja only became specially trained people at the beginning of the 15th century . they mainly trained in the regions of iga and koga . ninja were involved in samurai wars and were hired by samurai for different missions , but at the same time samurai did not accept them as noble warriors because most of the ninja came from lower social levels . they were dangerous and could not be controlled . their methods of fighting did not fit the samurai code . the samurai code is a code of honor . for example , the samurai warrior would show his rank and would only fight a samurai of equal or higher rank . japanese land lords ( daimyo ) widely used the services of the iga and koga ninja in the period of 1485-1581. but in 1581 , one of the three daimyo who united japan â€“ oda nobunaga attacked ninja from iga province . the ninja remained alive and ran to the provinces kii and mikawa , where tokugawa ieyasu protected them . later , oda nobunaga was killed by a samurai named akechi mitsuhide , who later became an enemy to tokugawa ieyasu .
