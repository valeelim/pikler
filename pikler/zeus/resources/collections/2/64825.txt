Microtiter plate     a microtiter plate ( sometimes called a microplate ) is a flat plate with lots of `` wells '' used as small test tubes . a microtiter plate is used mostly in laboratories and pharmacies . a microtiter plate could have 6 , 24 , 96 , 384 or even sometimes 1536 wells arranged in rows . some microplates , used in the industry , have been built with 3456 or sometimes 9600 wells for maximum efficiency . each well of a microplate can only hold very small amounts of liquid . the first microplate was made in 1951 by a hungarian man called dr. g. takatsky , who made a microtiter plate with 6 rows of 12 wells ( so 72 wells ) . microtiter plates started being used in bulk in the late 1950s , a man called john liner from usa had made a different , but better version . by 1990 more than 15 companies were making microtiter plates . in 1996 , the society for biomolecular screening ( sbs ) wanted to make the microplate have standards to live up to . and so in 2003 , microplates had to have a certain diameter and depth .
