Wakizashi     the wakizashi is a traditional japanese sword . it is shorter than the katana , which was well known in the beginning of the 17th century as a `` kodachi '' sword . the two swords were always carried together : the wakizashi finished off the work of the katana sword . such a sword could be from 30cm to 60cm ( 12 to 24 inches ) long . a small version was called a `` ko-wakizashi '' , a longer one was called an `` o-wakizashi '' . a wakizashi had a slightly curved blade with a square-shaped hilt ( handle ) . the hilt and the scabbard ( the case in which the sword is kept ) of a wakizashi was richly decorated with traditional motifs . a wakizashi was more decorated than a katana because it was not used as much as a katana , but still carried everywhere . another distinctive feature is the scabbard ( called a `` saya '' ) . the sayas were made to be like the katana but they could have extra pockets for smaller knives , a hair arranger , etc . the katana and the wakizashi together are called a daishō , which is translated as `` large and small '' . the first part of the word ( `` dai '' ) means `` big '' and stands for the katana sword ; the second ( `` sho '' ) stands for wakizashi . wakizashi was more decorated than a katana and it was thinner , this is why it was designed to cut through softer targets . so it was a sword to make dangerous cuts in weak points of the human body . the use of a daishō on the battlefield gave its user a big advantage . with the two swords the samurai could keep the enemies within a radius of action ranging from 2 to 7 feet ( 1 to 3 1/2 meters ) . miyamoto musashi , a famous japanese samurai , was especially skilful at using the daishō .
