Staff (music)    staff ( music ) a staff ( or stave ) is the name given to the five horizontal lines on which we can write music . musical notes can be placed either on a line ( i.e . with a line going through the middle of the note head ) or in a space . there are four inside spaces as well as the two outer spaces at the top or bottom . the higher the pitch of the note the higher it will be on the staff . taking the white notes of a keyboard : each note ( a , b , c , d etc . ) is placed higher on the stave ( line , space , line , space etc. ) . a clef is needed to show which notes they are . there are different clefs to suit high , medium or low instruments . this musical example shows the opening of `` symphony no 5 '' by beethoven . the first three notes are on the second line ( counting from the bottom ) . they are gs , because there is a treble clef at the beginning of the staff . the fourth note is a little lower : on the bottom line , the e line ( because of the flats in the key signature it is an e flat ) . the next note is between the other two in pitch ( an f ) . after the three fs comes a d in the outside bottom space .
