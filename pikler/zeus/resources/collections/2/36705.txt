Constructed language     an artificial or constructed language ( sometimes called a conlang ) is a language that has been created by a person or small group , instead of being formed naturally as part of a culture . some constructed languages are designed for use in human communication ( like the common esperanto ) . others are created for use in fiction , linguistic experiments , secret codes , or simply because the maker likes to play language games . constructed languages can be split into a priori languages , which are made from scratch , and a posteriori languages , which borrow words and grammar from existing languages . constructed languages can also be split into groups by purpose . these groups are : - engineered languages ( `` engelangs '' ) , which are split into philosophical languages and logical languages ( loglangs ) - designed for experiments in logic or philosophy - auxiliary languages ( `` auxlangs '' ) - designed to be a lingua franca for international communication ( also called international auxiliary language , ( ial ) )
