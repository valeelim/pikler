Immortality     immortality or eternal life is the idea of something which is alive that will stay alive forever . the opposite of immortality is mortality , which means a living thing can die . right now , only a small number of living things are known to be immortal . these are mainly simple , lower forms of life like bacteria . stories about immortal people or animals are popular in fiction and mythology , but not yet actually possible . many religions say people have an immortal soul with an afterlife . some people have long used magic and science to look for a way to live forever . others feel that death is what defines all living things , and as a natural part of life , should not be taken away . insurance actuaries have calculated that even if everyone were physically immortal , the average life span would still be only be 400 years because of the `` accident rate '' ; eventually , everyone would die of a fatal accident and it would be very unusual to encounter anyone more than 800 years old . therefore , it would seem that the only practical way to achieve actual immortality is to upload one 's mind into a supercomputer to live in virtual reality . futurists such as ray kurzweil believe this will become possible about the year 2045 in the technological singularity .
