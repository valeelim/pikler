Water (molecule)    water ( molecule ) water ( ho , hoh ) covers 70-75 % of the earth 's surface in its liquid and solid ( ice ) states , and is present in the atmosphere as a vapor . it is the most abundant molecule on the earth 's surface . at room temperature , it is a nearly colorless , flavorless , and odorless liquid . many substances dissolve in water and it is commonly seen as `` the universal solvent '' ; because of this , water in nature and in use is rarely clean , and may have some properties different than those in the laboratory . but there are many compounds that are essentially , if not completely , insoluble in water . water is the only common , pure substance found naturally in all three states of matter—for other substances , see chemical properties . pure water is tasteless . it is the other chemicals in the water which may give water a flavour . generally , the volume of a liquid increases when heated , however the volume of water `` decreases '' when heated within the temperature range of 0°c to 4°c . its volume increases only when heated above 4°c . such behavior is one of a number of water 's anomalous properties .
