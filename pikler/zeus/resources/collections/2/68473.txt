Flag of Switzerland     switzerland ’ s national flag was adopted on december 12 , 1889 , which is one of the world ’ s oldest flags . the flag of switzerland is a red field , a white cross whose arms are one-sixth longer than their width . the relationship between the span of the cross and the width of the flag has not been established , but in practice the ratio is about 2:3 or 7:10. the swiss cross on a red field ultimately derives from a similar banner of the holy roman empire , and thus has strong christian connotations . the swiss flag traditionally stands for freedom , honour and fidelity . the motto `` honor et fidelitas '' was inscribed on the cross of several swiss mercenary flags of the 18th century . in modern times , through association with consistent swiss policy , the flag has also come to mean neutrality , democracy , peace and refuge .
