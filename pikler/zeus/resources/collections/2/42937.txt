Darmstadtium     darmstadtium is a chemical element . it has been named ununnilium ( uun ) or eka-platinum but is now named darmstadtium . it has the symbol ds . it has the atomic number 110. it is a transuranium element . darmstadtium is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature . it has to be made . the isotopes with an atomic mass from 267 to 273 have very short half-lifes . the half life of these isotopes is measured in milliseconds . isotopes of darmstadtium with an atomic mass of 279 and 281 were synthesised after the other isotopes . ds-279 and ds-281 decay more slowly . the isotope with an atomic mass of 279 has a half life of 180 milliseconds and ds-281 has a half life of 11.1 seconds . no uses for darmstadtium are known . what darmstadtium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight . darmstadtium was first made on november 9 , 1994. it was made at the gesellschaft f√ºr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) in darmstadt , germany . only a few atoms of it were made . it was made by bombarding a lead target with nickel . a nuclear fusion reaction happened and made the element .
