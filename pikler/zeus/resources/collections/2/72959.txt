Protein biosynthesis     protein biosynthesis ( synthesis ) is when cells build proteins . the term is sometimes used to refer only to protein translation but more often it refers to a multi-step process . amino acids are either synthesised or eaten in food . then , after the transcription of polypeptide genes , the amino acids are put together . this is done by translation and rna splicing which produces messenger rnas . the splicing process produces the final proteins , which then fold up into their protein structure . then they can function . the plural is used here because , with most genes , the splicing process produces more than one final working protein . one particular drosophila gene ( dscam ) can be alternatively spliced into 38,000 different mrna . protein biosynthesis differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes , though parts of the process are the same in both . other websites . - science aid : protein synthesis for high school - protein synthesis - transcription - translation - protein synthesis animation wesleyan university learning objects animation of protein synthesis .
