Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha     the duchy of saxe-coburg and gotha ( german sachsen-coburg und gotha ) was a `` dual monarchy '' in germany . this means that one ruler ruled over two countries , in this case the duchies of coburg and gotha . `` saxe '' means of saxony , because there were many small countries but all were ruled by members of the royal house of saxony . usually the royal house of saxony means the rulers of the kingdom of saxony . the house of wettin ruled the other states ( wettin is the family 's surname ) . the royal house of saxe-coburg and gotha was created in 1826. one dynasty of the house of wettin ( the dukes of saxe-gotha-altenburg ) became extinct because there were no more male children to inherit . the remaining members of the family divided their various lands between them . the duke of saxe-coburg-saalfeld gave up saalfeld and instead got the duchy of gotha . saalfeld became part of saxe-meiningen , which also took hildburghausen when the dule of saxe-hildburghausen became duke of saxe-altenburg .
