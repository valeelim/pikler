Cockatiel     cockatiels are small birds originally from australia and are related to many other cockatoos . they are the second most common bird species kept as a pet . cockatiels can live from 10 to 25 years , depending on how healthy their lifestyle is , although wild cockatiels usually live longer . cockatiels have tiny feathers on their head called a crest . the crest allows the owner to have an idea of what they are feeling ; straight up if scared or excited , flat when they 're angry , and slightly curved is normal/happy . in the wild , cockatiels are prey animals , meaning there are predators that eat them . as a result , cockatiels can scare easily , especially when they meet someone or something they do not know . with enough patience and affection , an owner can tame the cockatiel and help them get over their natural fear . like many other parrots , cockatiels are very good at climbing , and use their beak to position themselves each time . cockatiels come in many different colours , some naturally while others were specifically bred . gray is considered to be their original colour , and is one of the most popular , along with lutino ( yellow ) . males have a brighter crest and face , and sing louder and more frequently than females . a cockatiel has very long tail feathers compared to other birds .
