Khmer language     khmer is the official language of kampuchea/cambodia . its script was the base for the thai script , although thai does not use subscript consonants . one thing that makes it particularly difficult for many foreigners to learn is that khmer words are not separated in a sentence and the sounds are quite hard for foreigners to replicate . but still each word in the sentence can be distinguished . also , there is not much material on khmer , although this situation is changing . the khmer script is based on an ancient indian alphabet . it is written from left to right . there are 35 consonants , some of which are written under other consonants . vowels are combined with the consonants . the language has a subject-verb-object order . pronouns change based on who you are speaking to . ខ្ញុំមិនចង់បានទេ `` i do n't want it '' អ្នកចង់ទៅលេងសៀមរាបទេ `` do you want to go to siem reap ?
