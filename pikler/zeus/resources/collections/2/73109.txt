Angular frequency     in physics , angular frequency . Ï‰ . ( also called the angular speed , radial frequency , and radian frequency ) is a measure of rotation rate . a high rate of angular frequency means something is turning very fast . the angular frequency is the magnitude of the vector quantity `` angular velocity '' which is also known as the angular frequency vector formula_1 . it is useful in many areas of maths and science as it allows understanding of many properties of physical objects in our world . in si units , angular frequency is measured in radians per second , with dimensions t since radians are dimensionless . angular freqency is often given in radians per second ( formula_2 ) as it is easier to work with . in this way , the angular frequency is given by , where formula_4 is the time ( period ) of a single rotation ( revolution ) and formula_5 is the frequency . if a wheel turns by an angle formula_6 in a time formula_7 then the angular frequency at any moment is given by , if the rotation speed is constant , this becomes ,
