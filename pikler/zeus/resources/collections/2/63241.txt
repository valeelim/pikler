Physical law     a physical law , scientific law , or a law of nature is a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior . empirical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments over many years , and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community . the production of a summary description of nature in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science . laws of nature are distinct from the law , either religious or civil , and should not be confused with the concept of natural law . nor should 'physical law ' be confused with 'law of physics ' - the term 'physical law ' usually covers laws in other sciences ( e.g . biology ) as well . some extremely important laws are simply definitions . for example , the central law of mechanics `` f '' = `` dp '' / '' dt '' ( newton 's second `` law '' of mechanics ) is often treated as a mathematical definition of force . although the concept of force predates newton 's law , there was no mathematical definition of force before newton . the principle of least action ( or principle of stationary action ) , schroedinger equation , heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , causality and a few other laws also fall into this category ( of mathematical definitions ) .
