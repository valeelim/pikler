Bullet-proof vest     a bullet-proof vest ( also called `` bulletproof vest '' , `` body armor '' or `` body armour '' ) is a protective piece of clothing that covers the torso ( chest , abdomen , and back ) of a person . it protects the wearer from most pistol and revolver bullets and from fragments of explosive devices such as grenades . bullet-proof vests are worn by police officers , soldiers , security guards , and people who are at risk of being shot ( such as the leader of a country ) . bullet-proof vests contain many layers of tightly-woven fabric such as kevlar ( or hard , strong materials such as ceramic or titanium ) which can stop the metal pistol or revolver bullets or metal shell fragments from going into a person 's body . when a bullet hits a bullet-proof vest , the forceful impact of the bullet can seriously hurt the person wearing the vest even if the vest stops the bullet . a bullet from a strong sniper or machine gun can pierce a bullet-proof vest . if a bullet hits a body part that the bullet-proof vest does not cover , the bullet can hurt or kill the person wearing the vest .
