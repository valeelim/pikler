Osmosis     osmosis is the movement of water or other solvent through a plasma membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration . osmosis is passive transport , meaning it does not require energy to be applied . what causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of solutes on the two sides of the membrane . when osmosis happens , water moves from the side of the membrane with a lower amount of osmotic pressure to the side of the membrane with the higher amount . an important example of osmosis is the movement of liquid ( solvent ) molecules across a cell membrane into a cell with a higher solute concentration . osmosis is a fundamental part of cell biochemistry , but also has mechanical applications and usages . `` hypotonic '' describes the less concentrated solution . an `` isotonic '' solution is when the concentration is equal on both sides of the membrane . `` hypertonic '' describes the more concentrated solution . when there is a hypotonic solution outside the cell , and hypertonic solution inside , the cell gets swollen and distorted .
