Band (anthropology)    band ( anthropology ) in anthropology , bands are the tiniest societies , consisting typically of 5-80 people , most or all of them close relatives by birth or by marriage . in effect , a band is an extended family or several related extended families . today , autonomous bands are almost confined to the most remote parts of new guinea and amazonia , but there were many others that have only recently fallen under state control or been assimilated or exterminated . they include many or most african pygmies , southern african san hunter-gatherers ( so-called bushmen ) , aboriginal australians , eskimos ( inuit ) , and native americans of some resource-poor areas of the americas such as tierra del fuego and the northern boreal forests ; all these modern bands are or were nomadic hunter-gatherers rather than settled food producers . until at least 40,000 years ago , probably all humans lived in bands , and most still did as recently as 11,000 years ago . bands have no permanent single base of residence , instead land is used jointly by the whole group , as opposed to being partitioned among subgroups or individuals . there is no regular economic specialization , except by age and sex : all able-bodied individuals forage for food . there are no formal institutions , such as laws , police , and treaties , to resolve conflicts within and between bands . organization is often described as `` egalitarian '' in the sense that there is no formalized social stratification into upper and lower classes , no formalized or hereditary leadership , and no formalized monopolies of information and decision making . however , this definition of egalitarian should not be taken to mean that there is equality in prestige and the decision-making process among band members . instead `` leadership '' should be thought of as informal and acquired through qualities such as personality , strength , intelligence , and fighting skills .
