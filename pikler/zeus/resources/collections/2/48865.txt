Ventricular fibrillation     ventricular fibrillation ( often shortened to vf or v-fib ) is a type of `` arrhythmia '' of the heart . `` arrhythmia '' means the heart is not beating normally . when a person is in ventricular fibrillation , the heart does not beat in any kind of pattern . instead , it quivers and twitches very quickly . this problem is called `` ventricular '' fibrillation because it affects the ventricles of the heart . the ventricles are the biggest parts of the heart . their job is to pump blood ( which carries oxygen ) to the lungs and the rest of the body . when a person is in ventricular fibrillation , the ventricles can not do this job . this means that the lungs , brain , and other organs will not get enough blood or oxygen . ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency . without enough blood and oxygen , no part of the body can survive . if ventricular fibrillation continues for long enough , the blood will stop circulating around the body . the person 's breathing and heart will stop . the person will die unless they get treatment quickly .
