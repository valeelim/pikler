Prototheria     the prototheria is a subclass of mammals . the name comes from greek `` prōtos '' means 'first ' , and `` thēr '' , 'beast ' . the only surviving animals in this subclass are the monotremes . there are two other subclasses , the metatheria and the eutheria . metatheria contains the marsupials . all the other mammals are eutherian . evidence is accumulating that the prototheria is not a natural group , but alternative suggestions are not yet agreed .
