Proportional representation     proportional representation is a system used to elect a country 's government . if proportional representation is used in an election , a political party that wins 10 % of the vote , will win 10 % of the seats in parliament and a party that wins 20 % of the vote , will win 20 % of the seats . if a party wins over 50 % of the vote , it wins over 50 % of the seats and can form a government , however this does not happen very often because most countries have lots of different political parties . if no party wins over 50 % of the vote , then a coalition government usually has to be formed , where a government is formed from two or more different political parties , who together have over 50 % of the seats in parliament . countries which use proportional representation include : austria , argentina , belgium , brazil , bulgaria , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , greece , iceland , ireland , israel , netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , russia , south africa , south korea , spain , sweden , switzerland and turkey .
