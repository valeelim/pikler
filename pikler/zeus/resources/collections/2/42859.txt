Persephone     persephone was a greek goddess of grain and spring . also sometimes referred to as kore . a daughter of zeus and demeter . she was kidnapped by hades and he makes her eat a pomegranate , a fruit of the underworld . according to some myths , if one were to eat the fruit of the underworld , they would be forced to stay there . this myth explains why the seasons change . supposedly , demeter was so sad over the disappearance of her daughter that she ignored her duties to the world , during this time all plants died . when demeter went to the underworld to rescue her persephone , hades forced persephone to eat the pomegranate . after she ate this fruit it was supposed to keep her in the underworld with hades so she would be forced to marry him . in some versions she only ate 6 seeds from the pomegranate , so hades only made her stay 6 months of the year . it is during the 6 months that persephone is with hades that demeter weeps , causing all plant life to die ( symbolizing fall and winter ) , and during the six months that she is with demeter life is sustained ( spring and summer ) . she does not have a throne on olympus but her mother let her sit on her lap when persephone was a child . the only reason hades kidnapped her is because he saw her running in a field , and he thought she was beautiful .
