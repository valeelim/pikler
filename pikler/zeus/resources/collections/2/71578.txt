Natural selection     natural selection is a central concept of evolution . it was an idea of charles darwin and alfred russel wallace , and is sometimes called the `` survival of the fittest '' . darwin chose the name as an analogy with artificial selection ( selective breeding ) . natural selection is the process where organisms with favourable traits are more likely to reproduce . in doing so , they pass on these traits to the next generation . over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their environment . this is because the frequency of genes for favourable traits increases in the population . members of a species are not all alike , partly because of differences in heredity ( genetics ) . this is true even with children of the same parents . some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a particular habitat . when this organism reproduces , its children get the genes , which gave it the advantage . some adaptations are extremely long-lasting , useful in many habitats . the evolution of wings in birds is an example . others are good only as long as the environment stays the same . if the environment changes enough , then another organism might do better .
