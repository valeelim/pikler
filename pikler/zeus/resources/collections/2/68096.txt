Varaha     hindus believe that vishnu had many important avatars , and the varaha avatar was the third avatar of vishnu . in this avatar , vishnu took the form of a black varaha . varaha is a sanskrit language word that means a boar . the hindu scriptures tell a story about this avatar . there was a daitya ( a demon ) named hiranyaksha . he threw the earth ( called prithivi by the hindus ) into the waters of the ocean . the earth was about to sink in the ocean . at this point , vishnu took the form of a black boar . he entered the water and carried the earth on its body and brought the earth safely to where it should be . thus , vishnu as a varaha saved the earth from being destroyed .
