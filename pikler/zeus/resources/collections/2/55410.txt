Calvinism     calvinism belongs to the reformed tradition of protestantism . this tradition goes back to john calvin and other theologians . important calvinists from europe include : martin bucer , heinrich bullinger , peter martyr vermigli , and huldrych zwingli , and from england , reformers thomas cranmer and john jewel . because john calvin had great influence and played an important role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century , the tradition generally became known as calvinism . today , this term also means the doctrines and practices of the reformed churches , of which calvin was an early leader , and the system is perhaps best known for its doctrines of predestination and total depravity . john calvin 's international influence on the development of the doctrines of the protestant reformation began at the age of 25 , when he started work on his first edition of the `` institutes of the christian religion '' in 1534 ( published 1536 ) . together with his contributions to confessional documents for use in churches it founded the direct personal influence on protestantism of calvin . he is only one of many to influence the doctrines of the reformed churches , but he eventually became the most prominent .
