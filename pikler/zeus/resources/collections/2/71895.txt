Genetic drift     genetic drift is a random effect on biological populations . its effect is to remove genetic variation from a population of living organisms . in natural populations there are a number of forces acting . there are forces which add heritable variation to the population , such as mutation and recombination . there are also factors which remove variation from the population , and drift is one of these . in a species , or an interbreeding population , there is usually a great deal of genetic variation . this genetic variation is in the form of different alleles at many loci ( gene positions ) on the chromosomes . changes in allele frequency are mainly caused by natural selection , that is , by differential survival , and contribution to the next generation . but as populations get smaller , there is a tendency for each generation to become more homozygous , with less variety of alleles . this is an effect similar to inbreeding : it leads to genetic uniformity . genetic drift is the name given to this loss of variation . it can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways , but `` only when populations are quite small '' . what 'small ' means would depend on the organism . 50 individuals is small , 5000 is not , 500 is maybe . the basic mechanism of drift is that genetic variety is reduced by chance , making the individuals more similar to each other , and hence more vulnerable .
