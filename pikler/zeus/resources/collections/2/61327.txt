Thought     thought is the operation of the brain in conscious activity . it may or may not be goal-directed , aimed at solving specific problems . it is not the only way brains operate . behaviour may occur as a result of instinct , and the adaptive unconscious may solve problems without a person being aware . other animals can use their brains to solve problems , but there is no way of telling whether they do so consciously . thought is investigated by four or five academic disciplines , each in its own way . the disciplines include psychology , philosophy , biology , physiology , psychoanalysis and sociology . philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind , mental events , functions , properties , and consciousness . the mind-body problem , i.e . the relationship of the mind to the body , especially the brain , is a central issue in philosophy of mind . the mind-body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds , or mental processes , and bodily states or processes . the main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes , and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body .
