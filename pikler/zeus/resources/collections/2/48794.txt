Chief executive officer     a chief executive officer ( ceo ) , or chief executive , is the most important corporate officer , administrator , corporate administrator , executive , or executive officer , in charge of total management of a corporation , company , organization or agency . in closely held corporations , it is general business culture that the office of chief executive officer , ceo , is also the chairman of the board . specifically , one person often shares the chairman and ceo titles while another person takes the presidency or may become chief operating officer ( coo ) . however , the term president is from the u.s. and in the uk coo is favored . underneath that comes the executive vice president ( u.s. ) or executive director ( uk ) . in publicly held corporations , the ceo and chairman positions can be separated but there are implications in corporate governance by doing so . in some european union countries , there are two separate boards , one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes ( elected by the shareholders ) . in these countries , the chief executive officer presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people . this ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board . this allows for clear lines of authority . the aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person . there is a strong parallel here with the structure of governments , which tend to separate the political cabinet from the management civil service .
