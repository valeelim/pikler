Schlenkerla     schlenkerla is a famous old brewery and tavern in bamberg , bavaria , germany . it is known for its smoked beer which is called `` aecht schlenkerla rauchbier '' ( `` real schlenkerla smoked beer '' ) . it is a strong , darkish beer with a slightly smokey taste which is rather like bacon . the alcohol content is 5.1 % . there is another speciality which is called `` urbock '' ( `` ur '' means `` original '' and `` bock '' is actually a male goat ) . the urbock is stronger : 6.5 % alcohol and is only served in the season known as the `` starkbierzeit '' ( `` strong beer time '' ) which is from october to 6 january . the beer is served from oak barrels . this is a very old tradition which is not often found nowadays . it is said that the invention of smoked beer came about because one day the brewery caught fire and , after the fire was put out , the beer had a smokey taste . people liked it and decided to make it like that . no one knows whether this story is true . the name schlenkerla comes from the word `` schlenken '' which means : `` to dangle '' ( `` to hang loosely '' , or `` swing '' ) . several hundred years ago the owner of the tavern was a man who had been run over by a horse cart . he walked with crooked legs and he used to hang his arms out as he walked . people called him the `` schlenkerla '' ( the ending `` la '' on a word often happens in the netherlands , belgium , western germany , and northern france ) . they would often say : `` let 's go to the schlenkerla '' and so the tavern and the beer got its name . the image of this man can still be seen hanging over the entrance to the tavern .
