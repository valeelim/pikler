Time signature     a time signature is a set of two numbers , one on top of the other one , written right after the key signature in a piece of music . the two numbers in a time signature tell you how many of one kind of note there are in each measure in the song . for example , formula_1 means that there are four quarter notes , or notes that last one beat , in each measure . the number in the top of the time signature tells a player how many of a certain kind of note there are in each measure . the number in the bottom of the time signature tells what kind of note is used a certain number of times in each measure . the number on the bottom of the time signature can be any exponent of 2. so , 64 could be a number that is put in the bottom of the time signature , but 65 could not be one . this table shows different numbers that could be the bottom of a time signature , and what they mean . note that each note down lasts for one-half of the amount the note above it lasted . for example , one quarter note lasts one beat , and one-half note lasts one half of a beat , because one divided by two is one-half .
