Illegal drugs     illegal drugs are drugs which have limitations on their ownership or use by a government , and are illegal in certain situations ( meaning a person is not allowed to have them ) . a drug is any chemical that affects the human body or mind when it is swallowed , breathed in , or consumed in another way . a `` psychoactive '' drug is a drug that affects the brain . some controlled drugs are allowed if you have permission ( called a `` prescription '' ) from doctor . other drugs are illegalâ€”meaning you are never allowed to have them . individual countries and places have different laws about different drugs , and there are also international treaties against some drugs . the most used drugs are not illegal for example cigarettes . there are many categories ( types ) of psychoactive drugs . these categories have subcategories ( categories within categories ) . for example , benzodiazepines and opiates are both subcategories of depressants . some drugs such as ketamine have elements of two categories ( hallucinogens and depressants ) . every drug is different , so it is important to know the effects of each individual drug , not just the general group .
