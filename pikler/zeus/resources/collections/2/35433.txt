Biological weapon     a biological weapon is a weapon that delivers toxins or pathogens ( like bacteria or viruses ) , with the goal of making people sick or killing them . biological weapons are also called bio-weapons . their use in war is called biological warfare . a biological weapon usually has two parts . the first is the biological agent ( also called a bio-agent , biological threat agent , or biological warfare agent ) . this is the pathogen that is meant to make people sick . the second is the delivery system - how the biological agent is going to get to and expose the people it is supposed to infect . some bio-agents can be `` weaponized '' - changed to make them more dangerous . for example , sometimes scientists can change a pathogen 's genes so the pathogen is deadlier , and so it will not be killed by usual antidotes or treatments . some bio-agents can be changed so they are easier to store , spread , or use as weapons . as of 2016 , there are more than 1,200 different kinds of bio-agents that could be made into weapons .
