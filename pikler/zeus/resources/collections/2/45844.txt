Cell division     cell division is the process by which a cell , called the parent cell , divides into two cells , called daughter cells . when the cell divides , everything inside it divides also . the nucleus and the chromosomes divide , and the mitochondria divide also . in mitosis , an ordinary body ( somatic ) cell divides to make two daughter cells . in meiosis , a cell divides twice , to produce four gametes ( sex cells ) . the first division of meiosis is a special kind of cell division called a reduction division because the number of chromosomes is halved . the second division of meiosis is similar to mitosis . cells are the 'building blocks ' of life , and cell division is a basic feature of life . for simple unicellular organisms like amoebozoa , one cell division reproduces the entire organism . on a larger scale , cell division can create offspring from multicellular organisms , such as plants that grow from cuttings . but most importantly , cell division enables organisms that are able to sexually reproduce to develop from the one-celled fertilised egg ( zygote ) . cell division also allows for continual renewal and repair of the organism .
