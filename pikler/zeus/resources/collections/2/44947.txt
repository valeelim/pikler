Longitudinal wave     a longitudinal wave is a wave in which the particle movement is parallel to the direction of the wave propagation . this means that the particles move left and right which in turn makes the other particles start to oscillate . this creates a wave . longitudinal waves are also called pressure waves , and sound waves are the most common kinds . as with other waves , the particles do not move with the wave .
