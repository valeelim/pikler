Modes of limited transposition     modes of limited transposition are a kind of musical scale . they were used by the french composer olivier messiaen . major scales have twelve different transpositions . this means that a major scale can start on any of the twelve notes ( c , c # , d , d # etc. ) . there are also twelve different transpositions of the minor scale . each transposition ( “ each scale ” ) is a different combination of notes ( in this case : all of them ) . a chromatic scale ( one which uses every note , i.e . using all white and black notes of a keyboard ) only has one transposition . this means that a chromatic scale can start on any note : each time it is the same combination of notes . messiaen was fascinated by scales that only had a few ( usually two or three ) transpositions . for example : the whole tone scale , which rises by a whole tone each time , has two transpositions . it can start , for example , on a c , so that the notes are c , d , e , f # , g # , a # , c. it can start on a c # so that the notes are c # , d # , f , g , a , b , c # . transposing this up another semitone , starting on d , would give d , e , f # , g # , a # , c , d which is exactly the same combination of notes as the first one ( the starting note is not important ) . the whole-tone scale was used by many composers including glinka , liszt and , especially , debussy . messiaen called it the `` first mode '' of transposition .
