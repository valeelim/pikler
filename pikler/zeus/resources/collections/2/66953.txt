Essay     an essay is a written text . it is usually about the personal point of view of the author who wrote it . the definition of an essay is vague . articles and short stories can be quite similar . almost all modern essays are written in prose , but works in verse have been called essays ( e.g . alexander pope 's `` an essay on criticism '' and `` an essay on man '' ) . people that write essays are called essayists . most essays are short . this does not have to be the case . john locke 's `` an essay concerning human understanding '' and thomas malthus 's `` an essay on the principle of population '' are long essays . essays can have all sorts of purposes . for example , an essay can be very argumentative , it can talk about points for and against the essay question to give a balanced argument or opinion .
