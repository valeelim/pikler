Concert hall     a concert hall is a place where concerts of classical music take place . “ concert hall ” can either mean the actual room where the concerts takes place , or the whole building . the hall where the concerts are held may have a “ stage ” ( where the performers are ) and there will be an “ auditorium ” where the audience sits . some concert halls are purpose-built . that means they were built to be concert halls . other concert halls may have been something else many years ago , e.g . a corn exchange ( a place where farmers used to sell their corn ) and the building has later been changed into a concert hall . purpose-built concert halls started about the beginning of the 20th century . at that time scientists began to understand the importance of good acoustics ( somewhere where the sound was good ) . concert halls that are purpose-built usually have fixed seating ( seats that can not be moved ) . some halls may have seats that can be moved , either by stacking them in small piles , or tiered seating that can fold up . this allows the hall to be used for other things , e.g . dancing .
