Corpus cavernosum penis     the corpus cavernosum penis ( or corpus cavernosum urethrae ) is one of two sponge-like sections of tissue in the male penis . they contain most of the blood during an erection . the term literally means `` cave-like body '' the corpus cavernosum are placed along the length of the penis . they are found along the penis shaft , from the pubic bones to the head of the penis . the spongy tissue fills with blood . the blood comes from arteries down the length of the penis . the blood fills the corpora cavernosa . this causes it to swell . when swollen , it holds 90 % of the blood involved in an erection . this increases both the length and circumference of the penis . blood can leave only through a system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus cavernosum . the expanding tissue constricts these veins . this preventing blood from leaving . the penis becomes rigid as a result .
