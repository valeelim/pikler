Tachi     the tachi is a japanese sword , which has a strongly curved blade and is longer than a katana . it was used on the battlefield before katana was , so it is considered to be older . the word tachi translates as `` the soul of bushi '' ( soul of samurai ) . when the katana began to be widely used the tachi sword became a court sword for ceremonies . it looks very richly decorated with traditional cord wrappings and a specially designed handle . the length of a tachi blade was around 30.70 inches ( about 75cm ) because of its length the tachi was a cavalry sword and was mainly worn by horsemen . the strongly curved blade also made it easy to make slicing blows . even if the tachi is a very long sword it is light enough to be handled with one hand . the tachi had a long enough hilt to hold it with two hands . it was especially useful for warriors who were not riding . the tachi was worn hung to the belt with the cutting-edge down , unlike the katana which was worn with the cutting-edge pointing upwards . not all tachi were the standard size . small ones were called ko-dachi . if the sword was longer than the standard one it was called o-dachi .
