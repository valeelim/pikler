Banknote     a banknote ( more commonly known as a bill in the united states and canada ) is a paper by which a bank promises to pay to the bearer on demand . together with coins , banknotes make up the cash forms of all modern money . coins are generally used for lower valued monetary units , and banknotes for higher values . originally , the value of money was determined by the value of the material the money was made of , such as silver or gold . however , carrying around a lot of precious metal was cumbersome and often dangerous . as an alternative , banknotes would be issued . in financial terms , a note is a promise to pay someone money . banknotes were originally a promise to give an amount of precious metal to anyone who presented the paper . people could pay for things by giving the banknote , and thus the stored value ( usually in gold or silver coins kept in the bank 's vault ) that the banknote promised . in europe the first paper money consisted of paper 'coins ' issued in protestant leyden ( today , leiden ) in the netherlands during the spanish siege of 1574. over 5000 of the estimated 14,000 residents of leyden died , mostly due to starvation . even leather ( often used to create emergency currency ) was boiled and used to feed the people . so to create currency , the residents took covers and paper from hymnals and church missives and created paper planchets , which were struck using the same dies that were previously used to mint coins .
