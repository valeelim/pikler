Cremation     cremation is the act of burning a body after it has died . cremation is a popular option to dispose of ( get rid of ) a body instead of burying it . the place where cremations take place is called a crematorium or crematory . religions which approve cremation include christianity , jehovah 's witnesses , buddhism , hinduism , jainism , sikhism , shinto and neopaganism . judaism and mormonism strongly discourage cremation . islam , neo-confucianism and zoroastrianism disapprove it . cremated remains ( also called `` ashes '' ) are returned to the person 's family . the family then has a few options of what to do with the remains . usually the ashes are buried in an urn at a cemetery plot just as a coffin is buried in normal earth burial . many religions require the ashes to be handled in dignified manner . in scandinavia it is customary to bury the ashes Ã­n an urn in a family grave ( a grave which contains the remains of many family members ) . family graves are also popular in japan and thailand . sometimes the cremated person has thought about what they want to be done with their remains and have shared their desires with their family . cremated remains can be kept in a container called an urn , which in turn can be buried on cemetery plot or placed in a depot called `` columbarium '' , or thrown into the air or water of a place that was special to the cremated person , or buried anonymously in the ground . these are the most popular choices of what to do with remains . there are also other , less common , options of how to dispose of the remains . some examples of ways to scatter the remains are : through fireworks , shot from guns , or dropped from an airplane or hot air balloon . remains can even be sent into space or turned into a diamond . the latter can be done because humans and diamonds are both made largely from carbon .
