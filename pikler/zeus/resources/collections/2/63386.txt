Christian theology     christian theology is reasoned commentary concerning christianity . christian theologians use rational analysis and argument to understand , explain , test , critique , defend or promote christianity . christian theology starts with the new testament . saint paul , in his letters , and in his speeches in acts of the apostles , draws upon his training as a rabbi and on his experience of christ starting outside damascus to explain to jews and gentiles alike the meaning of the crucifixion and resurrection of jesus . throughout the history of christianity later writers such as luther and john calvin have stressed the bible as the cornerstone of theological understanding , although the biblical canon itself is not without controversy . catholic and orthodox theologians have also stressed the importance of church tradition for the faith . thomas aquinas and saint augustine are among the most important writers within the roman catholic church . differences in theology have led to the many denominations within christianity , starting with the separation of jesus ' followers from judaism , and then particularly in the great schism and during the reformation . after luther 's quarrel with the pope , reformed churches like the lutherans and baptists are established . calvinism is very important within protestantism , although the followers of jacob arminius do not accept it . attempts at compromise in england between the catholics and puritans lead to the establishment of the church of england .
