Median     in probability theory and statistics , the median is a number . this number has the property that it divides a set of observed values in two equal halves , so that half of the values are below it , and half are above . if there are a finite number of elements , the median is easy to find . the values need to be arranged in a list , lowest to highest . if there is an odd number of values , the median is the one at position formula_1 . for example , if there are 13 values , they can be arranged into two groups of 6 , with the median in between , at position 7. with an even number of values , as there is no single number which divides all of the numbers to two halves , the median is defined as the mean of the two central elements . with 14 observations , this would be the mean of elements 7 and 8 , which is their sum divided by 2. alternatively , the median of an even-sized list is sometimes defined as either of the two middle elements ; the choice being either ( a ) always the smallest one , ( b ) always the largest one , or ( c ) randomly choose between the two . this alternative definition has two important advantages : it guarantees that the median is always a list element ( e.g. , a list of integers will never have a fractional median ) , and it guarantees that the median exists for any ordinal-valued data . on the other hand , when one of the choices ( a ) or ( b ) is taken , the median of a sample will be biased , which is an unwanted property of a statistical estimator . definition ( c ) does not have that disadvantage , but it is more difficult to do . it also has the disadvantage that the same list of values does not have a well-defined , deterministic median .
