Traditional Chinese characters     traditional chinese characters is one of the two commonly used forms of chinese characters . as its name shows , it is the `` traditional '' written form of the chinese language that first came about during the han dynasty ( shortly after the qin dynasty ) in 206 bc . the name `` traditional '' is used to set them apart from simplified chinese characters . court officials in the han dynasty believed that xiaozhuang characters , which were standardized under emperor qin shi huangdi with the unification of china , were hard and took too much time to write , since chinese characters at the time were written using curved lines instead of more angular lines . so han officials decided to simplify writing chinese characters by using multiple strokes , or lines , to form characters and radicals , rather than long curved lines . the changed xiaozhuang characters are now commonly known as hanzi ( simplified chinese : 汉字 / traditional chinese : 漢字 , meaning `` han characters '' ) , because they were from the han dynasty . they became the standard writing system of chinese and were also used ( with some differences ) in japanese , korean , and vietnamese , although only japanese still uses them in daily life to this day .
