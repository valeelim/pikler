Keratin     keratins are a family of fibrous proteins . keratin is what makes up hair in animals , as well as horns , nails , hooves , shells , beaks , and feathers . the name comes from greek word `` keras '' meaning `` horn '' . keratins are tough and insoluble . they form the hard but non-mineral structures in reptiles , birds , amphibians and mammals . a similar biological toughness is found in chitin . keratins are the main constituent of structures that grow from the skin : - the `` α-keratins '' in the hair ( including wool ) , horns , nails , claws and hooves of mammals - the harder `` β-keratins '' in the scales and claws of reptiles , their shells ( chelonia , such as tortoise , turtle , terrapin ) , and in the feathers , beaks , and claws of birds . these keratins are formed mainly in beta sheets . however , beta sheets are also found in α-keratins . arthropods such as crustaceans often have parts of their exoskeleton made of keratin , sometimes in combination with chitin . keratins are also found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals , including roundworms ( who also have an outer layer made of keratin ) .
