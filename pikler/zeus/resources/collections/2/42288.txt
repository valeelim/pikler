Geiger counter     a geiger counter ( sometimes called geiger-müller counter ) is an instrument that measures ionizing radiation such as alpha particles , beta particles , or gamma rays . it is best known as a hand held radiation survey instrument , but it can also be used as a bench instrument or permanently installed . the original operating principle was discovered in 1908 and since the subsequent development of the geiger-müller tube in 1928 the counter has been a very popular instrument due to its robust sensing detector and element and relatively low cost . the radiation sensor is a geiger-müller tube which gives out an electronic signal when radiation is present . the readout is counts or radiation dose . the counts display is commonly `` counts per second '' . radiation dose rate is displayed in a unit such as the sievert . the readout can be analogue or digital , and modern instruments have communications with a computer or network . there is usually an option to produce audible representing the radiation intensity . this allows the user to concentrate on manipulation of the instrument without looking at the display .
