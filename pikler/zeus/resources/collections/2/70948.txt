Tour de Pologne     the tour de pologne ( english : `` tour of poland '' ) is a road bicycle racing stage race . it consists of seven or eight stages , and was first held in 1928. until 1952 , the race was not held every year , but since then there has been a tour `` annually '' ( every year ) . when eastern europe was communist-controlled there were no professional cyclists , so until the early 1990s , the race was for amateurs only , and the winners mostly came from poland . although the tour de pologne had not reached a high status , and was little known , the international cycling union ( uci ) decided to make it a part of the uci protour from 2005 , which means that the major cycling teams compete in the race . other websites . - official website
