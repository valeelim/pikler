Oxide     an oxide is a chemical compound containing an oxygen atom and other elements . most of the earth 's crust consists of oxides . oxides can be made when elements are oxidized by air ( when oxygen in the air react with the element ) . some common oxides are : - water ( hydrogen oxide ) ( ho ) - iron ( iii ) oxide ( rust ) ( feo ) - aluminium oxide ( alo ) - lead ( ii ) oxide ( pbo ) - calcium oxide ( cao ) - carbon dioxide ( co ) - carbon monoxide ( co ) - magnesium oxide ( magnesia ) ( mgo ) - phosphorus pentoxide ( po ) - sulfur dioxide ( so ) - sulfur trioxide ( so ) - silicon dioxide ( sio ) - nitrous oxide ( laughing gas ) ( no ) - zinc oxide ( zno ) - copper ( i ) oxide ( cuo ) and copper ( ii ) oxide ( cuo )
