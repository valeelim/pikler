Spinet     a spinet is a small kind of harpsichord . in renaissance and baroque times , and even later , people often had a spinet in their homes . the advantage of a spinet was that it was cheaper than a harpsichord and it also took up less room . sometimes the word used to be spelt differently , e.g . `` spinnet '' or `` spinnit '' . the spinet is different from a harpsichord because of the angle of the strings which run at an angle to the right . the whole instrument is a bit like a triangle in shape . the strings are arranged in pairs and the jacks ( the quills which pluck the strings ) are also in pairs in the wider gaps , plucking the string next to them . harpsichords may have several sounds ( in the same way that an organ has several stops making different sounds . this is not possible on a spinet , which has one sound only . it is always an 8 foot sound ( the notes sound at the normal pitch , never an octave higher ) . spinets were useful for accompanying .
