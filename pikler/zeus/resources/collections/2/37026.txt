Hypertension     hypertension or high blood pressure , is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is higher than it should be . this requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels . the pressure in the arteries changes depending on what the heart is doing . when the heart squeezes , pumping blood into the arteries , the pressure increases . when the heart relaxes , the pressure decreases . when blood pressure is measured , the highest pressure ( when the heart is squeezing ) is called the systolic blood pressure . the lowest pressure ( when the heart is relaxing ) is called the diastolic blood pressure . blood pressure is written as two numbers . for example , in the picture at the right , the person 's systolic blood pressure was 158. their diastolic blood pressure was 99. this blood pressure is written as 158/99 . it is said `` 158 over 99 . '' there are two types of hypertension , called “ primary ” and “ secondary. ” primary hypertension means that the hypertension is not caused by any other disease . secondary hypertension means that the hypertension is caused by another disease . in most cases ( 90-95 % ) , hypertension is primary . only a small amount of hypertension ( 5-10 % ) is secondary .
