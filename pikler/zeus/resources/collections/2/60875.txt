Earth's mantle    earth 's mantle earth 's mantle is the 1,800 mile ( 2,900 km ) thick shell making up about 84 % of earth 's volume . it is over the earth 's iron-rich core , which takes up about 15 % of earth 's volume . past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface , where we live . the gases evolved during the melting of earth 's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of earth 's atmosphere . a thin crust , the lower part of the lithosphere , surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75 km thick . there are two main zones in the upper mantle . the uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere , an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200 km , of which the uppermost mantle is 120 to 50 km thick . below the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic . it is called the asthenosphere , and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity , about 200 km thick .
