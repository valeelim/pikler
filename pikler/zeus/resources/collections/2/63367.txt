Odonata     the odonata are an order of flying insects , the dragonflies and damselflies . like most of the flying insects ( flies , beetles , lepidoptera and hymenoptera ) , they evolved in the early mesozoic era . their prototypes , the giant dragonflies of the carboniferous are no longer put in the odonata . they are now called protodonata or meganisoptera . the two suborders are easily distinguished by their eyes : - dragonflies : they are anisoptera ( = eyes together & wings up or out at rest ) - damselflies : they are zygoptera ( = eyes apart & wings along body at rest ) all odonata have aquatic larvae called 'nymphs ' , and all of them , larvae and adults , are carnivorous . the adults can land , but not walk . their legs are specialised for catching prey . these insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by big compound eyes , legs that catch prey ( other insects ) in flight , two pairs of long , transparent wings that move independently , and long abdomens . they have two ocelli ( eye spots ) and short antennae . the mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult .
