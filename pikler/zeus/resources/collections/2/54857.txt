Nuclear reaction     a nuclear reaction is a process involving an atomic nucleus or more than one nucleus . the most common kinds are 1. nuclear fusion , a reaction in which two or more particles collide . the results are new particles which are different from the first ones . 1. nuclear fission , a nucleus breaking into pieces . 1. radioactive decay , in which a nucleus spits something out , changing itself into a different kind of nucleus . in the case of radioactivity the reaction is . fission and fusion can be done on purpose , to release energy . this energy can then be used for different things , for example to make steam ( as in a nuclear power plant ) . it can also be used as energy for a bomb . in the example figure li fuses with deuterium . this makes beryllium which then decays into two alpha particles . nuclear reactions occur in the sun , in nuclear reactors , in particle accelerators , and in outer space . other than radioactive decay , very few nuclear reactions occur on earth except in these special places . nuclear reactors use nuclear reactions to make heat and electricity . accelerators sometimes cause nuclear reactions to make radioactive materials . particles from outer space cause nuclear reactions in earth 's atmosphere that make air slightly radioactive .
