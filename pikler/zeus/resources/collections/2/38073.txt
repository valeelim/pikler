Covalent bond     covalent bonds are chemical bonds between two non-metal atoms . an example is water , where hydrogen ( h ) and oxygen ( o ) bond together to make ( ho ) . as they are both non-metals—which need to gain electrons—they have to share , so their outer shells cross over in order to have a full outer shell . a full outer shell has eight electrons . the electrons in this outer shell are called valence electrons . the number of valence electrons is decided by the size of the atom . electrons orbit an atomic nucleus in the same kind of way that planets orbit stars . there are layers of paths around an atomic nucleus . the first layer always contains only two electrons , while the layers after that usually contain up to eight . for example , if an atom contained eight total electrons , the first two would orbit very close to the nucleus , the next 6 would orbit a little farther away . every atom wants a `` full '' outer shell . that is to say , it wants the number of electrons in the outer-most layer to be as high as they can be . since most atoms ' outer shells can support up to eight electrons , this is the number of electrons most atoms want in their outer shell . in this example , the atom had eight total electrons , and six in the outer shell . since there are fewer than eight electrons in the outer shell , the atom will want to `` fill '' the places for two electrons with electrons borrowed from another atom . when an atom `` borrows '' electrons with another atom , a covalent bond is formed .
