Dubrovnik     dubrovnik is a city in croatia on the dalmatian coast . more than 500 years ago it was called `` ragusa '' . the italian name of the city is still `` ragusa '' ; this sometimes leads to confusion because there is already a city named ragusa on sicily . it is on the adriatic sea . about 50,000 people lived there in 2001. because of its age and unique buildings , the old city of dubrovnik has been declared a unesco world heritage site . the old city of `` ragusa '' was started by greeks who left illirya after their home was invaded in the sixth century . they had been part of the holy roman empire . ragusa in dalmatia grew to be an important country on the sea , called the `` republic of ragusa '' . this republic lasted until napoleonic times . ragusa was once the only city in dalmatia with roman influence not to be controlled by the republic of venice . after the middle ages more and more croats and serbs from inland areas of bosnia-herzegovina moved to the area . they had started the neighbouring town of dubrovnik , which eventually joined ragusa . the original population ( the dalmatian italians ) was reduced to the few people of the ruling class : in the 19th century nearly all the people living in ragusa were slavs ( croats and serbs ) . ragusa officially changed its name to `` dubrovnik '' ( a croatian name ) after 1918 , when the city became part of the newly-created country of yugoslavia .
