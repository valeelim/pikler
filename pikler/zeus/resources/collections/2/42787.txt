Francium     francium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol fr and an atomic number of 87. it is a metal . in chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the alkali metals . francium is very radioactive . it is in very small amounts in uranium and thorium ores . it has the lowest electronegativity and electron affinity of all the chemical elements . francium reacts violently with water , as do all of the elements in group 1 on the periodic table . francium is one of the hardest to find elements on the planet earth . it is estimated that there are only about 15 grams or half an ounce in the earth 's crust at a single time . although chemists knew the element number 87 in the periodic table should exist , it was a long time before it was discovered . in the early 1900s , nearly all boxes on the periodic table had been filled . chemists knew that one element had been found to fit into each box . francium was discovered in 1939 by a french chemist called marguerite perey . she named it after her home country , france .
