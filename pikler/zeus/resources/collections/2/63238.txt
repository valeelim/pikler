Work (thermodynamics)    work ( thermodynamics ) in thermodynamics , work is the quantity of energy transferred from one system to another without an accompanying transfer of entropy . it is a generalization of the concept of mechanical work in mechanics . in the si system of measurement , work is measured in joules ( symbol : j ) . the rate at which work is performed is power . work , i.e . `` weight `` lifted '' through a height '' , was originally defined in 1824 by sadi carnot in his famous paper `` reflections on the motive power of fire '' . specifically , according to carnot : in 1845 , the english physicist james joule wrote a paper `` on the mechanical equivalent of heat '' for the british association meeting in cambridge . in this work , he reported his best-known experiment , in which the work released through the action of a `` weight `` falling '' through a height '' was used to turn a paddle-wheel in an insulated barrel of water . in this experiment , the friction and agitation of the paddle-wheel on the body of water caused heat to be generated which , in turn , increased the temperature of water . both the temperature change ∆t of the water and the height of the fall ∆h of the weight mg were recorded . using these values , joule was able to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat . joule estimated a mechanical equivalent of heat to be 819 ft•lbf/btu ( 4.41 j/cal ) . the modern day definitions of heat , work , temperature , and energy all have connection to this experiment .
