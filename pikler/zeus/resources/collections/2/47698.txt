Apple Records     apple records was a record label founded in 1968 , started by the beatles . it was a division of the beatles 's company apple corps . emi served as distributors for apple . recording artists who appeared on the apple label included james taylor , mary hopkin , badfinger , billy preston , yoko ono , and members of the beatles before and after their breakup in 1970. while the beatles and their business associates had high hopes for apple at first , the tensions that caused the beatles to split also hurt the label . many of the records released on apple failed to become popular , either because they did not go over well with listeners , or were not given the promotion they needed or deserved to become hit records . james taylor `` walked out '' on his apple records contract , and signed with warner bros. , where he began a long string of hits . mary hopkin retired from music after completing her contract . billy preston and badfinger moved on to other record labels . apple records released the last of its non-beatles records in 1973 , and when their distribution deal with emi ended in 1975 , the label went out of business .
