Variations (music)    variations ( music ) in music , variation is a way of organizing a piece of music by taking a tune ( a theme ) and then repeating it in several different ways . it is often called theme and variation . many composers wrote pieces which are examples of theme and variation . sometimes the theme is one they made up , at other times they took a theme that another composer had already written and then made variations on it . there are lots of ways of varying a tune , and each variation will change it in a different way . a variation may play the tune much faster or much slower , it may change the tune by adding extra sharps and flats or other ornamental notes , or by playing the tune in octaves . it may change the harmony or the rhythm or use different instruments . it may combine the tune in different parts ( counterpoint ) . composers have used variations in music for centuries . in the renaissance and baroque periods composers wrote variations on a short tune in the bass which was repeated again and again . this was called a ground bass or sometimes it was a passacaglia or chaconne . renaissance composers also liked writing what they called “ divisions ” . this meant varying a tune by playing it , for example , at twice the speed or half the speed etc . so that crotchets ( quarter notes ) became minims ( half notes ) or quavers ( eighth notes ) .
