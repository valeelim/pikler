Aurora     an aurora , also called polar light or northern light , is a natural light display in the sky . they are usually seen in the high latitudes ( arctic and antarctic ) regions . auroras are produced when the earth 's magnetosphere is disturbed by the solar wind . an aurora around the north pole is called the `` aurora borealis '' or 'northern lights ' . around the south pole it is the `` aurora australis '' or 'dawn of the south ' . it can be seen from long distances , stretching in the sky many hundreds of miles far away . auroras can only be seen at night because their light is not as strong as the light of day and faint stars can even be seen through the aurora . however , they can also happen during the day . an aurora occurs when the sun sends off small particles into space . these particles are mainly electrons , with charge and energy , which means they contribute to electricity . earth has a protective shield of energy around it . this is called the `` magnetic field '' and forms an elongated sphere around the earth called the `` magnetosphere '' . the earth â€™ s magnetic field keeps off most of the solar wind .
