Geber     abu musa jabir ibn hayyan ( arabic : جابر بن حيان ) ( c. 721–c . 815 ) , known also by his latinised name geber , was a persian prominent chemist , alchemist , pharmacist , philosopher , astronomer/astrologer , physician and physicist . he has also been widely referred to as the `` father of chemistry '' . ibn hayyan is widely credited with the introduction of the experimental method into alchemy , and with the invention of numerous important processes still used in modern chemistry today , such as the syntheses of hydrochloric and nitric acids , distillation , and crystallisation . his original works are highly esoteric and probably coded , though nobody today knows what the code is . on the surface , his alchemical career revolved around an elaborate chemical numerology based on consonants in the arabic names of substances and the concept of `` takwin '' , the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory .
