Hydrogen sulfide     hydrogen sulfide ( british english : `` hydrogen sulphide '' ) is the chemical compound with the formula , is a colorless , toxic , flammable gas that is responsible for the foul smell of rotten eggs and flatulence . it often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen . this happens in swamps , and sewers ( alongside the process of anaerobic digestion ) . it also occurs in volcanic gases , natural gas and some well waters . this is the smell that people often think to be that of sulfur . but sulfur itself does not smell . hydrogen sulfide is also known as sulfane , sulfur hydride , sour gas , sulfurated hydrogen , hydrosulfuric acid , sewer gas and stink damp . iupac accepts the names `` hydrogen sulfide '' and `` sulfane '' . when people speak of more complicated compounds they always use the term `` sulfane '' . small amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be found in crude petroleum . sour natural gas can contain up to 28 % . but , sour natural gas must be cleaned before it can enter a long distance pipeline . pipelines limit hydrogen sulfide to 3 grains per thousand cubic feet of natural gas . volcanoes and hot springs give off some hs , where it probably is made by the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals , i.e . ms + ho to give mo + hs .
