Angular velocity     in physics , the angular velocity specifies the angular speed at which an object is rotating along with the direction in which it is rotating . it is a vector quantity . the si unit of angular velocity is radians per second . but it may be measured in other units as well ( such as degrees per second , degrees per hour , etc. ) . when it is measured in cycles or rotations per unit time ( e.g . revolutions per minute ) , it is often called the rotational velocity and its magnitude the rotational speed . angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega ( ω or ω ) . the direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation , in a direction which is usually specified by the right hand rule . related pages . - angular momentum
