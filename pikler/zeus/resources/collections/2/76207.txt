Evening Prayer (Anglican)    evening prayer ( anglican ) evening prayer ( often called evensong ) , in the anglican church , is the traditional service when people come to church to worship in the late afternoon or early evening . in cathedrals in britain and in some of the old university chapels it is a service that is sung by a choir nearly every day of the week ( there is usually one day of the week when there is no choir and everything is spoken ) . in cathedrals it is usually just the choir and the priests who sing , while the congregation listen . there is sometimes one hymn at the end in which the congregation can join in . evensong in churches will have more singing for the congregation to join in . the form of evensong used today was developed by thomas cranmer in the 16th century . there were two kinds of services , called `` vespers '' and `` compline '' that used to be sung every day by monks in monasteries . cranmer took some of the words that were used in both these services and made today 's form of evening prayer ( evensong ) .
