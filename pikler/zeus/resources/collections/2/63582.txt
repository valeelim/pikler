Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia     the arsacid dynasty or ( sometimes called the arshakuni dynasty ) ruled the kingdom of armenia from 54 to 428. they used to be a branch of the parthian arsacids but became a distinctly armenian dynasty later on . arsacid kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years after the fall of the artaxiad dynasty until 62 when tiridates i of armenia secured arsacid rule in armenia . an independent line of kings was established by vologases ii of armenia ( valarses/vagharshak ) in 180. two of the most notable events under arsacid rule in armenian history were the conversion of armenia to christianity by st. gregory the illuminator in 301 and the creation of the armenian alphabet by mesrop mashtots in 405. references . - history of education in armenia - by kevork a. sarafian , g a sarafean - the heritage of armenian literature vol.1 - by a. j .
