Xylem vessel     xylem vessels are long hollow chains of tough long dead xylem cells . xylem tissue is the water transporter cells of plants . it carries water around a plant . the presence of vessels is a characteristic feature of flowering plants . xylem vessels are a long straight chain made of tough long dead cells known as vessel elements . the vessel have no protoplasm . they are not living , but are made by living cells . the cells are arranged end to end and the cell walls have disappeared . this makes a tube . vessels are made of a substance called lignin . they have a lignified cell wall and a central cavity . vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls . lignin is a hard organic polymer . it makes the cell walls rigid and is very long-lasting . it is the lignin in xylem vessels which holds trees up . water flows up the xylem vessels . the evaporation of water from the stomata cells in the leaves pulls up the water in a transpiration stream . this is called capillary action , because it depends on the way water molecules stick to the walls of the xylem ( adhesion ) .
