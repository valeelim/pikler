Continuity     continuity is a word used when talking about art , especially `` serial art '' . serial art is when an artist paints several pictures which all have something to do with each other . the six star wars films tell one long story which `` continues '' from part to part . this is where the word `` continuity '' comes from . continuity refers to consistency from part to part -- that is , everything should fit together like one whole piece . at the end of the star wars film the empire strikes back , luke skywalker loses one of his hands . in the next film , return of the jedi , he has a fake hand to replace the one he lost . if he had his real hand again , it would n't make sense . the audience would say , did not he lose his hand in the last one ? continuity is making sure things make sense . sometimes the word is used to refer to any work of art , like just one film . for example , a woman has a full glass of wine in one shot . in the next shot , the wine is gone . in a third shot , she has a full glass of wine again . that scene would have very poor continuity : it does not make sense , and it reminds the audience that they are watching a movie . poor continuity is continuity that does not make sense and usually has mistakes .
