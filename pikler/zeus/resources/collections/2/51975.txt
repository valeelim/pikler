Data structure     in computer science , a data structure is the organization of and implementation of values and information . data structures are different from abstract data types in the way they are used . data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting . they do this by using algorithms . this can be seen in the relationship between the list ( abstract data type ) and the linked list ( data structure ) . a list contains a sequence of values or bits of information . a linked list also has a “ pointer ” or “ reference ” between each node of information that points to the next item and the previous one . this allows one to go forwards or backwards in the list . furthermore , data structures are often optimized for certain operations . finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming . the simplest type of data structure is a linear array . also known as a one-dimensional array . an array holds several values of the same type ( integer , floats , string , etc ) . accessing elements within the array is very fast . an array is normally of fixed size . after the size of the array is defined at the start , it may not be possible to increase the size of the array without creating a new larger array and copying all values into the new array . in computer science , an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of '' elements '' ( values or variables ) , each identified by at least one '' array index '' or '' key '' . an array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula .
