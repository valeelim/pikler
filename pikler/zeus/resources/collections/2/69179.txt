Commonwealth realm     a commonwealth realm is a country in the commonwealth of nations which has queen elizabeth ii as monarch . it includes her home country of the united kingdom and many of its former colonies or territories , including : in each of the countries outside the uk , the queen appoints a governor-general to represent her , who , after consulting with the government of the realm , has all of the powers and duties of the queen . usually the governor-general signs all acts of parliament into law , but can wait and ask the queen for advice or wait for her to sign the act herself . this happened in 1982 when queen elizabeth signed the important `` canadian charter of rights and freedoms '' during a visit to ottawa , and the australia act 1986 in canberra . although queen elizabeth ii is monarch of many countries , the british government has no power in the other realms , just as the governments of the other realms have no power in the uk . this is why each realm decides on the queen 's official title . usually it is `` queen of ( realm ) and her other realms and territories , head of the commonwealth '' . but two countries mention the uk in their title for the queen : grenada uses `` queen of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of grenada and her other realms and territories , head of the commonwealth '' , while canada uses the old fashioned form , which reads `` by the grace of god , of the united kingdom , canada and her other realms and territories queen , head of the commonwealth , defender of the faith . '' not all countries use the title `` defender of the faith '' .
