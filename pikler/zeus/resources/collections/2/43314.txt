Waffen-SS     the waffen-ss was part of the schutzstaffel ( ss ) . `` waffen-ss '' means `` armed ss '' in german . the waffen-ss was a paramilitary organisation within the ss . the divisions of the waffen-ss were made of specially trained soldiers . their original job was to protect higher-ranking people in the ss and the nazi party . together with the `` sturmabteilung '' ( `` storm battalion , '' or sa ) , they were used as a police force . the waffen-ss was officially an extra police force on the streets . in 1937 , some soldiers were reorganised . nazi leaders gave some ss members the job of guarding and running concentration camps ( and , later , death camps ) . these soldiers were moved from the waffen-ss to the `` ss-totenkopfverb√§nde '' . in some of the concentration camps , like auschwitz and buchenwald , doctors of the waffen-ss did experiments on humans . heinrich himmler led the ss from 1929 until nazi germany lost world war ii in 1945. after world war ii , the ss were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the ss was made illegal .
