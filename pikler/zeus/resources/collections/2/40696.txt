Silkworm     the silkworm ( `` bombyx mori '' ) is the larva or caterpillar of the `` bombyx mori '' moth . silk has been made for at least 5000 years in china . the moth is important because it makes the silk , and no longer lives in the wild . it is entirely dependent on humans . silkworms eat mulberry leaves , and were native to northern china . the domesticated `` b. mori '' and the wild `` bombyx mandarina '' can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids . female silkworm lays about 500 eggs at a time . she lays eggs on the leaves of mulberry trees . the eggs are covered with gelatinous secretion by which they stick to the leaves . female moth ( silkworm ) lays eggs and die after laying eggs as she does not eat anything . the eggs are kept in a cool place so that they can be stored for a long time . in a favourable condition , they hatch into larva . larva are produced in about 2 weeks from eggs at a temperature of 18 to 25 degree celsius . the cocoon is made of one thread of raw silk from 300 to 900 meters ( 1000 to 3000 feet ) long . the fibers are very thin . about 2,000 to 5,000 cocoons are needed to make a pound of silk .
