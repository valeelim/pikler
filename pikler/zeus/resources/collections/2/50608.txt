Oxidation     oxidizationing is any chemical reaction that involves the moving of electrons . specifically , it means the substance that gives away electrons is oxidized . when iron reacts with oxygen it forms a chemical called rust because it has been oxidized ( the iron has lost some electrons . ) and the oxygen has been reduced ( the oxygen has gained some electrons. ) . oxidation is the opposite of reduction . a reduction-reaction always comes together with an oxidation-reaction . oxidation and reduction together are called redox ( reduction and oxidation ) . oxygen does not have to be present in a reaction , for it to be a redox-reaction . oxidation is a gain of oxygen . reduction is a loss of oxygen . for example : - feo + 3co â†’ 2fe + 3co both reduction and oxidation go on at the same time which is a redox-reaction . the loss of hydrogen-atoms ; and , the simultaneously gaining of oxygen-atoms , is known as oxidation.then oxidation is gain o ion and . reduction is gain of hydrogen atoms related pages . - oxidizing agent
