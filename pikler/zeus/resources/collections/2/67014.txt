Vascular plant     the vascular plants , tracheophytes or higher plants are plants that have specialized tissues for conducting water , minerals , and photosynthetic products through the plant . they include the ferns , clubmosses , horsetails , flowering plants , conifers and other gymnosperms . the vascular plants are set apart in two main ways : 1. vascular plants have vascular tissues , which circulate resources through the plant . this feature allows vascular plants to grow to a larger size than non-vascular plants , which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes . 1. in vascular plants , the principal generation phase is the `` sporophyte '' , which is diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell . water transport happens in either xylem or phloem : xylem carries water and inorganic solutes upward toward the leaves from the roots , while phloem carries organic solutes throughout the plant . members . - spore-bearing vascular plants - equisetophyta ~ horsetails
