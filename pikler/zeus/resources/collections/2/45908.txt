Tree line     the tree-line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow . beyond the tree-line , they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad . there are several types of tree lines defined in ecology and geology : - arctic tree-line the farthest north in the northern hemisphere that trees can grow ; farther north , it is too cold . - antarctic tree-line the farthest south in the southern hemisphere that trees can grow ; farther south , it is too cold as well . - alpine tree-line the highest height where trees grow : higher up , it is too cold , or snow covers the ground for too much of the year . the climate above the tree-line is called an alpine climate . - exposure tree-line on coasts and isolated mountains , the tree-line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger , more complex mountain systems , because strong winds reduce tree growth . - desert tree-line the places where trees can not grow as there is too little rainfall . - toxic tree-line the environment is too extreme for trees to grow . this can be caused by molten lava or hot rock ( infrared radiation ) , any of several kinds of fumarole ( steam , sulfur , acid ) , soil ph , low oxygen conditions , salt concentrations ( as near the dead sea or great salt lake ) , sulfate levels , other natural causes , or by man made pollution .
