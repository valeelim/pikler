Hepatitis C     hepatitis c is an infection that mostly affects the liver . the hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) causes this disease . often , a person with hepatitis c does not have any symptoms ( health problems or signs that he has the disease ) . however , chronic infection can scar the liver . many years of infection may cause cirrhosis . sometimes , people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer . they can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach . the blood loss from this problem can kill . hepatitis c is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact ( when blood from a person with hepatitis c contacts ( touches or gets into ) another person 's bloodstream ) . the most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use ( when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins , with a needle that was already used by a person infected with hepatitis c ) ; nonsterile medical equipment ( medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person ) ; and blood transfusions ( when a person is given blood that came from an infected person ) .
