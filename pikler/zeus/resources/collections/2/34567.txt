Headlands and bays     a headland is an area of land that is surrounded by water on three sides . very often , the land areas are called `` cape '' s. a bay is an area of water . it is surrounded by land on three sides . the water areas are also called `` gulf '' s. headlands are made of hard rock and bays are made of soft rock . it takes the hard rock longer to erode . a bay is a large body of water in the land next to a sea or lake between two headlands . the waves coming to the shore in a bay are usually constructive waves , and because of this , many of them have a beach . a bay may be metres across , or it could be hundreds of kilometres across . bays form where weak rocks , such as sands and clays , are eroded , leaving bands of stronger rocks , such as chalk , limestone , or granite , forming a headland , or peninsula . headlands and bays are formed when there are parallel sections of softer and harder rock perpendicular to the coast . the sea erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock , forming a bay . the harder rock that is left protruding into the sea is the headland . they also can be made by people mining off the coast .
