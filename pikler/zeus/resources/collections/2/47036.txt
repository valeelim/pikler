Clef     a clef is a sign at the beginning of a staff of music which makes it possible for the player to work out what the notes are . the word “ clef ” is a french word meaning “ key ” . the original latin word is “ clavis ” . it is the “ key ” to understanding which notes should be played . the staff ( or “ stave ” ) consists of five lines across the page . the notes are placed on these lines and in these spaces . the staff is only large enough to cover one and a half octaves of music ( a bit more with ledger lines ) . therefore , different clefs are used for high music and for low music . the treble clef is drawn by starting with a circle in the middle , then going up , round and straight down with a hook at the end . the second line of the staff ( counting from the bottom ) goes through the middle of the treble clef ’ s circle . a note on this line is a g. this is why the treble clef is called a “ g clef ” . the treble clef is used for high notes . the notes higher than middle c can be written in the treble clef . in piano music the right hand is usually written in the treble clef . music for instruments such as the violin , flute , oboe , recorder , trumpet and high singing voice are always written in the treble clef .
