Benjamin Agosto     benjamin alexandro `` ben '' agosto ( born january 15 , 1982 , in chicago , illinois ) is an american ice dancer . his skating partner is tanith belbin . agosto originally skated with katy hill in the chicago area . in 1998 , he moved to michigan and he teamed up with belbin . they are coached by igor shpilband . shpilband is the one who paired them together . belbin & agosto had success immediately on the junior level . they won a medal of every color at the world junior figure skating championships between 2000 and 2002. they qualified to skate for the united states at the 2002 winter olympics . however , in order to do this , both partners would need to be citizens of the united states and belbin had not yet gotten american citizenship . in 2004 , belbin and agosto won their first national title . in 2005 , belbin and agosto won their first world medal . this was the first world medal for the united states in ice dancing in 20 years . their silver medal at this competition , along with how well the other american team did , earned the united states three spots on the olympic team . however , this would not have done them any good because belbin was still not an american citizen . if she had applied for citizenship , she would have gotten her citizenship in time for the 2006 olympics . because of rules changes after she had applied , she could not go back and take advantage of other rules , so she and agosto thought they would have to miss the 2006 olympics . but a special law was passed allowing her to take advantage of the sped-up process . belbin was sworn in as an american citizen on december 31 , 2005 .
