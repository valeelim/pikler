Pascal (unit)    pascal ( unit ) the pascal ( symbol : pa ) is the si derived unit of pressure or stress . it is a measure of perpendicular force per unit area i.e . equal to one newton per square meter . in everyday life , the pascal is maybe best known from meteorological air-pressure reports , where it happens in the form of hectopascal ( 1 hpa = 100 pa ) . in other cases , the kilopascal is more commonly used , for example on bicycle tire labels . one hectopascal corresponds to 0.1 and one kilopascal to about 1 % of atmospheric pressure ( near sea level ) . it is named after the french mathematician and physicist , blaise pascal .
