Card Sharks     card sharks was a game show airing from 1978 to 2001. two contestants fought against each other in the main gameâ€”the returning champion and a challenging contestant . the returning champion was represented by the color red . the challenger was represented by the color blue . the host , jim perry , then asked a toss-up question , which was asked to 100 people before the show ( example : `` we surveyed 100 lawyers : have you ever defended a person who you believed was guilty ? how many lawyers said they have ? '' ) . the contestant he asked it to would provide what they thought the number of people who gave the answer the host gave . the other contestant would then say whether they thought the actual number was higher or lower than the first contestant 's guess . whoever is closer to the number got a chance at the cards . there were two rows of five cards : the top red row ( for the champion ) and the bottom blue row ( for the challenger ) . the contestant in control had to predict whether each card was higher or lower than the card before it .
