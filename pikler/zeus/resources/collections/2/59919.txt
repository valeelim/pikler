Dynamics (music)    dynamics ( music ) in music , dynamics means how loud or quiet the music is . in written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for italian words for the dynamic levels . they are listed in the table below . notice that “ piano ” is pronounced the italian way ( “ pi-ah-no ” ) . `` use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very , very soft , or very , very loud . tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs , though only up to three are normally found in sheet music . dynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly . exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things : what is happening in the music , the instrument , the size of the room in which the music is being played etc . the important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another . some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want . others leave a lot to the performer to decide . historically , composers several centuries ago , such as bach , only wrote occasional dynamic marks . even mozart only wrote a few , mostly p and f. by the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music .
