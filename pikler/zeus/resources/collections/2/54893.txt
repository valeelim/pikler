Short-beaked echidna     the short-beaked echidna ( `` tachyglossus aculeatus '' ) is is the only member of its genus , and one of four living species of echidna . the short-beaked echidna , `` tachyglossus '' , is the spiny anteater because they eat ants and termites . it is covered in fur and spines . it has a special nose ( snout ) and a special tongue that lets the echidna catch its prey at a great speed . it lays eggs , like the other monotremes . the echidna lives throughout australia , and in coastal and highland regions of southwestern new guinea . in australia , it is the most widespread native mammal . it is not threatened with extinction , but human activities , such as hunting , habitat destruction , and the introduction of foreign predators and parasites , have reduced its range . the animal was first described in 1792 . `` tachyglossus '' means `` fast tongue '' . this is about the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites . the word `` aculeatus '' means `` spiny '' or `` having spines '' . the long-beaked echidna are all bigger than `` t. aculeatus '' . they eat mostly worms and grubs , rather than ants and termites .
