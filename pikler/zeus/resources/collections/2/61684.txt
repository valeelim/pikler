Murti     in hinduism , a murti ( also spelled murthi or murthy ) usually means an image in which the divine spirit is expressed ( 'murta ' ) . hindus call the presence of god into the image so that they can communicate with him and receive his blessings.hindus do n't worship the murti or statue itself but the god who is present in their minds and souls . it can also be set up any where murtis sometimes are abstract , but almost always stone or metal images of god in a human-like form like shiva or ganesha , rama or krishna , saraswati or kali . murtis are made according to strict prescriptions and then installed by highly trained priests through a ceremony . the priests can then call on god in the image daily . murtis in hindutemples and shrines are a mystical form of communication with god and devas . this is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the telephone . one does not talk to the telephone ; rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person . without the telephone , one could not have a conversation across long distances ; and without the sanctified image in the temple , one can not easily talk with the deity .
