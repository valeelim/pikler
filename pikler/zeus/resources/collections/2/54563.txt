Common clam worm     the common clam worm ( `` nereis succinea '' ) is a widely distributed polychaete worm . it is often referred to as a ragworm or sandworm , or simply as the `` clam worm '' , but these terms can all refer to any one of a number of other species of the genus `` nereis '' ( or indeed to other polychaetes ) . the name `` common clam worm '' is less ambiguous , but is also sometimes used for other `` nereis '' species such as `` n. virens '' and `` n. limbata '' . it is similar to a millipede . the common clam worm can reach up to 15 centimeters ( 6 inches ) in length , but most specimens are smaller than this . it is brown coloured at the rear , and reddish-brown on the rest of its body . it has an identifiable head with four eyes , two sensory feelers or palps , and eight tentacles . it is a freeswimming polychaete , scavenging on the bottom of shallow marine waters . it feeds on other worms and algae . to feed , it uses a proboscis , which has two hooks at the end , to grasp prey and draw it into its mouth . clamworms are an important food source for bottom-feeding fish and crustaceans , though they can protect themselves by secreting a mucus substance that hardens to form a sheath around them .
