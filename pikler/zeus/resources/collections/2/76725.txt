Eulipotyphla     the eulipotyphla is an order of mammals . it was formed from those insectivorous mammals which are monophyletic , a single clade . the old order insectivora is now abandoned because it was polyphyletic . the new order eulipotyphla has been shown to be monophyletic . the term insectivore ( insect eater ) can still be used to describe lifestyle . it explains the food habits of this and some other groups of mammals . although moles and shrews are not all strictly insectivorous , insects and other small animal life make up the main food of most members of the group . some kinds , the otter shrews of africa and the star-nosed mole of north america , for example , feed also upon fish . the townsend mole of the pacific northwest often is a nuisance to bulb growers because of its fondness for the bulbs of many kinds of plants . moles , as a group , are subterranean in habit . they spend most of their lives in the darkness of underground tunnels which they dig for themselves . the eyes of all moles are very small , in some species actually not opening to the outside , and of little value to them : vestigial organs . on the other hand , their senses of touch and smell are highly developed .
