Elongation     elongation is an astronomical term that describes the angle between the sun and a planet , as viewed from earth . when an inferior planet ( mercury or venus ) is visible after sunset , it is near its greatest eastern elongation . when an inferior planet is visible before sunrise , it is near its greatest western elongation . the value of the greatest elongation ( west or east ) , for mercury , is between 18째 and 28째 ; and for venus between 45째 and 47째 . this value varies because the orbits of the planets are elliptical , rather than perfect circles .
