Metamorphosis     metamorphosis in biology means the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form in two or more distinct stages . good examples are insects and amphibians . life for most insects begins as a larva or nymph then progresses to the pupa stage and ends as an adult . there are two main types of metamorphosis in insects : simple metamorphosis or `` hemimetabolism '' , and complete metamorphosis or `` holometabolism '' . insects who go through simple ( or incomplete ) metamorphosis have three life stages . these insects start as eggs , which are usually very small . when the egg hatches , a larva or nymph comes out . nymphs are just baby insects . most of the time , the nymph looks similar to the adult , but it is smaller , may have different colouration , and does not have wings . the nymph grows through stages called `` instars '' , shedding its 'skin ' ( `` epicuticle '' ) at each stage ( `` ecdysis '' ) . finally , it changes into a mature adult with wings . some insect nymphs are aquatic , which means they live in water . these nymphs usually have gills and look very different from the adults they will turn into . nymphs that live in water are called `` naiads '' .
