Polysaccharide     polysaccharides are relatively more complex carbohydrates . they are polymers made up of many monosaccharides . they are very large , often branched , molecules . they tend to be amorphous , insoluble in water , and have no sweet taste . when all the constituent monosaccharides are of the same type they are termed `` homopolysaccharides '' ; when more than one type of monosaccharide is present they are termed `` heteropolysaccharides '' . examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin . starches are insoluble in water . they can be digested by hydrolysis , catalyzed by enzymes called amylases . humans and other animals have amylases , so they can digest starches . potato , rice , wheat , and maize are major sources of starch in the human diet . the structural components of plants are formed primarily from cellulose . wood is largely cellulose and lignin , while paper and cotton are nearly pure cellulose . cellulose is a polymer made with repeated glucose units . humans and many other animals do not digest cellulose . certain animals can digest cellulose , because bacteria possessing the enzyme are present in their gut . the classic example is the termite .
