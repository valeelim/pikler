Compton scattering     in physics , compton scattering , or the compton effect , is the name used for what happens to the energy ( or frequency or wavelength ) of an x-ray or gamma ray photon when it interacts with matter ; the wavelength increases ( or energy/frequency decreases ) as it scatters off electrons . this scattering is one of the main things that happen when gamma rays meet matter . the compton effect was studied by arthur holly compton in 1923 .
