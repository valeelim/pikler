Ovum     an ovum ( latin : `` egg '' , plural : ova ) is the name for the haploid female reproductive cell , or gamete . both animals and land plants ( embryophytes ) produce ova . ova are made and released by a female 's ovaries . at birth , a female has all of her eggs , and from puberty , she releases an egg once a month until none are left . this is called oogenesis . when the ovum is fertilised by a male 's sperm , it becomes a zygote , which develops into a new organism . the ovum is fertilized inside the female body , and the embryo then develops inside the uterus , being fed by the mothers placenta . the ovum is the largest cell in the human body . you can see it without a microscope . the human ovum is between 100 and 200 Âµm long . they are nevertheless much smaller than the cleidoic eggs laid externally by reptiles and birds , which is why they need a long period of internal development in the womb . the sexual cycle is quite different in other mammals , whose females are only receptive during their 'heat ' , which triggers the release of eggs from the ovary . sexual activity then continues for a few days , then ceases entirely until the next heat .
