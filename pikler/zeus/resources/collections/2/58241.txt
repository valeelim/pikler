Cuneiform     cuneiform script is one of the earliest known systems of writing . it used wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets , made by a reed stylus . the name `` cuneiform '' itself means `` wedge shaped '' , from the latin `` cuneus '' `` wedge '' and `` forma '' `` shape '' . it came into english usage probably from the old french `` cun√©iforme . '' it was first used in sumer in the late 4th millennium bc ( the 'uruk iv ' period ) . cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs . in the third millennium , the signs became simplified and more abstract . fewer characters were used , from about 1,000 in the early bronze age to about 400 in late bronze age ( hittite cuneiform ) . the system used a combination of phonetic , consonantal alphabetic ( no vowels ) and syllabic signs . the original sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the akkadian , eblaite , elamite , hittite , luwian , hattic , hurrian , and urartian languages , and it inspired the ugaritic and old persian alphabets . cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the phoenician alphabet during the neo-assyrian empire . by the 2nd century bc , the script was extinct . all knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century .
