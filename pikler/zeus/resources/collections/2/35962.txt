Multituberculate     the multituberculates were a group of rodent-like mammals which survived for about 120 million years â€“ the second longest fossil history of any mammal line . they were eventually outcompeted by rodents , becoming extinct during the early oligocene . at least 200 species are known , ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized . these species occupied many ecological niches , ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree-dwelling . multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals , the theria ( placentals and marsupials ) , and monotremes . some cladistic analyses put them closer to theria than to monotremes . the multituberculates had a head anatomy similar to rodents . they had cheek-teeth separated from the chisel-like front teeth by a wide tooth-less gap ( called the `` diastema '' ) . each cheek-tooth displayed several rows of small cusps ( or tubercles , hence the name ) which worked against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw . it was an efficient chopping device .
