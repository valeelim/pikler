Padding (cryptography)    padding ( cryptography ) padding is a term used in cryptography . very often , messages ( to be encrypted ) start or end in a well-known way ( `` dear bob , ... , yours , alice '' ) . this is a problem , because that knowledge could be used to break ( or start to break ) encryption . to prevent this , a number of random characters are added at the beginning or the end of the message . this procedure may also be necessary because many cryptographic methods operate on blocks of code . if a block is not full , additional characters need to be filled in . filling in random text has proven very useful .
