Royal Philharmonic Orchestra     the royal philharmonic orchestra ( rpo ) is a british orchestra based in london . it travels around to give concerts in many places . the rpo was started just after world war ii , in 1946 , by the conductor sir thomas beecham . beecham did not start to get his players together until three weeks before the first concert which took place in croydon on september 15 , 1946. beecham was principal conductor until his death in 1961. when the orchestra toured the united states in 1950 they were the first british orchestra to visit america since the london symphony orchestra in 1912. beecham controlled all the organization of the orchestra . after beecham â€™ s death , the orchestra was made into a self-governing group , like the other london orchestras . they went through some difficult years . in 1963 the royal philharmonic society decided they would stop asking the rpo to play for their concerts , and in glyndebourne , where the rpo had played for the opera since 1948 , the london philharmonic orchestra became the resident orchestra instead . sir malcolm sargent helped the orchestra to put on its own concerts at a cinema in north london .
