Sight-reading     sight-reading ( or sight-singing for singers ) is the ability to play music that one has never seen before . it is important to be able to read music well in order to sight-read . many people who learn to play an instrument will take examinations from time to time . one of the tests that is usually required for an examination is some sight-reading . people who find it hard to read music will find it hard to sight-read . the best way to improve is by regular practice . people who play in orchestras will need to be good sight-readers because they often have to play music that they have never seen or heard before . people who learn the piano often find sight-reading hard because they have to read two staves at once ( one for each hand ) . playing through lots of easy music is a good way to improve . playing piano duets with a friend is also great fun . when someone is reading aloud their eyes are looking several words ahead of the word they are speaking . in the same way a good sight-reader will try to look ahead of the notes he is playing . the player is `` anticipating '' ( thinking about what is going to happen next ) . in this way he can try to make the music expressive , even if it means leaving out some of the notes .
