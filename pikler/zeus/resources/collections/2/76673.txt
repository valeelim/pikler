Housefly     housefly is the common fly often found in houses . the latin name for the housefly is `` musca domestica '' . this species is always found near humans . it is the most common species found on hog and poultry farms , horse stables and ranches . not only are house flies a nuisance , but they also carry disease-causing organisms . flies are not only an irritant to farm workers but may be a public health concern . each female fly can lay about 9,000 eggs in its life , in several batches of about 75 to 150. the eggs are laid on or near meat , often dead animals . within a day , larvae ( maggots ) hatch from the eggs ; they live and feed on dead and decaying organic material , such as garbage , carrion or faeces . they are pale-whitish , and have no legs . their life cycle is from 14 hours to 36 hours . at the end of their third instar , the maggots crawl to a dry , cool place and turn into pupae . these are coloured reddish-brown and about 8 mm long . from the pupae emerge adult flies . the whole cycle is known as complete metamorphosis .
