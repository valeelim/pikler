Vikidia     vikidia is an encyclopedia made with a wiki , using mediawiki . its goal is to be readable by a child from 8 to 13 years old as well as allowing easy understanding by people learning french , italian , spanish , english , russian , catalan , euskara and sicilian . it was inspired by , wikikids , a dutch website , much in the style of the larger and better known wikipedia . the major difference is in the fact that these sites are meant for minors . they are for children from the age of 8 to about 13 and everything in between , although there is no age limit . as in wikipedia , vikidia is an open wiki , so everybody is allowed to edit the articles . but vikidia is also a wiki for children , so all inappropriate or shocking content , especially vandalism , is quickly removed by the site 's administrators . vikidia helps children to contribute , and some schools and teachers have involved their class to write articles as a school project . the simple english wikipedia is much like vikidia , only that it is made for mature people learning english with a lesser focus on children .
