Edward Teach     edward teach ( c. 1680 â€“ 22 november 1718 ) was a pirate , often called `` blackbeard the pirate '' . ( it is not clear what his real name actually was ; some historians think that his last name may really have been thatch . ) he attacked ships in the caribbean and the american colonies . his flagship ship was the captured french slave ship `` la concorde '' which blackbeard renamed `` queen anne 's revenge '' . about 1718 it ran aground near beaufort inlet , north carolina and was abandoned . blackbeard often fought wearing a big feathered tricorn hat , and with lots of swords , knives , and pistols . some pictures show him with lighted rope matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle . the matches burned slowly and gave of lots of smoke . they were designed to make him look frightening . he probably got the idea from seeing the burning rope was used to light the gunpowder in cannons and guns . ( these old fashioned guns were called `` matchlocks '' , later a flint was used to make a spark , these were called flintlock guns ) . no one knows how many wives blackbeard had . the book `` a general history of the pyrates '' says that he had as many as fourteen wives , but he was not legally married to most of them .
