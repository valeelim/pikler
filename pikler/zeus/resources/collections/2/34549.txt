Automaton     an automaton ( one automaton , several `` automata '' ) is a concept from mathematics . sometimes the concept is called `` state machine '' . it is like an abstract machine . such a machine can be given `` input '' , which is either rejected , or accepted . it 's like a vending machine . when something is bought , coins ( or money ) needs to be inserted into the machine . if these are the right coins , they are accepted , and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed . if the coins are wrong , they are rejected . internally , the automaton has different `` states '' it can be in . feeding it input may ( or may not ) change its state . that way , the automaton goes through all the input , consuming one item ( which mathematicians call a symbol ) at a time . when no symbol is left , the automaton is in a certain state . this may be an `` final state '' . in this case the input is accepted . otherwise , the input is rejected . if the machine has a countable , finite number of states , it is called `` finite state machine '' . a diagram that shows all the states , and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram .
