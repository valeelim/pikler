Quotient     in mathematics , the quotient is the end result of a division problem . for example , in the problem 6 รท 3 , the quotient would be 2. then 6 would be called the dividend , and 3 the divisor . the quotient can also be expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend . a quotient can also mean just the integral part of the result of dividing two integers . for example , the quotient of 13 รท 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3. quotients also come up in certain tests , like the iq test , which stands for intelligence quotient . in this case , your quotient is basically your score . in recent decades , as people begin to emphasize full personal development , other similar quotients appeared .
