Coronary artery disease     coronary artery disease , also called coronary heart disease , is a heart disease . ( `` coronary '' means `` the blood vessels of the heart '' . ) coronary heart disease causes plaque to build up inside the coronary arteries . this causes the coronary arteries to become narrower . an artery is a blood vessel - a tube that carries blood . after the heart supplies blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients , the arteries carry the blood to different parts of the body . the coronary arteries are very important : they supply blood to the heart muscle . so when the coronary arteries become narrower , less blood gets to the heart muscle . most people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms . the most common symptom is a heart attack . if coronary heart disease is not treated , some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart . coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death . it is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old . men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women .
