Graphite     graphite , like diamond , is an allotrope of carbon . they are very similar to each other but the structure of the atom affects the chemical and physical properties . graphite is made of layers of carbon atoms . these layers can slide over each other very easily . this means that it is very soft . it is a dull gray in appearance . due to the delocalized electrons between the layers , it can conduct electricity very well . graphite can be formed from coal put under high heat and pressure . also , graphite can be turned into diamond with enough heat and pressure . this is how synthetic ( man-made ) diamonds are made . most graphite comes from mines in northeastern china . it is also found in sri lanka , canada and the united states . it is also called lead black because it looks like the metal lead . it was named by abraham gottlob werner in 1789 originating from the greek language . it can be used as a lubricant to make mechanical devices run smoother . the most common use of graphite is the `` lead '' in a pencil , which also has clay .
