Begging     begging means asking people for money , food , shelter or other things , when one is not able to give anything instead . it is also referred to as sponging , spanging ( short for `` spare-changing '' ) or ( in american english ) panhandling . in larger cities , it is common to see beggars who ask for money , food , or other items . typically , beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups , mugs , small boxes , hats , or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as `` help me . i 'm homeless . '' a 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $ 638 cad , those interviewed spent a median of $ 200 cad on food and $ 192 cad on alcohol , tobacco and illegal drugs . the fraser institute , however , criticized this study . they said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned . they also said that panhandlers ' reports were not reliable because of this , some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or food/service vouchers , instead of money . some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelter 's location and services , which can be given instead of cash .
