Microcontroller     a microcontroller ( abbreviated mcu or Âµc ) is a computer system on a chip that does a job . it contains an integrated processor , memory ( a small amount of ram , program memory , or both ) , and programmable input/output peripherals , which are used to interact with things connected to the chip a microcontroller is different than a microprocessor which only contains a cpu ( the kind used in a personal computer ) . first released in 1971 by the intel company , microcontrollers began to become popular in their first few years . the extremely useful intel 8008 microprocessor was then released , but it was still impractical because of high cost for each chip . these first microcontrollers combined different types of computer memory on one unit . after people began to see how useful they were , micro controllers were constantly being upgraded , with people trying to find new ways to make them better . cost was reduced over time and by the early 2000s , micro controllers were widely used across the world .
