Saurischia     saurischia is one of the two orders of dinosaurs . in 1888 , harry seeley classified dinosaurs into two main orders . their hip structure was why they were put into these orders . saurischians ( 'lizard-hipped ' ) and the ornithischians ( 'bird-hipped ' ) have differences in the ways bones in the hip are put together . all carnivorous dinosaurs ( the theropods ) are saurischians , and so are the sauropods like `` diplodocus '' and `` brachiosaurus '' . birds are direct descendants of a group of theropod dinosaurs , so they are a sub-clade of saurischian dinosaurs in modern classification . - order saurischia - suborder theropoda - suborder sauropoda related pages . - ornithischia
