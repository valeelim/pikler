Platelet     a platelet is a cell fragment that circulates in the blood . platelets are involved in hemostasis through the making of blood clots . a low platelet count ( number of platelets in the blood ) can cause a person to bleed without their blood clotting ( making scabs ) . a high platelet count can increase the risk of thrombosis ( blood clots inside blood vessels ) , which stops blood from flowing properly . platelets do not have a cell nucleus . they are disc-shaped , and are 1.5 to 3 micrometers in diameter . the body does not have a lot of platelets , so they can all be used up quickly . they contain rna , a canalicular system , and several different types of granules ; lysosomes ( containing acid hydrolases ) , dense bodies ( containing adp , atp serotonin and calcium ) and alpha granules ( containing fibrinogen , factor v , vitronectin , thrombospondin and von willebrand factor ) , the contents of which are released when the platelet is activated .
