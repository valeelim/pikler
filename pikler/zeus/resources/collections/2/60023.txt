Objectivity (journalism)    objectivity ( journalism ) objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism . objectivity may mean `` fairness '' , `` disinterestedness '' , `` factuality '' , and `` nonpartisanship '' . the term has not only a single meaning , because journalists and the public use it in these different ways . in many countries , advocacy journalism is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism . few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality . however , most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work . in `` discovering the news '' ( 1978 ) , sociologist michael schudson argues that `` the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts , ' a distrust in 'values , ' and a commitment to their segregation . '' in the united states , an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric . journalism without any bias , as if one just came to earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced , although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting . ( see , for example , noam chomsky , the journalist from mars . )
