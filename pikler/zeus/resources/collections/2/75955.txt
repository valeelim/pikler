Retrograde and direct motion     direct motion is the motion of a planetary body in a direction similar to that of other bodies within its system , and is sometimes called prograde motion . retrograde motion is motion in the opposite direction . in the case of celestial bodies such as the retrograde carme group of moons , such motion may be real , defined by the natural rotation or orbit of the body . every so often a planet seems to change direction and go the other way for a short period of time ( in relation to the fixed stars ) , making a loop or squiggle in its track before carrying on as normal . this apparent retrograde motion , however , is seen because the earth is moving . it is only seen when outer planets -mars to neptune are near opposition .
