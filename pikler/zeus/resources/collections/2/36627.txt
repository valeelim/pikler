Squaring the circle     squaring the circle is a problem of geometry . the problem is to construct a square that has the same area as the unit circle , only by using a compass and straightedge construction method . some people also call this problem the quadrature of the circle . this is not about a circle with corners like a square . it is a problem like squaring a triangle . it is easy to construct a square with the same area as a triangle . squaring the circle is related to the other ancient problems which have been proved impossible , squaring the cube and trisecting the angle . in 1882 , ferdinand von lindenmann proved that this is impossible because it is impossible to calculate √π exactly , which is a transcendental number .
