Loudspeaker     a loudspeaker , which is also called a loud-speaker or speaker , is an item that is used to create the sound in radios , television sets , and electric musical instrument amplifier systems . loudspeakers use both electric and mechanical principles to convert an electrical signal from a radio , television set or electric musical instrument into sound . for a loudspeaker to produce sound , the signal from the radio , television set , or electric musical instrument needs to be connected to an electronic amplifier . loudspeakers are usually built by using stiff paper cone , a coil of thin copper wire , and a circular magnet . the cone , copper wire , and magnet are usually mounted in a rectangle-shaped wood cabinet . the coil of copper wire moves back and forth when an electrical signal is passed through it . the coil of copper wire and the magnet cause the rigid paper cone to vibrate and reproduce sounds . inside loudspeaker can be audio crossover . some loudspeakers are designed for lower-pitched sounds , such as `` woofer '' loudspeakers or `` subwoofer '' loudspeakers . other loudspeakers , which are called `` tweeters '' , are designed to reproduce high-pitched sounds ( such as the sound of a whistle or a bird singing ) .
