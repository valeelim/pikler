Guantanamo Bay Naval Base     guantanamo bay is a bay in the south of the island of cuba . part of it is controlled by the united states . they took control of it in 1903 , under a treaty between the united states and cuba . the current government of cuba does not see this treaty as legal . they say it violates international law ( more specifically , the vienna convention on the law of treaties of 1969 ) . the southern part of the bay is surrounded by a navy station of the united states . the name of the station ( or base ) is sometimes shortened to gtmo , called `` gitmo '' . the mission of this station is to act to prevent terrorism , help people who are fleeing cuba and stop drug crime . this base is also now used as a place to keep people captured by american forces from afghanistan and iraq . also some prisoners were taken from other countries , like britain and france . some people say that these people do not get the rights that they should get as prisoners of war under the geneva conventions . one reason that they are there may be that the laws of the united states do not apply to them . according to some well-known human rights groups , some prisoners have been tortured and others may have been badly treated according the fbi inquiry . this has also been reported by some europeans who were taken by cia `` torture flights '' and have now been released .
