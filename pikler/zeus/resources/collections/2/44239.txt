`Abdu'l-Bahá     `abdu'l-bahá was a persian man who was born on may 23 , 1844 and died on november 28 , 1921. his father was bahá'u'lláh who founded the religion known as the bahá'í faith . `abdu'l-bahá spent most of his adult life in prison or under arrest , because of his father 's new religion . bahá'u'lláh called him the `` expounder '' of his word , meaning that only `abdu'l-bahá had the right to say what bahá'u'lláh 's writings mean . this was to prevent different people from splitting the religion up because they thought bahá'u'lláh meant different things , the way many other religions have split up .
