Planetary core     the planetary core is the innermost layer or layers in a planet . the terrestrial planets ( planets with a rocky surface ) have a core mainly made of iron and could be a solid or a liquid layer . the earth 's core is partially liquid , while the cores of mars and venus are thought to be completely solid , because the cores do not make a magnetic field . the gas giants also have a core made of iron . their cores are very small , in proportion to their large size . however , the gas giants are so large that their cores can still be larger than the earth 's core . jupiter 's core is estimated to be 12 times the mass of the earth 's . a core 's size can vary from each planet or other object . the moon 's core is 20 % of its radius , but mercury 's core is 75 % of its radius .
