Sophene     sophene ( armenian : `` '' ) was a province of the armenian kingdom and of the roman empire , in the southwest of the kingdom . it is currently in modern-day southeastern turkey . according to anania shirakatsi 's `` ashkharatsuyts '' ( `` world atlas , '' 7th century ) , tsopk was the 2nd among the 15 provinces of greater armenia . it consisted of 8 cantons ( `` gavars '' ) : khordzyan , hashtyank , paghnatun , balahovit , tsopk ( shahunyats ) , andzit , degiq , and gavreq ( goreq ) . tsopk was part of the kingdom of urartu in the 8th-7th cc bc . after unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 700s bc , king argishtis i of urartu resettled many of its inhabitants to his newly built city of erebuni ( modern day armenian capital yerevan ) . around 600 bc , tsopk became part of the newly emerged ancient armenian kingdom of orontids . after alexander the great 's campaigns in 330s bc and the subsequent collapse of the achaemenid empire , tsopk remained part of the newly independent kingdom of greater armenia . in the early 200s bc , at the instigation of the seleucid empire , which was trying to weaken the armenian kingdom , tsopk , along with commagene , split from greater armenia , forming the hellenistic kingdom of tsopk-commagene . the kingdom was ruled by a branch of the armenian royal dynasty of orontids . tsopk later split from the tsopk-commagene kingdom as well , forming an independent kingdom .
