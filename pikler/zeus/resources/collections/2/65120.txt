Approval voting     approval voting is a voting system used for elections . in approval voting , each person can vote for any number of candidates they like . the votes for each of the candidates are counted , and summed up . the candidate or candidates with most votes are chosen as the winners of the election . supporters argue it to be better than plurality voting because voters can vote for the lessor of evils advertised by the media but also for their favorite candidates . if their goal is just to vote against a candidate , they can do so more forcefully by approving all other candidates . ballots can easily be hand counted if voters do not trust computers , which might be needed for instant runoff voting . vote spoiling is not an issue with approval voting , so many candidates may run for office . opponents argue that voters still have some of the problems of plurality voting , which is that they do not know if they will need to compromise their vote or not ( tactical voting ) . giving approval to a compromise candidate could result in that compromise candidate winning , when their favorite would have won had they not given approval to the compromise candidate . it is possible for 51 % of voters ( a majority ) to view a candidate as their first choice but for that candidate to lose to a compromise candidate because many of those voters approved the compromise candidate as well . not knowing whether or not to compromise is a problem with all voting systems when at least three strong candidates run .
