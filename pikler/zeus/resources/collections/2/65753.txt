Cache     caching is a term used in computer science . the idea behind a cache ( pronounced `` cash '' ) is very simple : very often , obtaining a result for a calculation is very time-consuming , so storing the result is generally a good idea . two kinds of storage media are used : one is usually quite big , but accessing it is `` slow '' ; the other one can be accessed much faster , but generally it is small . the very basic idea behind caching is to use the medium that is fast to access to have copies of data . there is no difference between the copy , and the original . accessing the original data may take a long time , or it may be expensive to do ( for example : the results of a difficult problem that take a long time to solve ) . for this reason , it is much `` cheaper '' to simply use the copy of the data from the cache . put differently , a cache is a temporary storage area that has copies of data that is used often . when a copy of the data is in this cache , it is faster to use this copy rather than re-fetching or re-calculating the original data . this will make the average time needed to access the data shorter . putting a new value into a cache often means that an older value needs to be replaced . there are different ideas ( usually called `` strategies '' ) on how to select the value to replace .
