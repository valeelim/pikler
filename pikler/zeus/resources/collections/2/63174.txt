Yeghishe Charents     yeghishe charents ( born yeghishe soghomonian , ) ( 13 march 1897 , kars - 29 november 1937 , yerevan ) was an armenian poet killed in stalin 's purges . from 1904 to 1912 yeghishe soghomonian he was at school in kars . amid the upheavals of the first world war and the armenian genocide in the ottoman empire , he volunteered in 1915 for the caucasian front . in 1917-1918 he was in karin erzurum during the bitter fighting . some of his experiences would later appear in his poetry . yeghishe charents ( soghomonian ) , one of the nation 's favourite poets - a famous philanderer who apparently sought the ussr kremlin 's favours - produced a now famous poem called `` the message '' . its praise of uncle joe might grind the average set of teeth down to the gum ; it included the following : `` a new light shone on the world ... it is only this sunlight/which for centuries will stay alive . '' and more of the same . undiscovered by the ussr kremlin 's censors for many months , however , charents ( 1897 - 1937 ) had used the first letter of each line to frame a quite different `` message '' , which read : `` o armenian people , your only salvation is in the power of your unity . '' whoops ! like the distant mount ararat , it was a brave , hopeless symbol , as doomed as it was impressive . yeghishe charents was `` disappeared '' by the nkvd ( kgb ) in 1937 after being denounced by the architect alexsandr tamanyan - now hard at work building yerevan 's new stalinist opera house - the moment yeghishe charents ' schoolboy prank was spotted . then alexsandr tamanyan fell from the roof of his still unfinished opera house , and even today armenians - with their arab-like desire to believe in `` заговор '' the plot - ask the obvious questions .
