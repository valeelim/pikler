Optical printer     an optical printer is a device . it can be used to copy rolls of movies . it is made of one or more movie projectors , which are linked to a movie camera . it allows filmmakers to re-photograph one or more strips of movie . the optical printer is used for making special effects for motion pictures or for copying and restoring old movie material . common optical effects include fade outs and fade ins , dissolves , slow motion , fast motion , and matte work . more complicated work needs dozens of elements , all combined into a single scene . ideally , the audience in a theater should not be able to notice any optical printers work , but this is not always the case . for economical reasons , especially in the 1950s , and later in tv series produced on movie , printer work was limited to only the actual parts of a scene needing the effect , so there is a clear change in the image quality when the transition occurs . the first , simple optical printers were constructed in the early 1920s . linwood g. dunn expanded the concept in the 1930s . the development continued well into the 1980s , when the printers were controlled with minicomputers .
