Feedback     feedback is when the effect of a process ( or things that come out of it ) have a connection to its cause ( or things that go in to it ) . sometimes , output from an electronic source affects future input . this can form what is called a `` feedback loop '' . in some cases the output reinforces the input , making it stronger ; this is called `` self-reinforcing '' , `` positive '' , `` runaway '' or `` amplifying '' . in other cases , the output blocks or stops some of the input ; this is called a negative feedback loop . think about a sound system with input from a microphone and output to a loudspeaker . if the sound coming out of the loudspeaker is heard by the microphone , a loop is created , from speaker , to the microphone , through the cord , and back into the speaker . the loop is made up of sound and the electrical energy that the microphone and loudspeaker use to create that sound . if nothing stops the sound and electricity in the loop , it will travel faster and faster , which is why feedback starts out as a low hum and turns into a high squeal very quickly
