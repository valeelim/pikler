Socialist Unity Party of Germany     the socialist unity party of germany ( sed ) ( german : `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' ) was the governing party of east germany from 1949 , when east germany was created , until the elections of 1990. the sed was created in 1946 when the soviet union forced the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) members and the communist party of germany ( kpd ) members who lived in the soviet-occupied parts of germany and berlin . after 1990 , the party reformed itself as the party of democratic socialism ( later in 2005 , the left party.pds ) . it is still somewhat popular in parts the former east german territory , frequently winning seats at state and local elections . in the september 2005 bundestag election the pds was in coalition with wasg ( electoral alternative for labour and social justice ) , which was formed by oskar lafontaine who left the spd . the pds and wasg joined together in 2007. a famous sed poster read : `` to learn from stalin means to learn how to win '' . later , the word `` stalin '' was replaced with `` the ussr '' . when gorbachev was president of the ussr the famous slogan was abandoned , as the sed did not believe there was anything to learn from his ideas about perestroika .
