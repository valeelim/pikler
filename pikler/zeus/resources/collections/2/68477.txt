Japanese dragon     `` for the roller coaster , see tatsu ( roller coaster ) . '' a japanese dragon , also known as is a mythical animal from japan . like other creatures called dragons , the ryū is a big , fantastic animal that looks similar to a serpent , and is related to the chinese `` lóng '' and the korean `` yong '' . like all these asian dragons , it is shown without wings , has legs with claws , and usually lives in the ocean , the clouds , or heavens . japanese dragons do not fly as often as the chinese one , which is the reason why they usually appear much more like serpents . the `` ryū '' in art has only three toes , instead of the `` lóng 's '' five or the `` yong 's '' four . japanese dragons usually live in the sea . this is because japan is an island , and the sea is present in most of its geography . `` ryū '' originated from china and is one of the four creatures from heavens of japanese mythology ( the other three are the phoenix , turtle and tiger ) . it has often been the symbol of the emperor or of a hero . in japanese mythology , one of the first dragons is the yamata-no-orochi , a very big serpent with eight heads and eight tails . the serpent ate girls , and it was killed by susanoo after susanoo tricked the creature into becoming drunk on sake .
