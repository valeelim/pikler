Intrusion     an intrusion is magma ( melted rock ) which cools and becomes solid under the earth 's surface . it occurs when there are lines of weakness such as faults , joints , or bedding planes in the crust . then magma enters these lines of weakness . by contrast , an extrusion is magma which cools into rock above the surface of the crust . both intrusive and extrusive rocks are classed as igneous rocks . the process of forming intrusive rocks may take millions of years . as the rock slowly cools into a solid , the different parts of the magma crystallize into minerals . the crystals are usually larger than in extrusive rocks . many mountain ranges , such as the sierra nevada in california , are formed mostly by intrusive rock . often they are huge granite ( or related rock ) formations . intrusions vary widely , from mountain range sized batholiths to thin vein-like fracture fillings . when exposed by erosion , these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of earth 's surface . large bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the crust are called plutons .
