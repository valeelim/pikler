Southern Ireland     southern ireland was the twenty-six county irish state created by the government of ireland act 1920. this act divided the island of ireland in two , northern ireland ( covering approximately fifteen percent of the island , in the northeast ) and southern ireland ( covering the remaining territory to the south and west ) . both were given bicameral ( two houses ) parliaments and separate governments . the king was represented by the lord lieutenant of ireland , who also acted in northern ireland . southern ireland never existed except on paper . it was set up by law , but the first attempted meeting of its parliament failed because it was short of a `` quorum '' ( the number of members needed to hold a meeting ) . the second sitting was only to confirm the decision of dáil éireann to confirm the anglo-irish treaty , then dissolved it itself . so the british government set up southern ireland but there was never any government to take power . after the treaty was confirmed michael collins , head of dáil éireann 's government became chairman of the provisional government
