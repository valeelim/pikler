William Wordsworth     william wordsworth ( 7 april 1770 â€“ 23 april 1850 ) was an important poet of the romantic age in english literature . many people think that `` the prelude '' , an autobiographical poem of his early years is his masterpiece . wordsworth was england 's poet laureate from 1843 until his death in 1850. wordsworth was born as second of five children in the lake district . after the death of his mother in 1778 , his father sent him to `` hawkshead '' grammar school . in 1783 his father , a lawyer and a solicitor , died . although many aspects of his boyhood were positive , he remembered times of loneliness and anxiety . it took him many years , and much writing , to recover from the death of his parents . wordsworth went to `` st john 's college '' , cambridge in 1787. three years later , in 1790 , he visited revolutionary france and supported the republican movement , although the reign of terror later made him change his mind . ( see prelude book 10 ) the following year , he graduated from cambridge . in november 1791 , wordsworth returned to france and took a walking tour of europe that included the alps and italy . he fell in love with a french woman , annette vallon , who in 1792 gave birth to their child , caroline . because he was poor and there were tensions between britain and france , he returned alone to england the next year . but he supported annette vallon and his daughter as best he could in later life . war between france and britain prevented him from seeing annette and caroline again for several years . it is likely that wordsworth would have been depressed during the 1790s .
