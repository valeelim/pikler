Oviraptor     oviraptor is a genus of dinosaurs from what is today mongolia . `` oviraptor '' was a relatively large-brained dinosaur which cared for its eggs . in 1924 , an `` oviraptor '' fossil was found on top of some eggs , and some thought that it had been eating the eggs . others thought that the fossilized `` oviraptor '' was probably a parent of the eggs in the nest , and not an egg stealer . `` oviraptor '' lived in the upper cretaceous period , about 75 million years ago . only one definite specimen is known ( with associated eggs ) , from mongolia , though a possible second specimen ( also with eggs ) comes from the northeast region of inner mongolia , china . `` oviraptor '' is usually drawn with a distinctive crest , similar to that of the cassowary . however , re-examination of several oviraptorids show that this well-known , tall-crested species may actually belong to a relative of `` oviraptor '' , the genus `` citipati '' . it is likely that `` oviraptor '' did have a crest , but its exact size and shape are unknown due to crushing in the skull of the only recognized specimen .
