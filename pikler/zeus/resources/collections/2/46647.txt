Pension     a pension is a steady income given to someone . if pensions are part of a system of social security , the recipient of the pension is usually retired or disabled . they either have worked a long time during their life , or they are physically unable to do so . a pension is usually paid until a certain date ( or event ) occurs . in the case of social security plans , pensions are usually linked to the life of the person who receives the pension . some pensions define the benefit to the worker based on salary basis , years worked , and a multiplier . an example might be 2 @ 55 final 3 , meaning that the annuity is the highest 3-year average salary times years worked times 2 % ( if age 55 ) . a worker with 30 years service would receive 2*30 or 60 % of their salary . some systems allow a worker to receive more than 100 % salary by various maneuvers to alter the final salary basis . this system defines the contribution , without constraining or promising a certain benefit . for example , a company might contribute 10 % of a worker 's salary to a pension account of the worker 's choice , with final benefit received linked to the performance of the investment chosen .
