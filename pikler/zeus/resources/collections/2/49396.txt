Amelia Earhart     amelia mary earhart ( july 24 , 1897 – july 2 , 1937 ) was an american aviator , one of the first women to fly a plane long distances . she was the first woman to fly a plane by herself across the atlantic ocean . she broke many records and showed how air travel had moved forward . she also wrote books , most of them were about her flights . earhart vanished over the south pacific ocean in july 2 1937 while trying to fly around the world . she was declared dead on january 5 , 1939. many theories stand in place about amelia 's end . some believe she was a spy for the u.s government and was captured by the japanese on gardner island , others say she faked her death . the most plausible though is many researchers believe , which is that the electra ran out of fuel and that earhart and noonan ditched at sea . the `` crash and sink '' theory is often the most widely accepted explanation of earhart ’ s and noonan ’ s fate . however , there is a range of documented , archaeological , and anecdotal evidence supporting the hypothesis that earhart and noonan found gardner island , uninhabited at the time , landed the electra on a flat reef near the wreck of a freighter , and sent sporadic radio messages from there . it has been surmised that earhart and noonan might have survived on nikumaroro for several weeks before succumbing .
