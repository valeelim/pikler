MTR     the mass transit railway or mtr ( in chinese , 香港鐵路有限公司 , literally `` hong kong railway company '' ; or 港鐵 for short ) is the main rapid transit railway system in hong kong . since the mtr service first opened in 1979 , the network has grown to more than 150 stations . built and run by mtr corporation limited , the mtr system is a very popular mode of public transport in hong kong , with around 2.46 million passengers riding each day . hong kong 's growing economy and the quick increase in population created a lot of traffic problems . the hong kong government made a study of these problems . the first line was opened in 1979. the mtr was quickly popular with the people of hong kong , so later they built more lines to cover more ground . people are still deciding how and where to expand the mtr network next . during the 1960s , the government of hong kong thought they need to accommodate increasing road traffic that growing hong kong 's economy would bring . british transport consultants freeman , fox , wilbur smith & associates were appointed to study the transport system of hong kong . the consultants released the `` hong kong mass transport study '' in september 1967 , which proposed the construction of a mass transport underground railway system in hong kong .
