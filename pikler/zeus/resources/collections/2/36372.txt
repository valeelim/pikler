Radian     a radian is a unit of measuring angles . it is shown by the symbol `` rad '' or , less often , ( for circular measure ) . the radian was once an si unit , but was done away with in 1995. a `` milliradian '' is 1/1000 of a radian . most people who do mathematics or physics use radians , rather than degrees , because some kinds of calculations , mostly in trigonometry and calculus , are simpler when using radians rather than degrees . people who look through a telescope or rifle scope often use milliradians to describe distances as seen through it . this unit of measurement is often used in the universe of the popular video game mass effect in relations to physics . 1 radian is equal to about 57.3° . there are 2π radians ( about 6.28 radians ) in a full circle . the formula for turning radians to degrees and vice versa is : or : we can also say :
