Voltmeter     a voltmeter is an instrument used to measure voltage . for instance , a voltmeter can be used to see if there is more electricity left in a battery . the creation of voltmeters became possible when hans oersted invented the most simple voltmeter in 1819. the voltmeter can be connected by joining two wires to where the voltage is . one wire is the positive one , and the other the negative . with some voltmeters , one `` must '' make sure that the wires are connected to the right spots : the positive connection on the voltmeter to the more positive `` part '' of the voltage source , and the negative to the more negative `` part '' . this way , the voltmeter is parallel to the electrical circuit . one should also be careful about handling the connection : if there is a high voltage ( many volts ) , one can get hurt or even killed by touching the metal connections with the voltage directly . when the connections are made , the voltmeter shows the voltage . as there is no direct way to access the voltage , voltmeters are designed as special sort of ammeter which can calculate the voltage by assessing the electrical current and applying ohm 's law .
