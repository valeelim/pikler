Vector space     a vector space is a concept from mathematics . a vector space is a collection of mathematical objects called vectors . two operations are defined : addition of two vectors and multiplication of a vector with a scalar ( multiplication results in scaling ) . more formally , a vector space is a special combination of a group and a field . the elements of the group are called vectors and the elements of the field are called scalars . these `` vectors '' do not have to be vectors in the simplest sense . for example , they could be functions , matrices or simply numbers . so long as they obey the axioms of a vector space , we can think of them as vectors and the theorems of linear algebra will apply to them . often , for example in euclidean space , a vector can be represented graphically with an arrow that has a tail and a head . we normally then think of addition as the tail of one vector being placed at the same point as the head of the other vector . the sum vector is the one whose tail is the tail of the first vector and whose head is the head of the second . multiplication means that one vector is made bigger or smaller .
