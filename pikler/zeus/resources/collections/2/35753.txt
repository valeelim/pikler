Euler's identity    euler 's identity euler 's identity , sometimes called euler 's equation , is this equation : formula_1 - formula_2 , pi - formula_3 - formula_4 , euler 's number - formula_5 - formula_6 , imaginary unit formula_7 euler 's identity is named after the swiss mathematician leonard euler . it is not clear that he invented it himself . respondents to a `` physics world '' poll called the identity `` the most profound mathematical statement ever written '' , `` uncanny and sublime '' , `` filled with cosmic beauty '' and `` mind-blowing '' . many equations can be written as a series of terms added together . this is called a taylor series the exponential function formula_8 can be written as the taylor series formula_9 as well , sine can be written as formula_10 and cosine as formula_11 here , we see a pattern take form . formula_12 seems to be a sum of sine and cosine 's taylor series , except with all of the signs changed to positive . the identity we are actually proving is formula_13 . so , on the left side is formula_14 , whose taylor series is formula_15
