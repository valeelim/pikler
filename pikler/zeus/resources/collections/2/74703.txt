General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon     the f-16 fighting falcon ( also called the viper ) is an american light fighter . it is made to do many things , including destroying things on the ground and in the air . it can carry air missiles , ground missiles , and bombs . it first flew in 1974 , and was introduced in service in 1978. it is still in the american air force and many other airforces , and has been upgraded many times since it was first used . the fighting falcon was built as a fighter aircraft that would fight other aircraft in the air . it could turn very quickly , so it could get behind the enemy aircraft and shoot it down with missiles and guns . over time , the aircraft proved so good that it was also made to carry bombs that it could drop to destroy things on the ground . today , the most advanced fighting falcons have a lot of lumps and bumps in which all the upgraded and added electronics are housed . what started as a cheap light-weight fighter aircraft is today a true multi-role aircraft .
