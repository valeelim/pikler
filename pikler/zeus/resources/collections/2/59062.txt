Stevens' power law    stevens ' power law stevens ' power law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel . most people think that it describes a wider range of sensations than weber-fechner law . but critics argue that the validity of the law is not sure . the theory is named after psychophysicist stanley smith stevens ( 1906â€“1973 ) . although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th century researchers , stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957. the general form of the law is where formula_2 is the magnitude of the physical stimulus , formula_3 is the psychophysical function capturing sensation ( the subjective size of the stimulus ) , formula_4 is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and formula_5 is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used . the table to the right lists the exponents reported by stevens . references .
