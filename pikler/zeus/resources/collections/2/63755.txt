International Date Line     the international date line ( idl ) , also known as just the date line , is an imaginary line on the surface of the earth , going from north to south in the pacific ocean . the date becomes one day later as one travels across it in western direction , and one day earlier as one travels across it in eastern direction . the reason for this effect is that the countries on the eastern side of the international date line , ( in or outside eastern asia ) have the time zone 10–12 hours more than greenwich . and the countries on western side of it ( alaska/hawaii and other areas ) have the time zone 9–12 hours less than greenwich . so when travelling across the line , one 's watch has to be adjusted 20–24 hours , depending on the time zones . for example , new zealand is twelve hours ahead of greenwich mean time while hawaii is ten hours behind greenwich mean time . when travelling from new zealand to hawaii the clocks must be switched 22 hours backwards , about one day . international date line follows the meridian of 180° longitude down the middle of the pacific ocean for some time . so that it does not cross nations , it passes around the far east of russia and other archipelagos in the pacific .
