Tendon     a tendon ( or sinew ) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone . it is built to withstand tension . tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another . tendons and muscles work together . they can only create a pulling force . the beginning of a tendon is where it connects to a muscle . collagen fibers from the inside of the muscle are the same as those of the tendon . a tendon inserts into bone at an enthesis . at this point , the collagen fibers are changed into bone tissue . tendons can not create any pulling force of their own . the tendons transfer the movement of muscles . they can create an elastic force if stretched . tendons are part of the human body often connected to joints .
