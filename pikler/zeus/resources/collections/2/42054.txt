Monastery     monasteries are places where monks live . although the word `` monastery '' is sometimes used for a place where nuns live , nuns usually live in a convent or nunnery . the word abbey ( from the syriac word ' : `` father '' ) is also used for a christian monastery or convent . the monk in charge of an abbey is called an abbot ; the nun in charge of an abbey is an abbess . several religions have a system of monasteries . christian monasteries have a chapel for the monks to worship . monks are not allowed to marry ( celibacy ) . they are also not allowed to own anything . everything they use , including their clothes , belongs to the monastery . during the middle ages after the roman empire was defeated , monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed . some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived . the monks who live there live very isolated lives , growing their own food and looking after one another . other monasteries were in or near towns . monks do a lot of work in the community , including as teaching , medical care or telling people about god . few monks live isolated lives nowadays .
