Basil     basil ( `` ocimum basilicum '' ) ( or ) is a plant of the family lamiaceae . it is also known as sweet basil or tulsi . it is a tender low-growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm , tropical climates . basil is originally native to india and other tropical regions of asia . it has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years . it is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world . some of them are italian , thai , vietnamese and laotian cuisines . it grows to between 30–60 cm tall . it has light green , silky leaves 3–5 cm long and 1–3 cm broad . the leaves are opposite each other . the flowers are quite big . they are white in color and arranged as a spike . the plant tastes somewhat like anise , with a strong , pungent , sweet smell . basil is very sensitive to cold . it is best grown in hot , dry conditions . while most common varieties are treated as annuals , some are perennial , including african blue and holy thai basil . the word `` basil '' comes from the greek βασιλεύς ( `` basileus '' ) , meaning `` royal '' . this is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where st. constantine and helen discovered the holy cross . the `` oxford english dictionary '' quotes speculations that basil may have been used in `` some royal unguent , bath , or medicine '' . basil is still considered the `` king of herbs '' by many cookery authors . an alternative etymology has `` basil '' coming from the latin word `` basilicus '' , meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk , but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from greece .
