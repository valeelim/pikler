Pterosaur     pterosaurs were flying reptiles which lived in the mesozoic era at the same time as the dinosaurs . most pterosaurs were quite small , but in the upper cretaceous some grew larger than any other flying animals . the pterosaur `` quetzalcoatlus '' had a wing-span of up to 12 metres ( ~40 feet ) . the first fossils occur in the upper triassic , and the group continues until the k/t extinction event at the end of the cretaceous ( 220 to 65.5 million years ago ) . pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight . their wings were made from a flap of skin between their bodies and a big fourth finger ( sometimes called the `` wing finger '' ) . the pterosaurs fall into two groups . the earlier rhamphorhynchoids ( e.g . `` rhamphorhynchus '' ) had long tails and toothed jaws ; the pterodactyloids ( e.g . `` pterodactylus '' ) had short tails , and many had beaks with no teeth . the first pterosaur fossil was discovered in the late jurassic solnhofen limestone in germany in 1784. this was exactly the same place as `` archaeopteryx '' was found . georges cuvier first suggested that pterosaurs were flying creatures in 1801. since the first pterosaur fossil was found , twenty-nine species of pterosaurs have been found in those deposits alone . a famous early uk find was an example of `` dimorphodon '' by mary anning , in 1828 at lyme regis , dorset , england . the name pterosauria was coined in 1834 .
