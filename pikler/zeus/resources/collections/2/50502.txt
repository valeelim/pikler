Changeling     in stories ( folklore ) , a changeling is the child of a troll , elf , or fairy that has been left in the place of a human child . the stolen human child then lives with the troll family . a changeling is like a human baby but ugly , always hungry , and with a bad temper . sometimes the changelings are much wiser than a human baby would be . it is thought that changeling stories came from actual events . a family who had a handicapped or sick child may have traded their sick child for a healthier , better-looking child . folklore says that it might be possible for parents to figure out that their child has been replaced with a changeling . if they discovered the changeling quickly enough , they could get their human child back . one way to get the child back was to put the changeling in an oven . another way was to put the changeling in a forest so that the troll could take its child back . sometimes children died in the oven or forest .
