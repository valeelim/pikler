Lyrics     lyrics are the words to a song . a person who writes lyrics is called a lyricist . the lyrics of a song will usually have a meaning . some times the meaning is easy to find but other times it can be very difficult to know what the lyrics mean . some lyrics are so strange that it is nearly impossible to understand them . in such cases , people tend to look more at the form , articulation , meter , and symmetries of the lyrics instead of looking at their meaning . there are many websites that have the lyrics to songs . this may be a bad thing since many web sites include copyrighted lyrics without permission from the copyright holder . the united states music publishers ' association ( mpa ) , which represents sheet music companies , created a campaign against such sites in december 2005. mpa president lauren keiser said that the sites are `` completely illegal '' and that he wanted to see some site operators put in prison . `` lyric '' is from the greek ; a lyric was originally a song sung with a lyre . a lyric poem is one that expresses a subjective , personal point of view .
