Firewall (networking)    firewall ( networking ) outside of computer security , a `` firewall '' is simply a wall built to stop ( or slow down ) the spread of a fire . in terms of computer security , a firewall is a piece of software . this software monitors the network traffic . a firewall has a set of rules which are applied to each packet . the rules decide if a packet can pass , or whether it is discarded . usually a firewall is placed between a network that is trusted , and one that is less trusted . when a large network needs to be protected , the firewall software often runs on a computer that does nothing else . a firewall protects one part of the network against unauthorized access data travels on the internet in small pieces ; these are called packets . each packet has certain metadata attached , like where it is coming from , and where it should be sent to . the easiest thing to do is to look at the metadata . based on rules , certain packets are then dropped or rejected . all firewalls can do this . it is done at the network layer .
