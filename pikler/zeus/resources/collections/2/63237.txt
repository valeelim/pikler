King (chess)    king ( chess ) the king is the most valuable chess piece in a game of chess . it can move left , right , up , down or diagonally . it can only move one square at a time . when recording chess games , king is shortened to k. the object of the game is to checkmate ( capture the king ) . if a player 's king is attacked by an opponent 's piece , it is called check . the player with the attacked king must move so that the king is no longer in check . if the king can not do this , it is in checkmate , and that side loses the game . with a rook , the king may make a special move called 'castling ' . this is when the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks and then the rook is placed on the other side of the king . castling consists of moving the king two squares on its first rank toward either one of the first rooks , then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed . castling is only allowed when the king nor the castling rook has moved already , when no squares between them are occupied , when the king is not in check , and when the king will not move across or end its movement on a square that puts the king in check .
