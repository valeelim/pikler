Trial and error     trial and error is a primitive method of solving problems . it is characterised by repeated , varied attempts which are continued until success , or until the agent stops trying . it is an unsystematic method , which does not employ insight , theory or organised methodology . according to w.h . thorpe , the term was devised by c. lloyd morgan after trying out similar phrases `` trial and failure '' and `` trial and practice '' . under morgan 's canon , animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way . where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes , it might be explained by trial and error learning . an example is the skilful way in which his terrier tony opened the garden gate , easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour . lloyd morgan , however , had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response , and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it . edward thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the laboratory . in his famous experiment , a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning . he plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial . thorndike 's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results , which was later refined and extended by b.f. skinner 's operant conditioning .
