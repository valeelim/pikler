Melisma     in music , a melisma is the technique of singing one syllable to a lot of notes . they are often called vocal runs or simply runs . music which uses melismas can be called melismatic . in western music melismas are often used in operas or any other music which is written for the singer to show off the voice . melismatic music is the opposite of music where each syllable has its own note . in the `` alleluia chorus '' from handel 's `` messiah '' each syllable of the word `` alleluya '' has its own note . but in other parts of the `` messiah '' there are often melismas , e.g . in `` thus saith the lord '' the word `` shake '' ( `` and i will shake the heavens and the earth '' ) is set to a run of 25 fast notes . this example can also be described as `` word painting '' . handel uses the melisma to make it sound like someone shaking something . melismas are used a lot in music from many different cultures .
