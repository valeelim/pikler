Bergstraße Route     bergstraße ( `` mountain road '' ) is the name of a mountain route , and the area around it , which stretches across the western edge of the odenwald in southern hesse and northern baden-württemberg , germany . the name `` bergstraße '' also refers to the district kreis bergstraße , the independent wine-growing region of hessische bergstraße and the badische bergstraße in the baden wine-growing area . the route goes almost straight from north to south at the spot where the rhine lowlands meet the western edge of the odenwald . the name comes from the road 's route along the foot of the mountains , the rhine lowlands once being too damp to build a road there . the route mostly follows the modern b3 road . it begins in darmstadt and , after passing through eberstadt , splits into the `` old bergstraße '' and the `` new bergstraße '' , which goes somewhat farther to the west . the two routes meet again at zwingenberg . in weinheim-lützelsachsen the route splits into an old and a new bergstraße again . the new one passes west of the old route as far as heidelberg-handschuhsheim , where the two meet once more . the route carrying on after the neckar from heidelberg to wiesloch is still usually known as the bergstraße , even though the type of country and climate typical of the bergstraße is no longer as clear .
