Irish Potato Famine     the great famine or the great hunger ( ) is the name given to the famine in ireland between 1845 and 1852. outside ireland , it is usually called the irish potato famine . the famine was caused by `` the potato blight '' , a fungus-like organism which quickly destroyed the potatoes in ireland , and throughout europe . the effect was particularly severe in ireland because potatoes were the main source of food for most irish people at the time . it is believed that between 500,000 and more than one million people died in the three years from 1846 to 1849 because of hunger or disease . another million became refugees because of the famine . many people who left ireland moved to great britain , the united states , canada and australia . in ireland this time is referred to as `` the starvation '' . the potato was the only crop affected , yet ireland continued to produce corn , wheat , barley , and beef . however , the mostly english landlords made a bigger profit by selling these food products elsewhere .
