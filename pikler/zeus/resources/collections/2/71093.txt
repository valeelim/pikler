DNA replication     dna replication is the process of copying a double-stranded dna molecule . both strands serve as templates for the reproduction of the opposite strand . the process is sometimes called `` semi-conservative replication '' because the daughter dna from the original parent strand contains half of the original and half of the newly synthesized dna . this process occurs in all life forms with dna . there are some differences in the control of dna replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms . in a cell , dna replication begins at specific places in the genome , called `` origins '' . as the dna unwinds at the origin , the synthesis of new strands forms at a `` replication fork '' . in addition to dna polymerase , other enzymes at the fork help to start and continue the dna synthesis . dna polymerases are a family of enzymes that carry out all forms of dna replication . however , a dna polymerase can only extend an existing dna strand paired with a template strand ; it can not begin the synthesis of a new strand . to begin synthesis , a short fragment of dna or rna , called a 'primer ' , is created and paired with the template dna strand .
