Coelophysis     coelophysis was a small fast running carnivorous dinosaur . it is one of the earliest known genera of dinosaur . `` coelophysis '' was found in upper triassic strata dated to about 200 million years ago ( mya ) . it lived in what is now the southwestern united states . similar dinosaurs are found all over the world at that time . `` coelophysis '' walked on two legs ( as did all theropods ) . it was no more than about three feet ( 1 meter ) tall at the hips but because of a long tail could be almost 10 feet ( 3 meters ) long . there is some evidence that these animals hunted in packs , from the large numbers found together at the ghost ranch fossil site in new mexico . two different sizes of this species have been found in the fossil record . at first paleontologists thought that they were two different species , but most now think that this is because `` coelophysis '' males were larger than the females . this trait , known as sexual dimorphism , is often seen today in many animal species . `` coelophysis '' had a long narrow head ( approximately ) , with large , forward-facing eyes that afforded it stereoscopic vision and as a result excellent depth perception . the eyes were supported by bony rings ( `` sclerotic '' rings ) . the complete sclerotic ring of a juvenile `` coelophysis bauri '' was compared to those of reptiles and birds . evidently `` coelophysis '' was a daytime predator which hunted by sight . the study found that its vision was superior to that of most lizards , and ranked with that of modern birds of prey .
