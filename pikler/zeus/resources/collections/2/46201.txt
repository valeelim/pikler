Jurassic     the jurassic is the second geological period in the mesozoic era . it began 201.3 million years ago , and ended 145 million years ago . the jurassic period happened between the triassic and cretaceous periods . during the jurassic period , the climate was hotter and wetter than it is today . carbon dioxide levels and sea levels were also higher than today . the kimmeridge clay of the upper jurassic was laid down in an environment which does not exist on the earth today . much of western europe was covered by a high sea level . the supercontinent pangaea was beginning to break up , causing a narrow atlantic ocean . because of this , the united kingdom was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea , perhaps less than 100 metres deep , with occasional landmasses . this was shallower water than the blue lias of the lower jurassic . it was often low in oxygen , which caused its organic material to decompose , but only partially . the jurassic 's mudstones are organic-rich , and gave rise to most of the north sea oil .
