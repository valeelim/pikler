Broom (shrub)    broom ( shrub ) brooms are a group of evergreen , semi-evergreen , and deciduous shrubs . all the brooms and their relatives ( including `` laburnum '' and `` ulex '' ) grow in europe , north africa and southwest asia . the greatest diversity one can find in the mediterranean region . many brooms ( though not all ) are fire-climax species , adapted to regular stand-replacing fires which kill the above-ground parts of the plants , but create conditions for regrowth from the roots and also for germination of stored seeds in the soil . the most familiar is common broom , that grows in northwestern europe . one can find it in sunny sites , usually on dry , sandy soils . like most brooms , it has apparently leafless stems that in spring and summer are covered with golden-yellow flowers . in late summer , its pea-pod like seed capsules burst open , often with an audible pop , spreading seed from the parent plant . it makes a shrub about 1–3m tall , rarely to 4m . it is also the hardiest broom , tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c .
