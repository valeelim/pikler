William Baillie     captain william baillie ( june 5 , 1723 â€“ december 22 , 1810 ) was an irish military man and artist . baillie went to london at age of 18 to study law , but liked art more . shortly after getting to london , he joined the army . he served at the battle of culloden the battle of minden and retired with the rank of captain . baillie was later made the commissioner of stamps , which he was until 1795. while he continued as an artist , what he is most famous for was his skill repairing and printing etching plates . he worked on plates by many artists , including gerard dou , nicolas poussin , and most notably rembrandt . apparently he got a number of rembrandt 's worn-out plates . the three best known : - the goldweigher : he did a really fine job on this . the prints from it are at least as good as those done personally by rembrandt . - the hundred guilder print ( christ preaching ) : he changed it in a rather bad way . he then cut it up , and sold the pieces separately . - the three trees : the lower portion of this had been destroyed . baillie redid that part of the plate by copying an old print . it is not bad , but does not have the feeling that was in the original rembrandt .
