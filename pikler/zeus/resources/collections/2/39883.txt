Seminal vesicle     the seminal vesicles are a pair of tube-like glands . they are found behind the bladder of males . they make about 70 % of the content of semen ( also called seminal fluid ) . both vesicles are about 5 cm in length , but they are curled up . each gland makes a ball shape on the wall of each vas deferens . there is a tube linking the seminal glands which opens into the vas deferens and prostate gland . from inside to out , the layers making the vesicles are : - mucosa - folded to increase surface area - muscle - connective tissue the seminal vesicles make most of semen , but during ejaculation , most of the ejaculate has sperm rather than semen in it . the use of seminal fluid is not known , since sperm do not move or survive well in semen . some think that it acts as a fluid to stop sperm from another male impregnating the female so that the children of only one male can survive . seminal fluid has proteins , enzymes , fructose , mucus , vitamin c and flavins . the fructose gives sperm energy and 'food ' .
