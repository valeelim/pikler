Galerius     galerius ( gaius galerius valerius maximianus , ~260 â€“ 5 may 311 ) , was roman emperor from 305 to 311. galerius served as a soldier with distinction . he became `` caesar '' in 293 along with constantius chlorus , when the tetrarchy was introduced by diocletian . he married diocletian 's daughter valeria , and took over the care of the illyrian provinces . in 296 , at the beginning of the persian war , he moved from the danube to the euphrates . there his first campaign ended in a defeat by narses , near callinicum , which caused the loss of mesopotamia . diocletian came to antioch , where the official version of events was made clear : galerius was to take all the blame . in antioch , diocletian forced galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperor . the message conveyed was clear : the loss at carrhae was not due to the failings of the empire 's soldiers , but due to the failings of their commander , and galerius ' failures would not be accepted .
