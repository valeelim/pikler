Church-Turing thesis     the church-turing thesis ( also known as church 's thesis , church 's conjecture and turing 's thesis ) is a statement about computers . it says that a very simple kind of computer now named a “ turing machine ” is able to compute all computable functions . the church-turing thesis is linked to gödel 's incompleteness theorems . when a programming language is able to do what a turing machine can do , that language is called turing complete . if a problem is solvable in one such language then it is solvable in all of those .
