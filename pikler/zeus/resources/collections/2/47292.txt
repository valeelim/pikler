Landslide     a landslide includes a wide range of ground movement , such as rock falls , deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows . the biggest reason for a landslide is always that there is a slope and material goes down the slope because of gravity . but other things also contribute to landslides : - erosion by rivers , glaciers , or ocean waves makes slopes too steep - rock and soil slopes made weak through saturation by snowmelt or heavy rains - earthquakes create stresses that make weak slopes fail ( see liquefaction , hope slide ) - volcanic eruptions produce loose ash deposits , heavy rain , and debris flows - vibrations from machinery , traffic , blasting and even thunder may trigger failure of weak slopes - weight from much rain or snow , stockpiling of rock or ore , from waste piles , or from buildings may stress weak slopes to failure and other structures - groundwater pressure making the slope unstable - in shallow soils , the removal of deep-rooted plants that bind the colluvium to bedrock
