Nanometre     the nanometre ( symbol : nm ) is a unit used to measure length in the metric system . it is equal to one billionth of a metre ( ) . the name combines the si prefix `` nano- '' ( from the ancient greek , ' , `` dwarf '' ) with the parent unit name `` metre '' ( from greek , ' , `` unit of measurement '' ) . it can be written in scientific notation as 1×10 m. the nanometre is often used to express very tiny dimensions , such as measuring atoms . the nanometre is also commonly used to measure the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the part of the spectrum that can be seen by humans . visible light ranges from around 400 to 800 nm . the nanometre was formerly called the millimicrometre ( or the millimicron ) . this is because it is 1/1000 of a micrometre , and was written with the symbol mµ ( or sometimes µµ ) . related pages . - angstrom - nanotechnology
