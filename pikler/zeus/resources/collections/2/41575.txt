Habitat     a habitat is an area that is lived in by a particular species of animal , plant , or other type of organism . it is the natural environment in which an organism lives , or the physical environment that surrounds a population . most animals live in one type of environment because they are best suited to it . we say they are 'adapted to this environment ' . for example , animals such as frogs , newts , and ducks have webbed feet to help them swim in the water . there are many different types of habitats and many different kinds of adaptations to fit into each . if the habitat changes , it may no longer be suitable for the animals and plants that live there . because of the complex links between the plants and animals this can have many different effects . climate change is making some habitats warmer , and so many animal species are moving to cooler areas . however some species are not able to move and the populations are getting smaller . scientists think that 10 % of species may become extinct because of these changes . other habitats have been cleared to make them into farm land . in australia for example , 80 % of the eucalypt forests have been cleared for farming over the last 210 years . this is threatening the survival of forest animals such as the koala .
