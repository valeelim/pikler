Embalming     embalming is the act of preserving a dead body , so it will not decompose . if a human body is not embalmed , it will start to decay very quickly . because of this , most bodies are embalmed if they will be on display ( for example , lying in state ) for a funeral . embalming is similar to mummification , which many ancient peoples did to dead bodies . embalming is different from taxidermy , where only the skin is preserved . the oldest mummified corpses that have ever been found were mummified around 5000-6000 bce . these corpses are called the chinchorro mummies . these dead bodies were mummified by ancient people who lived in the atacama desert , in what is now chile and peru . the ancient egyptians often mummified dead bodies . they started mummifying corpses as early as 3200 bce . they believed that once a dead body was mummified , the body 's soul could find its way back to the body and begin its journey to the afterlife . ancient cultures from ethiopia , peru , tibet , and southern nigeria also used embalming techniques . so did the guanches , the jivaro indians , the aztecs , the toltecs , and the mayans .
