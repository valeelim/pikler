Columbian Exchange     the columbian exchange , sometimes called the grand exchange , is one of the most important events in history . it was the exchange of goods and ideas from europe , africa , and asia and goods and ideas from the americas . it also spread different diseases . it started in 1492 when christopher columbus arrived in the west indies ( north america ) . this exchange of plants and animals changed european , american , african , and asian ways of life . foods that had never been seen before by people became a major part of what they ate . for example , before 1492 , no potatoes were grown outside of south america . by the 1840s , ireland was so dependent on the potato that a diseased crop led to the devastating irish potato famine . the first european import to the americas , the horse , changed the lives of many native american tribes on the great plains , letting them to change to a nomadic lifestyle based on hunting bison on horseback . italy became famous for its tomato sauce , made from new world tomatoes , while coffee from africa and sugarcane from asia became the main crops of very large latin american plantations . also the chili and paprika from south america was introduced in india by the portuguese and it is today an important part of indian cuisine .
