Programme music     programme music ( or `` program music '' in us english ) is music for instruments which describes something or tells a story . it is the opposite of `` absolute music '' which is not trying to describe anything , just the sound of the piece . programme music was very popular in the 19th century although some programme music was written earlier . some composers in the renaissance and baroque periods wrote music which described battles . antonio vivaldi wrote a very famous set of four concertos for violin and strings called `` the four seasons '' . each of the movements describe things happening during the year 's seasons , e.g . the birds singing in the spring , snowy winter days , etc . at the start of the 1800s , beethoven wrote a pastoral symphony , symphony no . 6 `` pastorale '' , which describes the peaceful life in the countryside . this way of making music describe things became very popular with romantic composers . mendelssohn wrote `` concert overtures '' which had nothing to do with an opera but were simply short pieces of music for orchestra which told a story . `` hebrides overture '' , for example , describes the feel of the sea lapping into fingal 's cave in the scottish inner hebrides .
