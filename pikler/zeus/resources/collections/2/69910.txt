Multimeter     a multimeter or a multitester is an electronic measuring tool that is a combination of several tools in one unit . it usually includes an ammeter , voltmeter , and ohmmeter . digital multimeters are sometimes called dmm too . modern multimeters can be used to measure electrical quantities other than current , resistance and voltage . for example , they can be used to measure frequency , capacitance , transistors hfe and temperature . the multimeter can make many tests , so it is often called `` multitester '' . when measuring resistance it acts as an ohmmeter , showing ohms . for volts it would be a voltmeter . sometimes it is called a mixture of things like volt/ohm meter or vom . most meters can measure volts , amps , and resistance . the multimeter can be used to measure the voltage of a battery . it can also be used for measuring the voltage across two points in a circuit . the voltmeter is placed in parallel between the positive and negative terminals of the battery . it can also be used to measure resistance and amps hence the name of some meters `` voltmeter , ohmmeter , and amperage '' .
