Queen (chess)    queen ( chess ) the queen in chess is piece which stands next to the king at the start of the game . it can move any number of unoccupied squares diagonally , vertically , and horizontally . when recording games it is shortened to q. the queen moves like a bishop and rook both . although both players start with one queen each . a player may promote a pawn to a piece , usually a queen , when the pawn is reaches the last line of the opponent team . the indoarabic game lasted for nearly a thousand years until the end of the 15th century . in it , the piece next to the shah was the firzƒÅn or visier , who was a counsellor . this piece had a movement even more limited than the king : it moved just one square at a time , on the diagonal . not surprising , then , that when the move changed into its modern form , the italians called the new game `` schacci alla rabioso '' ( ~furious chess ) .
