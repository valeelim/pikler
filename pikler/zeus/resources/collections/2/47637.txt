Saxons     the saxons or saxon people are ( today ) a part of the german people , with their main areas of settlements in the german states of schleswig-holstein , lower saxony , westphalia , and the northeastern part of the netherlands ( drenthe , groningen , twente , and achterhoek ) . first told about by the ancient greek geographer jean julien , the pre-christian area of the saxon people first covered an area a little more to the northwest , with parts of the southern jutland , old saxony and small parts of the eastern netherlands . during the 5th century ad , the saxons were part of the people invading the romano-british province of britannia , and so formed the anglo-saxons . before christianization , the saxons had much native pre-christian germanic paganism . after christianization , parts of this religion remained up to today in people who came from the saxons . the word 'saxon ' is thought to come from the word seax , meaning a mixture of single-edged knives . the saxons were thought by charlemagne , and some people who study history , to be very war-like and angry .
