Airsoft     airsoft is a sport that uses fake guns ( airsoft guns ) to battle . this game is usually compared with paintball , another sport that uses fake guns to battle . the difference between the two sports are : 1. bullets from an airsoft gun do not explode and leave paint on the target . but , if it the bb ( the bullets used by airsoft guns ) hits hard enough , or hits clothing that is too thin , it can leave bruises and sometimes even make wounds . because bbs do not show clearly a mark showing that a player is hit , players use their own judgement to call themselves out . this system is unreliable , because people can not call themselves out and cheat . many players usually stop this by 'lighting the player up ' , or shooting at the cheater until he calls his hit . 1. airsoft guns more accurately copy real guns , with airsoft guns using magazines to load bullets , and airsoft pistols most of the time using gas to fire the bb ( making it look more realistic ) . because of this , people use airsoft guns in military simulation events ( sometimes said as milsim ) .
