Rust     rust is a type of corrosion . it happens to iron and its alloys when it is exposed to air or water for a long time . rust slowly decomposes iron into other chemicals , because of a reaction with the oxygen molecules . both air and water are needed for rust . almost all metals corrode but they can be protected by covering with paint , a coating of oil or grease or even plastic . sacrificial protection or industrial galvanizing can also work . alloys ( mixes of metals ) such as stainless steel , rust more slowly than pure iron . when iron rusts , it becomes red or brown , and the metal eventually decays . rust appears on metal if it is left outside in the damp air . for example rust occurs mostly in cracks of alloys or metals . rain water can enter the cracks and stay in the cracks , and cause the metal to corrode . eventually it becomes rust . iron is not strong after it rusts . some metals , such as aluminium , titanium , and stainless steel form a very thin coating of tough corrosion on the metal . the metal can not continue corroding because the coating isolates the rest of the metal from the source of oxygen . this is why aluminium keeps its shine . it also makes aluminium seem very unreactive , even though it can react with water .
