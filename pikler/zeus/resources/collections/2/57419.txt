Caecilian     the caecilians are an order ( gymnophiona or apoda ) of amphibians . most of them look like either earthworms or snakes . they burrow in the ground . for this reason , they are the least explored order of amphibians . caecilians have no limbs . for this reason , the smaller species look like worms , while the larger species with lengths up to 1.5 m look similar to snakes . the tail is short and the cloaca is near the end of the body . their skin is smooth and usually dark in colour . some species have colorful skins , though . inside the skin are calcite scales . due to their underground life the eyes are small . skin often covers them , to protect them . this has led to the idea that they are blind , which is not the case . because of the skin cover , their `` seeing '' is limited to simple dark-light perception . they can tell the difference between dark and light . all caecilians have two tentacles at their head . the tentacles are probably used for a second smelling capability in addition to the normal sense of smell based in the nose .
