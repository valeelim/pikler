John Batman     john batman ( 21 january 1801 â€“ 5 may 1839 ) was an australian farmer and businessman who was one of the first white people to live in melbourne . batman was born in rosehill , parramatta ( part of sydney ) , and spent time in tasmania ( then called van diemen 's land ) . in tasmania he started farming on land the government gave him . he brought more land . during this time , he was involved in conflicts with the tasmanian aborigines . in december 1825 , or early 1826 , batman captured the notorious bushranger ( a kind of robber ) , matthew brady . batman asked to be given land in the westernport area of victoria , but the government rejected him . so , in 1835 , as a leading member of the port phillip association he sailed for the mainland of australia in the schooner `` rebecca '' and explored much of port phillip bay . batman made an agreement , now known as batman 's treaty , with some local aborigines to rent their land in return for things like knives and flour every year . probably the wurundjeri people did not understand the agreement . in any case , the governor of new south wales said the agreement was not legal the land was owned by the government rather than the aborigines .
