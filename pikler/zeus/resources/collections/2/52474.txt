Feudalism     feudalism is a system of land ownership and duties . it was used in the middle ages . with feudalism , all the land in a kingdom was the king 's . however , the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him . these presents of land were called manors . under feudalism , taxes were not paid with money . they were paid in products and services . presents and taxes had to be given to the lords by their vassals . at harvest time , the vassals gave shares of their crops to the lords . the vassals would grind their grain at the noble 's grainaries . they would give part of the grain to their lord . when animals were killed for food , part of the meat was given to the lords . the lords promised to give protection , peace , and safety to their vassals . manors were completely owned by the nobles . they were given from one generation to another . the noble 's firstborn son took it all when his father died . each manor had its own pasture lands , mill , wine press , church , and village . a manor had to let many people live there . lords gave their servants food and a place to sleep , but they did not pay their servants money .
