Deuterium     deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen , the first element . deuterium has one proton and one neutron . hydrogen does not have a neutron , only a proton . another isotope of hydrogen , tritium , has two neutrons . the chemical symbol for deuterium is h but d is also used often . two deuterium atoms combined with an oxygen atom is sometimes called `` heavy water . '' this is because it is like water ( ho ) , but heavier because deuterium has one more neutron in its nucleus . heavy water is sometimes used in nuclear reactors . it is also used as a solvent for nmr spectroscopy . this is because it will dissolve the sample , like normal water , but it will not be detected by the magnet in an h nmr .
