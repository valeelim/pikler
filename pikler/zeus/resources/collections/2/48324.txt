Spiny lobster     spiny lobsters , also known as rock lobsters are a family ( palinuridae ) of about 45 species of crustaceans , in the decapoda reptantia . spiny lobsters are also called `` crayfish '' , `` sea crayfish '' or `` crawfish '' . although they superficially resemble true lobsters in terms of overall shape , and that they also have a hard carapace and exoskeleton , the two groups are not closely related . spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long , thick , spiny antennae , and by their complete lack of claws ( `` chelae '' ) ; true lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs , with the first being particularly enlarged . like true lobsters , however , spiny lobsters are edible and are an economically significant food source ; they are the biggest food export of the bahamas . spiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas , including the caribbean and the mediterranean sea , but are particularly common in australasia , where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish ( `` jasus novaehollandiae '' and `` jasus edwardsii '' ) , and south africa ( `` jasus lalandii '' ) . a new species , `` palinurus barbarae '' was described in 2006 .
