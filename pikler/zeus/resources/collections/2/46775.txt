Song Dynasty     the song dynasty ruled in china from 960â€“1279 . it started the reunification of china for the first time since the fall of the tang dynasty in 907. the years in between , known as the period of five dynasties and ten kingdoms , were a time of division between north and south , and of rapidly changing administrations . in 960 , a general of the later zhou dynasty named zhao kuangyin ( the later emperor taizu of song ) overthrew the emperor through a mutiny and established the song dynasty . although it unified china , its army was weak and defeated in the wars against the liao dynasty and western xia . soon after the death of emperor taizu , the empire faced many economic and military problems . in 1127 , the manchu clans led by the jin dynasty emperors destroyed the liao dynasty , invaded song , and captured the emperor , princes , and ministers . a prince at southern china was lucky to be the only one who was not taken by the manchus , and after the invasion of northern china he succeeded the throne at hangzhou . because of this , historians named the song that was before the invasion named northern song , and the one after the invasion named southern song . southern song made peace with the manchus and existed until kublai khan of the mongols invaded the entire southern china in 1279 .
