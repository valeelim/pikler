Internal energy     in thermodynamics , the internal energy of a thermodynamic system , or a body with well-defined boundaries , denoted by '' u '' , or sometimes '' e '' , is the total of the kinetic energy due to the motion of molecules ( translational , rotational , vibrational ) and the potential energy associated with the vibrational and electric energy of atoms within molecules or crystals . it includes the energy in all the chemical bonds , and the energy of the free , conduction electrons in metals . the internal energy is a thermodynamic potential and for a closed thermodynamic system held at constant entropy , it will be minimized . one can also calculate the internal energy of electromagnetic or blackbody radiation . it is a state function of a system , an extensive quantity . the si unit of energy is the joule although other historical , conventional units are still in use , such as the ( small and large ) calorie for heat . ( calories that are on classic food labels are actually kilo-calories . ) `` internal '' energy does not include the translational or rotational kinetic energy of a body `` as a whole '' . it also does not include the relativistic mass-energy equivalent `` e '' = '' mc '' . it excludes any potential energy a body may have because of its location in external gravitational or electrostatic field , although the potential energy it has in a field due to an induced electric or magnetic dipole moment does count , as does the energy of deformation of solids ( stress-strain ) .
