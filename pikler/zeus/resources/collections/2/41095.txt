( the triumvirates were groups of three men who had much power ) the end of the republic is often said to be when gaius julius caesar was appointed as dictator ( single ruler ) by the roman senate . this happened after a series of civil wars that lasted from about 49 bc to the year 44 bc . some people say the republic ended with the naval battle of actium between marcus antonius and octavian . they both had been in the second triumvirate . it was fought on september 2 , 31 bc . octavian won . later on , he was proclaimed roman emperor . the end date could also be when octavian was given the title of the first `` augustus '' . this was on january 16 , 27 bc .
