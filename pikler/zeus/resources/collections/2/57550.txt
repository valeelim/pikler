Osiris     in egyptian mythology , osiris is the god of life , death , the flooding of the nile and the afterlife . he was the brother and husband of isis . they had a son named horus . osiris was murdered by his brother set because osiris was pharaoh , which seth wanted to be . osiris was killed when set tricked him into getting into a box , then poured lead onto the box to close it so osiris could not get out of it . however , isis brought osiris back to life for one night . after horus was old enough , he defeated seth and became the pharaoh . osiris ' mother was goddess nut , father geb , sister nephthys , and sister and wife isis . he was around to protect the egyptians from the underworld . by the hellenic era , greek awareness of osiris had grown , and attempts had been made to merge greek philosophy , such as platonism , and the cult of osiris ( especially the myth of his resurrection ) , resulting in a new mystery religion . gradually , this became more popular , and was exported to other parts of the greek sphere of influence . however , these mystery religions valued the change in wisdom , personality , and knowledge of truth , rather than the exact details of the accepted myths on which their teachings were overlayed . thus in each region that it was exported to , the myth was changed to be about a similar local god , resulting in a series of gods , who had originally been quite distinct , but who were now synonymous with osiris . these gods became known as osiris-dionysus .
