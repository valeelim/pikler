Compression     compression could mean : - gas compression , raising the pressure and reducing the volume of gases - physical compression , the result of the subjection of a material to compressive stress - compression arch suspended-deck bridge , a compression arch rises above the deck - compression , the part of a longitudinal wave where particles are the closest together - compressibility , a measure of volume change resulting from pressure - compression ( geology ) , a system of forces that tend to decrease the volume of or shorten rocks . - compression ratio , a number that predicts the performance of any internal-combustion engine - data compression , encoding information using fewer bits - image compression - audio data compression - video compression - compression artifact , noticeable defects in audio or video that has been compressed - bandwidth compression , in telecommunications - gain compression in electronic amplifiers , which is a result of device non-linearity - audio level compression , usually artificially introduced gain compression to improve the perceived quality of audio
