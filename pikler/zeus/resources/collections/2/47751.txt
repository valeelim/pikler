Visa     a visa ( short for the latin `` carta visa '' , lit . `` the document having been seen '' ) is a permit given by a country that allows someone to go to that country . a visa is a document that is stamped on a person 's passport by an embassy . it names the kind of visit and says how long the person can stay . sometimes , people need to go through an interview held at the embassy before they get a visa . many countries require foreign visitors to have a valid passport and a visa before they can enter the country , but there are exceptions ( see below for examples of such these ) . visas are associated with the request for permission to enter ( or exit ) a country , and are thus , for some countries , not the same as actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country . some countries , such as some states of the former soviet union , require that their citizens , and sometimes foreign travelers , obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country . until 2004 , foreign students in russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to university there , and had to obtain an exit visa to return home . this policy has since been changed , and foreign students are now issued multiple entry ( and exit ) visas .
