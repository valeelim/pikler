Kanji     kanji is one of the three forms of japanese writing . a kanji is an `` ideogram '' : that is , a kind of simple picture . it is a symbol of an idea such as an object , thing or quality . kanji ideograms ( or “ characters ” ) were taken from chinese characters , and many changed over time . the word “ kanji ” means “ han characters ” ( i.e . “ chinese characters ” ) . there are two other systems used to write in japanese . these systems are called hiragana and katakana ( together they are called “ kana ” ) . they show how a word is pronounced because each character stands for a syllable ( a , ka , sa , ta etc. ) . each kanji could also be written in kana , indeed they are in children ’ s books or books for foreigners learning japanese . japanese can have many homophones for one pronunciation , e.g . `` hana '' can mean “ nose ” or “ flower ” , but the kanji character for each is quite different . the kanji for `` nose '' is 鼻 and the kanji for `` flower '' is 花. however , each kanji character can have several different pronunciations , according to which meaning ( which “ reading ” ) is intended .
