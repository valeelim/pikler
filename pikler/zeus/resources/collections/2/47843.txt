Amplifier     the word amplifier ( sometimes called an amp ) usually refers to an electronic amplifier . electronic amplifiers make a signal from a radio or electric musical instrument ( such as an electric guitar or an electric bass guitar ) louder and stronger . amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers . this includes televisions , radios , computers , and mp3 players , to name a few . devices similar to the electronic amplifier are made in mechanical engineering . the power assisted steering and braking on a motor car utilise mechanical amplifiers to multiply the amount of force applied by the driver . amplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary . typical impedance is 8 ohms . classification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal . example : a-class amplifier takes more current without signal than b-class amplifier but a-class amplifier have smaller distortion . there is also several distortion types . electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes . electronic amplifiers have to be connected to electrical current or a battery to work . once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger , the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it .
