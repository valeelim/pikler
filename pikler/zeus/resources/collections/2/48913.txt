Macroscopic     macroscopic means physical objects that are measurable and can be seen by the naked eye . when one uses macroscopic for abstract objects , one thinks of the world as we see it without any help . lengths scales are called macroscopic if they fall in the range of more or less than 1 mm or up to 1 km . one may use the term `` macroscopic '' also for a `` larger view '' , namely a view only available from a large perspective . a macroscopic position could be considered the `` big picture '' . examples . - a macroscopic view of a ball is just that : a ball . a microscopic view could reveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of cracks and fissures ( as viewed through a microscope ) or , further down in scale , a collection of molecules in the rough shape of a sphere . in physics macroscopy is a relative term . if one looks at a galaxy , a star is microscopic in comparison with the whole galaxy , even if it is many , many orders of magnitude larger than us . macroscopy can also be described as a relation between any two objects in terms of its magnification on a scale of some sort . a macroscopic object is something that we are able to see in plain sight through our own field of vision no matter where we are located . in spacetime light must also come into contact with our eyes and the object we are observing in order for it to be visible .
