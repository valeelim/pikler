Cold front     a cold front is a meteorological word that is used to describe the movement of a cooler air mass into an area of warmer air . the air with greater density moves under the less dense warmer air , lifting it , which can cause a line of showers and thunderstorms , or a squall line to form when there is sufficient moisture . this upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front . on weather maps , the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes pointing in the direction of its movement . cold fronts can also move up to twice as fast as warm fronts .
