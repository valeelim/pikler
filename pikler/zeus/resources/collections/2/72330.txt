Treaty of Warsaw (1970)    treaty of warsaw ( 1970 ) the treaty of warsaw ( ) is a treaty between west germany and the people 's republic of poland . it was signed on december 7 , 1970 and ratified by the german bundestag on may 17 , 1972. in the treaty , both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing border - the oder-neisse line . this was a very sensitive topic at the time as poland was concerned that one day a german government would lay claim to some of the territory germany lost after world war ii . poland took over this territory to replace the parts of east . a lot of that land was east of the curzon line , and poland kept it after the polish-soviet war ( 1919-1921 ) . chancellor willy brandt was heavily criticized by the conservative cdu/csu opposition , which indeed were in favour of such a claim , accusing him of abandoning german interests . the oder-neisse line was reaffirmed by a reunited germany in the german-polish border treaty , signed on 14 november 1990. in the frg at the time this treaty was signed it was not seen as the last word on the border , because article iv stated that previous treaties like the potsdam agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement , so the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between germany and the allies of world war ii as provided for in the potsdam agreement .
