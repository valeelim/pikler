Lighthouse of Alexandria     the lighthouse of alexandria , or the pharos , was a tall tower built between 285 and 247 bce . it was built on the island of pharos in alexandria , egypt to serve as a lighthouse for sailors . the top of the tower had a mirror that reflected sunlight during the day ; a fire was lit at night . the word for `` lighthouse '' in some languages is `` pharos '' or its equivalent legend holds that ptolemy i soter would not allow sostratus to put his name on the tower , but the architect left the following inscription on the base 's walls : σοστρατοσ δεξιφανου κνιδιοσ θεοισ σωτερσιν υπερ των πλωιζομενων < /small > . ( sostratus of cnidus , son of dexiphanes , to the gods protecting those upon the sea . ) these words were hidden under a layer of plaster , on top of which was chiseled another inscription honoring ptolemy the king as builder of the pharos . after centuries the plaster wore away , revealing the name of sostratus . with a height estimated at between 115 and 145 meters ( 384 – 469 ft ) , it was among the tallest man-made structures on earth for many centuries . it was identified as one of the seven wonders of the world by antipater of sidon . it was the third tallest building after the two great pyramids ( of khufu and khafra ) . it was destroyed by earthquakes .
