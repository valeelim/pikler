Cue sports     cue sports are games played with balls on a cloth-covered table that has rubber railings ( called `` cushions '' ) around it to keep the balls on the table . two or more people use sticks ( called cues ) to make one ball ( the cue ball ) hit other balls . in the past , all cue sports were called billiards , but that term has various different meanings in different areas . there are different kinds of cue sports , including : - `` pool '' or `` pocket billiards '' , in which the goal is to use the cue ball to knock other balls into `` pockets '' ( holes cut into the rubber cushions , so that the balls can drop down into nets or a collection tray ) . there are many diffierent pool games , such as `` eight-ball '' , `` nine-ball '' , `` cutthroat '' and `` killer '' . pool is usually played with either nine or fifteen balls ( besides the cue ball ) . - `` carom billiards '' , usually played with three balls , uses a table without pockets . the goal is to use the cue ball to hit one of the other two balls , then hit one or more of the cushions , and finally hit the second other ball . there are several different kinds of carom games , too ; they are different mostly because of how many cushions must be hit .
