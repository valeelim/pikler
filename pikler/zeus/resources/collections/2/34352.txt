Aardwolf     the aardwolf ( `` proteles cristata '' ) is a small , insectivorous mammal , native to east africa and southern africa . its name means `` earth wolf '' in the afrikaans / dutch language . it is also called `` maanhaar jackal '' in afrikaans , or `` civet hyena '' , based on the secretions ( civet ) from their anal glands . the aardwolf is in the same family as the hyenas . unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora , the aardwolf does not hunt large animals , or even eat meat on a regular basis ; instead it eats insects , mainly termites – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night by using its long , sticky tongue to capture them . the aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern africa – these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs . the aardwolf is nocturnal , resting in burrows during the day and coming out at night to eat .
