Alban Berg     alban berg ( born vienna , 9 february 1885 ; died vienna 24 december 1935 ) was an austrian composer . alban berg and anton webern were both pupils of arnold schoenberg . all three composers in their own way changed the style of musical composition in the early 20th century . they grew up at a time when most composers were still writing romantic music , but schoenberg and his pupils started to write atonal music ( music which is not in any key ) and then twelve-tone music in which all 12 notes in an octave are of the same importance . although berg wrote a lot of twelve-tone music he still managed to make it sound quite romantic at times , more so than schoenberg or webern . his most important works are his two operas `` wozzeck '' and `` lulu '' and his `` violin concerto '' . berg was brought up in the centre of vienna . his family had plenty of money , but when berg â€™ s father died in 1900 life became much harder for them . he did not do very well at school . he also had a love affair with a kitchenmaid , with whom he had a daughter .
