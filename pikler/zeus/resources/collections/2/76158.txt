Ca-Al-rich inclusions     ca-al-rich inclusions ( cais ) are centimeter-sized light-coloured calcium and aluminium rich inclusions found in carbonaceous chondrites . cais contains high-temperature minerals and are among the first solids which solidified from the cooling protoplanetary disk . cais were formed at much higher temperatures than the associated chondrules , and may have survived many high-temperature events , whereas most chondrules are the product of a single transient melting event . the isotopic anomalies of cais give valuable clues about the solar system 's formation , suggesting that the solar nebula collapsed shortly after a nearby supernova . radiometric dating shows that the cais formed about 2 million years before the chondrules formed . references . - gilmour j . 2002. the solar system 's first clocks `` science '' 297 , 1658-1659 . - amelin y . `` et al .
