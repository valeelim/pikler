Counties of England     the counties of england are territorial divisions of england for administrative , political and geographical purposes . most current counties have foundations in older divisions such as the anglo-saxon shires , and duchies . the names , boundaries and functions of these divisions have changed considerably over their history . a series of local government reforms from the 19th century onwards has left the exact definition of the term 'county ' ambiguous . the term `` counties of england '' does not , therefore , refer to a unique set of names or boundaries ; in formal use , the type of county relevant to the specific task is explicitly stated e.g . ceremonial county , registration county , historic county or former postal county . the 39 historic , ancient or traditional counties , developed from the 12th to the 16th centuries , though many of the specific areas are much older . they were not used for census reporting since 1841. most of the historic counties continue to form part of the local government structure , often with reformed boundaries .
