Nectar     nectar , in botany , is a liquid made by the flowers of plants . it is sweet because it has sugar in it . plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals . it is made in glands called nectaries . the nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth of the flower . this means the animal trying to get the nectar have to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction . by doing this , the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce . some plants make nectar outside the flower . these plants do it to attract predatory insects . these insects will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects found near the plant . nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from . it is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects , as well as hummingbirds , eat nectar . some plants give of very rich aromas , such as the rocky mountain columbine
