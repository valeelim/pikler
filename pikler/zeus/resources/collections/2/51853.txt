Alphabet (computer science)    alphabet ( computer science ) in computer science , an alphabet is a finite non-empty set . the elements of an alphabet are called the letters or symbols of the alphabet . an example of an alphabet is formula_1 which may be used for morse code or `` { begin , if , else , for , while } '' which may be the keywords of a programming language . the set of natural numbers is not an alphabet because as it is not finite . the alphabet which is used the most in computer science is `` { 0,1 } '' . it is called the binary alphabet because it contains two symbols . an alphabet can be used to make a string ( or word ) . this is a finite sequence of letters from the alphabet . for example , a string of length 5 over `` { 0,1 } '' is `` 01101 '' . the empty string is the string containing no letters ( it is often written as formula_2 ) . the empty string is a string over any alphabet . if we have an alphabet called formula_3 . then we write the set of `` all '' strings that can be made from formula_3 as formula_5 . this is called the kleene star ( or kleene closure ) of formula_3 . it is named after the mathematician stephen cole kleene .
