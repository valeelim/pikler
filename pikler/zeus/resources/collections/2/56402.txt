Solar cell     a solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy . sometimes the term `` solar cell '' is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight , while the term `` photovoltaic cell '' is used when the light source is unspecified . the device needs to fulfill only two functions : photogeneration of charge carriers ( electrons and electron holes ) in a light-absorbing material , and separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will transmit the electricity . this conversion is called the `` photovoltaic effect '' , and the field related to solar cells is known as photovoltaics . solar cells have many applications . they have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable , such as in remote area power systems , earth-orbiting satellites and space probes , consumer systems , e.g . handheld calculators or wrist watches , remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications . more recently , they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules connected to the electricity grid through an inverter , often in combination with net metering .
