Ethology     ethology is the scientific study of animal behaviour ( u.s. `` behavior '' ) , and a sub-topic of zoology . ethology overlaps , to some extent , with psychology . psychology is a social science which studies human behaviour , but many psychologists have done experiments on learning in animals . ethology studies animal behaviour , but many ethologists have been interested in human behaviour . an american specialist on ants , william morton wheeler , first used the term 'ethology ' in english in 1902. the study of animal behaviour , which had been going on in an anecdotal way since aristotle , had its roots in natural history . it became more scientific during the 19th century . the french zoologist étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire was the founder of ethology in europe , and his son isidore produced a three-volume encyclopaedia `` histoire naturelle générale '' . in the third volume he talked about animal behaviour in almost modern terms . the entomologist j.-h fabre ( 1823–1915 ) was a remarkable observer of natural life . his popular writing on natural history kept ethology alive in europe .
