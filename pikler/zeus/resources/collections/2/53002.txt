Asura     the asura are a group of supernatural creatures in hinduism and buddhism . in today 's hinduism , the asuras are demons . but this was not always that way . the idea of the asuras is very , very old , from long before the time people learned how to read and write . the asuras only became demons much time had passed . buddhism also has asuras . these are from hinduism but have also changed a lot in their own way . some of the asuras are very important , and have been worshiped for thousands of years . the most important of these are varuna and mitra . varuna is the god of the ocean , which in olden times was thought to be flowing under the earth . so , varuna came to be seen as god of the underworld . in ancient times , water was thought to be where wisdom came from . so varuna is considered very wise , and he gives his wisdom to those who honor him . varuna 's closest companion is mitra . mitra mostly means `` friend '' in hinduism , but it originally meant `` promise '' . and so mitra is the god of friendships and promises . he protects people who honor the truth and punishes those who tell lies . the `` mi- '' in `` mitra '' means `` to tie tightly '' . friendship and promises tie people to one another .
