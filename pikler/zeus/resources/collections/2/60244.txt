Creed     a creed is a statement or confession of belief — usually religious belief — or faith . the word comes from the latin `` credo '' for `` i believe '' . it is sometimes called `` symbol '' ( greek , συμβολον ) , that means a `` token '' by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other . it is likely that the earliest creed of christianity that deserves the title in full is the apostles ' creed . the apostles ' creed seems to have been formulated to resist gnosticism ; it emphasizes the birth , physical death , and bodily resurrection of jesus christ . it reads : the nicene creed is clearly derived from the apostles ' creed , and represents an elaboration of its basic themes . the most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning christology and the trinity . christians today probably use the nicene creed most widely , followed by the apostles ' creed . the jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the shmah or shema yisrael , a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism , the belief in one god . this creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day : `` hear o israel , the lord is our god , the lord is one '' , also translated as `` hear o israel , the lord is our god , the lord is unique [ `` or '' alone ] .
