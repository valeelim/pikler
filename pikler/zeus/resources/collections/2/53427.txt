Rondo     in music a rondo is a piece of music which has one main theme , which is heard several times , and other musical ideas in between each time . if we give the main theme a label `` a '' and the other musical ideas `` b '' , `` c '' , `` d '' etc . then the form of a rondo can be described as abacada . the sections in between the main `` a '' section are called `` episodes '' . rondos can vary in length , e.g . a rondo might be abacadaeafa . each episode is normally in a different key from the main key . the word `` rondo '' is sometimes given the french spelling : rondeau . composers from the baroque period onwards often write movements which are in rondo form . in the classical music period the last movement of a symphony or sonata is very often a rondo . rondos are normally fast and lively . they are a good way of finishing a long piece of music with something that is happy . the word `` rondo '' is related to the word `` ritornello '' meaning : something that keeps returning . rondo form is sometimes combined with sonata form to make something which is called `` sonata rondo form '' . in sonata rondo form the second tune is treated like the second subject in sonata form where it comes back in the main key the second time .
