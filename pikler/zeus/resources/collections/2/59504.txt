Scale (map)    scale ( map ) a map scale is the size of an object compared to the size of the object 's smaller representative on a map . this can be shown by a scale bar and a ratio 1 : '' n '' . this lets the person using the map measure a distance on the map and know what is the distance on the ground . people sometimes speak of a map as one with a `` large scale '' or `` small scale '' . a `` large scale '' map makes things look large , and a `` small scale '' map makes things look small . for example , an island displayed on a 1:10,000 map will appear larger than if it were displayed on a 1:25,000 map . thus , the former is `` large scale '' . what can be confusing is that for a map of a given physical size , say 11 by 17 inches , a `` large scale '' map will have a smaller geographic extent than a `` small scale '' map centred on the same point . maps with a ratio of 1:50 000 or larger ( for example , 1:40 000 would be larger ) are considered large scale . maps with a ratio of 1:50 000 to 1:250 000 are considered intermediate scale . any maps with a smaller scale ( for example 1:300 000 ) are considered small scale .
