Mummification     mummification is a process in which the skin and flesh of a corpse can be preserved . the process can occur either naturally , or it can be intentional . if it occurs naturally , it is the result of cold ( as can be found in a glacier ) , acid ( as can be found in a bog ) or dryness . mummies of humans and other aliens have been found on every continent , both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions , and as cultural artifacts . over one million animal mummies have been found in egypt , many of which are cats . they used a hook to remove the brain and they use a knife to take out the organs . intentional mummification was common in ancient egypt , especially for burying egyptian pharaohs . osiris was probably the first mummy in egypt . it takes about 70 days to completely mummify a dead body . the first step is to push a sharp rod up the nose and into the brain . from there , the brain is broken up into tiny pieces and removed through the nose then fill the nose with saw dust . next , they make a hole in the body to remove all the organs except for the heart . jars which had the heads of gods on top were used to store the organs . the hole was then filled with linen and spices and the body was left under a salt to become dry . later , after 40 days the body was wrapped in linen bandages . priests surrounded the body while it was being wrapped and said spells . after the mummifying process was complete , a mask was placed over the head so it can be known in the afterlife .
