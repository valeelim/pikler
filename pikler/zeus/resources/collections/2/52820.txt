Signal processing     signal processing is the analysis , interpretation and manipulation of signals . signals of interest include sound , images , biological signals such as ecg , radar signals , and many others . processing of such signals includes storage and reconstruction , separation of information from noise ( e.g. , aircraft identification by radar ) , compression ( e.g. , image compression ) , and feature extraction ( e.g. , speech-to-text conversion ) . for analog signals , signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunication . for digital signals , signal processing may involve the compression , error checking and error detection of digital signals . - analog signal processing—for signals that have not been digitized , as in classical radio , telephone , radar , and television systems - digital signal processing—for signals that have been digitized . processing is done by digital circuits such as asics , fpgas , general-purpose microprocessors or computers , or specialized digital signal processor chips .
