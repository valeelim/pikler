Audition     an audition is a test to see whether a person is good enough to take part in a play or concert or to join a theatre company , dance company or orchestra . when people go for an audition they will normally have to prepare something to perform . an actor many have to be prepared to say a monologue ( a speech from a play ) . if he ( or she ) is auditioning for a particular play then he will take a scene from that play , e.g . if the play is `` hamlet '' a male actor who would like the part of hamlet might have prepared the famous `` to be or not to be ... '' monologue . the director of the play will then be able to decide whether he is good enough , or whether he might be better in another role . they may give the person who is auditioning some other tests , e.g . improvisation or acting with other people . when a musician auditions for a job in an orchestra they will have to prepare a piece of music they know well . they may also be expected to have prepared difficult passages from well-known musical works , e.g . someone auditioning for tuned percussion might be asked to play the xylophone introduction to `` summer time '' from `` porgy and bess '' , one of the hardest solos for xylophone . they will also be given some sightreading .
