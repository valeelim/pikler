Algebraic structure     in mathematics an algebraic structure is a set with one , two or more binary operations on it . the basic algebraic structures with one binary operation are the following : - magma ( mathematics ) - semigroup - monoid - group - commutative group the basic algebraic structures with two binary operations are the following : - ring - commutative ring - field examples are - the whole numbers ( natural numbers together with zero ) with addition ( or multiplication ) is a monoid , but is not a group - the integers with addition is a commutative group , but with multiplication is just a monoid - the integers with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring , but not a field - the rational numbers , the real numbers and the complex numbers with the ordinary addition and ordinary multiplication are fields .
