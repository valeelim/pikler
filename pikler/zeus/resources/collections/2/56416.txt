Fraction (mathematics)    fraction ( mathematics ) a fraction is a number that shows how many equal parts there are . when we write fractions , we show one number with a line above another number , for example , formula_1 or or 1/4 . the top number tells us how many parts there are , the second number tells us the total number of parts . the top part of the fraction is called a numerator . the bottom part of the fraction is called a denominator . for example , formula_1 : the 1 is the numerator here , and the 4 is the denominator . examples . 1. for example , a room where formula_1 of the people are girls , has 1 girl for every 4 people . 1. think of a cake made of 4 equal parts . each is 1 part of 4. in maths , you write this as formula_1 , and it is called a `` quarter '' . 2 parts of the cake ( i.e . 2 quarters ) is written formula_5 , and this is also known as 1/2 , half . a fraction is a mathematical expression relating two quantities or numbers , one divided by the other . the numbers may be whole numbers ( or integers ) – this is a rational number . for example , formula_6 is a fraction . they can also be polynomials – this is a rational function .
