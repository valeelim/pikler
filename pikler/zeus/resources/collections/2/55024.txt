Flux     flux is a term in physics and mathematics . it is broadly defined as `` how much stuff goes through your thing . '' for instance , imagine a butterfly net . the amount of air passing through the net is the flux . in the study of transport phenomena ( heat transfer , mass transfer and fluid dynamics ) , flux is defined as flow per unit area , where flow is the movement of some quantity per time . flux , in this definition , is a vector . there are many fluxes used in the study of transport phenomena . each type of flux has its own distinct unit of measurement along with distinct physical constants . six of the most common forms of flux from the transport literature are defined as : 1 . `` momentum flux '' , the rate of transfer of momentum across a unit area ( n·s·m·s ) . ( newtonian fluid , viscous flow ) 1 . `` heat flux '' , the rate of heat flow across a unit area ( j·m·s ) . ( fourier 's law ) ( this definition of heat flux fits maxwell 's original definition . ) 1 . `` chemical flux '' , the rate of movement of molecules across a unit area ( mol·m·s ) . ( fick 's law of diffusion )
