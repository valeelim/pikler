Wormhole     a wormhole is a theoretical connection between a black hole and a white hole creating a shortcut through time and space . it is not known if wormholes exist in nature . scientists believe that if wormholes existed they could not be made following any traditional scientific methods . in order to hold a wormhole open , a form of theoretical exotic matter would be needed . otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation . if plotted on a 2-dimensional plane , the wormhole bends the plane , like folding a paper , so that the two ends would be touching . ( as seen in the picture ) . the term wormhole was first used by john wheeler , a theoretical physicist . it is also known as einstein-rosen bridge . a worm hole is much like a tunnel with two ends each in separate points in space time . researchers have no observational evidence for worm holes .
