Electricity generation     electricity generation is the making of electricity for use by people . most comes from rotary electrical generators turned by various engines . making electricity in one central place became useful when electric power distribution was possible . this required power transformers which could change voltage . electricity could be sent as alternating current along electric power lines for great distances cheaply . electricity has been generated for powering human technologies for at least 120 years . different sources of energy have been used to run generators , including coal , nuclear , natural gas , hydroelectric , and petroleum power and a small amount from solar energy , tidal harnesses , wind generators , and geothermal sources . the demand for electricity can be met in two different ways . the main method is to build large centralized projects to generate and transmit the electricity required . many of these projects have caused unpleasant environmental effects such as air or radiation pollution and the flooding of large areas of land .
