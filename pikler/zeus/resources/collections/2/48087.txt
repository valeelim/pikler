Hashish     hashish is a sticky , thick , dark-colored resin ( like sap ) which is made from the flower of the female cannabis plant , `` cannabis sativa '' . the cannabis plant 's leaves and flowers contain chemicals known as cannabinoids . the cannabinoids include thc which gives a person who smokes or eats parts of the cannabis plant a feeling of euphoria ( makes the user feel good or happy ) , cbd , which gives the user a feeling of relaxation or sedation , and cbg which is responsible for giving the user red/droopy eyes . the name `` hashish '' comes from an arabic word meaning `` dry weed '' . the two main drugs made from the cannabis plant are marijuana and hashish . hashish has much more of the chemical thc ( which makes users feel good or happy ) than marijuana . hashish is an illegal drug in the united states , canada , and many other countries . it is controversial , since some people think it should be legal , some think it should be legal only for medical purposes , and some think it should not be legal at all . to make hashish , workers rub cannabis blossoms with their hands to get the resin to stick to their hands , and then the resin is collected . another way to make hashish is to sift the ground-up , dried leaves through a screen and compress the powder resin to make a `` brick '' .
