Engraving     engraving is putting a design onto a hard , flat surface , by carving into it . the result may be a decorative piece in itself , as when silver , gold or steel are engraved , or may provide a printing plate of copper or another metal , for printing images on paper which are also called engravings . engraving was an important method in history of making images on paper , both in artistic ways , such as making a decorative print , and also for printing books and magazines . it has long been replaced by photography in its commercial uses and , is nowadays much less common in printmaking , where it has been almost completely replaced by etching and other techniques . engravers use a steel tool called a burin to cut the picture or pattern into the surface , mostly a copper plate . gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that give different line types when used . the burin gives us a line that is unique because of its steady appearance and smooth edges . the angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking . florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines on them , used to do work on larger areas . flat gravers are used for doing work on letters , as well as most musical instrument engraving work . round gravers are commonly used on silver as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel .
