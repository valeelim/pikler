Cell nucleus     the cell nucleusâ€‹ ( plural : cell nuclei ) is a membrane bound structure that contains the cell 's hereditary information and controls the cell 's growth and reproduction . it is commonly the most prominent organelle in a cell . the nucleus is small and round , and it works as the cell 's control center . it contains chromosomes which house the dna . the human body contains billions of cells , most of which have a nucleus . all eukaryote organisms have nuclei in their cells , even the many eukaryotes that are single-celled . bacteria and archaea , which are prokaryotes , are single-celled organisms of quite a different type and do not have nuclei . cell nuclei were first found by antonie van leeuwenhoek in the 17th century . the nucleus has a membrane around it but the things inside it do not . inside it are many proteins , rna molecules , chromosomes and the nucleolus . in the nucleolus ribosomes are put together . after being produced in the nucleolus , ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mrna into proteins .
