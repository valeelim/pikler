Inch of mercury     inches of mercury , inhg or hg is a non-si unit for pressure , or a way to measure how hard something is pushing on something else . it is a unit that is still used a lot for counting barometric pressure , or how thick the air is in one place , in weather forecasts and aviation , or anything that has to do with flying in the united states , but is considered a bit old in other countries . it is the amount of pressure that a column of mercury that is one inch tall has at 32 °f ( 0 °c ) at the standard acceleration of gravity , or how fast things speed up as they are falling because of gravity . airplanes that are flying at high altitudes , or that are flying higher than what is called the transition altitude , which varies by country set their barometric altimeters , which control the air pressure in their plane , to a standard pressure of 29.92 inhg or 1,013.2 hpa ( 1 hpa = 1 mbar ) no matter what the actual sea level pressure is , in inches of mercury used in the u.s. and canada , and in other units in other countries . the resulting altimeter readings , or the things that show up on the plane 's altimeter are known as flight levels .
