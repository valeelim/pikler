Denomination (currency)    denomination ( currency ) when dealing with money , denomination is the value of the individual currency . for example a one dollar bill , a 100 dollar bill , a penny and a quarter are all different denominations of money . a one dollar bill and a one dollar coin are the same denomination as they are the same value . when countries form a monetary union , redenomination may be required and the conversion ratio is often not a nice even number , or even less than 1. when countries that had a `` pound ( £ ) - shilling ( s ) - pence ( d ) '' ( £sd ) currency system converted to a system which had pounds ( £ ) and pennies ( p ) or dollars ( $ ) and cents ( ¢ ) it was called decimalisation . in the £sd system , £1 = 20s and 1s = 12d , so £1 = 240d . however in the new systems £1 = 100p or $ 1 = 100¢ or 100c - a decimal-based system , hence the word `` decimalised '' . other pages . - inflation
