Variance     the variance in probability theory and statistics is a way to measure how far a set of numbers is spread out . variance describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value . the variance is defined as the average of the squares of the differences between the individual ( observed ) and the expected value . that means it is always positive . in practice , it is a measure of how much something changes . for example , temperature has more variance in moscow than in hawaii . the variance is not simply the average difference from the expected value . the standard deviation , which is the square root of the variance and comes closer to the average difference , also is not simply the average difference . variance and standard deviation are used because it makes the mathematics easier when adding two random variables together . in accountancy , a variance refers to the difference between the budget for a cost , and the actual cost . external references . - `` standard deviation and variance , '' maths is fun
