Fir     firs ( `` abies '' ) are about 45-55 species of evergreen trees in the family `` pinaceae '' . fir trees can reach heights of 10–80 m tall and trunk diameters of 0.5–4 m when mature . the difference between firs and other members of the pine family is that their needle-like leaves are attached to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup , and by erect , cylindrical female cones 5–25 cm long that release the winged seeds . the male cones are normally much smaller and spread through the tree so that the wind can help pollinate the female cones . like all members of the pine family , these trees have a sticky sap called resin . fir wood is not suitable for construction because it is not very resistant to insects and decay . it is usually sawn or crushed into fine sheets or pieces and made into plywood or for indoor or temporary outdoor use . however , fir trees are used widely in gardening . they can be used as shelter trees to protect other plants from wind or grown alone as decorative trees .
