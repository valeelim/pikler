Amniote     the amniotes are a taxonomic group of animals : all the tetrapods except the amphibians . they are the land vertebrates which lay cleidoic eggs . two super-groups make up the amniotes : the synapsida ( pelycosaurs , theriodonts and mammals ) and the sauropsida ( all reptiles , including dinosaurs and birds ) . the embryos of amniotes are either laid as eggs or develop in the female . these embyros are protected by several membranes , and have a much larger food supply than amphibian eggs . the 'invention ' of the cleidoic egg , and its embryonic membranes , is the main reason why the eggs of an amniote do not need to be laid in water . thus , as distinct from the amphibians , `` amniotes are truly terrestrial '' . secondarily , many reptiles and mammals returned to water , and mammals bear the young live , as do some reptile groups . this evolutionary flexibility is much less common in amphibians . the first amniotes , such as `` casineria '' , looked like small lizards . they evolved about 340 million years ago , in the mississippian or lower carboniferous . their eggs could survive out of the water . this let amniotes move into environments that had less water . the amniotes moved across the earth . most vertebrates that live on land are amniotes , as are most of the air-breathing animals of the sea .
