The Byrds     the byrds were a popular folk rock band , from california . their members included jim mcguinn ( who later changed his name to roger ) , david crosby , gene clark , chris hillman and michael clarke . later band members included gram parsons , clarence white , and gene parsons . the byrds pioneered folk rock , a blend of folk music with rock and roll . many of their songs were remakes of bob dylan 's songs , such as `` mr. tambourine man '' , which was their first hit in 1965. they recorded a bright , uplifting version of `` turn , turn , turn '' , which had been adapted by pete seeger from ecclesiastes in the bible . other songs were written by band members . the byrds recorded `` so you wan na be a rock'n'roll star ? '' about the monkees , not liking the star-making machinery that made the monkees famous overnight . mcguinn later said the song was about the pop music business , not the monkees . they softened their opinions , though , once they 'd met the band and saw they had real talent . members of the byrds played on monkees recording sessions , and the later band crosby , stills & nash was formed partly from meetings at peter tork 's house .
