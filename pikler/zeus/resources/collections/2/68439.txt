Onryō     onryō ( 怨霊 ) is a japanese ghost ( `` yūrei '' , 幽霊 ) who is believed to be able to return to the world of the living to seek revenge . some onryō are male , mostly in kabuki , but most of them are women . they usually suffer at the hands of their male lovers when they were alive , because they were weak , but they become strong in death . in japanese tradition , the spiritual world has yomi ( hell ) on one side and the world of the living in the other . in the middle , there is a waiting area , like a purgatory , where spirits lie in doubt before moving on . some spirits , especially those of murdered people , can go back to the world of the living , influenced by feelings of anger , sadness , or love . onryō and yūrei do not have a particular look . but the popularity of kabuki in the edo period meant that a costume was created to show what they look like . this usually included a white burial kimono , long and black , messy hair , and white and purple make-up . the influence of this image can be seen in modern movies about onryō , like `` ring '' .
