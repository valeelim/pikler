Liturgy     a liturgy is a ceremony , according to the traditions of a particular group or event . in religion , it may mean an elaborate formal ritual ( such as the catholic mass ) , or a daily activity such as the muslim salats . anglican , orthodox , lutheran , or other groups , when using the words `` the liturgy '' , normally mean a standardized order of events observed during a religious service , often including the eucharist . the `` open '' or `` waiting '' worship of quakers is an example of a non-liturgical service because there is no minister or structured order of events . in the christian church , liturgical churches are those that use a well-defined liturgy dating to the second century and earlier , in which many of the words and music used follow basic patterns each time the service is conducted . most orthodox , catholic , anglican , and lutheran churches are liturgical , most other churches to a far lesser extent . so-called non-liturgical churches usually follow a common worship sequence from one service to the next , with several elements common to many such services . these elements often include readings from the bible , hymns , a sermon , offerings of money , and at certain times , holy communion .
