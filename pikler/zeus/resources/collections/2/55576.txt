Investiture Controversy     the investiture controversy , also known as the lay investiture controversy , was the most important conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval europe . it began as a dispute in the 11th century between the holy roman emperor henry iv and pope gregory vii . the question was who would control appointments of bishops ( investiture ) . the controversy led to many years of bitterness and nearly fifty years of civil war in germany . this war ended with the triumph of the great dukes and abbots , and the falling apart of the german empire in the end . when gregory vii , a reformist monk , was elected as pope in 1073 , the controversy between emperor and pope began . in the higher ranks of the german clergy , gregory had many enemies . therefore king henry declared gregory was no longer pope and the romans should choose a new pope . when gregory heard of this he excommunicated henry iv , declared he was no longer emperor and absolved his subjects from the oaths they had sworn to him .
