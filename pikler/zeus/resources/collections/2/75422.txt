Dogfight     a dogfight is a close air fight between fighter planes . it often involves turning , climbing , and swirling . dogfights started during world war i and world war ii when the fighter planes did not have many weapons . the first aerial dogfight occurred during the battle of cer ( 15–24 august 1914 ) , when serbian aviator miodrag tomić encountered an austro-hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over austro-hungarian positions . the austro-hungarian pilot initially waved , and tomić reciprocated . the austro-hungarian pilot then fired at tomić with his revolver . tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back . tomić managed to escape , and within several weeks , all serbian and austro-hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns . modern weapons such as homing missiles did not exist in that time , and planes could only fight each other with machine guns . since the machine guns were only useful at close range , the planes had to fly very close together to have combat . pilots had to fly with many maneuvers to try to not be shot , and be able to shoot the enemy planes . this new type of flying was named dogfighting . fighter planes made just for this type of flying were sometimes called dogfighters .
