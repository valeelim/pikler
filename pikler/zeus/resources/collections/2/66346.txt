Simulation     a simulation is a way of seeing a thing happen without it actually taking place in the same way . a simulation can be used to predict what might happen without doing it , in case it is dangerous or too expensive or difficult . it can also be used to show people what will happen next , or what happened in the past . it can also show what people believe is happening in a place or time where it is impossible to know what really happens . there are research institutions just devoted to simulations , like , e.g. , `` the george e. brown , jr. network for earthquake engineering simulation '' or nees . simulations are very useful all over the world , because in a simulation things can be controlled that might not be easy to control in real life . they can use or smaller versions of an object or system for testing or practice . they can often use smaller versions of things , like space ships or rooms , to simulate the real thing . they can also use a safer thing in place of a thing that is dangerous , like when astronauts practice in a swimming pool rather than in outer space . astronauts also practice in simulations of the moon before they went and landed there , and in simulations of spaceships that move the way real spaceships do , so they can get used to it . simulations often use computers or television . computers are used to make simulations of what a spaceship 's route might be on the way to the moon , to help plan the mission .
