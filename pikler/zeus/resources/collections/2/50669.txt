Toxicology     toxicology is the study of the negative effects of chemicals on living things . the main factor in the `` toxicity '' of a substance is the dose ( how much of the chemical has been given ) , as almost all substances can be toxic under the right conditions . many chemicals that we call poisons are only toxic when made into different chemicals by the body . many chemicals are made toxic in the liver by enzymes , for example paracetamol , which is a common drug . there is also some variation in liver enzymes ( caused by genetic variation ) in different people that can cause a substance to be more toxic in one person than it is in another . some substances are also only toxic when they are with other chemicals , as one liver enzyme can cause activity in another enzyme . some measures of toxicity . - ld is a test that finds an average dose required to kill half of the animals being tested ( normally rats in human toxicity ) . - the fixed dose procedure , an alternative to the ld50 which measures oral toxicity in a similar way , but using fewer animals and with less suffering .
