Soxhlet extractor     a soxhlet extractor is a kind of laboratory equipment . it is made of glass . franz von soxhlet invented it in 1879. it has a flask , an extraction chamber , and a condenser . it can be used for solid-liquid extractions . in this discontinuous extraction process , the extraction solvent inside the boiling flask is evaporated and re-condensed in the distillation column above . it then falls down onto the solid material requiring extraction . the chamber containing the solid material is connected to the boiling flask below by a syphoning mechanism seen in the pythagorean cup , which allows the chamber to fill to a point , at which it will empty its contents and start to fill again and the extracted compounds will accumulate in the boiling flask below . chemists use it to remove a material from a solid . it is useful when removing materials that do not dissolve well in any solvent . chemists use a solvent such as ether or alcohol in the extractor . the soxhlet extractor applies the solvent repeatedly to the solid until enough of the material dissolves .
