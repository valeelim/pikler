Concept     a concept is an idea that is applied to all objects in a group . it is the way people see and understand something . the name used to identify a concept ( the concept 's label ) is a `` term '' . for example , the word `` dog '' is the term to identify the concept of what a dog is . everything that a person knows about a dog is the concept of the term dog . different terms can be used to identify the same concept . car and automobile are synonyms for the same concept . different languages have different terms for the same concept . this is what makes translation possible . the terms may be different in each language , but the concept is the same . the concept of jumping is the same to a person from england and a person from italy , but one person uses the term `` jump '' to mean the concept and the other person uses `` salto '' .
