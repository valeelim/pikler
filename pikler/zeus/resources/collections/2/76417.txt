Bodhi Tree     the bodhi tree was a large and very old sacred fig tree ( `` ficus religiosa '' ) . it was at the mahabodhi temple at bodh gaya . siddhartha gautama , the spiritual teacher and founder of buddhism , later known as gautama buddha , achieved `` bodhi '' ( spiritual enlightenment ) while sitting under this tree . the bodhi tree is easily recognised because of its heart-shaped leaves . the word `` bodhi tree '' is also widely applied to existing trees , particularly the sacred fig growing at the mahabodhi temple , which is probably a direct descendant of the original tree . this tree is a frequent place for pilgrims to visit , being the most important of the four holy sites for buddhists . the bodhi tree at the mahabodhi temple is called the sri mahabodhi . according to buddhism , after his enlightenment , buddha spent a whole week in front of the tree , standing with unblinking eyes , gazing at it with gratitude . a shrine was later built where he had stood . the spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of buddha , the only shrine that could be so used . king asoka held a festival every year in its honor in the month of kattika . his queen , tissarakkhā was jealous of the tree , and three years after she became queen ( i.e. , in the nineteenth year of asoka 's reign ) , she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns . the tree , however , grew again , and a great monastery was attached to the bodhimanda called the bodhimanda vihara . among those present at the foundation of the mahā thūpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks from the bodhimanda vihara , led by cittagutta .
