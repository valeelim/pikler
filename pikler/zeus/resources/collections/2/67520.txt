Machine translation     machine translation , sometimes referred to by the acronym mt , is part of computational linguistics . it looks at the use of computer software to translate text or speech from one natural language to another . at its basic level , mt performs simple substitution of words in one natural language for words in another ( see literal translation ) . current machine translation software often allows to adapt the translation to subject or profession ( such as weather reports ) â€” to improve output by limiting the allowable substitutions . this technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used . it follows then that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text . in the words of the european association for machine translation ( eamt ) : other pages . - literal translation other websites . - international association for machine translation ( iamt ) - association for machine translation in the americas ( amta )
