Jörð     jörð ( or jord ) is a giantess ( jötun ) and goddess in norse mythology . she is the personification of earth . her name means `` earth '' . she is also called fjörgyn . jörð is the wife of odin , king of the gods , and the mother of thor . her parents are annar and nótt . snorri sturluson says jörð was included among the asynjur . her name occurs most often in skaldic and eddic poetry in phrases that refer to thor as `` the son of jörð '' . there is some confusion , however , because in some parts of the poetic edda the word `` fjörgyn '' appears in phrases referring to thor , such as in the poem `` voluspa '' , where thor is described as `` the son of fjörgyn '' . scholars explain the confusion by pointing out that fjörgyn , as an old norse noun , means `` earth '' when used in the feminine form .
