Heraldry     heraldry is the art and science of designing and using a coat of arms . the study of coats of arms is also called `` armory '' . the practice of using distinct markings on a person 's shield started in the middle ages , when a knight 's helmet covered his face , making everybody look the same in battle . at first , only knights and nobility had coats of arms , but in the middle ages , some cities started using heraldry too . by the end of the middle ages , other people began using coats of arms , now called `` burgher arms '' , which means they belong to a regular person and not a member of the nobility . an official in charge of approving and recording coats of arms is called a `` herald '' . the related study of flags is called `` vexillology '' . heraldry is described in english using a specialised called `` blazon '' which is based on french words . heraldry uses only bold , bright colors , called `` tinctures '' , with special names . gold , for instance , is called `` or '' . this word is often capitalised to distinguish it from the conjunction `` or '' . silver and white are sometimes treated as different colors , but in english blazon both are called `` argent '' . some combinations of colors represent furs , and these have names that are only used in heraldry . there are a number of geometric shapes , called `` ordinaries '' , that are used in heraldry , and each of these has a special name too . the shield may be divided in a number of ways , usually following the lines of the ordinaries .
