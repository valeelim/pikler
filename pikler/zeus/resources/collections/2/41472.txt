Manifold     a manifold is a concept from mathematics . making a manifold is like making a flat map of a sphere ( the earth ) . the earth is a sphere , a three dimensional object of geometry . yet , maps ( two-dimensional representations ) can be made of the earth . at the edges of a certain map , the map needs to be changed . that way it is possible to make a two dimensional image of the whole surface of the earth . there need to be rules , on how to change the maps , and some areas ( near the edges of the map ) will be on more than one map . it is not possible to make one map only , which would have no edges . this map would either have edges ( and overlapping areas ) , or there would be some places where the paper was torn . tearing and overlapping is n't allowed . each manifold has a dimension . this is the dimension of the maps , in the example above . it is the same for all maps .
