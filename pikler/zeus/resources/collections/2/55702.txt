Green tea     the drink green tea ( ) is a `` true '' tea . it comes from the plant species `` camellia sinensis '' . green tea is a tea that has undergone little oxidation while it was processed . green tea is popular in china , taiwan , hong kong , japan , korea , and the middle east . recently it has been drunk more widely in the west , where usually black tea is consumed . in the kamakura period , a buddhist monk , eisai ( 1141–1215 ) , and his follower , dogen , first brought tea `` ( maccha ) '' to japan . he had learned about tea on a visit to china . eisai taught people to grow the tea plants , and how to prepare the tea leaves . people drank tea for its benefit as a medicine rather than as a refreshment . tea drinking gradually spread as part of zen buddhism . the tea ceremony was part of the training for mental discipline . green tea kept the mind pure and relaxed , an effect caused by the caffeine in the tea . the custom of drinking tea gradually spread throughout japan . in the muromachi period , tea tasting competitions were popular . people also gambled on these competitions . zen buddhist master , juko murata ( 1422–1502 ) stopped these competitions . he broke with the grand tradition , and developed a small ceremony performed around the tatami mat . the tea ceremony was perfected afterward in the azuchimomoyama era by jou takeno and sen no rikyu ( 1522–1591 ) . they removed all extra movements and unnecessary decoration and objects from the tea room . the idea , based on zen , was to concentrate your attention on the wealth inside your mind .
