Euclidean geometry     euclidean geometry is a system in mathematics . people think euclid was the first person who described it ; therefore , it bears his name . he first described it in his textbook `` elements '' . the book was the first systematic discussion of geometry as it was known at the time . in the book , euclid first assumes a few axioms . these form the base for later work . they are intuitively clear . starting from those axioms , other theorems can be proven . in the 19th century other forms of geometry were found . these are non-euclidean geometry . carl friedrich gauss , j√°nos bolyai , and nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky were some people that developed such geometries . very often , these do not use the parallel postulate , but the other four axioms . euclid makes the following assumptions . these are axioms , and need not be proved . 1. any two points can be joined by a straight line 1. any straight line segment can be made longer ( extended ) to infinity , so it becomes a straight line . 1. with a straight line segment it is possible to draw a circle , so that one endpoint of the segment is the center of the circle , and the other endpoint lies on the circle . the line segment becomes the radius of the circle .
