Biogas     biogas means a gas produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of organic matter . the organic matter can be manure , sewage sludge , municipal solid waste , biodegradable waste or any other biodegradable feedstock . biogas is mainly methane and carbon dioxide . depending on where it is produced , biogas is also called : - swamp gas - marsh gas - landfill gas - digester gas biogas can be used as a vehicle fuel or for generating electricity . it can also be burned directly for cooking , heating , lighting , process heat and absorption refrigeration . biogas production by anaerobic digestion is popular for treating biodegradable waste because valuable fuel can be produced while destroying disease-causing pathogens and reducing the volume of disposed waste products . the methane in biogas burns more cleanly than coal , and produces more energy with less emissions of carbon dioxide . the harvesting of biogas is an important role of waste management because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide . the carbon in biogas was generally recently extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthetic plants , so releasing it back into the atmosphere adds less total atmospheric carbon than the burning of fossil fuels .
