Fermat number     a fermat number is a special positive number . fermat numbers are named after pierre de fermat . the formula that generates them is where `` n '' is a nonnegative integer . the first nine fermat numbers are : as of 2007 , only the first 12 fermat numbers have been completely factored . ( written as a product of prime numbers ) these factorizations can be found at prime factors of fermat numbers . if 2 + 1 is prime , and `` n '' > 0 , it can be shown that `` n '' must be a power of two . every prime of the form 2 + 1 is a fermat number , and such primes are called fermat primes . the only known fermat primes are `` f '' ... , '' f '' . interesting things about fermat numbers . - no two fermat numbers have common divisors . - fermat numbers can be calculated recursively : to get the nth number , multiply all fermat numbers before it , and add two to the result . today , fermat numbers can be used to generate random numbers , between 0 and some value n , which is a power of 2. fermat , when he was studying these numbers , conjectured that all fermat numbers were prime . this was proven to be wrong by leonhard euler , who factorised formula_2 in 1732 .
