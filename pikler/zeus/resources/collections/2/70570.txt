Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert     there are several solar power plants in the mojave desert which supply power to the electricity grid . solar energy generating systems ( segs ) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the mojave desert which were built in the 1980s . these plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts ( mw ) making them the largest solar power installation in the world . nevada solar one is a new solar thermal plant with a 64 mw generating capacity , near boulder city , nevada . there are also plans to build other large solar plants in the mojave desert . the mojave solar park will deliver 553 mw of solar thermal power when fully operational in 2011. insolation ( solar radiation ) in the mojave desert is among the best available in the united states , and some big groups of people are in the area . this makes the mojave desert particularly suitable for solar power plants . these plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular , readily available materials .
