Chapel Royal     the chapel royal is a department of the monarch 's household in the united kingdom . incorrectly , the term is also used for the choirs of these chapels . the correct name for these choirs is the `` gentlemen of the chapel '' . they are a group of priests and singers who sing church services for the british monarch ( king or queen ) . they are helped by young boy singers called choristers or `` children of the chapel . '' it is an old tradition . today there are two consecrated buildings at st james ’ s palace , near buckingham palace in london served by the chapel royal . these chapels do not belong to the diocese ( group of churches in a district ) . that is why they are called “ royal peculiars ” ( “ peculiar ” in this sense does not mean “ strange ” but “ special ” ) . services are held every sunday except during august and september . members of the public are welcome to go to these services . this is the only time that the public can go into the royal chapels . the choir also sing at special services , including one held every year on 6 january to celebrate epiphany when offerings of gold , frankincense and myrrh are made on behalf of the queen .
