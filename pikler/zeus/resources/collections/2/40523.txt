Corrosion     corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to reactions . it is usually oxidation with air molecules and often in the presence of water . corrosion also occurs when an acidic or basic material touches another material . when a material corrodes , it changes and becomes weaker . materials that corrode include metal , plastic , and wood . also , corrosion is a form of erosion . one form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes , which under certain circumstances reduces wear . iron corrosion is called rusting .
