Travelling salesman problem     the travelling salesman problem ( often called tsp ) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science . it is focused on optimization . in this context `` better solution '' often means `` a solution that is cheaper '' . tsp is a mathematical problem . it is most easily expressed as a graph describing the locations of a set of nodes . the travelling salesman problem was defined in the 1800s by the irish mathematician w. r. hamilton and by the british mathematician thomas kirkman . hamilton â€™ s icosian game was a recreational puzzle based on finding a hamiltonian cycle . the general form of the tsp appears to have been first studied by mathematicians during the 1930s in vienna and at harvard , notably by karl menger . menger defines the problem , considers the obvious brute-force algorithm , and observes the non-optimality of the nearest neighbour heuristic : hassler whitney at princeton university introduced the name `` travelling salesman problem '' soon after . the travelling salesman problem describes a salesman who must travel between n cities . the order in which he does so is something he does not care about , as long as he visits each once during his trip , and finishes where he was at first . each city is connected to other close by cities , or nodes , by airplanes , or by road or railway . each of those links between the cities has one or more weights ( or the cost ) attached . the cost describes how `` difficult '' it is to traverse this edge on the graph , and may be given , for example , by the cost of an airplane ticket or train ticket , or perhaps by the length of the edge , or time required to complete the traversal . the salesman wants to keep both the travel costs , as well as the distance he travels as low as possible .
