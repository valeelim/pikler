Key signature     a key signature is a group of sharps or flats which are printed at the beginning of a line of music . it shows which notes have to be changed into sharps or flats . for example : if there is one sharp in the key signature it will be an f sharp . it means that every time the note f is written one plays ( or sings ) an f sharp ( on a keyboard : the black note just to the right of the f ) instead . there are twelve major and twelve minor keys ( properly called “ modes '' ) . this is because a scale can start on any note , and there are twelve notes within an octave : seven white notes and five black notes on a keyboard . each major key has its own key signature ( the relationship between the keys is explained in the article “ circle of fifths ” . each minor key shares a key signature with one of the major keys . there are fifteen possible key signatures : up to seven sharps , up to seven flats , or no sharps or flats . the reason why there are fifteen and not twelve is because three of them have two possible names : f sharp major ( 6 sharps ) can also be called g flat , c sharp is d flat and b is c flat . we call these enharmonic i.e . the same note but with a different name .
