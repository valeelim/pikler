Anno Domini     anno domini ( latin : `` in the year of ( our ) lord '' ) , shortened as ad or a.d. , is used to refer to the years after the birth of jesus.a.d . ad is also a shortening for christian era . similarly , before christ , shortened as bc or b.c. , is used in the english language to refer to all years before the start of the time period `` anno domini '' . usually , ad comes before the year but comes after a century or millennium . for example , a person would write ad 2014 but 21st century ad or 3rd millennium ad . there is no zero year in this system . this means that the year a.d. 1 follows the year 1 b.c . this dating system was meant to signal the year of christ 's birth , but modern scholarship has decided jesus was actually born a few years earlier . the system for working out the years was invented by dionysius exiguus in about ad 525. he fixed the point anno domini , which is used to number the years of both the gregorian calendar and the julian calendar . he used it to identify the several easters in his easter table . he did not use it to date any historical event . when he devised his table , julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year â€” he himself stated that the `` present year '' was `` the consulship of probus junior [ flavius probus ] '' , which he also stated was 525 years `` since the incarnation [ conception ] of our lord jesus christ '' . how he arrived at that number is unknown . he invented a new system of numbering years to replace the diocletian years that had been used in an old easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted christians .
