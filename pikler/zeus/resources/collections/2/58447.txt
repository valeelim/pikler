Kumquat     the kumquats or cumquats are a group of small fruit-bearing trees . the edible fruit ( which is also called kumquat ) is similar to other `` citrus '' but is smaller . kumquats are slow-growing , evergreen shrubs or small trees , from 2.5–4.5 m tall , with dense branches . sometimes they have small thorns . the leaves are dark glossy green , and the flowers pure white , similar to citrus flowers . kumquats came from china ( they are known in literature of the 12th century ) , and have long been cultivated there and in japan . they were introduced to europe in 1846 by robert fortune , who was collector for the `` london horticultural society '' , and a short time later into north america . they are much hardier than citrus plants as oranges . the 'nagami ' kumquat needs a hot summer , ranging from 25 °c ( 77°f ) to 38°c ( 100.4°f ) , but can withstand frost down to about -10 °c ( 14°f ) . it grows in the tea regions of china where the climate is too cold for other citrus fruits , even the mikan ( also known as the satsuma ) orange .
