Rhombus     a rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal in length . a rhombus with all angles equal is called a square . the word `` rhombus '' comes from the greek word `` rhombos '' , meaning `` spinning top '' . a rhombus is sometimes called a diamond , but not all rhombi are diamond shaped . to find the perimeter of a rhombus , just add up all the sides . also opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal . another interesting thing is that the diagonals ( dashed lines in second figure ) meet in the middle at a right angle .
