Shield volcano     a shield volcano is a large volcano with shallowly-sloping sides . the name derives from a translation of `` skjaldbrei√∞ur '' , an icelandic shield volcano whose name means `` broad shield , '' from its resemblance to a warrior 's shield . shield volcanoes are formed by lava that flows easily . consequently , a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano . many of the largest volcanoes on earth are shield volcanoes . the largest is mauna loa on the big island of hawaii . shield volcanoes can be so large they are sometimes considered a mountain range , such as the ilgachuz range and the rainbow range , both of which are in canada . these shield volcanoes formed when the north american plate moved over a hotspot similar to the one feeding the hawaiian islands , called the anahim hotspot . there are also shield volcanoes , for example , in washington , oregon , and the galapagos islands . the piton de la fournaise , on reunion island , is one of the more active shield volcanoes on earth , with one eruption per year on average .
