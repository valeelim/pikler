South West England     south west england is one of the regions of england . it has the largest area of all regions , and reaches from gloucestershire and wiltshire to cornwall and the isles of scilly . this includes the area often known as the west country , and much of wessex . the size of the region is shown by the fact that the northern part of gloucestershire , near chipping campden , is as close to the scottish border as it is to the tip of cornwall . agriculture and tourism are the important industries of the region . mining of tin and copper was also formerly very important in devon and cornwall . traditionally , the south west of england has been well known for producing cheddar cheese , named after cheddar in the mendip hills , for devon cream teas , and for somerset cider . it is now probably equally well known as the home of the `` eden project '' ( in cornwall ) , `` aardman animations '' , the `` glastonbury festival '' ( in somerset ) , `` trip hop '' music , cornwall 's seafood restaurants , and surfing beaches . two national parks ( dartmoor and exmoor ) and four world heritage sites lie in this region .
