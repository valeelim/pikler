Bite     a bite is a wound received from the teeth of an animal . animals may bite things in self-defence . animals also bite things to cut them into smaller pieces before they eat them . bites can cause many medical problems , such as : - tearing or scratching the tissue - haemorrhaging if major blood vessels are pierced - infection by bacteria or pathogens , such as rabies - introduction of venom by venomous animals such as some snakes - introduction of things that may irritate the person by causing inflammation or itching bite wounds should be washed , ideally with povidone-iodine soap and water . the injury should then be loosely wrapped with a bandage . open bite wounds are not sutured because of the risk of infection . animal bites caused by carnivores ( other than rodents ) may infect the victim with rabies if the animal that bit them carries it . if possible , the animal is caught and the head is looked at for signs of rabies . signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth , self-mutilation , growling , jerky behaviour , and red eyes . if the animal lives for ten days and does not develop rabies , then the animal probably is not infected . in cases where the animal can not be found , prophylactic rabies treatment is carried out in most places .
