Fermion     a fermion is a category of elementary particles . they are very small and very light . fermions can be thought of as the building blocks of matter because atoms are made up of fermions . paul dirac named them fermions in honor of a famous scientist called enrico fermi . an electron ( a charged particle ) is a fermion , but a photon ( the particle of electromagnetic radiation ) is not . the spin numbers of fermions are 1/2 , 3/2 , 5/2 , etc . because their spin is not a whole number they follow the pauli exclusion principle : no two fermions can share a quantum state ( which includes position in space ) , if they have the same quantum numbers , such as spin . in other words , fermions can collide with each other . this behavior is not in the other class of elementary particles called bosons : you can have many bosons , for example photons , in the same place at the same time . the motion of fermions follows the fermi-dirac statistics . most well known fermions have spin of 1/2 . an example of a type of fermion with a spin of 1/2 is the electron . the electron belongs to a group of fermions called leptons .
