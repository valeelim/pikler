Golgi complex     the golgi complex , also known as the golgi apparatus or simply the golgi , is a cytoplasmic organelle . it is found in eukaryote cells , as in animals , plants , and fungi . the complex was discovered by camillo golgi in 1898. golgi was ignored and his discovery was said to be dirt on his lenses . years later , electron microscope pictures showed structures just like in the original golgi drawings . it is made of several flattened sac-like membranes which look like a stack of pancakes . the main function of the golgi apparatus is to process and package macromolecules , such as proteins and lipids . they come to the golgi after being built , and before they go to their destination . the golgi complex inspects them for flaws and discards extra material added during their manufacture , wraps them up and then targets them for packaging . the golgi complex is especially active in processing proteins for secretion . the golgi releases special enzymes called lysosomes , which clean off any extra amino acids . when the package is ready , it is pinched off the golgi and released into the cytoplasm .
