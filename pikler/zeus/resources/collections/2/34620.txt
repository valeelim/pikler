Gregorian chant     gregorian chant is an important form of plainchant , used mainly in the roman catholic church . with plainchant , all people sing the same music in unison , most of the time . sometimes , there is a second part , called `` organum '' , which often uses the same melody , but at an interval . this interval is often a fourth or a fifth . gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central europe during the 9th and 10th centuries , but people wrote new songs and changed the old ones later . many people believe an old story , which says that pope gregory the great wrote the songs . most people who study the history of music believe that kings such as charlemagne brought music from rome to their kingdoms in france and germany . when charlemagne 's people sang these songs , they changed the songs . this new music became gregorian chant . usually men and boys sang gregorian chant in churches , and holy women and men sang gregorian chants in their daily prayers . in roman catholic churches , prayers and songs follow an order called the `` roman rite . '' gregorian chant is the music used in the `` mass '' and the `` office '' of the roman rite . the `` mass '' is the part of the roman rite where catholics receive what they believe to be the body and blood of christ . the `` office '' is the part of the roman rite where holy men and women pray at special times every day . in the past , people sang different songs in parts of europe , but gregorian chant replaced almost all of them . although the roman catholic church no longer requires people to sing gregorian chants , it still says that gregorian chant is the best music for prayer .
