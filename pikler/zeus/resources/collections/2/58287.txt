Amun     in egyptian mythology , amun was a very powerful god . he was often combined with ra to form the god amun-ra . at one point in egyptian history , he was called the `` king of the gods '' . amun ( also spelled amon , amoun , amen , and sometimes imen , `` egyptian '' yamanu ) was the name of a deity , in egyptian mythology , who became one of the most important deities in ancient egypt . in later years , he was combined with horus into one god . amun 's name is first recorded as `` imn '' . that means `` the hidden ( one ) '' . vowels were not written in egyptian hieroglyphics , but egyptologists think the name must have been pronounced ( yah-maa-nuh ) originally . the name survives into the coptic language as `` amoun . '' amun was shown in human form , seated on a throne , wearing on his head a plain deep circlet from which rise two straight parallel plumes , maybe meant as the tail feathers of a bird . that would remind of his earlier status as a wind god . when amun had become more important than menthu , the local war god of thebes , menthu was called the son of amun . however , as mut was infertile , it was believed that she , and thus amun , had adopted menthu instead .
