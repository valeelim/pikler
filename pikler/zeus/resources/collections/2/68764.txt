Tropical Storm Chantal (2007)    tropical storm chantal ( 2007 ) tropical storm chantal was a very short-lived storm in the northern atlantic ocean that stayed away from land during most of its existence . it was also the third named storm of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season . the stormed formed from a non-tropical system between bermuda on cape cod , massachusetts that developed on july 31 with good conditions for further development . the storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 80 km/h ) and began to move quickly northeastwards into colder water temperatures . when convection began to decrease , the national hurricane center stopped sending out advisories on august 1 when chantal began to turn into an extratropical cyclone . later , the remnants moved over southeast newfoundland , before moving into the arctic ocean . an area of thunderstorm activity developed on july 28 about 100 miles ( 160 km ) east of the bahamas which was associated with a weak low pressure system . it moved north-northeastward , into poor environmental conditions which left the system disorganized . however , conditions then were forecasted to become better for development , and by july 29 the national hurricane center stated that it had `` potential for tropical or subtropical development . '' on july 30 , the low passed to the west of bermuda as it continued moving northeastward , under the effects of a large mid-latitude trough . the system contained an exposed low-level circulation , which from time to time passed under a thick area of convection to its northeast . by early on july 31 , ship reports and quikscat observations detected winds of 35 mph ( 55 km/h ) , and the center was well-involved enough with the convection for the national hurricane center to name it as `` tropical depression three '' while it was located about 270 miles ( 435 km ) north-northwest of bermuda , or about 445 miles ( 710 km ) south-southeast of chatham , massachusetts .
