Cerebrum     the cerebrum is the largest part of the brain . it is in the front part of the brain . it contains about 15 billion cells , and is the latest brain structure to have evolved . the cerebrum takes in data from sight and other sense organs , and 'makes sense ' of it ( interprets it ) . it controls consciousness and action ( voluntary muscular activity ) . it plans , thinks , judges , and organises speech and information . these are the so-called 'higher mental functions ' . the cerebrum is divided into two `` cerebral hemispheres '' . these two cerebral hemispheres are connected by three bands of nerve fibres , or commissures , which connect the two halves . the outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of the grey matter , and is called the cerebral cortex . the inner layers are made up of the white matter ( nerve fibres ) , and the basal ganglia . in the cerebrum , there are specific regions for each kind of stimulus and its response . for example , occipital lobe is the region for visual reception , temporal lobe for auditory reception , and parietal lobe for touch , smell , temperature and conscious association . the frontal lobe takes action , based on sensory input and other factors .
