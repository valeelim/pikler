Elastic modulus     an elastic modulus , or modulus of elasticity , is the mathematical description of an object or substance 's tendency to be deformed elastically ( i.e . non-permanently ) when a force is applied to it . the elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress-strain curve in the elastic deformation region : where λ is the elastic modulus ; stress is the force that causes the deformation divided by the area to which the force is applied ; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original state of the object . if one specifies how stress and strain are to be measured , that allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined . related pages . - elasticity ( physics ) - tensile strength
