History of England     england is the largest of the countries that today make up the united kingdom . the name `` england '' comes from the anglo-saxons who arrived in the 5th century . the territory of england has been united as one country since the 10th century . this article is about the history of that territory until 1707 , when britain ( england and wales ) was joined with scotland to make great britain . archaeology shows that people came to southern england long before the rest of the british isles , probably because of the friendly climate between and during the ice ages of long ago . julius caesar invaded what is now england in 55 and 54 bc , and wrote in `` de bello gallico '' that there were many tribes there , who were very similar to other celtic tribes in europe . coins , and later roman historians , have given us the names of some of the rulers of the tribes , and what they did . for hundreds of years , what is now england was a roman province , britannia . the romans later gave up on the province and left the celtic people on their own as the roman empire began to fall apart . the influence of the romans meant that the territory of england had already experienced unity before the anglo-saxons arrived .
