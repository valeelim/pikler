Sibylline Books     the sibylline books were a collection of prophecies in rhyme written in greek . the legendary king of rome , tarquinius superbus bought them from a sibyl ( a kind of prophetess ) , and the prophecies used to be consulted in times when great danger happened in the history of the roman empire . the books were also known to the greeks . they were kept in the temple of apollo at gergis on mount ida ( near troy in asia minor ) in the 7th century bc , and said to be written by the hellespontine sibyl . from there , it passed to erythrae ( in eastern asia minor ) and was called the work of the erythraean sibyl . it seems that this collection travelled from there to cumae , italy and from there to rome . according to virgil in the aeneid , aeneas had consulted the cumaean sibyl before he travelled to the lower world . the story of how king tarquinius bought them from the cumaean sibyl was a famous legend . she offered to sell tarquin a collection of nine books of prophecy , but he refused the price , so she burnt three . after that she offered to sell the six remaining books for the same price . he refused again and she burnt another three . finally he bought these three remaining books for this price so they would not be destroyed , and put them in the temple of jupiter in rome .
