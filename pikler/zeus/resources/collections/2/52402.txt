Spectrum     `` this article is about the visible spectrum . for all other uses see : spectrum ( disambiguation ) '' a spectrum , plural : spectra , is a band of several colours : violet , indigo , blue , green , yellow , orange and red . a spectrum can be seen if the sun 's light is passed through a prism and allowed to gather on a white screen . this visible spectrum is part of the larger electromagnetic spectrum . a natural example of a spectrum is a rainbow . the word `` spectrum '' was first used by scientists studying optics . they used the word to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light when separated using a prism . the spectrum seen when light passes through a prism is an example of the dispersion of light . the material from which the prism is made has a different refractive index `` n '' than air . usually , `` n '' is greater than `` n '' , and `` n '' is taken to be approximately one . this implies that light travels a little slower in the material of the prism than in the space surrounding it . the angle of refraction can be determined from the angle of incidence and the refractive indexes using snell 's law .
