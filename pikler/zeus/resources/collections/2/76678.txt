Chemical engineering     chemical engineering is a branch of engineering dealing with chemistry that came to existence in the early 20th century . before this time , chemical plants were designed by chemists , who were trained to work on a small scale only . chemical engineering combines the jobs of a chemist and that of industrial engineer . this makes factories more efficient and chemicals much cheaper . chemical engineering uses physics ( the science of moving objects and forces ) , chemistry ( the science of substances ) , and mathematics . there are many different types of jobs for people with degrees in chemical engineering . some new topics in chemical engineering include : - environmental sanitation at factories ( making certain that nature is not hurt by the factories ) ; - developing types of energy other than those from gas or oil ; - biomedical engineering .
