Postulate     a postulate ( also sometimes called an axiom ) is a statement that is agreed by everyone to be correct . this is useful for creating proofs in mathematics and science , and postulates are often the basic truth of a much larger theory or law . postulates themselves can not be proven , but since they are usually obviously correct this is not a problem . here is a good example of a postulate ( given by euclid in his studies about geometry ) . using this postulate and four others like it , euclid brought a new understanding of geometry to the world , and many people think they are some of the most influential works in geometry even now . sometimes postulates are not obviously correct , but are required for their consequences . the easiest case must be with albert einstein 's postulate that the universe is homogenous . this type of postulate was necessary to make possible some major scientific achievements , but can also be problematic since not self-evident . there are also a few characteristics that all postulates should have .
