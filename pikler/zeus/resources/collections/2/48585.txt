Flagellum     a flagellum ( plural : `` flagella '' ) is a long , whip-like projection of a cell composed of microtubules . they help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion . the flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an “ s ” motion , and is surrounded by cell membrane . flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller cilia . so much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the phylum `` undulipodia '' . previously , margulis had proposed that the ciliates alone should be placed in a phylum `` ciliophora '' . admittedly , the protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms , but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux ( changing ) , protista is still a useful term . cilia and flagella are cell organelles , specialised units which carry out well-defined functions , like mitochondria and plastids . it is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes ( bacteria or archaea ) , and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms ' working together in 'a marriage of convenience ' .
