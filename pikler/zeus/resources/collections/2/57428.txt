Dry suit     a dry suit is a type of protective clothing worn by scuba divers who are swimming in very cold water , such as in the arctic ocean or the north atlantic ocean . a dry suit is similar to a wetsuit , in that it helps to insulate the diver 's body from the cold of the ocean . however , a wetsuit lets water to touch the diver 's body , but a dry suit is sealed so it does not allow water to touch the diver 's body . this means that a dry suit offers more protection from the cold ocean water .
