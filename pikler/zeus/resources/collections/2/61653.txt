Honeydew     honeydew is a liquid sugar that aphids and some scale insects make when they eat plant sap . honeydew is very sticky . to eat plant sap , the aphid or scale insect pushes its mouth parts into the plant . plant sap is under pressure inside the plant . the pressure inside the plant pushes the sap into the insect . sometimes the pressure is so great that the sap is forced out of the rear of the insect . this is how honeydew is made . the honeydew then drops from the insect and makes a sticky layer on the plant . honeydew on plants can cause sooty mould , which is white and appears as powder on the plant . honeydew is collected by some insects , such as some wasps and bees . some honey bees make honeydew into a dark , strong honey , called honeydew honey . honeydew honey is valuable in parts of europe and asia because people think it can be used as a medicine . ants collect honeydew from aphids . many ants even harvest the honeydew directly from the aphids . this helps the aphids , because the ants chase predators , such as lady beetles , away from the aphids .
