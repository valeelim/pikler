Midori Days     midori days is an anime about a girl who falls in love so badly that when she wakes up she 's somehow attached to her love interest 's ( seiji ) right hand . this anime is about how these two adjust to their strange new relationship . high school boy seiji sawamura is really quite a nice guy , but he 's got a bad reputation and the nickname mad dog , earned by copious street fighting , often in pursuit of justice . his right hook is so deadly that it 's got its own nickname-the devil 's right hand . other students avoid him and he can not get a girlfriend . in fact , 20 girls have turned him down . but unknown to him , he has had a secret admirer for the past three years-quiet goody-two-shoes midori kasugano , who is so paralyzed by her shyness that she could not possibly tell him how she feels . then , in the tradition of minami 's sweetheart ( *de ) and the eternity you desire , midori falls into a coma , while seiji finds that instead of a right hand , he now has a living glove puppet-compare to puppet master sakon . a tiny , living and speaking midori is attached to the end of his arm and reveling in his undivided attention . the situation is awkward and embarrassing but the pair find they really do like each other , even when things are switched for an episode and seiji becomes midori 's left hand . the result is a very silly show that still manages to convey how paralyzing shyness can be and how enforced intimacy can reveal unsuspected aspects of a person 's character . based on the manga by kazuro inoue in shonen sunday , itself a surreal cartoon version of the perennial surrogate parenting and reluctant roommates genres of live-action japanese television
