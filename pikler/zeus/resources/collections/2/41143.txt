Salt evaporation pond     a salt evaporation pond ( or saltern pond ) is a man-made shallow pond . usually it is located near the sea . the ponds can be filled with salt water . the water is then left to evaporate . the salt is left behind , and can be harvested . such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals . most of these animals are birds . the color tells how much salt there is left in the water . green colors come from special algae . these algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds ( ponds with little salt in the water ) . in middle to high salinity ponds , an alga called dunaliella salina shifts the color to red . millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid-salinity ponds . other bacteria such as stichococcus also contribute tints . these colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color . other websites . - nasa page on salt ponds - information on the san francisco bay salt ponds
