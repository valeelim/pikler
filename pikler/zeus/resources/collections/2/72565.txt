White Genocide     white genocide ( armenian : ճերմակ or սպիտակ ջարդ , jermag or spitag chart ) is the word western armenians use to describe assimilation in the west . armenians were forcibly deported from their homeland in anatolia during the armenian genocide in 1915-1918 , and never allowed to return . western armenians consider armenians who assimilate within the local population of the country where they were eventually forced to emigrate ( such as france , usa , argentina , etc . ) as lost to their nation due to the continuing exile after the actual genocide itself , and thus consider that lost armenian to be another victim of the genocidal attempt to eliminate the armenians . the term `` white genocide '' was also used for the regions of nagorno-karabakh and nakhichevan where armenians were forcibly deported and cleansed from the regions . other pages . - armenian genocide - sumgait pogrom
