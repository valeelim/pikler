Lamellibrachia     lamellibrachia is a genus of `` cold seep tube worms '' . these are related to giant tube worms . they live on the floor of the oceans , near cold seeps . there crude oil and methane leak out of the ocean floor . the worm forms a symbiosis with certain bacteria which can oxidise sulphides . the worm provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulphide and oxygen . it does this by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a haemoglobin molecule . in return , the bacteria feed the worm . the worms can grow to a length of about 3 metres . together , they form a 'biogenic habitat ' by creating groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals . living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of organism , many of which are found only at these seeps . cold seeps and hydrothermal vents are the only known communities that do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production . unlike hydrothermal vents , which are short-lived environments , cold seeps leak oil and gas slowly . probably because of the cooler temperatures and stability , many cold seep organisms are much longer-lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents . these worm grow very slowly , but can reach lengths of over 10 feet ( 3 metres ) . this means individuals may live over 250 years .
