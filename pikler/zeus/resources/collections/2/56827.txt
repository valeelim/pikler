Monosaccharide     monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates . they consist of one sugar and are usually colorless , water-soluble , crystalline solids . some monosaccharides have a sweet taste . examples of monosaccharides include glucose ( dextrose ) , fructose , galactose , and ribose . monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides like sucrose ( common sugar ) and polysaccharides ( such as cellulose and starch ) . further , each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group ( except for the first and last ) is chiral , giving rise to a number of isomeric forms all with the same chemical formula . for instance , galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses , but they have different chemical and physical properties .
