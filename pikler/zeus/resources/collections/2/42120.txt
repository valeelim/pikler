Antimony     antimony is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol sb . the symbol sb is from the latin name of 'stibium ' for the element . it has the atomic number 51. its atomic mass is 121.8. it is a blue-gray element that is somewhat toxic . antimony has four allotropes . the common allotrope of antimony is a blue-white metalloid . it looks black when powdered . it is brittle , soft , and shiny . yellow and black antimony are unstable nonmetals . yellow antimony is only found at very cold temperatures . it is made by oxidation of stibine . it turns into black antimony when light is shined on it or when it is warmer . black antimony is normally made by heating metallic antimony until it boils and then cooling the vapors very quickly . it can ignite spontaneously ( without any ignition source like a spark or a flame ) . it also corrodes easily . there is another explosive form of antimony that is made by electrolysis of antimony trichloride . this antimony explodes when changing into the metallic form . there is no chemical reaction ; the atoms in the antimony crystal are rearranging themselves . when antimony is talked about it normally means the blue-white metalloid form , since it is most common .
