Tobin tax     a tobin tax is a tax on all trade of currency across borders . the first idea that it could be useful came from the economist james tobin . the tax is meant to put a penalty on short-term speculation in currencies . the proposed tax rate would be low , between 0.1 % to 0.25 % . on august 15 , 1971 , richard nixon told that it would no longer be possible to change the us dollar to gold , so ended the bretton woods system . tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability , and proposed that such a system include a charge on foreign-exchange transactions . professor tobin later received a nobel prize in economics in 1981. the idea was nearly forgotten for more than 20 years . in 1997 ignacio ramonet , editor of `` le monde diplomatique '' , started the debate around the tobin tax again with an editorial titled `` disarming the markets '' . ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax , which was named attac ( association for the taxation of financial transactions for the aid of citizens ) . the tax has then become an issue of the antiglobalization movement and a matter of discussion not only behind academic institutions but even in the streets and in parliaments around the world , such as the uk and france .
