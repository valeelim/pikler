Moksha     moksha is the ultimate goal of personal spiritual development for some schools of hinduism . it is the equivalent of nirvana in buddhism . in the sanskrit language , `` moksha '' means freedom . it is as a state of eternal bliss and emptiness . according to vedanta life is an endless cycle of birth , death , and rebirth into a physical universe that is actually an illusion . hindu scriptures describe moksha as the spiritual liberation from this cycle and the achievement of an eternal and blissful emptiness that transcends all of the joys , pain , and sorrow of the physical body or corporeal life . it is the goal of hindu practitioners to achieve moksha ( freedom/liberation from the material world ) through the practice of yoga viz jnana yoga ( knowledge ) , karma yoga ( work ) , and bhakti yoga ( through reciting prayers and worshiping god ) . moksha is a vedic term . scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the moksha of vedanta hinduism and the nirvana of buddhism , but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically . similarities can be found between moksha and some concepts found in the upanishads . hindu texts explain the moksha as sat-chit-anand [ needs explanation ] .
