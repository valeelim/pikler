Baronet     in the united kingdom a baronet is a man who has the title `` sir '' , like a knight , but who is neither - a senior member of one of the orders of chivalry , sometimes called orders of knighthood , nor - a knight bachelor . unlike the members of the orders of chivalry and a knight bachelor a baronet can pass his title to his children . baronets rank higher than knights , but below barons . some baronets were created in the 1300s , but the modern order of baronets dates from king james i of england . on 22 may 1611 king james i set up the present hereditary order of baronets in england . he made 200 `` gentlemen of good birth '' baronets . he did this partly to reward those people with more than a knighthood , without making them as important as a baron . the other reason was that the king needed money to keep soldiers in ireland . each of the new baronets had to pay Â£1095 , which was the cost of keeping thirty soldiers for three years . in 1619 james i set up the baronetage of ireland , to raise more money .
