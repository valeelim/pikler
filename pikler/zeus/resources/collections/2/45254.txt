Hieroglyph     hieroglyphs ( or hieroglyphics ) are a type of writing which use symbols or pictures to stand for sounds and words . the egyptians , luwians and mayan cultures are among those who used hieroglyphs . they have also been found in turkey , crete , united states and canada . they are thought to have started when pictures were used to tell stories on pots and other artwork . over time they became letters . the word `` hieroglyph '' comes from the greek words ἱερός ( hierós 'sacred ' ) and γλύφειν ( glúphein 'to carve ' or 'to write ' ) , and was first used to mean the egyptian hieroglyphs . the greeks who came to egypt saw the picture letters which were often found carved on house walls , tombs , and monuments . ancient egyptians used pictures to make a phonetic alphabet , so that each sound could be written with a picture-word , a `` phonogram '' or `` pictograph '' . for example , a zig-zag for water n came to mean the letter `` n '' , because the egyptian word for water started with n. this same picture became our letter 'm ' in the latin alphabet , because the semitic word for water started with m , and semitic workers changed the symbols to fit sounds in their own language . in the same way , our latin letter 'n ' came from the hieroglyph for snake d as the word for `` snake '' started with n in semitic . in egyptian , this picture had stood for a sound like english `` j '' because of their word for snake . some pictures came to represent ideas , and these are known as `` ideograms '' .
