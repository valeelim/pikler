Synapsid     synapsids ( 'fused arch ' ) , is a taxonomic class of tetrapods . this class includes mammals and earlier groups related to mammals . synapsids are one of the two major groups of amniotes . the sister group , which gave rise to the reptiles , is the sauropsida . both groups evolved from early amniotes about 345 million years ago during the early or mid carboniferous period . synapsids include the pelycosauria ( pennsylvanian to permian ) , and the therapsida ( lower permian to present ) . the pelycosaurs were dominant on land in the permian , and went under at the permianâ€“triassic extinction event . the therapsids were dominant on land in the lower triassic , but by the upper triassic the dinosaurs had taken over . the mammal-like reptiles are traditionally divided into a primitive group and an advanced group , known respectively as pelycosaurs and therapsids . pelycosaurs are a paraphyletic group of six primitive families of synapsids . they were all rather lizard-like with sprawling gait and possibly horny scutes . the therapsids contain the more advanced synapsids , having a more erect pose and possibly hair , at least in some forms . the latter are the ancestors of mammals . thus both of the two synapsid groups represent evolutionary grades : the pelycosaurs have given rise to the therapsids , who in their turn have given rise to the mammals .
