Turbine     a turbine is an engine that turns fluid movement into energy . simple turbines have a shaft with a blade on it . moving fluids , such as water or air , push the blades so that they turn around with the shaft . the turning movement is most often used to turn a generator . early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels . turbine blades can also be turned to move a fluid . this is how simple propeller airplanes work . a casing can be placed around the turbine to control the movement of the fluid . types . - steam turbine - gas turbine - transonic turbine - jet engine - ceramic turbine - contra-rotating turbine - statorless turbine - shrouded turbine - shroudless turbine - bladeless turbine - water turbine - wind turbine - impulse turbine - velocity compound curtis other websites . - turbine introductory math - turbines jet powered 1/16 scale airbus a330
