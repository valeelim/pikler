Yersinia pestis     yersinia pestis is a bacillus . it is a bacterium . it has been identified as the infectious agent of bubonic plague . this bacterium also causes other forms of plague- septicemic plague and pneumonic plague . these three forms of the plague have been responsible for a high death toll in many epidemics throughout human history . these diseases are believed to be the cause of the black death . because of the black death , about one third ( one of three ) people in europe died . this was between 1347 and 1353. the bacillus was discovered by the physician alexandre yersin during an epidemic of the plague in hong kong , in 1894. yersin worked for the pasteur institute at the time . originally , the microoganism was named `` pasteurella pestis '' . it was renamed in 1967. currently , three varieties of y. pestis are known . historians are currently divided about the role of `` y. pestis '' in the black death . some historians said that the black death spread far too fast . therefore `` y. pestis '' could not have caused it . dna from `` y. pestis '' has been found in the teeth of some of the victims of the black death . for this reason , `` y. pestis '' must have been at least a factor in some ( but not necessarily all ) european plague epidemics .
