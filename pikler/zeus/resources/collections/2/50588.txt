Crucifixion     crucifixion is a way to execute ( kill ) someone , usually because they have committed a crime . it was used as a capital punishment by the government of rome . a prisoner was beaten with whips , and made to carry their own cross . they were either tied or nailed to the cross . the romans used different types of crosses : t-shaped , x-shaped , and sometimes just trees . it killed people by making them bleed , go into shock , and making it hard for them to breathe , eventually dying of suffocation . some of the people would live for several days before dying . the roman soldiers ( which were like the police of that time ) would often break the legs of the criminal to speed it up . the most famous person to have been crucified was jesus christ , the son of god according to the christian religion . he was crucified along with two thieves . the cross later became a symbol of christianity . six of the twelve apostles of jesus were also crucified later on , but most of them asked to be crucified in a different way from jesus . for example , andrew ( who later became the patron saint of scotland ) was crucified on an x-shaped cross . in the year 337 ad , emperor constantine i abolished crucifixion in the roman empire .
