Normal distribution     \ ; \exp\left ( -\frac { \left ( x-\mu\right ) ^2 } { 2\sigma^2 } \right ) \ ! < /math > | the normal distribution is a probability distribution . it is also called gaussian distribution because it was discovered by carl friedrich gauss . the normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution . it is very important in many fields of science . normal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form . these distributions differ in their `` location '' and `` scale '' parameters : the mean ( `` average '' ) of the distribution defines its location , and the standard deviation ( `` variability '' ) defines the scale . the standard normal distribution ( also known as the z distribution ) is the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one ( the green curves in the plots to the right ) . it is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell . many values follow a normal distribution . this is because of the central limit theorem , which says that if an event is the sum of other random events , it will be normally distributed . some examples include :
