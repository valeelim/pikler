Phenylketonuria     phenylketonuria ( pku ) is a genetic disorder ( a disease a person is born with ) where a person 's body can not break down an amino acid called phenylalanine . amino acids are necessary to make proteins , an important part of the human body . phenylalanine only comes from the food we eat ; our bodies do not make any by themselves . average people produce an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase in their bodies . when they ingest phenylalanine , the body can not use it , so this enzyme changes phenylalanine into tyrosine , which the body can use . in people with pku , very little or no enzyme is made . since the phenylalanine they eat is not being changed into tyrosine , it builds up in their bodies . this can cause problems with the way their bodies work . symptoms vary from person to person . because of the rarity of pku , many symptoms go undiagnosed or unrecognized . in addition , there are variations in the categories of pku individuals . there are untreated , early treated , late treated , those returning to diet , hyperphe , classical pku , uncontrolled , and highly controlled . for your average infant a doctor will diagnose pku with a quick blood test . their symptom will be high phe levels . if that infant goes undiagnosed for weeks or months , he/she may start to exhibit some or all of the following symptoms for uncontrolled pku . the symptoms include :
