Tensile strength     tensile strength is a measurement of the force required to pull something such as rope , wire , or a structural beam to the point where it breaks . the tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can take before failure , for example breaking . there are three typical definitions of tensile strength : - yield strength - the stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation . this is not a sharply defined point . yield strength is the stress which will cause a permanent deformation of 0.2 % of the original dimension . - ultimate strength - the maximum stress a material can withstand . - breaking strength - the stress coordinate on the stress-strain curve at the point of rupture . some typical tensile strengths of some materials : - note : multiwalled carbon nanotubes have the highest tensile strength of any material yet measured , with labs producing them at a tensile strength of 63 gpa , still well below their theoretical limit of 300 gpa . however as of 2004 , no macroscopic object constructed of carbon nanotubes has had a tensile strength remotely approaching this figure , or substantially exceeding that of high-strength materials like kevlar .
