Three Laws of Robotics     the three laws of robotics are three rules which isaac asimov thought would be programmed into robots . the rules assume that robots will be human-type machines , able to walk about and do things . asimov called these robots `` positronic robots '' . the laws are presented in his 'robot ' series of short stories and novels . the first mention of the laws is in asimov 's short story `` runaround '' ( written in 1942 ) . 1. a robot may not injure a human being or , by failing to act , allow a human being to come to harm . 1. a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings , except where carrying out those orders would break the first law . 1. a robot must protect its own existence , as long as the things it does to protect itself do not break the first or second law . later , asimov added the zeroth law : `` a robot may not harm humanity , or , by inaction , allow humanity to come to harm '' ; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this . according to the `` oxford english dictionary , '' the passage in asimov 's short story `` liar ! '' ( 1941 ) that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word `` robotics '' . asimov was not aware of this at the time ; he assumed the word already existed by analogy with `` mechanics , '' `` hydraulics , '' and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge .
