Bretons     the bretons are a distinct ethnic group in the region of brittany in france . they trace much of their heritage to groups of brythons who settled the area from south western britain in the 4th-6th centuries . the region of brittany is named after them and many speak `` brezhoneg '' , a brythonic language closely related to cornish and a bit more distantly to welsh . the breton language as such is part of the insular celtic language group . in eastern brittany , a regional `` langue d'o√Øl '' named gallo developed ; it shares certain points of vocabulary , idiom , and pronunciation with breton .
