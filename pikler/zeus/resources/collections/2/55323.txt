Budding     budding is a method of asexual reproduction . with budding , a new organism grows on another one . it stays attached , while it grows . only when it is fully grown does it detach from the parent organism . since the reproduction is asexual , the newly created organism is a clone and is genetically identical to the parent organism . budding is very common in plants and fungi . sometimes it can also be found with animals , for example with hydras or sponges .
