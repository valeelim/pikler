Hydrothermal vent     a hydrothermal vent ( which is also called a black smoker ) is an opening in the surface of the earth . there are gases that rise through it , which heat the water around it . there are many such vents on earth . if they are on land , they are usually hot springs , geysers , or fumaroles . many archaea and bacteria live near hydrothermal vents , which are underwater . they support giant tube worms , clams and shrimp , and many other eukaryotes . deep sea organisms have no access to sunlight , so they must depend on nutrients in the chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live . compared to the surrounding sea floor , however , hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater . hydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food . these bacteria use sulfur compounds , particularly hydrogen sulfide , a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms , to produce organic material through the process of chemosynthesis .
