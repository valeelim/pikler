Valkyrie     valkyries ( old norse : `` valkyrja '' `` choosers of the slain '' ) are lesser goddesses in norse mythology . they serve the chief god odin . their task is to choose those who have died in the most heroic way in battle . the valkyrie then carries the chosen one off to valhalla . this chosen one would then be called einherjars . they would then be shared between odin and freyja . they would fight at odin 's side at ragnarök , the battle at the end of the world . in valhalla , the valkyries would also serve drink and care for the well-being of the feasting warriors . the old norse people thought that valkyries rode giant wolves , and that they had black wings which correspond to ravens ; these two creatures both scavenge corpses on the battlefield symbolizing death and destruction . with the spread of christianity the idea of what a valkyrie was like changed more and more to a romantic description of a beautiful woman . richard wagner composed some operas , featuring valkyries ( german : `` walküren '' , singular : `` walküre '' ) . these operas are `` die walküre '' , `` siegfried '' , and `` götterdämmerung '' . they feature a story of a valkyrie brünnhilde , her punishment for disobeying her father , and her falling in love with siegfried . the music for the opening of act three of `` die walküre '' is very famous . it is called the `` ride of the valkyries '' .
