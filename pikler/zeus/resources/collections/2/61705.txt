Guild     a guild is an association of craftspeople or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a town . many groups of people started as guilds , including scholars , and religious guilds . many modern organisations , like universities , started as guilds . however , the basic idea of a guild was to control the training and practice of a trade or business . in europe , guilds were given authority by the monarch . new young members had to serve as apprentices to a master for a certain length of time ( such as seven years ) . at the end they became full members of the guild , and could set up on their own , and take apprentices of their own . that is the way the european world worked up to and including the first part of the 20th century . there were guilds of weavers and dyers in the wool trade , of masons and architects in the building trade . there were guilds of painters , blacksmiths , bakers , butchers , and so on . the corporation of the city of london includes the `` livery companies '' . these companies were originally guilds . the senior members of the livery companies choose the lord mayor of london , the sheriffs and certain other officers .
