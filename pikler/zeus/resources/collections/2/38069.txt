Allotropy     allotropy ( or allotropism ) is when a chemical element can exist in two or more different forms in the same physical state or phase . these different forms are called allotropes . therefore , an allotrope is a different structure in which an element appears . this happens when the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different way . for example , the allotropes of carbon include : - diamond , where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a four-cornered lattice arrangement ; - graphite , where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a six-sided lattice ; - graphene , single sheets of graphite ; and - fullerenes , where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spheres , cylinders or egg-shaped formations only some elements have allotropes . the term `` allotropy '' is used for elements only , not for compounds . the more general term , used for any crystalline material , is polymorphism . allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same state ( i.e. , different solid , liquid or gas forms ) ; these different states are not , themselves , considered examples of allotropy .
