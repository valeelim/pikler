Duel     a duel is a fight between two people who have similar deadly weapons and have agreed to a set of rules before the fight takes place . the fight is usually about a matter of honor . the goal of a duel is not usually to kill the opponent but to restore the honor of the man who declared the duel . duels are not official laws , they are carried out by individuals . duels were practiced from the 15th to 20th century in western societies . for example , in 1804 in the united states the politicians aaron burr and alexander hamilton had a duel . since the american civil war , all u.s. states have criminalized dueling , with punishments for dueling ranging from not being allowed to run for public office to the death penalty . dueling was outlawed because groups against dueling formed and were successful . duels could be fought with swords or pistols . the person who felt offended or dishonored had to `` challenge '' his opponent to a duel . this was usually done by throwing his glove down in front of the opponent or by hitting him in the face with a glove . each person had to then find a person to be his `` second '' . the job of the seconds was to choose a place to duel and to decide whether or not the weapons were equal .
