Second law of thermodynamics     the second law of thermodynamics says that when energy changes from one form to another form , or matter moves freely , entropy ( disorder ) increases , in a closed system . differences in temperature , pressure , and density tend to even out horizontally after a while . due to the force of gravity , density and pressure do not even out vertically . density and pressure on the bottom will be more than at the top . entropy is a measure of spread of matter and energy to everywhere they have access . the most common wording for the second law of thermodynamics is essentially due to `` rudolf clausius '' : in other words , everything tries to maintain the same temperature over time . there are many statements of the second law which use different terms , but are all equal . another statement by clausius is : heat can not of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body . an equivalent statement by lord kelvin is : a transformation whose only final result is to convert heat , extracted from a source at constant temperature , into work , is impossible .
