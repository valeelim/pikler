Ornamentation (music)    ornamentation ( music ) in music , ornaments are notes which are added to the main notes of a piece of music in order to make it more interesting . there are several types of ornaments , including trills and slides . music of the renaissance and baroque periods have lots of ornaments . the composer usually shows what ornaments are needed by little signs written above the notes . in some pieces , especially in slow movements , the composers often did not show the ornaments that are needed : they expected the performers to put them in themselves . understanding the correct way of ornamenting music used to be a very important part of the art of singing or playing a musical instrument . the correct way of ornamenting music varied a lot from one country to another and from one century to another . ideas about how music should be performed kept changing . it is important for musicians today , who want to play music from these older periods , to know as much as possible about historical musical styles . sometimes we have to make guesses about what a composer might have wanted . fortunately several composers and music theorists wrote books about how to play ornaments . this enables us to understand the different performing styles . sometimes composers wrote a preface ( introduction ) in their music to explain to the performer how to play the ornaments they had written .
