Orbital eccentricity     in astrodynamics , orbital eccentricity shows how much the shape of an object 's orbit is different from a circle . eccentricity ( formula_1 ) is defined for all circular , elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic orbits . it can take the following values : - for circular orbits : formula_1 is equal to zero , - for elliptic orbits : formula_1 is more than zero but less than 1 , - for parabolic trajectories : formula_1 is equal to 1 , - for hyperbolic trajectories : formula_1 is more than 1. use this formula : formula_6 , where e is the eccentricity , r is the apoapsis ( far point ) of the object 's orbit , and r is the periapsis ( near point ) of the object 's orbit . the near and far points are the apsides .
