DDT     ddt is a well-known pesticide . the abbreviation stands for dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane , one of its names . the swiss chemist paul hermann m√ºller was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1948 , for his discovery . in the 1960s there was a study that questioned if it was good to spread large amounts of ddt indiscriminately . the study also found that ddt could cause cancer . ddt is also highly poisonous to birds and other animals further up the food chain . this is why ddt was replaced by other pesticides . the stockholm convention which took effect in 2004 , restricts the use of ddt to vector control . the convention does not affect the use of ddt for public health issues . this is because there are very few affordable alternatives . ddt is still widely used in india , north korea and possibly elsewhere. < ref name= '' ddtbp.1/2 '' > < /ref >
