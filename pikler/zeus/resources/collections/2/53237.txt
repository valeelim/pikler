Midlands     midlands could be in general the central region of any territory . in britain and ireland , the term is reseved for the `` middle '' in the north-south ( `` vertical '' ) direction ( countries that are oriented more east-west use `` mid '' with a `` horizontal '' meaning . ) in the united kingdom , scotland and england both have midland areas that are famous enough to be called the `` midlands '' ( as a name , not just as a description ) . in wales the term for the central region is `` mid wales '' ( not `` the welsh midlands '' ) . the rest of this article deals with the english region known simply as the midlands , which is more or less the territory of the early-medieval kingdom of mercia . the area lies between southern england , northern england , east anglia and wales , and includes the counties of derbyshire , herefordshire , leicestershire , lincolnshire , northamptonshire , nottinghamshire , rutland , shropshire , staffordshire , warwickshire , the west midlands and worcestershire . the 2001 census also included norfolk , suffolk and cambridgeshire in the midlands but these are not generally considered to be part of the midlands but east anglia .
