Ditch     a ditch is created to channel water and can be described as a small or moderate depression . a ditch can be used for drainage , to drain water from low lying areas , alongside roadways or fields , or to channel water from a more distant source for plant irrigation . a trench can be defined as a long narrow ditch . ditches are commonly seen around farmland , especially in areas that have required drainage , such as the fens in the uk and the pro-water management the netherlands . roadside ditches can provide a hazard to motorists , especially in poor weather conditions . in military engineering and fortification , a distinction is made between a ditch and a trench . a ditch is a barrier , designed to slow down or break up an attacking force , while a trench is a cover , intended to provide protection to the defenders . in medieval fortification , a ditch was often constructed in front of a defensive wall . when filled with water , such a defensive ditch is called a moat . today ditches are of no importance as an obstacle for persons , but are still often used as anti-vehicle obstacles .
