Angeln     modern angeln , ( danish : angel ; latin : anglia , which also means in direct translation from latin : england ) , is a peninsula in schleswig-holstein , germany . ancient angeln may have been somewhat larger than the angeln of today , but following the ancient sources it included the territory of modern angeln . angeln has an importance far beyond its small area , as it seems to have been the original home of the angles who invaded the southern part of great britain , which was named after them , england . and so the name of the major world language , english , seems to have taken its name from this little region . following the departure of the angles from anglia about 350 , the region was occupied by danish settlers not later than the 8th century . related pages . - angles - germanic peoples - anglo-saxons other websites . - crop circles in angeln - angeln cattle - tourism in angeln - cinarchea ( archaeological films of schlesvig-holstein ) - county and municipal flags ( schleswig-holstein , germany ) - genealogy in schleswig holstein , germany
