History of the world     the history of the world is about the study of the cultural achievements of the entire human race . this includes the time from prehistory to the end of the 20th century and excludes natural history before the development of human beings . modern human beings , called `` homo sapiens '' ( 'wise man ' ) have lived since about 250,000 years ago . at this time there were other `` species '' of human that were a little different to `` homo sapiens '' . these include `` homo erectus '' ( 'standing man ' ) and `` homo neanderthalensis '' ( 'man from neanderthal ' ) . the theory of human evolution is that humans slowly developed from other earlier species of human-like creatures . biologists believe that `` homo sapiens '' evolved in africa and spread from there to all other parts of the world , replacing `` homo neanderthalensis '' in europe and the `` homo erectus '' in asia . `` homo neanderthalensis '' , generally called neanderthal man , has this name because the cranium of a skull was found in the neanderthal valley in 1856 : it was different from a modern skull . skeletons had been found in other places since then . they had lived before modern humans , and had the knowledge to use tools and fire . when ancient stone tools are found , their style often shows whether they were made by `` homo sapiens '' or whether they were made by a neanderthal ( see palaeolithic ) . by the end of the stone age , it is believed that `` homo sapiens '' were the only type of humans left .
