Chain (unit)    chain ( unit ) a chain is a unit for measuring length . it is part of the imperial , united states customary and spanish systems . people usually used it for measuring land . the short way of writing chains is ch . there are a number of different definitions of the chain , from 50 to 100 feet long . in the imperial system , one chain is equal to 66 feet or 20.1168 metres . this is also called a `` gunter 's chain '' , `` surveyor 's chain '' or `` land chain '' . the chain was originally called an `` acre 's breadth '' because it was the width of a acre , while a furlong was the length . the clergy edmund gunter created a measuring device called a chain . the chain was long . it was divided by 100 in small metal links . the links were made of thick wire with a loop at each end . the links were connected to each other by three rings . there were brass handles at each end . people folded the chain up , link by link , and carried it in their hand . the name `` chain '' comes from these devices . the unit was once important in everyday life in united kingdom and its colonies and in the united states . people used it when they made maps and planned out cities and towns . land was surveyed and measured using these chains . even after more accurate ways of measuring land were created , many people continued to use the chain as a unit because land had already been surveyed in this method for so long .
