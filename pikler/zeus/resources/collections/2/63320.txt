Chemical property     in chemistry , a property is any aspect of a substance which is only seen by means of a chemical reaction . simply speaking , chemical properties can not be determined just by viewing or touching the substance . this is different from a physical property , which can be discovered without changing the substance 's chemical structure . usually a chemical property is discovered by changing the substance 's internal structure . when a substance goes under a chemical reaction , the properties will change drastically , resulting in chemical change . however , a catalytic property would also be a chemical property . chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications . they can be used to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances . examples of chemical properties . - reactivity with other chemicals . - toxicity . - coordination number . - flammability . - enthalpy of formation . - heat of combustion . - oxidation states . - chemical stability
