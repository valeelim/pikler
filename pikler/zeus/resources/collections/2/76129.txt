Hominidae     the hominids are members of the biological family hominidae ( the great apes ) . this includes humans , chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans . `` great ape '' is a common name rather than a taxonomic label and there are differences in usage . sometimes it seems to exclude humans ( `` humans and the great apes '' ) ; at other times it includes them ( `` humans and non-human great apes '' ) . `` homo sapiens '' is definitely a hominid , as judged by all modern reference works . hominids range in weight from 48 kg to 270 kg . males are larger than females . hominids are primates with no tails , robust bodies and well-developed forearms . their thumbs ( and big toes , except in humans ) oppose the fingers , and form a grip . all digits have flattened nails . at present , the hominidae includes four genera and five species . its nonhuman members are restricted to rain forests in equatorial africa , sumatra and borneo . however , if fossil hominids are included , then all the australopithecines and the genus `` homo '' are included . hominid fossils date from the miocene . they are known from asia , and from europe . neanderthals were in europe and western asia for a long time ( at least half a million years ) before the emergence of our species . asia had a huge version of the orangutan : `` gigantopithecus '' .
