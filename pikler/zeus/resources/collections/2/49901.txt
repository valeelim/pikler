Graviton     a graviton is a hypothetical particle that 'transfers ' gravitation 's force ( particles like this are known as gauge bosons ) from its field . gravitons have never been observed , directly or indirectly , however , there have been several theories that use gravitons to explain certain phenomena . for example , a theory that describes black holes by combining quantum mechanics and gravity , has been advanced by georgi dvali and cesar gomez , which suggests a black hole is `` an overpacked bucket of gravitons '' . there are some theories that suggest that gravitons would make up a new group of particles , `` attraction particles '' . cern is currently smashing more particles using the large hadron collider to try to find this particle . the graviton applies a tiny force as it impacts the nuclei of atoms . all atoms themselves have these graviton particles in orbit around them . if you gather a lot of atoms together the population of orbiting gravitons increases proportionately . as a result a large asteroid for example with have more gravity than a small one ( source alfred herman schrader ) .
