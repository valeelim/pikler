The Protectorate     in british history , the protectorate was the period 1653–59 during which the commonwealth of england , scotland and ireland was governed by a lord protector . before the protectorate , england ( and then scotland and ireland ) had been ruled directly by parliament since it had in 1649. the rump parliament had been sent away in april 1653 by soldiers led by oliver cromwell . although the replacement , the barebones parliament ( july–december 1653 ) , was nominated by cromwell and the leaders of the army , it was just as difficult to control . the post of lord protector was created by a constitution passed in december 1653. cromwell got this position for life . although the constitution divided power between the lord protector , the council of state and parliament , in practice there was again the strong executive power that had been absent since the end of the monarchy . cromwellian government has been called ‘ one of the first experiments in ( `` de facto '' ) military dictatorship ’ ( abbott ) .
