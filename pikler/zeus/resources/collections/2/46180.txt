Canon (music)    canon ( music ) a canon is a piece of voices ( or instrumental parts ) sing or play the same music starting at different times . a round is a type of canon , but in a round each voice , when it finishes , can start at the beginning again so that the piece can go “ round and round ” . perhaps the most well-known canon is the pachelbel 's canon written by johann pachelbel . there are different kinds of canon . canons can be described according to distances between the entries of the voices . if the second voice starts one bar ( one measure ) after the first voice , this is called a “ canon at the bar ” . if it starts after only half a bar , it is called a “ canon at the half-bar ” . it is even possible to have very close canons , e.g . “ canon at the quaver ( eighth note ) ” . olivier messiaen wrote a 3 part canon at the quaver in his `` '' ' for violin and piano . the pianist ’ s right hand ( playing chords ) , his left hand and the violinist are the three parts . canons can also be described according to the intervals between two voices . if one voice starts on a c and the next voice starts the same tune on an f above this is a “ canon at the fourth ” ( because the interval ( distance ) from c to f is called a “ perfect fourth ” ) . if the second voice has the tune upside down ( inversion ) this is called “ canon in inversion ” . if the second voice has the tune at half the speed ( each note being twice as long ) this is a “ canon in augmentation ” or an “ augmented canon ” . the opposite is a “ canon in diminution ” .
