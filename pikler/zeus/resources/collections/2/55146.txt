Acts of the Apostles     the acts of the apostles ( greek `` praxeis apostolon '' ) is a book of the bible , which now is the fifth in the new testament . it is often simply called acts . acts tells the story of the early christian church , with particular interest for the ministry of the twelve apostles and of paul of tarsus . the early chapters in jerusalem , report jesus 's resurrection , his ascension , the day of pentecost , and the start of the twelve apostles ' ministry . the later chapters report paul 's conversion , his ministry , and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to rome . most people think that the author of acts also wrote the gospel of luke , as acts 1:1 refers to 'the former treatise have i made , theophilus , of all that jesus began both to do and teach ' . the traditional view is that both the two books were written `` c. '' 60 by a companion of paul named luke . many theologians still think so . but some think the books were written by an unknown author at a later date , sometime between 80 and 150 .
