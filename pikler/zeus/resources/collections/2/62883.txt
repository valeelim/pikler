Gribble     a gribble is any species of marine isopod from the family limnoriidae . they are mostly pale white and small ( 1-4 mm long ) crustaceans . the term gribble was originally used for the wood-boring species , especially the first species described from norway by rathke in 1799 , `` limnoria lignorum '' . the limnoriidae have species which bore into seaweed and sea grass , as well as wood borers . there are three genera , `` paralimnoria '' , `` limnoria '' and `` lynseia '' . `` limnoria '' has species in most seas . those gribbles able to bore into living marine plants are thought to have evolved from a wood ( dead plant ) boring species . gribbles bore into wood and plant material for food . the cellulose of wood is digested . the most destructive species are `` limnoria lignorum '' , `` l. tripunctata '' and `` l. quadripunctata '' . according to an expert , they are the only animals able to make a cellulase to dissolve plant cell walls . other animals that eat plant fibres make use of bacteria in their gut to produce the enzyme . gribbles do not . this has led some biologists to think of biofuels .
