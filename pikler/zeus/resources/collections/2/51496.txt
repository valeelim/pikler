Cuttlefish     cuttlefish are marine cephalopod molluscs . they belong to the same class as squid , octopodes and the nautilus . cuttlefish have an internal shell ( called a cuttlebone ) , large eyes , and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with finely toothed suckers , with which they grab their prey . cuttlefish eat small molluscs , crabs , shrimp , fish and other cuttlefish . various sharks and fish prey on them . they live about 1 to 2 years . cuttlefish have an internal cuttlebone , made of calcium carbonate . it is porous , full of small holes , the buoyancy of the cuttlebone can change , allowing the cuttlefish to go lower or higher by changing the amount of gas and liquid in its chambers . the cuttlebone of each species has a distinct shape , size , and pattern of ridges or texture . cuttlebones are used by jewellers and silversmiths as moulds for casting small objects . they are probably better known today as the material given to pet birds as a source of calcium . the cuttlebone is only found in cuttlefish , and is one of the features that makes them different from squid and other molluscs .
