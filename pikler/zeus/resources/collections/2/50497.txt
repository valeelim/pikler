Hydroponics     hydroponics or hydroculture is the method of growing plants in the nutrients that they need instead of soil . the plant foods are simply put into water instead and it makes a solution for the plants to live in . vegetables , flowers and herbs can all be grown in water . it is quite an old idea . the earliest published work on growing terrestrial plants without soil was the 1627 book `` sylva sylvarum '' by francis bacon , printed a year after his death . water culture became a popular research technique after that . in 1929 , william frederick gericke of the university of california at berkeley began publicly promoting that solution culture be used for agricultural crop production . there are many ways to grow plants in this way . here are some examples . this puts or floats the plants in water containing nutrients into a container . the water is renewed by a control system to prevent the plants ' roots from becoming dry . the water does not flow through the container but remains static . because the water is still algae often grows , using nutrients and covering the plants roots so that they are not able to take in the nutrients so well . algae growth can be reduced by using some method to prevent light from reaching the roots , for example , black plastic , or aluminium foils . the static solution has to be changed every week or two to ensure it has the correct amount of nutrients .
