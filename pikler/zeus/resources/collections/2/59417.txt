Solvent     a solvent is a substance , that becomes a solution by dissolving a solid , liquid , or gaseous solute . a solvent is usually a liquid , but can also be a solid or gas . the most common solvent in everyday life is water . most other commonly-used solvents are organic ( carbon-containing ) chemicals . these are called organic solvents . solvents usually have a low boiling point and evaporate easily or can be removed by distillation , thereby leaving the dissolved substance behind . solvents should therefore not react chemically with the dissolved compounds - they have to be inert . solvents can also be used to extract soluble compounds from a mixture , the most common example is the brewing of coffee or tea with hot water . solvents are usually clear and colorless liquids and many have a characteristic smell . the concentration of a solution is the amount of compound that is dissolved in a certain volume of solvent . the solubility is the maximal amount of compound that is soluble in a certain volume of solvent at a specified temperature .
