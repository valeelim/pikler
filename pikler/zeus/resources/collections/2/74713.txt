Hydrogen atom     a hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen . its parts are a single negatively-charged electron that circles a single positively-charged nucleus of the hydrogen atom . the nucleus of hydrogen consists of only a single proton ( in the case of hydrogen-1 or `` protium '' ) , `` or '' it may also include one or more neutrons ( giving deuterium , tritium , and other isotopes ) . the electron is bound to the nucleus by the coulomb force . hydrogen-1 , also known as protium or `` light hydrogen '' is the main component of natural hydrogen . other pages . - hydrogen - quantum mechanics section 4.2 deals with the hydrogen atom specifically , but all of chapter 4 is relevant . other websites . - physics of hydrogen atom on scienceworld - interactive graphical representation of orbitals - applet which allows viewing of all sorts of hydrogenic orbitals - the hydrogen atom : wave functions , and probability density `` pictures '' - basic quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom
