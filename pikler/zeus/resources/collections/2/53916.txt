Paleontology     palaeontology or paleontology is the study of fossils of living things , and their phylogeny ( evolutionary relationships ) . it depends on basic sciences such as zoology , botany and historical geology . the term palaeobiology implies that the study will investigate the palaeoecology of the groups in question . in `` palaeozoology '' , the evolution of those phyla with fossil records are studied : see list of animal phyla . in `` palaeobotany '' , fossil plants are studied . in historical geology the formation , sequence and dating of rock strata give information about past environments . a fossil is any kind of life that is more than ten thousand years old and preserved in any form that we can study today . the fossil record is always incomplete , and later discoveries may extend the known survival of a group . see lazarus taxon . some palaeontologists study fossils of microorganisms , living things that are too small to see without a microscope , while other palaeontologists study fossils of giant dinosaurs .
