Watermill     a watermill is an engine that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour or lumber production , or metal shaping ( rolling , grinding or wire drawing ) . a watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant . the watermill was invented in china during the han dynasty ( 202 bc 220 ad ) in order to grind grain as well as to power piston bellows of a blast furnace in forging cast iron . a text from 20 ad ( during the usurpation of wang mang ) states that the legendary mythological king known as fu xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar , or tilt-hammer device ( see trip hammer ) . in 31 ad , a chinese engineer named du shi ( wade-giles : tu shih ) `` '' invented the first water-powered bellows . this was a complicated machine with gears , axles , and levers that was powered by a waterwheel '' , '' . this invention aided the forging of cast iron smelted from the blast furnace . du shi 's invention was continued by chinese in subsequent dynastic periods of china , although the bellows of his device were improved upon in later periods ( from leather bellows to wooden-fan bellows ) .
