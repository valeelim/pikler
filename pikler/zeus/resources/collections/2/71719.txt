Wi-Fi     wi-fi is a way of connecting to a computer network using radio waves instead of wires . the wi-fi alliance says wi-fi is any `` wireless local area network '' ( wlan ) that follows the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ' ( ieee ) 802.11 specification . a wi-fi device can work with any wi-fi network anywhere in the world . the word `` wi-fi '' is a play on words with hi-fi , and was invented to replace the name `` ieee 802.11b direct sequence spread spectrum '' . there are many types of wi-fi standards , known as 802.11 a , b , g , n , and recently ac & ad . these specifications are different in terms of speed and how far away you can use them . as of 2013 , most wireless networks use one of two radio frequency bands . these are not the only two bands , but are the most used . one of the bands is at around 2.4 ghz , and the other is at 5 ghz . both of these have benefits and drawbacks : the 2.4 ghz band is widely used , and devices are usually cheaper . microwave ovens , dect telephones and other wireless devices also use the 2.4 ghz band , and sometimes cause interference which slows transmissions . the 5 ghz band has more frequencies and usually less interference , but there are more rules for using it . in some places , the 5 ghz band may not be used outdoors . because fewer devices use the 5 ghz band , devices that do are often more expensive .
