Hellenistic art     the art of the hellenistic time ( 400 b.c . to 0 b.c , a long time in the past , in greece ) is sculpture and painting and other things . for a long time , people said that the art of that time was not good . pliny the elder talked about the greek sculpture of the classical time ( 500 b.c . - 323 b.c. , the time before the hellenistic time ) and then said `` cessavit deinde ars '' ( `` then art stopped '' ) . but much good art is from the hellenistic time . many people know about the sculptures laoco√∂n ( in the picture ) and venus de milo and winged victory of samothrace . now more people have looked at writing about the hellenistic time . people discovered art from the hellenistic time at vergina and other places . now people can see that the art of the hellenistic time is very good art . one of the things that made the hellenistic time different from other times was the division of alexander the great 's country into smaller parts . in every part there was a family of leaders . the ptolemies had egypt ; the seleucids had mesopotamia , the attalids had pergamon , and other leaders had other parts . every family of leaders gave money for art in a way that was different from the way the city-states did it . they made big cities and complex groups of buildings in a way that most city-states had already stopped doing by 500 bc . this way of making buildings was new for greece . this way was not to try to change or fix a natural place , but to make the buildings fit the natural place . there were many places for pleasure , for example many theatres and places to walk . the hellenistic countries were lucky because they had much empty space where they could make big new cities . some of their new cities were antioch , pergamon , and seleucia on the tigris .
