Bypass (road)    bypass ( road ) a bypass is a road or highway that goes around a town or village so that traffic which is passing that town does not have to go through the town centre . bypasses are good because they reduces the amount of traffic in the centre where the people live and work . it makes it much safer for them to cross the roads , and reduces pollution . it is better for the vehicles passing the town because their journey is made quicker . people are not always happy when a bypass is built . the main objections people sometimes have is that a new road uses up a lot of land . also , some people who have businesses in the town ( especially filling stations and restaurants ) may think that they will not get so many customers . if there are no strong rules that control the use of land , buildings are built along a bypass , making it an ordinary town road so that it might become just as busy as a town street again . a road that goes all the way around the town in a large circle is called a ring road . the m25 is a ring road for london .
