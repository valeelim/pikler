Crystallization     crystallization is the way that atoms gather to make tightly bonded or connected groups . it separates a solid from a liquid or sometimes from a gas . crystallization can be from a melt or from a solution , and can be natural or artificial . faster crystallization can make smaller crystals as in basalt , and slower can make bigger ones as in granite . artificial crystallization is a technique that forms solid crystals from a homogeneous solution . for crystallization to occur the solution at hand ought to be supersaturated . put simply , the solution should contain more solute molecules than it would under ordinary conditions . this can be achieved by various methodsâ€”solvent evaporation , cooling , chemical reaction , 'drowning ' being the most common ones used in industrial practice . to make things clear we can use a simple example . we take a bowl of water to which we add sugar crystals . we keep adding sugar to it until we reach a stage when no more crystals can be dissolved . this solution so obtained is a saturated one . it is interesting to note that we can dissolve more crystals to this particular saturated solution by heating it ( since solubility of solutes increases with increase in temperature , although exceptional cases occur ) . this elevation in temperature causes more sugar crystals to dissolve in it ( thus forming a supersaturated solution ) , but when the temperature of the solution is allowed to attain equilibrium with the surroundings , the solubility of the solute decreases ( because the temperature of the solution has decreased ) and the 'excess ' sugar so added crystallizes out . this process essentially illustrates the simplest of supersaturation techniques .
