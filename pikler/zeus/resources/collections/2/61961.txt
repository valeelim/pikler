Ascension     ascension is a christian holiday . the word `` ascension '' means `` going up '' . according to the story told in the bible , jesus ascended ( went up ) to heaven with his apostles . the holiday is celebrated forty days after his resurrection . the story tells that jesus ' body went to heaven , and that in heaven he sits at the right-hand side of god the father . ascension day is officially celebrated on a thursday . however , not all countries hold the feast on this day . it is one of the ecumenical feasts . all christians celebrate this feast , much like easter and pentecost . it is a very important feast in the calendar of the christian church . in some countries ( at least in austria , belgium , colombia , denmark , finland , france , germany ( since the 1930s ) , haiti , iceland , indonesia , liechtenstein , luxembourg , madagascar , namibia , the netherlands , norway , sweden , switzerland and vanuatu ) it is a public holiday ; germany also holds its father 's day on the same date . the eastern orthodox church calculates the date of easter differently , so the eastern orthodox celebration of ascension will usually be after the western observance ( either one week , or four weeks , or five weeks later ; but occasionally on the same day ) . the earliest possible date for the feast is may 13 ( of the western calendar ) , and the latest possible date is june 16. some of the oriental orthodox churches , however , observe ascension on the same date as the western churches .
