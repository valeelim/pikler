Báb     siyyid `alí muḥammad ( 20 october 1819 – 9 july 1850 ) was a merchant from shíráz , iran who started a version of shia islam called bábism . after he started the religion , he changed his name to báb . people who believe in the báb are called bábís , and they believe that the báb was a prophet . bábís also believe that the báb is the qá'im that shi'as believe will come in the future . the báb wrote hundreds of letters and books teaching who he was and what the rules of his religion were . the báb 's new rules replaced the `` sharia law '' or muslim rules for his followers . bábism became very large ; over ten thousand people believed in the báb . the shi'a clergy , or leaders of islam in iran hated the báb and tried to harm people who followed his religion . in 1850 a firing squad shot the báb in tabríz , iran . the báb had other names , for example the `` primal point '' and the `` '' point of the bayán . '' '' the báb told everyone that another prophet who was stronger and even more powerful was coming soon . people who follow the bahá'í religion believe the báb was talking about bahá'u'lláh , who started the bahá'í religion .
