Hydrogen bond     a hydrogen bond is a low kind type of dipole-dipole bond that exists between an electronegative molecule and a hydrogen molecule bonded to another electronegative molecule . this type of bond always involves a hydrogen molecule . that explains the name . hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules ( `` intermolecularly '' ) , or within different parts of a single molecule ( `` intramolecularly '' ) . the typical hydrogen bond is stronger than van der waals forces , but weaker than covalent , ionic and metallic bonds . intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water ( 100 Â°c ) . references . - george a. jeffrey . `` an introduction to hydrogen bonding ( topics in physical chemistry ) '' . oxford university press , usa ( march 13 , 1997 ) . isbn 0-19-509549-9 - a new intermolecular interaction : unconventional hydrogen bonds with element-hydride bonds as proton acceptor robert h. crabtree , per e. m. siegbahn , odile eisenstein , arnold l. rheingold , and thomas f. koetzle `` acc . chem . res .
