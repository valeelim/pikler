Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel    hilbert 's paradox of the grand hotel hilbert 's paradox of the grand hotel is a mathematical paradox named after the german mathematician david hilbert . hilbert used it as an example to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do . normal hotels have a set number of rooms . this number is finite . once every room has been assigned to a guest , any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet can not be served - in other words , the hotel is fully booked . now suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms . as a convenience , the rooms have numbers , the first room has the number 1 , the second has number 2 , and so on . if all the rooms are filled , it might appear that no more guests can be taken in , as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms . this is wrong , though . a room can be provided for another guest . this can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2 , the guest in room 2 to room 3 , and so on . in the general case , the guest in room `` n '' will be moved to room `` n+1 '' . after all guests have moved , room 1 is empty , and the new guest now has a room to occupy . this shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full , something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms .
