Po (river)    po ( river ) the po ( latin : `` padus '' , , ancient `` eridanus '' ) is a river that flows 652 kilometers ( 405 miles ) eastward across northern italy , from monviso ( in the cottian alps ) to the adriatic sea near venice . it has a drainage area of 71,000 kmÂ² and is the longest river in italy . it goes through many important italian towns , including turin ( torino ) and ( indirectly ) milan ( milano ) , in lombardy . it is connected to milan through a net of channels called `` navigli '' , which leonardo da vinci helped design . near the end of its course , it creates a wide delta ( with hundreds of small channels and five main ones , called `` po di maestra '' , `` po della pila '' , `` po delle tolle '' , `` po di gnocca '' and `` po di goro '' ) at the southern part of which is comacchio , an area famous for eels . the po valley corresponds to the roman cisalpine gaul , divided in cispadane gaul ( south of the po ) and transpadane gaul ( north of the po ) . the vast valley around the po is called `` pianura padana '' and is so efficiently connected by the river that the whole valley became the main industrial area of the country . this river is subject to the authority of a special authority , the `` magistrato delle acque '' .
