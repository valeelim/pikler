Rumi     jalal ad-din muhammad rumi ( 30 september 1207 – 17 december 1273 ) , also named `` mawlānā '' , which means `` our master '' , is one of the islamic world 's greatest poets . he is usually known in the english-speaking world simply as rumi . he was a sufi mystic , philosopher and lover of humanity . his followers began a school of mysticism to encourage and celebrate his teachings—the sufi branch known to many westerners as the 'whirling dervishes ' , but whose proper name is the mevlevi order . jalâluddîn rumi was born in 1207 in balkh persia in what is today afghanistan . his father bahauddin was a famous religious teacher and mystic who received a position at the university in balkh . when mongols invaded persia , rumi left persia for konya , which was then under the persian empire . by the time he made it to konya his mother had died , and he was married with one , a son , 'mevlâna ' ( our master ) had had his early spiritual education under the tutelage of his father bahauddin and later under his father ’ s close friend sayyid burhaneddin of balkh . mevlâna grew both in knowledge and consciousness of god over the years . eventually sayyid burhaneddin told mevlâna that he was now ready and a mature sufi and scholar and that the 'next stage ' of his spiritual development would soon occur . and so sayyid predicted the coming of shams of tabriz , the central event and love of rumi ’ s life .
