Opiliones     the harvestmen are eight-legged arachnids . although they belong to the class of arachnids , harvestmen are not spiders . they belong to the order opiliones or phalangids . more than 6,400 species of harvestmen have been discovered , although the real number of extant species may exceed 10,000. well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million year old rhynie cherts of scotland . the samples found look surprisingly modern . apparently , the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then . in some places , harvestmen are known by the name `` daddy longlegs '' , but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods : the crane fly ( `` tipulidae '' ) and the cellar spider ( `` pholcidae '' ) . many species are omnivores , they eat anything they can find . most of the time this is small insects , and some plants and fungi . some are scavengers . harvestmen are not dangerous to humans . none of the described species has poison glands . they are not `` true '' spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways . for example , harvestmen have no venom or silk glands ; spiders have these .
