Acts of Supremacy     the acts of supremacy was passed by elizabeth i in 1558. this act stated that the king , not the pope was the head of the church of england . when this act was originally passed by henry viii , in 1534 , he had been the ‘ head of the church in england ’ but under elizabeth ’ s reign , she was “ supreme governor of the church in england ” . the change may have been made to appease catholics who could not accept the monarch as `` head of the church '' , seeing the church as the pope 's domain , or it may have been made because elizabeth was a woman . in the sixteenth century , women were regarded as inferior to men in spiritual matters , and many were uncomfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge . this act also included an oath of loyalty to the queen that the clergy were expected to take . if they did not take it , then they would lose their office . a high commission was established to ensure that the oath was taken .
