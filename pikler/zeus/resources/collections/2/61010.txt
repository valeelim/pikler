Differential equation     a differential equation is a mathematical equation that involves variables like x or y , as well as the rate at which those variables change . differential equations are special because the solution of a differential equation is itself a function instead of a number . if a differential equation only involves x and its derivative , the rate at which x changes , then it is called a first order differential equation . a higher-order differential equation has derivatives of other derivatives . if there are more variables than just x and y , then it is said to be a partial differential equation . sometimes , something in the world will obey several differential equations at the same time . these are said to be modeled by coupled differential equations . some differential equations can be solved exactly , and some can not . sometimes one can only be estimated , and a computer program can do this very fast . although they may seem overly-complicated to someone who has not studied differential equations before , the people who use differential equations tell us that they would not be able to figure important things out without them . most scientists and engineers ( as well as mathematicians ) take at least one course in differential equations while in college . some mathematicians devote their career to investigating differential equations that are difficult to solve .
