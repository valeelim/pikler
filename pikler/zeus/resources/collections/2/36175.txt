Apatosaurus     apatosaurus is a sauropod dinosaur which lived in the upper jurassic period . it is in the same family as `` diplodocus '' . `` brontosaurus '' was once thought a later name for `` apatosaurus '' , but is now proved to be a separate genus . `` apatosaurus '' grew as big as 21 meters long , 4.5 meters tall at the hip , and weighed up to 23 metric tons . it ate plants . its bones have been found in wyoming , colorado , oklahoma , and utah . when it was first found , scientists thought that `` apatosaurus '' lived partly under water , since it could not hold its own weight on dry land . now they think it lived on dry land , probably in herds . the cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more solid than those of `` diplodocus '' . the bones of the leg were much stockier ( despite being longer ) , implying a more robust animal . the tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion . like most sauropods , `` apatosaurus '' had only a single large claw on each forelimb , with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws .
