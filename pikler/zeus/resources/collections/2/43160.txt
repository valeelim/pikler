Wikia     wikia is a website where people can make a wiki . wikia was started in 2004 by jimmy wales ( who also started wikipedia ) and angela beesley . it used to be called wikicities , and the name was changed to wikia on march 27 , 2006 to prevent other people from mistaking it for a wiki on cities . wikis on wikia must be about something which lots of people will like , so people can not make them on any topic . all content on wikia is released under a free license , such as the gnu free documentation license or the creative commons . anybody can change pages on wikis at wikia , so that no single person `` owns '' or is `` the boss '' of a wiki , and so that large communities can be made . the software used is mediawiki . wikia uses advertisements to generate money , which is different than wikipedia , which uses donations . in general , wikia has much lower standards of notability than wikipedia does . this means that something can have an article on wikia , but not on wikipedia . also , articles on wikia are often written in more `` in-universe '' style ; meaning that fictional characters and plots are written as if they are real . some projects on wikia are more for people who are very interested in the topic .
