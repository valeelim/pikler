Theoretical computer science     theoretical computer science is domain of computer science that looks at the notion of information and about how information can be processed . it also looks at the way models are built in computer science . common divisions of theoretical computer sciences include : - automata theory : an automaton is an abstraction of a machine , which changes its internal state according to some rules . automata theory also looks at the kinds of problems that can be solved by such automata . - computability theory and computational complexity theory look at the question if a problem can be solved by a given automaton , and how well a given solution is , compared to others . - formal languages are the way to communicate with a given automaton . most of the time , the question is whether the automaton will accept a word of a formal language , that is , when the word is fed into the automaton , the automaton will end up in an exit state . semantics are used to talk about the grammars of such languages , and how they are constructed .
