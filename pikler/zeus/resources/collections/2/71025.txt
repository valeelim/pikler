Penicillium     penicillium is a genus of ascomycetous fungi of major importance in the natural environment as well as food and drug production . members of the genus produce penicillin , a molecule that is used as an antibiotic , which kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria inside the body . this widespread genus contains over 300 species . the mycelium is a highly branched network of multinucleate , usually colourless hyphae . the conidiospores are the main dispersal route of the fungi , and are often green in colour . sexual reproduction involves the production of ascospores . the asci contain eight unicellular ascospores each . species of `` penicillium '' are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available . saprophytic species of `` penicillium '' and `` aspergillus '' are among the best-known representatives of the eurotiales . they live mainly on organic biodegradable substances . commonly known as moulds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage . many species produce toxins which work against bacteria and other fungi . the ability of these `` penicillium '' species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their ability to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist . some species have a blue colour , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture .
