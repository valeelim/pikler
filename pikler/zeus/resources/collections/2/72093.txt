Phencyclidine     phencyclidine ( a shortened version of the chemical name `` phenylcyclohexylpiperidine '' ) , usually called pcp , is an illegal drug . pcp is called a hallucinogenic drug : it causes people to hallucinate , and see , hear , and sense things that are not real . pcp is neurotoxic . it causes changes to the brain that can leave permanent damage . before people started using pcp as an illegal drug , it was used as an anesthetic . pcp is a white powder , made of tiny crystals . it dissolves easily in water or alcohol . pcp has many slang or 'street names ' ; the most common is `` angel dust '' . other slang names for pcp are angel hair , angel mist , aurora borealis , black whack , crystal , cyclones , devil dust , dummy dust , embalming fluid , hallucinogen , horse tranquilizer , jet fuel , magic dust , rocket fuel , or star dust . pcp is sometimes mixed with marijuana and called love boat or killer weed . pcp can also be mixed with crack ; this is called `` space basing '' . pcp was created after world war ii as a surgical anesthetic . it worked well , but there were serious side effects : hallucinations , jumbled speech , and delirium . around the mid-to-late 1960s , the drug sprang up on the streets of san francisco as a `` peace pill . '' people soon realized that it was a very dangerous drug . in the san francisco area , the use of pcp died out before the 1970s . at the same time , the drug was becoming more common in new york , and it spread quickly there . however , its use in this area died out , like in san francisco . the united states made it illegal to use pcp for any reason , or to make the drug , because of its serious effects .
