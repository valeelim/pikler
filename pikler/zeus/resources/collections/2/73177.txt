Riding (division)    riding ( division ) in the united kingdom , a riding is a division of certain large historic counties . it is usually one of three parts ; the word itself comes from old english `` trithing '' ( itself from old norse `` thrithjungr '' ) which means 'third part ' . several counties are divided into ridings , but are usually governed by a council bearing the same name as the county . however , the ridings of yorkshire are so large that each riding was given its own county council . thus there were county councils for the east riding , the north riding and the west riding . in 1974 when all the administrative counties of england and wales were reorganised , these councils were replaced by six new ones within yorkshire ( either wholly or in part ) called north yorkshire , south yorkshire , west yorkshire , cleveland , durham and humberside . in canada , a riding is a federal constituency , or `` electoral division '' as they are known in canada .
