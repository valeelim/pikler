European Parliament     the european parliament ( formerly european parliamentary assembly or common assembly ) is the parliament of the european union ( eu ) . eu citizens elect its members once every five years . together with the council of ministers , it is the law-making branch of the institutions of the union . it meets in two locations : strasbourg and brussels . the parliament is made up of its 751 members , called `` meps '' . each member speaks for an area of europe , for example london , denmark or scotland . anyone can be elected , they are elected by all the eu citizens , the people who are citizens of a country in the eu . people have been elected to parliament since 1979 , before that they came from the parliaments of each country . because meps come from lots of countries , they all speak different languages ( 23 in 2007 ) . this means that the parliament has to have lots of interpreters . unlike other international groups of politicians , meps do not sit in groups of countries , but they sit next to people who they share ideas with . the two largest groups are the `` european people 's party-european democrats '' and the `` party of european socialists '' . but these groups work together to agree , so they do not fight and try to make a law if the other does not like it .
