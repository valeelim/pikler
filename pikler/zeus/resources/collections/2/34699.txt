Katakana     katakana is a japanese script used for writing words borrowed from other languages . it is easier to read than the kanji ( the picture method based on chinese characters ) . once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned , the reader knows how to pronounce them . katakana and hiragana are both syllabaries . in english we use the letters of the alphabet . in most words each letter stands for a bit of sound ( a phoneme ) . in a syllabary each symbol stands for a syllable . for example : in english we write “ wagamama ” : each of the eight letters standing for a sound : “ w-a-g-a-m-a-m-a ” . but if the word “ wagamama ” is divided into syllables there are four syllables ( blocks of sound ) : wa-ga-ma-ma . in katakana it is written with four symbols : ワガママ . hiragana works in the same way , but the symbols are mostly different . katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more “ squared off ” . together katakana and hiragana are called “ kana ” . this is a table of the basic katakana strokes . the first chart shows the basic katakana ( characters with red letters next to them are no longer used today ) .
