List of Neptune's moons    list of neptune 's moons neptune has a total of 14 moons . the largest moon is triton which was discovered by william lassell just seventeen days after neptune was found . then it took one hundred years later to find the second moon , nereid . the hubble telescope found the 14th moon in 2013. most of neptune 's moons are named after sea nymphs . neptune has a lot of moons who have unusual orbits . triton which is the largest moon of neptune , orbits in a retrograde orbit ( which means triton orbits or moves the opposite way from how neptune spins ) . two moons , psamathe ( discovered in 2002 ) and neso ( discovered in 2003 ) , are also unusual because they have the largest orbits for any moons discovered in the solar system so far . they take about 25 years to make one orbit and are 125 times farther than how our moon orbits away from earth . many astronomers and scientists think that neptune 's inner moons were not original bodies that formed with neptune , but were instead remains of debris from triton that slowly built up together . other scientists think that when triton was captured by neptune , triton 's mass and odd orbit caused neptune 's original moons to be destroyed by gravity , only to be reformed after triton formed a stable orbit .
