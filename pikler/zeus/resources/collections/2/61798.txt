Anuket     anuket was the first ancient egyptian goddess of the nile river in areas like elephantine island , at the start of the nile 's journey through egypt , and in nearby parts of nubia . her temple was built at the island of seheil . since the god khnum and goddess satis were thought to be the gods of the source of the nile , anuket was believed to be their daughter . the egyptians believed that the two tributaries in her area of the nile were her arms . because tributaries move quickly , she became associated with fast-moving things , like arrows , and the gazelle . in art , she was usually shown as a gazelle , or with a gazelle 's head , and sometimes had a headdress of feathers . when the nile started its annual flood , the `` festival of anuket '' began . people threw coins , gold , jewelry , and precious gifts into the river , thanking anuket for the life-giving water . the taboo that was held in several parts of egypt of not eating fish , which were considered sacred , was lifted during this time . other websites .
