Me채nkieli     me채nkieli ( also known as `` tornedalian finnish '' , meaning `` our language '' ) is a finno-ugric language spoken in the river torne valley in the north of sweden , above the arctic circle . it is an official minority language of sweden . the language could be seen as a mix between finnish and swedish , since it has been changed a lot by swedish . for many years , swedish was the only language to be taught in the schools of the torne valley . the population became bilingual . they spoke both finnish and swedish , but they were mostly only able to write in swedish . today many people in the younger generations only speak swedish . since 1999 , me채nkieli is an official minority language of sweden . since there are no swedish statistics of the population 's native languages , it is not known how many me채nkieli speakers there are . taking statistics is also a bit controversial , as many people consider the language to be a dialect of finnish .
