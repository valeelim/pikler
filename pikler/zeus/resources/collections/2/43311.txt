Elasmosaurus     elasmosaurus was a 46 foot long swimming reptile that lived in the north american inland sea . it was a plesiosaur . it was first discovered in 1868 by a scientist named edward drinker cope who accidentally put the head on the tail . it had 71 cervical vertebrae . it was suggested by d.m.s . watson that their method was as surface swimmers , mostly eating with their head above water , darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton . it is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water . aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape , as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs . all the longer-necked families were , from the setting of the teeth and jaws , eaters of small fish . the large number of neck vertebrae is probably linked to the modest degree of flexibility between adjacent vertebrae .
