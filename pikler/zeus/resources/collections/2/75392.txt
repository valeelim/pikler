Frottola     the frottola ( plural : frottole ) was the most popular kind of secular ( non-religious ) song in italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries . frottole were quite simple and fun . they were often sung by small groups of singers . they were not contrapuntal , but they had a tune in the top part while the other singers sang chords to accompany the tune . sometimes they might have been sung by a solo voice with a lute accompaniment . the most famous composer of frottole was bartolomeo tromboncino . the great composer josquin also composed frottole , although that is not what he called them . for example , there is a well-known one called `` el grillo '' ( the cricket ) in which the singers try to sound like the chirping of a cricket in the grass . about the year 1530 the frottola developed into the madrigal .
