Prokaryote     prokaryotes ( or `` monera '' ) are the simplest living things : bacteria and archaea . they generally do not have a cell nucleus , nor cell organelles , however a small number of exceptions have been found . prokaryotes are unicellular . they are either `` bacteria '' or `` archaea '' . prokaryotes are cells which do not have a cell nucleus , and lack other things eukaryotes ( cells with a true nucleus ) have . prokaryotes do not have membranes inside the cell . this means that there are no vacuoles , golgi apparatus , endoplasmic reticula or other organelles inside the cell . however , they do have ribosomes , though of a simpler kind than eukaryotes . eukaryote cells include organelles which were once free-living prokaryotes . in 1977 , carl woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the bacteria and archaea ( originally eubacteria and archaebacteria ) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms . this arrangement of eukaryota ( also called `` eukarya '' ) , bacteria , and archaea is called the three-domain system , replacing the traditional two-empire system .
