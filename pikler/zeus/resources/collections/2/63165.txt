Thermodynamic state     a thermodynamic state is the macroscopic condition of a thermodynamic system as described by its particular thermodynamic parameters . the state of any thermodynamic system can be described by a set of thermodynamic parameters , such as temperature , pressure , density , composition , independently of its surroundings or history . the parameters required to specify the state depend on the characteristics of the system . there is an optimal ensemble of parameters that uniquely specify the state , and all other parameters can be derived from these . the `` state postulate '' says that the state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent , intensive properties . other pages . - thermodynamic system - thermodynamics references . - black w. & hartley , j .
