Grave (mass)    grave ( mass ) grave was the word that was used to describe mass before the word `` kilogram '' was introduced . `` grave '' comes from the word `` gravity '' and was first used in 1793 in france . the name `` kilogram '' was introduced in 1795 but was not the official word for mass until 1875. in order to have full consistency in the international system of units ( si ) , many people think that the kilogram should be called something different . using the word `` kilogram '' creates a problem because it is a base unit that has the prefix `` kilo '' already in its name . to fix the problem , some people have suggested using the word `` grave '' again . other websites . - http : //www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html - http : //www.quid.fr/2006/unites_de_mesure/unites_de_masse/ - http : //www.sizes.com/units/grave.htm
