Emperor Itoku     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that he ruled from the palace of `` migario-no-miya '' at karu in what will come to be known as yamato province . itoku is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes itoku as the third of . the `` gukanshō '' records that itoku was the second or third son of emperor annei , but the surviving documents provide no basis for making guesses about why the elder brother or brothers were passed over . during reign of emperor itoku , the capital of japan was at karu , yamato . the absence of information about itoku does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei ( 509 ? -571 ) .
