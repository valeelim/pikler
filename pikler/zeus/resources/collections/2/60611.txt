Fog     fog is mist when it is very thick . it may appear on land or sea . it usually lowers visibility ( makes it hard to see very far ) . when fog forms at high levels it creates a cloud called stratus . when the air chills , moisture will turn to fog . fog is made up of tiny water droplets or , in very cold conditions , ice crystals . when seen on a high speed camera , ( a special camera that takes many frames and can view videos at very low speed ) it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air . these water droplets make up the fog or mist . there are many types of fog , such as evaporation fog , advection fog , radiation fog , and upslope fog . the thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere , temperature , weather and location .
