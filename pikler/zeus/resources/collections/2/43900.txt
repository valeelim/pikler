Hail Mary     hail mary is a christian prayer to mary , the mother of jesus . most of the prayer comes from the gospel of luke . some things were also added to the prayer during the 13th century ( the 1200s ) . when a person says a hail mary , he asks mary to pray for him . in roman catholicism , the hail mary makes up the most important part of the rosary . the eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox also use the prayer . so do many other groups within christianity , including anglicans , independent catholics , and old catholics . some protestant denominations also use the hail mary . the hail mary uses two phrases from saint luke 's gospel . the first is `` hail , full of grace , the lord is with thee , blessed art thou amongst women '' ( ) . ( in simple english , this means : `` be glad . you are full of grace . you are with god . you are blessed . '' ) the second is `` blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb '' ( ) . ( this means : `` you and your child ( jesus ) are both blessed . '' ) when the hail mary was first created , it was much shorter than it is now . in western europe , in the mid-13th century , the prayer was just a few words . the word `` mary '' was added after the word `` hail . '' the entire prayer was `` hail mary , full of grace . '' we know this from saint thomas aquinas 's writings about the prayer .
