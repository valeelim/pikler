Intelligence     intelligence is to to understand or perceive . there is no general agreement on what intelligence is . the idea comes from a latin word : `` intelligo '' meaning to `` choose between different options '' . a part of intelligence allows people to solve problems . these problems may be easy to solve . they may also be difficult to solve , and involve abstract thought . for some , intelligence is a property , or characteristic of the mind . for others , it is simply the working of the brain , especially the cerebral cortex . if an answer is found to a problem , it can be remembered . that way , the problem is solved more quickly when it comes up again . this is what is called learning . there is disagreement about which has more influence on intelligence , genetics or environment . also , intelligent behaviour is possibly learned when an organism ( a living thing ) reacts enough to a stimulus . scientists believe that intelligence can be measured or tested . a type of intelligence test would be solving many problems in a very short time . most of the problems have to do with seeing things , or telling what a rotated shape would look like . some are also related to mathematics : for example to tell what number would come next in a row . other tests have to do with words or the understanding of language . after giving such a test to a person , a number would be calculated to give an approximation of the intelligence quotient ( iq ) . since many of the words on the language tests come from latin , this part of an intelligence quotient might measure how much a person has learned or understands latin .
