Voltaic pile     the voltaic pile was the first ever battery . it was invented in 1800 by alessandro volta , an italian physicist . the picture to the right shows a voltaic pile : it 's a pile , or `` stack '' of discs , made from 3 different materials . some of the discs are made from copper , some from zinc . other metals can be used ; but it 's important that there are two `` different '' kinds of metal . there are also discs made from leather or cardboard : these are the green discs in the picture . they must be soaked , or `` made wet '' , with something acidic . note how the discs follow a pattern : first a disc made from one of the metals , then a cardboard or leather disc , then a disc made from the other kind of metal . then the same kinds of discs , in the same order , again and again . in the picture , you can see how one `` set '' of zinc disc , cardboard disc and copper disc has been `` pushed '' a little to the right . such a `` set '' is called a `` cell '' : the voltaic pile in the picture has 6 cells . the two different metal discs in a cell will each have a voltage across it ; about 1,1 volts . stacking cells in a pile adds to the voltage of the cells , and from the discs at the top and bottom of the voltaic pile in the picture , there is a voltage of 6 Ã— 1,1 volts = 6,6 volts .
