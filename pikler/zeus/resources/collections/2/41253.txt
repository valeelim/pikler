Wasp     wasps are members of the order hymenoptera , which also includes ants , bees and sawflies . the common or garden wasps , `` vespula vulgaris '' , and hornets ( `` vespa '' ) are members of the eusocial family vespidae . this has about 5000 species . by far the greater number of wasp species ( over 100,000 ) are the parasitic wasps . most of them are parasitoids which lay their eggs in the caterpillars of other insect species . almost every pest insect species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it . this makes wasps vital to the natural control of pest numbers ( biocontrol ) . parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they prey mostly on pest insects and have little impact on crops . many people get confused between wasps and bees . it 's pretty easy to tell the difference between bees and wasps , because bees look quite hairy and wasps do not . wasps have biting mouthparts and antennae with 12 or 13 segments . they usually have wings and their abdomens are attached to their thorax by a slender petiole , or a “ waist ” . females have a sting , which they use for piercing and egg laying . adult wasps feed mostly on nectar , but their larvae feed on insects or pollen , provided by the mother .
