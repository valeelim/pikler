Cartel     in economics , a cartel is a group of formerly independent companies who overtly agree to work together . the objectives of cartels are to increase their profits or to stabilize market sales . they do this by fixing the price of goods , by limiting market supply or by other means . monopolies are not cartels , because in a monopoly there is only one independent company . cartels are bad for the economy in general and for their customers who are overcharged . cartels usually occur in oligopolies , where there are a small number of players that control the majority of supply in a market . besides the sellers ' cartel just described , buyers may also form cartels to suppress the price of a purchased input . another type of cartel is the bidding ring . in bid rigging potential suppliers form an agreement as to which of them will win a supply contract at a price above the competitive price and , if one of them wins , then agree to a rule for sharing the extra profits among themselves . bid rigging is most common among construction firms trying to get a government building project .
