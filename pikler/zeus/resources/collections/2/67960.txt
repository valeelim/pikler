Nitrogen fixation     nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its stable gas form ( n ) in air and changes into other nitrogen compounds ( such as ammonia , nitrate and nitrogen dioxide ) useful for other chemical processes . it is an important part of the nitrogen cycle . nitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways : biological . microorganisms that fix nitrogen ( diazotrophs ) . - cyanobacteria , `` e.g . '' the highly significant `` trichodesmium '' - green sulfur bacteria - `` azotobacteraceae '' - `` rhizobia '' - `` frankia '' gram-positive soil bacteria cause nitrogen-fixing nodules in actinorhizal plants . cyanobacteria are in most environments on earth . they play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere . cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen , like nitrate , nitrite , ammonium , urea , or some amino acids . plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – fabaceae – with taxa such as kudzu , clovers , soybeans , alfalfa , lupines , peanuts , and rooibos . they have symbiotic bacteria called `` rhizobia '' in nodules in their root systems , producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants . when the plant dies , the fixed
