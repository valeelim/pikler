Neurotransmitter     neurotransmitters are chemical messengers . they send information between neurons by crossing a synapse . electrical signals are not able to cross the gap between most neurons . they are changed into chemical signals to cross the gap . neurotransmitters act mostly on chemical synapses . once they reach the next neuron they are absorbed . the neuron then changes this chemical signal back into an electrical signal called an action potential . the action potential passes across the next neuron and to the next synapse . many neurotransmitters are made from amino acids , which are part of your diet and it takes only a few steps to convert them . neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions . scientists do not yet know exactly how many neurotransmitters exist , but more than 100 chemical messengers have been identified . each neurotransmitter has a different function . for example : dopamine is used in reward and pleasure and noradrenaline is used in an animal 's `` fight or flight '' response . neurotransmitters also regulate the passing of messages . this is because an action potential must be a certain strength before the neurotransmitters are released . the strength required to release the neurotransmitter is called a threshold .
