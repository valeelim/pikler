Vampire squid     the vampire squid ( `` vampyroteuthis infernalis '' , 'vampire squid from hell ' ) is a small , deep-sea cephalopod . it can be found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world . it has special filaments it can retract ; because of this , it has been placed in its own order : `` vampyromorphida '' ( formerly `` vampyromorpha '' ) . it is similar to both squid and octopus . it is the only surviving member of its order . it was first described and mistakenly identified as an octopus in 1903. the vampire squid can grow to about 30 cm ( 1 foot ) in total length . it is no threat to humans . its 15 cm ( 6 inch ) gelatinous body varies in color between velvety jet-black and pale reddish , depending on location and lighting conditions . a webbing of skin connects its eight arms , each lined with rows of fleshy spines or `` cirri '' . the inside of this `` cloak '' is black . only the distal half ( farthest from the body ) of the arms have suckers . its limpid , globular eyes—which appear red or blue , also depending on lighting—are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5 cm ( 1 inch ) in diameter .
