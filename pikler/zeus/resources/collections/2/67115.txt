Brackish water     brackish water ( less commonly brack water ) is salt water and fresh water mixed together . it is saltier than fresh water , but not as salty as seawater . it may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water , as in estuaries , or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers . some human activities can produce brackish water , mostly certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish pools for freshwater prawns . technically , brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand ( ppt or ‰ ) . thus , `` brackish '' covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition . it is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time . the term brackish water comes from the low german word `` brack '' , which is a small lake made when a storm tide breaks a dike and floods land behind the dike .
