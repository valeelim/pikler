Queue     a queue is a line of people standing behind one another who are waiting for something . the person at the front of the queue will have his turn next , then the next person and so on . when someone comes to join the queue they have to go to the back of the queue and wait until it is their turn . sometimes people try to `` jump the queue '' or `` push in '' . they are usually told off and have to go to the back of the queue . the word `` queue '' comes from the french word for `` tail '' , but when talking about a queue of people in english it is pronounced `` kyoo '' ( like `` kew '' in `` kew gardens '' ) . the word `` queue '' can be a noun ( `` please stand in the queue '' ) or a verb ( `` please queue over there '' ) . a queue may also be a queue of vehicles waiting to get passed something or to go in somewhere . people may queue to be served in a shop , or queue for a bus or taxi or to go into something like a museum . queueing is much better than pushing one 's way in . sometimes , in places where a lot of people are queueing , there may be a system of numbered tickets . when someone arrives , they take a number and wait until their number is shown on a display board . this system is often used in banks , doctor 's surgeries , passport offices , etc .
