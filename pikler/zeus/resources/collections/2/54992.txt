Field (physics)    field ( physics ) in physics , a field means that a physical quantity is assigned to every point in space ( or , more generally , spacetime ) . a field is seen as extending throughout a large region of space so that it influences everything . the strength of a field usually varies over a region . michael faraday became the first to coin the term `` field '' , in 1849. for some fields , there is a number for each point in space . they are called `` scalar fields '' . for more complicated fields , there are more than one number for each point in space . they are called `` vector fields '' or `` tensor fields '' . for example , one can model a gravitational field by a vector field where a vector indicates the acceleration a mass would experience at each point in space . other examples are temperature fields or air pressure fields , which are often illustrated on weather reports by isotherms and isobars by joining up the points of equal temperature or pressure respectively . types of fields . classical fields . - newtonian gravitation : describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two masses .
