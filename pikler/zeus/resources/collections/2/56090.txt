Walther von der Vogelweide     walther von der vogelweide ( born about 1170 ; died possibly in würzburg around 1230 ) was a famous german poet and composer . he was the greatest of the german minnesinger . these were people who wrote and sang songs about courtly love . walther himself may have added “ von der vogelweide ” to his name ( it means “ of the bird meadow ” ) . the german courtly love songs that had been written at the time were all very similar , but walther gave these songs new life and made them very beautiful . unfortunately we do not know any of his music , because he did not write it down . but he wrote his poems down . they are very original , sometimes humorous , sometimes serious , often just gently suggesting ideas carefully . we do not know where walther was born , but he wrote in a document that he had learned to sing and write poetry in austria . the dialect he spoke shows that he must have come from bavaria or austria . he spent some time at the court of duke leopold v of babenberg in vienna . this was about 1190. he took part in public singing contests and had long discussions with other people about love and the way it should be written about in poetry .
