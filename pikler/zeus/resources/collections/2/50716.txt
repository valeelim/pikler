Levi Strauss     levi strauss ( february 26 , 1829–september 26 , 1902 ) was a german-born american maker of clothing . born as `` löb strauss '' into a jewish family in buttenheim in franconia , bavaria , now a part of germany . in 1847 , strauss , his mother and two sisters moved to new york city to join his brothers jonas and louis löb in their dry goods business . by 1850 he had adopted the name `` levi strauss '' . in 1853 , strauss moved to bustling san francisco , california , where the california gold rush was still in high gear . levi expected that the mining camps would welcome his buttons , scissors , thread and bolts of fabric ; additionally , he had yards of canvas sailcloth intended for tent-making and as covers for the conestoga wagons that dotted the landscape next to every stream and river in the area . it was on california street that levi and his brother-in-law david stern opened a dry goods wholesale business called levi strauss & co. levi was often found leading a pack-horse , heavily laden with merchandise , directly into the mining camps found throughout the region . the story goes that both prospectors and miners , often complaining about the easily torn cotton `` britches '' and pockets that `` split right out '' gave levi the idea to make a rugged overall trouser for the miners to wear . these were fashioned from bolts of brown canvas sailcloth , with gold ore storage pockets that were nearly impossible to split . levi exhausted his original supply of canvas as the demand grew for his hard-wearing overalls , and so he switched to a sturdy fabric called serge , made in nimes , france . originally called serge de nimes , the name was soon shortened to denim .
