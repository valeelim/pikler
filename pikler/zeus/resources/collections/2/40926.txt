If and only if     iff ( if and only if ) is a `` biconditional statement '' . it means both conditions must hold ( be true ) for the statement to be true . it is often called a `` necessary and sufficient condition '' . example : - `` madison will eat the fruit if and only if it is an apple '' ( equivalent to `` madison will eat the fruit if the fruit is an apple , and will eat no other fruit . ) this makes it clear that madison will eat all and only those fruits that are apples . she will not leave any apple uneaten , and she will not eat any other type of fruit . that a given fruit is an apple is both a `` necessary '' and a `` sufficient '' condition for madison to eat the fruit . please note that the truth table shown is equivalent to the xnor gate .
