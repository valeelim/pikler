Lutheranism     lutheranism is a denomination within the christian religion . the namesake who led the lutherans in their protest against the roman catholic church was martin luther . he began this protest against the catholic church in the 16th century . luther was a german priest , theologian , and university professor in wittenberg . he worked to improve the theology and practices of the roman catholic church , primarily indulgences and abuses of power by the bishop of rome . this overall movement is known as the protestant reformation . lutheranism started when martin luther and his followers were excommunicated from the roman catholic church . luther â€™ s ideas helped begin the protestant reformation . other reformation leaders who separated from the roman catholic church agreed with luther on some things , but criticized him for not separating himself far enough from roman catholic doctrine ( see john calvin and ulrich zwingli ) . lutherans believe the bible is the first and only authoritative source for christian faith and teaching . like other christians , they believe in the trinity , that jesus christ was both god and man , that all humans are sinful since adam and eve ( see original sin ) , and that humans are saved by jesus ' death on the cross . lutherans believe that the central idea to all of their beliefs is that humans are saved by grace alone through faith alone because of jesus christ alone ( see justification ( theology ) ) . the main points of lutheran theology were summed up in 1530 by philip melanchthon in the writing called the augsburg confession .
