Ionic bond     an ionic bond is the bonding between a non-metal and a metal , that occurs when charged atoms ( ions ) attract . this happens after a metal atom loses one or more of its electrons to the nonmetal atom . this makes the bond stronger and harder to break . when this happens , the metal becomes a positive cation , and the non-metal becomes a negative anion . this occurs , for example , when sodium and chlorine join to form common salt , nacl . in other buts , an ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between two oppositely charged ions . the positive ion is called cation , and the negative ion is the anion . features of ionic bonds . - three dimensional structure called an ionic lattice . - soluble in water . - they are compounds formed from metals and non-metals . - in a solid state they do not conduct electricity . however , in a liquid state or when dissolved in water , they will conduct electricity well because the ions are free to move . - they contrast to the characteristics of a covalent bond .
