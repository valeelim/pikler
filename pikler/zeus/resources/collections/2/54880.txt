Apprenticeship     apprenticeship is a system of training people who are learning how to do a job which needs special skill . someone who is learning in this way is called an `` apprentice '' . an apprentice will learn by working with someone who is already skilled at a job . they are like a teacher and pupil . the system of apprenticeship has been used for many hundreds of years . in the late middle ages the craft guilds and town governments used to watch and control the system . a master craftsman had the right to employ young people to work for them and pay them a small salary . in return the apprentice would be learning the trade . most apprentices were males , but female apprentices are more common nowadays , especially in crafts such as embroidery , silk-weaving etc.. related pages . - education further reading . - `` modern apprenticeships : the way to work '' , the report of the modern apprenticeship advisory committee , 2001 - `` apprenticeship in the british `` training market '' '' , paul ryan and lorna unwin , university of cambridge and university of leicester , 2001
