College of Arms     the college of arms , in london is one of the few remaining government heraldic authorities in europe . it was founded in 1484 by king richard iii , and its job is to control heraldry and grant new `` armorial bearings '' , sometime called coats of arms . the college is run by the kings of arms , heralds and pursuivants who handle heraldic affairs in england , wales and northern ireland on behalf of the queen . ( scotland has its own heraldic authority : lord lyon king of arms and his office . ) the college also grants arms to citizens of other commonwealth countries that do not have their own heralds . ( canadians use canadian heraldic authority and south africans have the bureau of heraldry ) as well as designing and granting new arms , the college tries to answer many requests from people trying to prove that they are descended from an `` armigerous '' ( arms-bearing ) person ; a person descended in the male line ( or through heraldic heiresses ) from an armiger may be reissued that ancestor 's arms . special marks called difference marks can be added make the coat of arms different from the arms of their cousins . the college is involved in genealogy and have many pedigrees ( family trees ) in their records . anyone may register a pedigree with the college , where they are carefully checked and need official proofs before being altered .
