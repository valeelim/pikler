Complementary color     complementary colours are pairs of opposite colours . what is meant by `` opposite '' can be different between colour science , and art and the printing process . in color science `` complementary colors '' are colors opposite to each other on the color wheel . primary colors and secondary colors are typically paired in this way : - red and cyan ( red cyan ) ( where cyan is the mixture of green and blue ) - green and magenta ( green magenta ) ( where magenta is the mixture of red and blue ) - blue and orange ( blue orange ) ( where orange is the mixture of red and yellow ) if a person stares at a single color for about a minute then looks at a white surface , an afterimage of the complementary color will appear . this is because of `` eye fatigue '' . for example , if the person stares at a red color , the photoreceptors ( cells in the eye which catch colored light ) for red light in the retina ( the back part of the eye ) become fatigued . when photoreceptors are fatigued they are less able to send information to the brain . if the person then looks at white light , all photoreceptors will send information . because the photoreceptors for red light are fatigued , the information they send will not be as strong as the information about the colors other than red and the illusion of seeing the complementary color is created .
