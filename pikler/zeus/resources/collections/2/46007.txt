Finlandia (Symphonic Poem)    finlandia ( symphonic poem ) finlandia is a symphonic poem by the finnish composer jean sibelius . he wrote it in 1899 and made some changes to it the next year . `` finlandia '' is the latin name for finland . at the time sibelius wrote it , finland was called the `` grand duchy of finland '' . this was because it was being ruled by russia . the finnish people wanted to rule finland for themselves . the music was composed for a pageant to encourage the finnish people to work for freedom . the music of `` finlandia '' is exciting and dramatic . it sounds like the finnish people struggling to be free . towards the end the music becomes calm and a lovely tune is played . it is a hymn tune which became known as `` finlandia '' . many years later sibelius set some words to this hymn and it is often sung as a separate piece by a choir . the words were written by veikko antero koskenniemi . it has become finland 's best known song and almost feels like a second finnish national anthem . it is often sung as a hymn in christian churches to the words `` be still , my soul : the lord is on your side '' . the tune was also used as the national anthem of the short-lived african country biafra .
