Receptor (cell biology)    receptor ( cell biology ) in cell biology , receptors are special structures that can be found in cell membranes . these are made of protein molecules such as glycoproteins . receptors bind ( attach ) to specialised molecules . if the receptor has this molecule , it is activated , but if it does not it is deactivated . depending on its state , a change inside the cell happens . cell surface receptors ( membrane receptors , transmembrane receptors ) take part in communication between the cell and the outside world . extracellular signalling molecules ( usually hormones , neurotransmitters , cytokines , growth factors or cell recognition molecules ) attach to the receptor . this triggers changes in the function of the cell . the process is called signal transduction : the binding starts a chemical change on the inside of the membrane . in short , receptors work like locks and keys . with the key , the lock can be locked or unlocked . if it is unlocked , the door belonging to it can be opened . part of the receptor sticks out of the cell membrane . the same applies to the membranes of cell organelles . a receptor 's main function is to recognize and respond to a specific ligand , for example , a neurotransmitter or hormone . some receptors respond to changes in 'transmembrane potential ' ( the difference in electric potential between the inside and the outside of a cell ) .
