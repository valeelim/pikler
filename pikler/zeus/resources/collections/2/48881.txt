Shear stress     shear stress is a stress state where the stress is parallel to the surface of the material , as opposed to normal stress when the stress is to the surface . shear stress is relevant to themotion of fluids upon surfaces , which result in the generation of shear stress . also constructions in soil can fail due to shear ; e.g. , the weight of an earth-filled dam may cause the subsoil to collapse , like a small landslide . related pages . - scissors work by shear stress
