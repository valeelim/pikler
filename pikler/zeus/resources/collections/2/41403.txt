Selenium     selenium is a chemical element . its chemical symbol is se and its atomic number is 34. it has 34 protons and 34 electrons and a mass number of 78.96. selenium ( selenium atoms only ) has several different forms . they are called allotropes . the most stable of these is a dense gray semimetal ( an element that is partially a metal and a nonmetal ) . the way the atoms are put together is a named a trigonal polymer chain . it lets electricity pass through it better in the light than in the dark . this form is used in photocells . selenium also has many nonconductive forms : a black glass-like substance , as well as several red crystalline forms . in the red form the eight atoms of selenium form ring to make a molecule . these rings then stack together to make the solid red selenium . the way that red seleniums atoms are put together is similar to sulfur . selenium is not very reactive . it does not dissolve in acids except nitric acid . it also dissolves in alkali 's like sodium hydroxide . it reacts with air when powdered to make selenium ( iv ) oxide . it does not react with many things , so selenium ( iv ) oxide is what most selenium compounds are made from .
