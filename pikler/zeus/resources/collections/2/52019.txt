XHTML     xhtml stands for extensible hypertext markup language . it is markup used to design websites and webpages . xhtml is much more strict than ordinary html , and is based on both xml and html . due to the lax nature of html , different web browsers can sometimes display websites incorrectly since there is more than one way to interpret poorly written html . the strict and formal nature of xhtml , once fully adopted will allow for web browsers to display the same page correctly between them . proper xhtml is also easier to read for humans . for example , the below code shows one of the differences between html and xhtml : incorrect , html version : < br > correct , xhtml version : < br / > the line break tag in html does not have a closing tag , you just type it once and it creates a line break . in xhtml the rule is that tags that do not have an closing tag must close themselves within the initial tag . these tags are called `` empty tags . '' another empty tag is < hr / > which inserts a `` horizontal rule '' or dividing line .
