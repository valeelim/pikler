Electrical energy     electrical energy can refer to several closely related things . it can mean : - the energy stored in an electric field - the potential energy of a charged particle in an electric field - the energy provided by electricity in any of these cases , the si unit of electrical energy is the joule ; which is the amount of energy used by a one-watt load , such as a tiny light bulb , drawing power for one second . the unit used by many electrical utility companies is the watt-hour ( wh ) ; which is the amount of energy used by the same one-watt load drawing power for one hour . the kilowatt-hour ( kwh ) , which is 1,000 times larger than a watt-hour , is a useful size for measuring the energy use of households and small businesses . a typical household uses several hundred kilowatt-hours per month . the megawatt-hour ( mwh ) , which is 1,000 times larger than the kilowatt-hour , is used for measuring the energy output of large power plants . the terms `` electrical energy '' and `` electric power '' are frequently used interchangeably . however , in physics , and electrical engineering , `` energy '' and `` power '' have different meanings . power is energy per unit time . the si unit of power and electricity is the watt . one watt is a joule per second . in other words , the phrases `` flow of power , '' and `` consume a quantity of electric power '' are both incorrect and should be changed to `` flow of energy '' and `` consume a quantity of electrical energy .
