Antibody     antibodies ( also called immunoglobulins ) are large y-shaped proteins . they are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates . antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system . the antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen . each tip of the `` y '' of an antibody contains a structure ( like a lock ) that fits one particular key-like structure on an antigen . this binds the two structures together . using this binding mechanism , an antibody can `` tag '' a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly . the production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . each antibody is different . they are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen ( in practice , this means virus or bacteria ) . for instance , an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the bubonic plague or the common cold . though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable . this allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist . each of these variants can bind to a different antigen . this enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
