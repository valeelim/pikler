La Scala     the teatro alla scala , usually known as la scala , is probably the most famous opera house in the world . it is in milan , italy , which is the country where opera started at the beginning of the 17th century . the theatre opened on 3 august 1778. at first it was called `` nuovo regio ducal teatro alla scala '' . the first opera to be performed there was salieri 's `` europa riconosciuta '' . there had been a theatre there before , called teatro ducale , but it had been destroyed by fire in 1776. the new theatre was built where there had been a church called santa maria della scala . this is how the theatre got its name . the theatre had more than 3,000 seats arranged in six tiers ( six storeys ) of boxes , and above that the two 'loggione ' or galleries . it has a very large stage . the money for the building was found by selling the 'palchi ' ( boxes ) to wealthy noblemen and other rich people in milan . in the 'platea ' ( the main floor ) there were no seats and the audience there stood up to watch , like they do today in the royal albert hall at the proms . the orchestra could be seen very well as they were not in an orchestra pit like they are today .
