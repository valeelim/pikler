Exponentiation by squaring     exponentiating by squaring is an algorithm . it is used for quickly working out large integer powers of a number . it is also known as the square-and-multiply algorithm or binary exponentiation . it implicitly uses the binary expansion of the exponent . it is of quite general use , for example in modular arithmetic . the algorithm has been known for a long time . it is already written down in a book called `` chandah-sÃ»tra '' . that book was published in india , around 200 bc . the following recursive algorithm computes `` x '' for a positive integer `` n '' where n > 0 : this algorithm is much faster than the ordinary method to compute such a value . multipliying x by itself , n operations are needed to calculate `` x `` . with the method shown above , only log2 ( n ) operations are needed .
