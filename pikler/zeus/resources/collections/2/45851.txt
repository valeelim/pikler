Lithuanian language     the lithuanian language is a baltic language . it is from lithuania , spoken in a few countries in europe , as well as in the americas and australia . lithuanian and latvian are the only remaining baltic languages . both languages have many things in common . lithuanian , however , adopted fewer words and phrases from german and other languages . however , long ago lithuanian was affected by the slavic languages , so the main barbarisms were replaced with lithuanian words only in 1920 , by lithuanian philologist jonas jablonskis and others . there are two main dialects of lithuanian . `` samogitian '' is the dialect mostly used in west lithuania , the other , widely used in the whole country is `` aukštaitian '' ( high-landers ' dialect ) . the standard lithuanian comes from west-aukštaitian . the first book written in lithuanian is `` katekizmas '' by martynas mažvydas . it was published in east prussia in 1547 .
