Bow (music)    bow ( music ) in music , a bow is a stick which is strung with hair . it is used to pull across the strings of a string instrument such as a violin , viola , cello or double bass . the wood used for good quality bows is usually pernambuco wood from brazil . some bows nowadays are made from carbon fiber . they are often cheaper and still of very good quality . the bow has to be slightly curved so that it straightens out a bit as the hairs are tightened ( this is like the bow of ‘ bow and arrow ’ where letting go of the tension of the bent bow makes the arrow fly off ) . horsehair is used for the hairs of the bow . these hairs gradually fall out when the bow is used a lot . when a lot of the hairs have fallen out the player can have the bow re-haired . when the bow is new , or when it has just been re-haired , it will not make any sound until the hairs have been well rubbed with rosin ( also called “ colophony ” ) . the rosin makes the hair grip the string as it is drawn across . every violinist needs to keep a piece of rosin ( called a “ cake of rosin ” ) in his or her violin case . they may need to rosin the bow for a short while each time they play . there is a screw at the end of the bow for tightening the hairs . after playing , the bow hairs should be slackened again before the bow is put away . this is to stop the wood from warping ( bending out of shape ) .
