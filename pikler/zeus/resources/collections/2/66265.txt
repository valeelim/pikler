Deal or No Deal     deal or no deal is a game show in more than 40 countries on the world created by john de mol . it began in the netherlands in 2000 . `` deal or no deal '' involves a contestant , a host/presenter , a banker , and a number of briefcases ( or boxes ) , with each having a different ( and initially unknown ) value . each game starts with the contestant selecting one of the casesâ€“this first case 's value is not known until the game ends . during the rest of the game , the contestant opens the rest of the cases , one at a time , revealing its value . each time after a specified number of cases are opened , the banker offers the contestant a certain amount of money to end the game . if the contestant takes an offer , the game ends , otherwise the contestant ends up with the money from the first case . since the range of possible values for cases is known at the start of each game , how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what cases have been eliminated . to promote suspense and lengthen games , the banker 's offer usually strays from the expected value dictated by probability theory , particularly early in the game . however it is not uncommon for the bank 's offer to exceed the player 's expected value very late in the game .
