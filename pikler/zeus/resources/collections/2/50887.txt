FLAC     flac ( which stands for free lossless audio codec ) is a way to code audio files . it makes those audio files smaller , without affecting the sound quality . it is unlike mp3 , because when encoding audio using an mp3 encoder , information is lost and can not be recovered . when a flac file is decoded , it will be identical to the original raw audio . flac is the most common lossless audio codec . lossy encoders , such as mp3 encoders will generate smaller files than lossless encoders such as flac , although with a lossy codec the decoder 's output will not be exactly identical to the encoder 's input .
