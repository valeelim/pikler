Alternating current     an alternating current ( ac ) is an electric current of which magnitude and direction vary , unlike direct current , whose direction remains constant . the usual waveform of an ac power circuit is a sine wave , because this leads to the most efficient transmission of energy . however , in certain applications different waveforms are used , such as triangular or square waves . when one speaks of alternating current one mostly refers to the form in which electricity is delivered to businesses and residences . but audio and radio signals carried on electrical wire are also examples of alternating current . in these applications , an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded ( or modulated ) onto the ac signal . this means that the direction of current flowing in a circuit is constantly being reversed back and forth . this is done with any type of ac voltage source . all houses have alternating current . the ac comes from a power plant . the direction of the electricity switches back 60 times every second ( or 50 times in some parts of the world ) . this happens so fast that a light bulb does not stop glowing .
