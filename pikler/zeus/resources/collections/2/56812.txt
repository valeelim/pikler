Petri dish     a petri dish is a small dish shaped like a cylinder . scientists use it to grow cells from animals , fungus , and diseases so they can study them . they are usually made of glass or plastic . the glass ones can be used again if they are heated at 160Â°f . sometimes people fill them with agar , which helps cells grow . these are called 'agar plates ' . many people use them in science classes at school . they have lids so germs in the air can not get into them , or `` contaminate '' them , and ruin the experiment .
