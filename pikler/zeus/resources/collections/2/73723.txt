Timpani     timpani ( sometimes called kettle drums ) are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper shaped by craftsmen , which after being tuned , have a skin-like material stretched over the top . this material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin , but modern drums use a synthetic material . this top section is known as the `` drumhead '' . `` timpani '' is an italian word . it is also a plural of the word `` timpano '' . however `` timpano '' is rarely used in informal english . more often , a timpano is referred to as a `` drum '' , a `` timpani '' , or simply a `` timp '' . someone who plays a timpani is called a `` timpanist '' . timpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes . a tympanist will often describe the drum as being `` in voice '' ( or out of voice , as the case may be ) when it is correctly tuned . to play it , it is hit with a special drumstick or `` timpani mallet '' . other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note , and are not tuned . a player normally sits with a group of two , three or four timpani around him , which is why the name timpani is in the plural .
