Las Vegas algorithm     a las vegas algorithm is an algorithm that uses randomness which has the consequence that the algorithm terminates with probability $ p < 1 $ . if the algorithm does terminate then it does so with a correct result ( unlike a monte carlo algorithm which definitely terminates but with a result that is only correct with probability $ p < 1 $ ) . the algorithm gambles with the resources used . it may take a very long times to give back a result , or it may not give back a result at all . a simple example would be a version of the quicksort . quicksort is used to quickly sort things ( mostly numbers ) . for this , each element is compared to a central element ( called `` pivot '' ) . depending on how this element is selected the sorting can take more time or less . most often , a las vegas algorithm is used to pick the pivot randomly .
