Waka     waka ( ) or yamato uta is a genre of japanese poetry . waka literally means '' japanese poem '' in japanese . the word `` waka '' was originally created by poets during the heian period to make clear the difference between native japanese poetry and the `` kanshi '' ( , `` chinese poems '' ) . this meant that they put together several different styles , one of them being tanka ( lit . `` short poem '' ) and the other chōka ( lit . `` long poem '' ) . there are others : bussokusekika ( lit . `` rock of the buddha 's footprint poem '' ) , sedōka ( lit . `` whirling head poem '' ) and katauta ( lit . `` poem fragment '' ) . these last three forms were no longer used at the beginning of the heian period , and `` chōka '' also disappeared a short time after . so , the term `` waka '' came in time to mean the same as `` tanka '' . tanka is a much older form of japanese poetry than haiku . waka did not follow any rules of rhyme , nor line ; it was a free style kind of poetry . this can be seen in this example of tanka written by poet yamanoue no okura ( 660 - 733 ) - hyakunin isshu
