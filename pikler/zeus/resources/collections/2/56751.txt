Multiset     a multiset ( sometimes called a bag ) is a concept from mathematics . in many ways , multisets are like sets . certain items are either elements of that multiset , or they are not . however , multisets are different from sets : the same type of item can be in the multiset more than once . for this reason , mathematicians have defined a relation ( function ) that tells , how many copies of a certain type of item there are in a certain multiset . they call this `` multiplicity '' . for example , in the multiset { `` a '' , `` a '' , `` b '' , `` b '' , `` b '' , `` c '' } , the multiplicities of the members `` a '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' are respectively 2 , 3 , and 1. a multiset is illustrated by means of a histogram . a multiset can also be considered an unordered tuple : - the tuples ( a , b ) and ( b , a ) are not equal , and the tuples ( a , a ) and ( a ) are not equal either . - the multisets { a , b } and { b , a } are equal , but the multisets { a , a } and { a } are not equal . - the sets { a , b } and { b , a } are equal , and the sets { a , a } and { a } are equal too . one of the simplest examples is the multiset of prime factors of a number `` n '' . here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime divisors of `` n '' . for example the number `` 120 '' has the prime factorisation
