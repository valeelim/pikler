Quirinus     in roman mythology , quirinus was an early god of the roman state . in augustan rome , quirinus was also a name of janus , as `` janus quirinus '' . quirinus was originally most likely a sabine god . the sabines had a settlement near the site of what was to become rome , and erected an altar to quirinus on the `` collis quirinalis '' , the `` quirinal hill '' , one of the `` seven hills of rome '' . when the romans settled there , they absorbed the cult of quirinus into their early belief system — previous to direct greek influence — and he was said to be the deified romulus . in later times , however , quirinus became far less important , losing his place to ( juno and minerva and mars ' place ) .
