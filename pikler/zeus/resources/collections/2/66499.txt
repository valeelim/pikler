Numeral system     a numeral system ( or system of numeration ) is a way to write numbers . roman numerals and tally marks are examples . `` 11 '' usually means eleven , but if the numeral system is binary , then `` 11 '' means three . a numeral is a symbol or group of symbols , or a word in a natural language that represents a number . numerals differ from numbers just as the word `` rock '' differs from a real rock . the symbols `` 11 '' , `` eleven '' and `` xi '' are different numerals , all representing the same number . this article tries to explain the different systems of numerals . see also number names . there are different symbols that can be used to make numbers . in a system with base 10 ( the normal decimal system ) , usually the symbols `` 0 '' , '' 1 '' , '' 2 '' , `` 3 '' , `` 4 '' , `` 5 '' , '' 6 '' , `` 7 '' , `` 8 '' , and `` 9 '' are used . the numbers 0 to 9 can be written as one symbol , `` 0 '' ... `` 9 '' . to count past 9 , symbols have to be put together . `` 10 '' can be seen as `` 1 '' in the tens ' place and `` 0 '' in the ones ' place , or as `` 1 times 10 plus 0 times 10 '' . with a base of 2 , only the symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' are used . `` 10 '' in base 2 notation is therefore `` 1 times 2 plus 0 times 2 '' . this is the same as 2 , in the base 10 notation .
