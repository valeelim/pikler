Whole-tone scale     in music , a whole tone scale is a scale in which each note is separated from the next one by an interval of a whole tone . there is always one note in between each pair of notes of the whole-tone scale ( counting all the notes : white and black ) . there are only two combinations possible for a whole tone scale : - c , d , e , f # , g # , a # - and - c # , d # , f , g , a , b when one of these scales is played on a piano , starting from a low note and moving up to high notes , while at the same time pressing the sustaining pedal ( the right pedal ) , it makes a `` dreamy '' sound . it does not sound in any particular key , but floats along . it also sounds very good on a harp . debussy uses the whole-tone scale a lot in his music , but he was not the first to do so . russian composers such as glinka in his opera `` ruslan and ludmila '' and borodin in `` prince igor '' used the whole-tone scale . later composers to use it include alban berg in his `` violin concerto '' , and béla bartók in his `` string quartet no . 5 '' . it has also been used in jazz .
