Home directory     in computing , a home directory is a special directory ( or location in the file system , apple calls directories `` folders '' ) . very often , there is one such home directory per user . some users , which were created by the system and usually do not log in , do not have such a home directory . a home directory is used to store personal files of the respective user , including written document and settings for programs . on unix and linux-like operating systems , the directory is usually called like the username . it is usually in the `` /home '' hierarchy . a user `` fred '' would therefore his home directory in `` /home/fred '' . it can be written as `` ~ '' . since windows 95 there is a directory called `` my documents '' . it was introduced together with `` my computer '' . it helps the users locate their files . since windows 2000 it is in the user 's profile directory `` documents and settings\username '' . so a user `` fred '' will find his files in `` documents and settings\fred\my documents '' . in windows vista the directory has lost the `` my '' , and is simply called `` documents '' . other directories , which are similar , may exist . they are called `` my music '' , `` my pictures '' and `` my videos '' . since windows 7 files of a user can be found at `` \users\ ( username ) \ '' .
