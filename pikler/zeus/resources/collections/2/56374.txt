Wave power     wave power means the use of ocean surface waves and the capture of that energy to do useful workâ€”including electricity generation , desalination , and the pumping of water ( into reservoirs ) . it makes use of the kinetic energy of the waves that are driven by the wind . power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tides . tests have shown that it is possible to produce energy from waves , particularly in scotland in the uk . but the technology is not as well developed as other renewable energy such as wind power or solar power . other websites . - practical ocean energy management systems inc links and discussion - an ocean wave energy converter using rotors - oceanography : waves - `` waves '' by tim lovett -- tables and trivia on waves - wave energy -- world energy council - corvallis gazette times -- oregon state university wants to host a national wave research center
