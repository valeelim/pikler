Henagon     a henagon ( or monogon ) is a shape in geometry . it is like a polygon , except that it only has one side and one corner ( vertex ) . henagons are considered to be impossible to draw , using euclidean geometry . this is because the single side would go to infinity . since it only has one side , there is only one angle . therefore all henagons are considered regular shapes .
