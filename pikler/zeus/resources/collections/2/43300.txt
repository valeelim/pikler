Xylem     xylem is a tissue in plants . its cells have thick , hard walls . xylem tissue dies soon after it is formed and is the wood in the middle of a tree . the dead cells are like pipes , hollow and rigid . xylem is one of two tissues in the plant which transport substances that plants need to live . substances that xylem transports include water and minerals obtained through the plant 's roots , as xylem runs from the roots to the stems and leaves . the other transport tissue is the phloem , which transports energy in the form of sugar ( as well as any other chemicals ) from the leaves to the rest of the plant . xylem cells are present in all parts of a plant , in stems , roots , and leaves . water is carried against gravity by the negative pressure that builds up through the process of transpiration , which is the evaporation of moisture in leaves . xylem consists of four types of cells : 1. xylem parenchyma which are living cells with thin walls 1. xylem fibres 1. tracheids 1. xylem vessels most of these cells are dead cells and have thick walls .
