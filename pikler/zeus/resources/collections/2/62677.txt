Bertrand's postulate    bertrand 's postulate bertrand 's postulate states that if `` n '' > 3 is an integer , then there always exists at least one prime number `` p '' with `` n '' < `` p '' < 2 '' n '' − 2. this statement was first made in 1845 by joseph bertrand . bertrand verified his statement for all numbers in the interval [ 2 , 3 × 10 ] . his statement was completely proven by pafnuty chebyshev in 1850. for this reason , the postulate is also called the bertrand-chebyshev theorem or chebyshev 's theorem . srinivasa ramanujan gave a simpler proof . ramanujan later used that proof when he discovered ramanujan primes . in 1932 , paul erdős published a simpler proof using the chebyshev function θ ( `` x '' ) . other websites . - ramanujan 's simpler proof
