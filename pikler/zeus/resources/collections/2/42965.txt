Physical property     a physical property is a property , quality or way that an object is . a physical property can always be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would effect its chemical or atomic structure . there are two types of physical properties : `` intensive '' and `` extensive '' . - `` intensive physical properties '' do not depend on how much of the object there is . for example , a small rock will be just as hard as a large rock . hardness , softness and speed ( quickness ) are intensive physical properties . - `` extensive physical properties '' change depending on how much of the object there is . for example , a small rock weighs less than a large rock . volume , total mass , and weight are extensive physical properties . physical properties also include when a physical change occurs .
