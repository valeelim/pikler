Waste heat     waste heat is the by-product heat of machines and technical processes for which no useful application is found . a fraction of input energy is always converted to heat by friction between machine parts and other processes such as liquid friction ( see : viscosity ) . mechanical drives can be designed to run smoothly , with little loss of energy to heat . machines for conversion of energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce large amounts of waste heat ( see : second law of thermodynamics ) . this waste heat can be re-used if a cogeneration system is used . it is hard to use waste heat because it is difficult to transport the heat to another place , and it is difficult to store the heat for use at another time . in electrification of waste heat , organic matter can be used as a working medium to produce electricity on much lower temperatures compared to the water steam cycle .
