Database transaction     with databases , a transaction is a point where there is interaction with the database . maybe , something is asked from the database . sometimes the data in the database may also be changed . a database transaction is generally atomic . that means , it is either done completely , or it is not done . the state of it being done is not visible . if it is not done completely , any changes it made will be undone . this is known as `` rollback '' . most of the time , transactions are needed to guarantee the acid principle of databases .
