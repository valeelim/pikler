Peerage     a peer is a member of the nobility . it is sometimes used instead of `` lord '' . in formal or old british documents , the house of lords is called the house of peers . in the united kingdom there are five ranks of the peerage : - baron is the lowest . in scotland this is called a lord , short for `` lord in parliament '' . - viscount - earl - this is an old saxon word . in continental europe this rank is called `` count '' , the lord in charge of a county . an earl 's wife is called a `` countess '' - marquess - a special rank higher than an earl because a marquess 's land was in the marches , the border areas that must be defended . a marquess 's wife is called a `` marchioness '' . there were not many marquesses in scotland , and they usually spelled the title `` marquis '' like the french - duke - the highest rank . informally barons , viscounts , earls and marquesses are called lords , and instead of their name when speaking to them , the term `` my lord '' is used . a duke is never called a lord . `` your grace '' is used for a duke .
