Salsa     salsa is a type of music and dance of hispanic origin . salsa music is based on cuban music . this is a `` fusion '' of musical ideas which originally came from africa and spain . during 1965-1975 in new york , musicians of cuban and puerto rican origin combined to produce this cuban-style music . the music got the label of 'salsa ' . no-one really knows how this happened , but everyone recognised how good it was to have a label for it . over time , salsa bands worked in other influences . for example , in the late 60s willie colon developed numbers that made use of brazilian rhythms . n.y. radio programmes offered 'salsarengue ' as a further combination . the question of whether or not salsa is anything more than cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years . initially , not much difference could be heard . later it became clear that salsa in new york was a bit different from popular music in cuba . also , miami , venezuela , colombia and other places all had their own ideas . it now seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s , at any rate in new york . the reasons for this are also much disputed . it is difficult for any music which uses a foreign language to succeed in the biggest english-speaking market-place .
