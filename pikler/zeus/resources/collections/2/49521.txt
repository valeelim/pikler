Gamma ray     gamma rays ( Î³-rays ) are electromagnetic waves with the smallest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum . they were discovered in 1900 by paul villard , and named in 1903 by ernest rutherford . gamma rays are like x-rays , but the waves are smaller in wavelength . both gamma rays and x-rays are photons with very high energies , and gamma have even more energy . they are also a type of ionizing radiation . gamma rays can travel through thicker materials than x-rays can . gamma rays are produced by some types of radioactive atoms . cobalt-60 and potassium-40 are two isotopes that emit gamma rays . cobalt-60 is created in accelerators and is used in hospitals . potassium-40 occurs naturally . small amounts of potassium-40 are in all plants and animals . gamma rays from potassium-40 each have an energy of 1460 thousand electron volts ( kev ) . gamma rays and x-rays can also be distinguished by their origin : x-rays are emitted by electrons outside the nucleus , while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus .
