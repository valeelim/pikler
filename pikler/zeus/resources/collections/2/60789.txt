Plate tectonics     plate tectonics is a theory of geology . it has been developed to explain large scale motions of the earth 's lithosphere . this theory builds on older ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading . dissipation of heat from the mantle is the original source of energy driving plate tectonics . exactly how this works is still a matter of debate . the driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going research . the outermost part of the earth 's interior is made up of two layers . the lithosphere , above , includes the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle . below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere . although solid , the asthenosphere can flow like a liquid on long time scales . large convection currents in the asthenosphere transfer heat to the surface , where plumes of less dense magma break apart the plates at the spreading centers . the deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again . this is caused by extremely high pressure . ocean lithosphere varies in thickness . because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards , it gets thicker as it moves further away from the mid-ocean ridge . typically , the thickness varies from about thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than at subduction zones .
