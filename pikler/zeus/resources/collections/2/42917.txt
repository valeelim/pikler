Laser printer     a laser printer is a printer for computers . it uses led-technology to get small particles of toner from a cartridge onto paper . very often , this is more economical to use than the ink of inkjet printers . the laser printer was first invented by a team at xerox in 1969. the first laser printer was called the xerox 2000. laser printing is a process which typically involves seven steps : 1. raster image processing : the processor inside the printer converts the data to be printed from its current file format , into a bitmap of the page to be printed - this is then stored in raster image memory . 1. charging : an electrostatic charge is then projected onto a revolving photosensitive drum inside the printer . 1. writing : a laser beam is directed at a rotating polygonal mirror , which redirects the beam onto the photosensitive drum . the rasterized data in memory is now read , and used to control whether the laser is on or off , as the beam sweeps across the drum - where the laser beam strikes the drum the charge is reversed , creating a latent electrical image on the surface .
