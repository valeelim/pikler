Non-vascular plant     non-vascular plants is a general term for those plants without a vascular system ( xylem and phloem ) . although non-vascular plants do not have these tissues , some of them have other tissues for internal transport of water . nonvascular plants have no roots , stems , or leaves . these structures always have some vascular tissue . the term `` non-vascular plant '' is no longer used in biological classification . non-vascular plants include two quite different groups : - the bryophyta ( mosses ) , the marchantiophyta ( liverworts ) , and the anthocerotophyta ( hornworts ) . because these plants have no water-conducting tissues , they do not have the structural complexity and size of most vascular plants . - algae - especially the green algae . recent studies have demonstrated that the algae actually consist of several unrelated groups . it turns out that common features of living in water and photosynthesis were misleading as indicators of close relationship . only the green algae are still considered relatives of the plants .
