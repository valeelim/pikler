Slave trade     during the history of slavery , there were many different forms of human exploitation across many cultures . slavery is a condition in which people are owned or completely controlled by other people . buying and selling slaves is a trade as old as many of the oldest civilizations . a modern form of the slave trade is called human trafficking . in one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations . early hunter-gatherers had no use for slaves they did everything for themselves . having another pair of hands to help them meant another mouth to feed . slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people . once men gathered in cities and towns and there was more than enough food , having a cheap supply of labor made sense . this is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared . the main source of slaves was war . when a town was captured , the men were killed and the women were enslaved to work in the fields or as concubines . slaves made up only a small percentage of the earliest civilizations . these included china 's yangtze river valley , india 's indus valley , egypt 's nile valley and the tigris and euphrates valleys in mesopotamia .
