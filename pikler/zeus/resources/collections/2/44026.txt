Liopleurodon     liopleurodon was a large species of pliosaur . it was an apex predator in the upper jurassic seas , around 160â€“155 million years ago . it grew up to 6.39 metres ( 21 feet ) long . it was a relative of `` pliosaurus '' and `` kronosaurus '' . it preyed on other marine animals such as `` ophthalmosaurus '' . some fossil remains excavated from the kimmeridge clay formation in england indicate a much larger animal , perhaps up to long . however , these have not been put in the genus `` liopleurodon '' . `` liopleurodon '' 's nose allowed it to smell underwater . it could smell prey from some distance away . despite needing to breath air , liopleurodon spent its entire life at sea and was unable to leave the water . consequently , it would have given birth to its young alive and may have visited shallower water to breed . species . - `` l. ferox '' ( type ) - `` l. pachydeirus '' - `` l. rossicus '' - `` l. macromerus ''
