Market forms     in economics , market structure ( also known as market form ) describes the state of a market with respect to competition . most market forms given below talk about a `` homogeneous product '' . this simply means that they all make the same kind of product ( like sugar , or soap ) , and that the individual consumer does not care where he or she buys from . they simply want to get the cheapest one , since all kinds of sugars ( or soaps ) look the same anyway . the major market forms are : - perfect competition : there are many firms making a homogeneous product . - monopolistic competition , also called competitive market : there are a large number of independent firms . each firm has a very small proportion of the market share . - oligopoly : a market is dominated by a small number of firms which own more than 40 % of the market share . - oligopsony : a market dominated by many sellers and a few buyers . - monopoly : there is only one provider of a product or service . - natural monopoly : a monopoly in which economies of scale cause efficiency to increase continuously with the size of the firm .
