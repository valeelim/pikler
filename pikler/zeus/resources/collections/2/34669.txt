Hiragana     hiragana are part of the japanese writing system . japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence , usually content words , and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar ( in english these would be words like “ from ” and “ his ” ) . hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words . hiragana is a syllabary , which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable . it is therefore different from a language such as english which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound ( phoneme ) . there is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names . the two kana systems are quite easy to learn , but kanji takes years of practice . in contrast , the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks . in the past hiragana was considered as women 's writing , while men wrote in kanji . since kanji suit well in chinese but poorly in japanese , it was the women who wrote the first japanese books , poems and songs . later the buddhist clerics , such as rennyo ( d. 1498 ) , wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand and everyone to read .
