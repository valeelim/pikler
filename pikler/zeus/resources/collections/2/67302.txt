Arturo Toscanini     arturo toscanini ( 25 march 1867 – 16 january 1957 ) was an italian conductor . most musicians think he was the greatest conductor of his time . his fame was legendary : he was probably the first conductor to become a world superstar . he had an incredibly good memory and could remember every single note of the large number of works he conducted . he had a photographic memory so that he could remember what the pages looked like . sometimes he found little mistakes in the scores which no one else had ever noticed . he had a very keen sense of hearing and knew exactly what each instrument was doing . he also had a fiery temperament and there are movies of him shouting angrily at his orchestra in rehearsals . in the early days of gramophone recordings he made some of the first recordings of famous orchestral works . toscanini was born in parma in italy . he won a scholarship to the local music conservatory , where he learned to play the cello . he joined the orchestra of an opera company and he toured south america with them in 1886. while performing verdi ’ s opera `` aida '' in rio de janeiro the audience did not like the conductor and they booed him so that he had to leave the stage . no one knew what to do at first , but then they persuaded toscanini , who was only 19 years old , to put down his cello and conduct the orchestra . he did this brilliantly from memory ( without looking at the music ) and that night he became famous .
