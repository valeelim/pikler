Tierce de Picardie     in music a tierce de picardie ( meaning `` picardy third '' ) is a major chord at the end of a piece of music in a minor key . in the 16th to 17th centuries this was a very common way to end a piece in a minor key . this is because music in the minor sounds melancholy or disturbed in comparison to the major because the third note of the scale is flattened ( lowered by a semitone ) . in the harmonic series this minor third is the 17th harmonic which sounds dissonant against the fundamental ( first note of the scale ) . this means that ending in the major gives a sense of relief after the tension of the minor . in a piece in a minor , for example , where the third note of the scale is c natural , in a tierce de picardie the final chord will include a c sharp , changing the chord from a minor to a major . beethoven ’ s `` fifth symphony '' is in c minor but the last movement is in the major . this is not a tierce de picardie in this case , as the term applies only when just the last chord alters . the term was introduced in 1767 by rousseau in his `` dictionnaire de musique '' ( dictionary of music ) . “ tierce ” means “ third ” , but no one knows why he called it “ picardie ” ( picardy is an area in the north of france ) .
