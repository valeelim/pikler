Conway's Game of Life    conway 's game of life the game of life is an imaginary robot game ( cellular automaton ) made by the british mathematician john horton conway in 1970. the reason it is called a game is because people who play the game can set it up in different ways to make it do different things . sometimes people play the game by changing the way the imaginary robot is set up at the start to watch what happens . the game of life is a zero-player game because it changes without anybody playing ( after the starting position is chosen ) . a different type of game lets two players set up imaginary robots to see which one is better . the game is played on a grid of squares called `` cells '' , each cell is black ( alive ) or white ( dead ) . when people are playing the game , they start by making some dead cells alive . then the alive cells can make other cells alive or dead because of the rules of the game . the rules are : 1. any alive cell that is touching less than two alive neighbours dies . 1. any alive cell touching four or more alive neighbours dies .
