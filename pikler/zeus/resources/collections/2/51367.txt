Oligopoly     in economics , an oligopoly is a market form in which the market or industry is controlled by a small number of sellers . usually , the market has high barriers to entry , which prevents new firms from entering the market or even be able to have a significant market share . as there are only a few sellers in the market , each seller would take note of the actions made by one another , and thinks about how the other sellers will respond when making decisions as such , there is a possibility in which an oligopoly can come together to make a common decision that allows them to have less competition and charge higher prices for consumers . in many countries , some country-held companies were privatized . very often , this privatization lead to oligopolies . in many countries , there are only a handful of companies providing networks for mobile phones . they control the prices for accessing the network . that is why using a mobile phone is often much more expensive than using a land line one . trains run by private sectors are much costlier than those run by a government . as a government gives rights to private sectors to get a hold of some other sectors , they take advantage of it .
