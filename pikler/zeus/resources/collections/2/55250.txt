Placebo     a placebo is a treatment for a disease or condition which is deliberately ineffective . the motive usually is that if a person believes that a medicine , diet , or other treatment is good for himself or herself , then it is good for the person . sometimes sick people who receive a placebo feel like they are getting better , and sometimes their bodies actually do get better . when patients have that response , it is called the `` placebo effect '' . the term `` placebo effect '' ( or `` placebo response '' ) was introduced in 1920. it is the response of the subject which causes the observed effect , not the substance . john haygarth tested a placebo effect in the 18th century . it showed `` to a degree which has never been suspected , what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination '' . émile coué , a french apothecary ( pharmacist ) , working between 1882 and 1910 , discovered what later came to be known as the `` placebo effect '' . he reassured his clients by praising each remedy 's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each medication . in 1901 coué began to study under hypnosis . in 1913 , coué and his wife founded `` la société lorraine de psychologie appliquée '' . his book `` self-mastery through conscious autosuggestion '' was published in england ( 1920 ) and in the united states ( 1922 ) .
