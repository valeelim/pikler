Xenarthra     the xenarthra is a superorder of mammals . it is a group of placental mammals ( infraclass eutheria ) . they live at present only in the americas , and are anteaters , tree sloths , and armadillos . their origins can be traced back as far as the palaeogene ( about 60-65 million years ago ( mya ) , shortly after the mesozoic ) in south america . xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in south america during its long period of isolation , invaded the antilles by the early miocene , and then spread to central and north america as part of the great american interchange . nearly all of the once abundant big xenarthrans , such as ground sloths , glyptodonts , and pampatheres went extinct at the end of the pleistocene . xenarthrans differ from other placental mammals in several ways . the name xenarthra means 'strange joints ' , and was chosen because their vertebral joints have extra articulations and are unlike those of any other mammals . the males lack external testicles , which are instead placed between the bladder and the rectum . also , xenarthrans have the lowest metabolic rates among the therians .
