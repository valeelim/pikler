Internal medicine     internal medicine is the branch and specialty of medicine concerning the diagnosis and nonsurgical treatment of diseases in adults , especially of internal organs . doctors of internal medicine , also called `` internists '' , are required to have included in their medical schooling and postgraduate training at least three years dedicated to learning how to prevent , diagnose , and treat diseases that affect adults . internists are trained to solve puzzling diagnostic problems and handle severe chronic illnesses and situations where several different illnesses may strike at the same time . internists can choose to focus their practice on general internal medicine , or may take additional training to `` subspecialize '' in one of 13 areas of internal medicine , generally organized by organ system . cardiologists , for example , are doctors of internal medicine who subspecialize in diseases of the heart . the training an internist receives to subspecialize in a particular medical area is both broad and deep . subspecialty training ( often called a `` fellowship '' ) usually requires an additional one to three years beyond the standard three year general internal medicine residency . ( residencies come after a student has graduated from medical school . )
