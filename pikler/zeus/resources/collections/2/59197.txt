Style guide     a style guide ( also known as style manual ) is a set of rules for language usage and design of documents ( records ) . some style guides are about things related to graphic design , such as arranging words and white space on a page . website style guides often help with visual or technical things . literary style guides help with choosing the best words , common errors in grammar , punctuation and spelling ; and help for how to express ideas in a precise , fair and forceful way . some modern style guides are for use by all people . these are usually more about language than about how it should look . style guides do not stop a writer from using his own unique style , but some writers believe style guides are too restrictive . like language itself , many style guides change as time passes . for example , the associated press stylebook is updated every year .
