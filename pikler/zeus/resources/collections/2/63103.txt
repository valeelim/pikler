Skipper (butterfly)    skipper ( butterfly ) the skippers are a family of butterflies , the hesperiidae . they are named after their quick , darting flight . skippers used to be classified in their own superfamily , hesperioidea , because they have their antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet while the other butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae . skippers also have generally stockier bodies than regular butterflies , with stronger wing muscles . there are about 3400 species of skippers . they are usually classified in the following subfamilies : - awls , awlets and policemen ( subfamily coeliadinae , about 75 species ) - grass skippers ( subfamily hesperiinae , over 2000 species ) - skipperlings ( subfamily heteropterinae , about 150 species ) - giant skippers ( subfamily megathyminae , about 100 species ) - spread-winged skippers ( subfamily pyrginae , about 1000 species ) - firetips ( subfamily pyrrhopyginae , about 150 species ) - australian skippers ( subfamily trapezitinae , about 60 species ) many species of skippers look frustratingly alike . for example , some species in the genera `` erynnis '' , `` hesperia '' , and `` amblyscirtes '' can not currently be distinguished in the field by experts , the only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia .
