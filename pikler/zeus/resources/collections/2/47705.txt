Urban area     an urban area is an area where many people live and work close together . the population density is higher than in the surrounding area . it is where buildings are close together . urban is the opposite of rural , where farm lands and nature are . urban areas are usually cities and towns . most of the work available in urban areas is factory and office work . agricultural work is rare because buildings are close together and there is no space for farm lands . there are different urban area definitions for each country . the definitions mostly depend on how populated the country is and if the definition shows a true percentage of how urbanized the country is . for example , in poland an urban area is any place that has the status of a town , whereas in china it is any district , city , or town with a population density higher than 1500 people per square kilometer . the urban population definition for canadian and scandinavian countries depends on density . if there is a house every 200 meters it is classified as urban .
