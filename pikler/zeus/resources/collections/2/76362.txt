Surface gravity     the surface gravity , `` g '' , of an astronomical or other object is the gravitational acceleration experienced at its surface . the surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration caused by the gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the object 's surface and which , in order not to disturb the system , has negligible mass . surface gravity is measured in units of acceleration , which , in the si system , are meters per second squared . it may also be described as a multiple of the earth 's gravity , `` g '' = 9.80665 m/s . in astrophysics , the surface gravity may be expressed as log `` g '' , which is obtained by first expressing the gravity in cgs units , where the unit of acceleration is centimeters per second squared , and then taking the base 10 logarithm . other websites . - newtonian surface gravity
