Mesocyclone     a mesocyclone is a vortex of air , about 2 to 10 km in diameter ( the mesoscale of meteorology ) , inside a convective storm . that is , it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis , usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere . they are most often cyclonic , that is , related with a localized low pressure area inside a severe thunderstorm . such storms can create strong surface winds and a lot of hail . mesocyclones often happen together with updrafts in supercells , where tornadoes may form . mesocyclones are normally relatively very small in size ; they lie between the synoptic scale ( hundreds of kilometers ) and small scale ( hundreds of meters ) . other websites . - electronic journal of severe storms meteorology
