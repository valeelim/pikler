Water content     water content means the amount of water present in a porous substance , such as soil . this term is used in hydrogeology , soil science and soil mechanics . in saturated groundwater aquifers , all available spaces are filled with water . above a capillary fringe , pore spaces have air in them too . gaps between soil particles are called `` pore spaces '' or `` voids '' . these voids contain various amounts of either water or air . soil moisture content can be expressed in different basis : - gravimetric : the mass of water/mass of solid material - volumetric : the volume of soil/total porosity the amount of void space within a soil depends on the distribution of particle sizes , and is quantified by soil porosity . soil moisture is more generally considered within the context of hydrology , where it represents the immediate store of infiltrating rainfall , before it either evapotranspires or contributes to groundwater recharge . other pages . - humidity
