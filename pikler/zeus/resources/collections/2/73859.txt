Trail of Tears     the trail of tears was a forced movement of native americans in the united states between 1836 and 1839. the united states government forced native americans to leave their lands and move outside the united states . the u.s. then took over the native americans ' lands and made the united states bigger . because thousands of native americans died during this forced move , it is called the `` trail of tears . '' in 1827 , gold was found near dahlonega in georgia . this resulted in a gold rush . but at that time , a native american nation called the cherokees lived in georgia . many cherokee children went to american schools . the cherokees had their own newspaper and built three-story houses . some even owned slaves . even so , president andrew jackson wanted this land to belong to the united states . the land was worth over $ 7,000,000 ( about $ 179.5 million in 2015 u.s. dollars ) . jackson signed a law that forced the cherokees to move . this was called the indian removal act . however , at that time , the cherokees had their own nation and their own government . they did not have to follow laws made by the united states . therefore , jackson signed laws that let him take nearly all the cherokees ' rights .
