Red blood cell     red blood cells ( also known as rbcs , red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes ) are cells in the blood which transport oxygen . in women , there are about 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood . in men , there are 5.4 million red blood cells per microliter of blood . red blood cells are red because they have hemoglobin in them . the most important function of red blood cells is the transport of oxygen ( o ) to the tissues . the hemoglobin absorbs oxygen in the lungs . then it travels through blood vessels and brings oxygen to all other cells via the heart . the blood cells go through the lungs ( to collect oxygen ) , through the heart ( to give all cells oxygen ) . they go back to the heart to be re-pumped to the lungs ( to again collect oxygen ) , so the blood in your body travels in a double circuit , going through your heart twice before it completes one full circulation of the body . a fact which makes mammalian red blood cells different to all other cells is that , when they are mature , red blood cells do not have a nucleus . all other vertebrates have red cells with nuclei .
