Fate     fate or destiny is the idea that the future is already planned even if people do not know what their fate is ( what is going to happen to them ) . humans in nearly all cultures have had ideas about their fate being “ predetermined ” ( fixed in advance ) . people who live unhappy lives may believe that their misery is because of their fate and that they can do nothing about it . this is called being “ fatalistic ” . other people may believe that they can control their fate by being brave and trying to “ overcome ” fate by improving themselves and their lives . in greek mythology there were three fates . they were three goddesses who determined when every person was going to be born , how they would live and when and how they would die . human beings in many cultures had lots of ways in which they would try to “ read ” their fate ( know what would happen to them ) . sometimes they would try to read their fate in the stars ( this is called astrology ) . in other cultures they might ask a person with powers of magic like a shaman . the ancient greeks often went to delphi to ask the oracle .
