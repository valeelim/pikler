Tide     a tide is the periodic rising and falling of earth 's ocean surface caused mainly by the gravitational pull of the moon acting on the oceans . tides cause changes in the depth of marine and estuarine ( river mouth ) waters . tides also make oscillating currents known as tidal streams ( ~'rip tides ' ) . this means that being able to predict the tide is important for coastal navigation . the strip of seashore that is under water at high tide and exposed at low tide , called the intertidal zone , is an important ecological product of ocean tides . the height of tides varies somewhat with the phases of the moon . at new moon and full moon , tides are higher because the sun 's tidal force adds to the moon 's . this is called `` spring tide '' . in most places , there are two tides a day . they each have a high point ( the high tide ) and a low point ( the low tide ) . we speak of a `` flood tide '' coming in towards high tide , and an `` ebb tide '' going out towards low tide . the period of the tide is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes , exactly half a `` tidal lunar day '' . the lunar day is longer than the earth day because the moon orbits in the same direction the earth spins . this is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05Â½ ( not at 1:00 ) .
