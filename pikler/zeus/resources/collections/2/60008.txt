Single (music)    single ( music ) in popular music marketing , a single is a record release with only one or two songs . the first song ( usually the one given the most promotion , and heard more often in the media ) is called an a-side , while any other song on the single is called a b-side . the pairing of recordings on a single comes from the days of and vinyl records , when discs had two playable sides . modern compact disc singles may contain more than one version of either the a- or b-side , or sometimes an additional recording by the same performer . b-sides may be selections from an album , or songs not otherwise issued for sale . many times the chance to get a new song issued as an a-side creates competition between members of bands , or teams of songwriters . john lennon and paul mccartney of the beatles tried to write better songs than each other , to get more a-sides than the other . george harrison , also a beatle , rarely had his songs chosen for singles , but had a hit with `` something '' for the band . in the days of vinyl singles , for both a- and b-sides were paid equally . many listeners never played b-sides more than once , and radio focused on a-sides . many people who made recordings knew this , and used it to earn extra money from sales , or to promote other music they made . phil spector sometimes used short by his studio band as b-sides to singles he produced .
