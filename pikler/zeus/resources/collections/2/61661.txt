Ecclesiastical Latin     the term ecclesiastical latin ( sometimes called church latin ) means the latin language that is used in documents of the roman catholic church and in its latin liturgies . it is not a distinct language or dialect , but only the latin language used for ecclesiastical purposes , because the same language can be used also for commercial or other purposes . the church issued the dogmatic definitions of the first seven general councils in greek , and even in rome greek remained at first the language of the liturgy and the language in which the first popes wrote . the holy see is not obliged to use latin as its official language and , in theory , could change its practice . but latin has the advantage that the meaning of its words have less likelihood of changing radically from century to century . this helps to ensure theological precision and orthodoxy . accordingly , recent popes have reaffirmed the importance of latin for the church and in particular for those undertaking ecclesiastical studies .
