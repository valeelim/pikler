Noah's Ark    noah 's ark noah 's ark , according to the book of genesis ( chapters 6â€“9 ) in the bible , was a ship that god instructed noah to build to save himself , his family , and every kind of animal , because god was going to destroy the earth by bringing about a great flood . it also says that the ark rested on the highest point in the area which was mount ararat , in what is now turkey . the size of the ship was 300 by 50 by 30 ells , according to genesis 6:14. this makes it about half the size of the ship rms queen elizabeth 2 , or 137 by 22.9 , by 13.7 metres . it would have had about the same tonnage ( weight ) as the rms titanic . there have been many recorded sightings of the ark over the years , however no physical evidence has been proven to show that the ark is currently on mount ararat . according to the bible , the ark was made of gopherwood . gopherwood is possibly the wood of a cypress tree , which was used for making ships in the middle east . cypress was good for making ships because it had strong wood from a large trunk and limbs . however , no one knows for sure what kind of tree gopherwood was .
