Rabbi     rabbi ( in the hebrew classic רִבִּי `` ribbi '' ; in the hebrew modern רַבִּי `` rabbi '' ) in judaism signifies `` professor , master '' or literally `` grand '' . the word `` rabbi '' ( `` my master '' ) derives from the hebrew root `` rav '' , that in the hebrew biblical signifies `` grand '' or `` distinct '' ( in knowledge ) . in judaism , `` rabbi '' is a title of respect for a particularly learned member of a jewish community . most rabbis earn their title by studying jewish law at a seminary or yeshiva . the primary role of a rabbi is to teach torah . in addition , rabbis often act as the religious leader of a jewish community . in contrast to many other religions , a rabbi is not required to be present at life cycle events in judaism . nevertheless , rabbis still normally preside over life cycle events . historically , only men could be rabbis . this is still true in orthodox judaism . most non-orthodox jews allow women to be rabbis as well . three rabbis together can form a rabbinic court , or beit din . this is done when there is a legal conflict between two jews . they judge the conflict based on jewish law . this is also done when somebody wants to convert to judaism .
