Tetrapod     tetrapods ( greek `` tetrapoda '' = four feet ) are vertebrate tetrapodomorph land animals . the basic tetrapod plan is four legs and feet . this kind of locomotion is quadrupedal . amphibians , reptiles , dinosaurs , birds , and mammals are all tetrapods . even though snakes do not have limbs , they are tetrapods because they evolved from animals with four limbs . the earliest tetrapods evolved from the sarcopterygii , or lobe-finned fish , into air-breathing amphibians , perhaps in the upper devonian period . this means the transition took place in fish , before the land was the main habitat . this is typical of transitional fossils undergoing mosaic evolution . clear fossil tetrapod tracks from the mid-devonian predate previous tetrapod records by 18 million years . these tracks are from the middle devonian of poland , dated to nearly 400 million years ago . the footprints were made in the mud of a tropical lagoon , and no animal of that time could have made the tracks except a tetrapod . the find strongly suggests that the animals were fish , not amphibia , when the transition to limbs occurred . the term fishapod is becoming used . they would have been derived from lobe-finned fish ( sarcopterygii ) , but of a genus whose body fossil has not yet been found . the polish team suggest the fish > tetrapod transition might have taken place as early as the lower devonian .
