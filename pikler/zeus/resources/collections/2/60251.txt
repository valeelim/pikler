Purgatory     according to the teaching of the roman catholic church , purgatory is the `` final purification of the elect '' : `` all who die in god 's grace and friendship , but still imperfectly purified , are indeed assured of their eternal salvation ; but after death they undergo purification , so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven . '' â€œ in purgatory there are different levels ; the lowest is close to hell and the highest gradually draws near to heaven . it is not all souls day , but , christmas , that the greatest number of souls leave purgatory . there are in purgatory , souls who pray ardently to god , but for whom no relative or friend prays on earth . god makes them benefit from the prayers of other people . it happens that god permits them to manifest themselves in different way , close to their relatives on earth , in order to remind men of the existence of purgatory and to solicit their prayers to come close to god who is just , but good . perhaps the best-known instance of purgatory in the arts is dante 's `` purgatorio '' , the second book of his `` divine comedy '' . likewise , the ghost in william shakespeare 's `` hamlet '' may also presuppose a belief in purgatory ,
