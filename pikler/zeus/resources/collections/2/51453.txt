Limpet     the name limpet is used for many marine and freshwater gastropod species which have a simple conical shell . the phrase `` true limpets '' is used only for marine limpets in the ancient clade patellogastropoda . this article is mainly about the true limpets . true limpets are small marine gastropod molluscs with flattened , cone-shaped shells . they live throughout the intertidal zone , attached to rocks or other hard ground . they attach themselves using mucus and a muscular `` foot '' , which seals them against the rock and protects them from desiccation during low tide , and from high-energy waves action . limpets eat by grazing on algae found on rock surfaces . they scrape films of algae from the rock with a radula , a ribbon-like tongue with rows of teeth . limpets move by rippling the muscles of their foot in a wave-like motion . most limpets are less than 3in ( 8cm ) long , but a west mexican limpet grows to be 8in ( 20 cm ) . some key-hole limpets have a hole at the top , through which gas exchange can occur ( they are not true limpets ) .
