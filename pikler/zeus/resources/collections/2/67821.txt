Rings of Neptune     the planet neptune has a dim planetary ring system which is made up of several separate rings and some `` ring arcs '' . the `` rings arcs '' are part of the outer ring called the adams ring and are not to be seen anywhere else . the ring `` particles '' ( small parts ) are unusually dark colored , and have large amounts of microscopic dust . neptune has thirteen known moons . four of them orbit the planet inside the outermost rings . the rings around neptune could not be seen from earth with strong telescopes . the evidence that they were there was first seen when scientists were watching the planet as it passed between the earth and a star . ( when this happens , the light of the star is blocked . this is called `` stellar occulation '' . ) scientists watched this happen 50 times , and on five of those times in the early 1980s they saw the star give a little `` blink '' just before or after the planet covered it . this meant that rings around the planet were blocking the light , but the rings were not complete .
