Fertile Crescent     the fertile crescent is a historical region in the middle east that includes the levant , mesopotamia and ancient egypt . these countries on a map together have a shape that is similar to a crescent , so archaeologist james henry breasted spoke of the `` fertile crescent '' because he wanted to show the similarities of the cultures of this region in ancient times . all these lands are watered by important rivers : nile , jordan , euphrates and tigris . together they cover some 400-500,000 square kilometers , and the region extends from the eastern shore of the mediterranean sea around the north of the syrian desert and through the jazirah and mesopotamia to the persian gulf . these areas are in present-day egypt , israel , west bank , gaza strip , and lebanon and parts of jordan , syria , iraq , south-eastern turkey and south-western iran . the population of the nile river basin is about 70 million , the jordan river basin about 20 million , and the tigris and euphrates basins about 30 million , giving the present-day fertile crescent a total population of around 120 million , or at least a quarter of the population of the middle east .
