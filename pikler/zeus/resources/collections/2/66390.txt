Distributed computing     distributed computing is a word from computer science , about using many computers to solve a big problem . one way to solve a big problem is to use a very fast computer called a supercomputer . supercomputers are very expensive , and many scientists can not buy them . a cheaper way to solve a big problem is to split it into smaller problems , when possible . these smaller problems can then be solved by different computers ( or processors ) , which talk to each other over a computer network . because many computers work together , this makes them as powerful as a supercomputer . one example where distributed computing is used is the great internet mersenne prime search . other page . - grid computing
