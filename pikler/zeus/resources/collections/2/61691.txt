Virtual memory     virtual memory is a way of managing memory which is a recent trend of technology used in computers . computers run software . this software will need computer memory to run , and do what it needs to do . most computers in use today can do more than one thing at a time , they run more than one application . this is known as multiprocessing . in this case , all the programs or applications that are running on the computer at a time share its resources . a computer does not have more processors or main memory just because more programs run on it . virtual memory is the idea that the application `` sees '' a `` block of memory '' of a given size . the application can use this memory as it sees fit . this block of memory is `` virtual '' in the sense that it comes from different parts . some of it may be in the main memory of the computer , but some may also be on disk . the cpu has a special part , called arithmetic logic unit which does some of the translations between application memory and system resources . modern operating systems also do a part of this work .
