Redox     redox ( shorthand for reduction/oxidation ) describes all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation number ( oxidation state ) changed . the term `` redox '' comes from the two concepts of reduction and oxidation . it can be explained in simple terms : - oxidation describes the loss of electrons by a molecule , atom or ion - reduction describes the gain of electrons by a molecule , atom or ion which gains and loses electrons can be easily memorised by the abbreviation oil rig , which stands for , `` oxidation is loss , '' or losing electrons , and `` reduction is gain , '' or gaining electrons . but there are exceptions . redox is a chemical process . it can be described within chemical formulas . this example describes the process that occurs in a blast furnace , where iron ( fe ) reacts with carbon ( c ) : related pages . - electrochemistry other websites . - redox reactions calculator - redox reactions at chemguide - online redox reaction equation balancer , balances equations of any half-cell and full reactions
