Narasimha     narasimha , according to hinduism , was the fourth avatar of vishnu . in this form , vishnu had the body of a man , but he had a head of a lion . this avatar of vishnu is also a symbol of great strength . the hindu scriptures tell this story about narashimha . there was a demon ( a `` daitya '' ) named hiranyakashipu . he was against all gods . but , his son named prahlad used to worship the gods , especially vishnu . hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death . hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead . vishnu became narasimha , and protected prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping hiranyakashipu . brahma had granted hiranyakashipu a boon that kept him safe so that he could not be killed by a human , animal or deva . he also could not be killed in the day or night , or inside or outside of his palace . this made hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him . when he wanted to kill his son for worshiping vishnu , vishnu came to earth incarnated as a half-man , half-lion creature ( neither man nor human ) . this way vishnu killed hiranyakashipu in the twilight ( neither day , nor night ) and on the porch of the palace ( neither inside , nor outside ) , without disrupting the boon given to him by brahma .
