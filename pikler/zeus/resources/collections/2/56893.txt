Escape velocity     escape velocity is the initial speed that something would need to completely escape the gravity of a large body , like a star or a planet ( such as the earth ) , by mere inertia . if a ball is thrown upwards while standing on the ground , the ball will reach a certain height ( the faster thrown - the higher ) and fall back down . but imagine if the ball is thrown fast enough that it `` never '' falls back down , and instead travels into space farther and farther away from the earth . the minimum speed at which this could happen is called the escape velocity . the escape velocity at the surface of the earth is 11.2 kilometers per second ( or 6.96 miles per second ) , assuming there is no drag . this is , of course , a very high speed compared to how fast a ball can be thrown . even a bullet shot into the sky will fall back down , because its initial speed of nearly 1 kilometer per second ( or 0.621 miles per second ) is far from escape velocity . spacecraft starting from the surface of earth has a zero initial speed . but , if it has enough fuel , it may be permanently accelerated by its engine until it reaches escape velocity . then it will travel into space even after the engine is shut off .
