Broom     a broom is a cleaning tool . it consists of stiff fibres attached to , and roughly parallel to , a cylindrical handle , the broomstick . in the context of witchcraft , `` broomstick '' is likely to refer to the broom as a whole . a smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster . brooms have changed very much in their construction , since they developed from ad-hoc use of branches and bundles of several natural fibres . originally , all brooms were round , a shape that is easy to construct but inefficient for actually sweeping . brooms could be attached to a handle , either short for a whisk broom , or long for a broom used to sweep the floor or fireplace . the word for the tool was originally `` besom '' , `` broom '' simply being the material of which it was normally made . the fibres used in modern brooms are from broom corn . they are long , straight , durable , and bound together in the plant . the newest major change is the `` flat broom '' , invented by the shakers in the 1800s , which has far more width for pushing dirt and nearly all brooms produced today are flat brooms .
