Polder     empoldering is a method of reclaiming land from the sea . empoldering involves the use of polders , and is also a way to control floods . a polder is a piece of land in a low-lying area that has been reclaimed from a body of water by building dikes and drainage canals . although empoldering is usually carried out in low-lying coastal areas , it can be also carried out in inland areas such as lakes and rivers . it is commonly carried out in countries like the netherlands , where much of the country is below sea level and subject to flooding . about one-fifth of the land in the netherlands has been reclaimed from the sea . their largest and most successful project is the zuider zee project . polders have 2 distinct features . firstly , they are enclosed by dikes to keep the water out . the dikes also serve to protect the polder from erosion . secondly , polders are continually maintained by systems of drainage canals and pumps which prevent them from becoming waterlogged and hence , suitable for cultivation .
