Pedestrian     a pedestrian is a person travelling on foot , whether walking or running . in modern times , the term mostly refers to someone walking on a road or footpath , but this was not the case historically . the main way humans get around is by walking . the first humans walked out of africa about 60,000 years ago . we walked across india to reach australia . we walked across asia to reach the americas . we walked from the fertile crescent area to reach europe . nowadays , roads often have a designated footpath attached especially for pedestrian traffic , called the `` sidewalk '' in american english and the `` pavement '' in british english . there are also footpaths not associated with a road which are used only by pedestrians , especially ramblers , hikers or hill-walkers and there are roads not associated with a footpath . these footpaths , in mountains or forests , are called trails . efforts are underway by pedestrian advocacy groups to make it easy to be a pedestrian in new developments , especially to counteract newer developments where 20 to 30 percent do not include sidewalks . some activists advocate large auto-free zones where pedestrians only or pedestrians and some non-motorised vehicles are allowed .
