Hydrolysis     hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process in which a chemical compound reacts with water . this is the type of reaction that is used to break down polymers into many smaller units . in this reaction , water is always added to the chemical compound . ( as noted above , hydrolysis of metal salts is more commonly known as hydration . ) many metal ions are strong lewis acids , and in water they may undergo hydrolysis to form `` basic salts '' . such salts contain a hydroxyl group that is directly bound to the metal ion in place of a water ligand . the positive charge on metal ions creates an attraction to water , a lewis base with a non-binding electron pair on the oxygen atom , and alters the water molecule 's electron density . this in turn increases the polarity of the o-h bond , which now acts as a proton donor under br√∏nsted-lowry acid-base theory to release the hydrogen as a h+ ion , increasing the acidity of the solution . for example , aluminium chloride undergoes extensive hydrolysis in water with the solution being very acidic .
