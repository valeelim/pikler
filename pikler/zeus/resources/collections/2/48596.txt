Snowball     a snowball is a ball of snow . they are usually made by a person picking snow up in their hands and pressing it together in the ball the size of their hand . snowballs are usually thrown at people or objects as a game called a snowball fight . making snowballs is a common activity for children when it snows . larger snowballs are made by using a ball the size of a hand and rolling it on the ground . as more snow sticks to it , the ball grows larger . larger snowballs are often used to make snowmen . the term `` snowball effect '' comes from this . it means as things go on , they get larger in the same way that a snowball gets larger as it rolls .
