Trail     a trail is a pedestrian path or road mainly used for walking , but often also for cycling , cross-country skiing or other activities . some trails are off-limits to everyone other than hikers , and few trails allow motorized vehicles . in the united states , the word footpath is also used to mean a trail ; however in australian english , new zealand english , indian english , and irish english this word means `` sidewalk '' ( american english ) or `` pavement '' ( british english ) . in australia , the word track can be used interchangeably with trail , and can refer to anything from a dirt road to a pedestrian walkway ( generally also unpaved ) . the term `` trail '' gained popularity during world war ii , when many servicemen from the united states were stationed in australia , which probably influenced its being adopted by elements of the australian media at the time ( see kokoda track ) . in new zealand , the word track is used almost exclusively except in reference to cross-country skiing , where trail is used . trail use has become very popular for a wide variety of users . some trails are meant as nature trails , and are used by people learning about the natural world . many trails are day trails , what means that they are generally used by people out for a short hike , less than a day . some trails are backpacking trails , or long-distance trails , and are used by both day hikers and by backpackers . some of the trails are over a thousand miles ( 1,500 km ) long and may be hiked in sections by backpackers , or completed in one trip by dedicated hikers . some trails are specifically used by other outdoor enthusiasts to gain access to another feature , such as good climbing sites . many runners also favor running on trails rather than pavement , as giving a more vigorous work-out and better developing agility skills , as well as providing a more pleasant exercise environment . see trail running .
