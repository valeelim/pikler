Armadillo     armadillos are in the cingulata , an order of new world placental mammals . the living ones have a leathery armored shell . the word `` armadillo '' is spanish for `` little armored one '' . there are about 10 living genera and about 20 species of armadillo . their average length is about 75 centimeters ( 30 in ) , including the tail . the giant armadillo grows up to 100 cm ( 39 in ) and weigh 30 kg ( 66lbs ) . all species live in the americas . most of the 20 species are found in open areas , such as grasslands , but some also live in forests . armadillos species are mostly found in south and central america , especially around paraguay . many species are endangered . the nine-banded armadillo has an unusual reproductive system , in which genetically identical quadruplets are born in each litter . because they are always genetically identical clones , the group of four young is a good subject for scientific , behavioural or medical tests . they provide the same biological and genetic makeup , and then get different treatment . this is the only regular case of 'polyembryony ' in the class mammalia , where one fertilised egg splits into four embryos . it only happens in the genus dasypus , and not in all armadillos . other animals which have this reproductive method are parasitoid wasps , certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates .
