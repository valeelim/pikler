Rationalism     rationalism is a branch of philosophy where the validity of an idea is determined by logic , rather than religious means such as revelations , meditation , emotions or observations . rationalist philosophers believe that all knowledge can be understood through a process of reasoning , without any external sources . they do not believe that human beings can understand everything this way , but that it is theoretically possible . rationalist philosophers attempt to understand ideas like god and the soul in this manner . the first people to talk about rationalism were marin mersenne and ren√© descartes , in the 17th and 18th centuries . other philosophers who are seen as rationalist today include baruch spinoza , gottfried leibniz and immanuel kant . famous people opposed to this idea were david hume and john locke . rationalism also influenced natural law . natural law is a theory that says that there are laws given by nature , valid everywhere . deism was also influenced by rationalism . according to deism , a supreme being created the universe . this being , and other religious truths can be determined by observing nature , and finding natural laws . this would make religions that are based on revelation unnecessary .
