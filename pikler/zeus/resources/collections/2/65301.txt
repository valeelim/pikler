Aspirator     an aspirator is a device that makes vacuum , because of the venturi effect . in the aspirator , fluid flows through it . the tube gets more thin , making the fluid flow faster , and making the pressure smaller . then , vacuum is taken from it . the aspirator is also known as an ejector or a filter pump . the most common type of aspirator is the water aspirator . it is used in laboratories for chemistry and biology . the aspirator has a fitted tee , which is attached to a faucet . it has a hose barb on one side . the flow of water passes through the straight part of the tee , which restricts the water flow at the intersection with the hose barb . the vacuum hose should be connected to this barb . the strength of the produced vacuum is limited by the vapour pressure of the flowing water . however , the strength of the vacuum is not limited if a gas is used as the working force .
