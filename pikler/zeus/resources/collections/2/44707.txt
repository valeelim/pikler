Hypotenuse     the hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degrees angle in a right triangle . it is always the longest side . for example : in this triangle , if angle c is 90 degrees , then the opposite side , `` c '' , is the hypotenuse . the hypotenuse is important in trigonometry , where it is used to calculate many functions . the length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known , using pythagoras ' theorem . in fact , the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known , using this theorem .
