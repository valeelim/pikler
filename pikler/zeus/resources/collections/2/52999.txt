Buoyancy     in physics , buoyancy ( ) is a force on an object making that object rise or move upward . it comes from the spanish word for `` float '' , `` boyar '' . buoyancy is made by the difference in pressure put on the object by the fluid or air that the object is in . the net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid that is displaced by the body . this force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter . buoyancy is important for many vehicles such as boats , ships , balloons , and blimps . if the object has exactly the same density as the liquid , then its buoyancy is the same as its weight . it will not sink or float . an object with a higher average density than the fluid has less buoyancy than weight and it will sink . that is why pebbles do not float . although a ship is made of steel which is more dense than water , it floats because it encloses a volume of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water . related pages . - submarine
