Astronomical unit     the astronomical unit ( au ) is a unit of length got from the earth 's orbit . it is the average distance the earth gets from the sun `` on the long axis of the ellipse '' . its definition is : the length of the semi-major axis of the earth 's elliptical orbit around the sun . `` semi-major '' means half the long axis . the au is about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles . astronomers usually measure distances within the solar system in astronomical units . mars is about 1.4 au from the sun , jupiter lies at roughly 5.2 au , and neptune is roughly 30 au from the sun . light travels an au in about 8.317 minutes . from 1976 to 2012 the au was defined as “ the radius of an unperturbed circular newtonian orbit about the sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass , moving with a mean motion of 0.01720209895 radians per day ( known as the gaussian constant ) ” . in 2012 , the iau redefined it to be simply . in the iers numerical standards , the speed of light in a vacuum is defined as `` c '' = , in accordance with the si units . the time to cover an au is τ = , resulting in the astronomical unit in metres as `` c '' τ = . it is very roughly the distance from the earth to the sun .
