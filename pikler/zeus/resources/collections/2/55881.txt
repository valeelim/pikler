Favism     glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( sometimes also called g6pd deficiency , or favism ) is a hereditary disease . this means it is passed on through the genes from a parent to the child . it leads to a form of anaemia . there are some means to treat it , though the focus of the doctors now lies on prevention ( avoiding parents passing it on to their child ) . as it is linked to the x chromosome , most people who suffer from it are male . sufferers can not make the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase . this will mean the circulation of sugar in their body is different . more red blood cells will be destroyed because of it . about 400 million people suffer from this condition . very often , it can be found in regions where there is also malaria . this is because the red blood cells found in people with favism are not targeted by malaria . this condition may result from an allergy to alkaloids in vicia faba ( faba bean , broad bean , windsor bean ) .
