Aral Sea     the aral sea ( ( aral tengizi ) , , ) is a lake in central asia . it is between kazakhstan in the north and karakalpakstan , an autonomous region of uzbekistan , in the south . since the 1960s , the aral sea shrank . 90 % of the sea has gone . the rivers that fed it ( the amu darya and the syr darya ) were used by the soviet union for irrigating cotton production . what is left of the aral sea is heavily polluted , largely as the result of weapons testing , industrial projects , and fertilizer runoff before and after the breakup of the soviet union . there is a project to save at least the northern part of the aral sea . for this , a dam was built in the 1990 to stop water running off . climate improved in the following years , and water levels rose again . however , that dam broke , and was rebuilt in 2005 , with international funding . another problem was that the island of rebirth had been used for the testing of biological weapons until 1993. it is currently contaminated with anthrax , the plague , and tularemia . since 2001 , it is no longer an island , but a peninsula .
