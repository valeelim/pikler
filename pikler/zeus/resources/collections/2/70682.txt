Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia     the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia ( asala ) was a marxist-leninist guerilla organization , that operated from 1975 to 1986. the stated intention of asala was `` to compel the turkish government to acknowledge publicly its alleged responsibility for the deaths of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 , pay reparations , and cede territory for an armenian homeland '' . asala was founded in 1975 in beirut , lebanon by hagop hagopian ( harutiun tagushian ) and kevork ajemian , a prominent contemporary writer . the group 's activities were primarily assassinations of turkish diplomats and politicians in western europe , in the united states and the middle east . a failed attack in geneva on october 3 , 1980 , in which two armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group , the 3 october organization . the asala 's eight point manifesto was published in 1981. continuous attacks prompted turkey to accuse cyprus , greece , syria , lebanon , and the soviet union of provoking or possibly funding the asala , though nothing of this sort was ever found to be true .
