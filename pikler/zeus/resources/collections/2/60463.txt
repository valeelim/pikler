Microdon     flies in the genus microdon are a type of hoverfly . `` microdon '' and its subfamily are different from most other flies because they are myrmecophiles . this means they live in ant colonies ( nests ) . there are more than 350 species of `` microdon '' in the world . some of these will be split off in time because `` microdon '' has been used as a catch-all for various unrelated species . most `` microdon '' live in the tropics ; 30 species live in north america . `` microdon '' adults are very hairy and look like bees . they are 8 to 15 mm long . the antennae are almost as long as the fly 's face . these flies have black or pale ( white or golden ) hairs , and their bodies are either black or metallic green or blue . the larvae of `` microdon '' flies look strange . they are very round and look like stout little slugs . at first scientists thought they were mollusks and scale insects . they move slowly . adult `` microdon '' flies do not hover around flowers such as many other hoverflies ; instead they remain close to the ant colonies where they grew up .
