Benign     the word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated , but can also mean that something is not harmful . it is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body . tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons . because of this , the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour . tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy . these are termed `` premalignant '' .
