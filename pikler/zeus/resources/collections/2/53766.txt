Deflation     deflation means that generally the prices of products are going down . it is the opposite of inflation . it is said , that deflation happens when there is less money than there are goods . it is also said that deflation is a sign of a weak state of that country 's economy , because deflation usually happens during an economic collapse . deflation is thought to be even worse than inflation . deflation starts when people are waiting for prices to go down even more . they will then spend less money . because of that , companies can not afford to keep up the amount of goods that are made , and have to lower that amount , as well as fire workers to make even a small profit . even if an economy is growing , there can be some amount of deflation - if the amount of money going around grows slower than the making of goods . there has not been much deflation in the world since the 1930s , except in japan . deflation can be helped by the country 's own government by lowering the companies ' tax levels , so they can lower their prices while getting the same profit . this way normal people are more encouraged to buy the cheap goods they were waiting for , and slowly the companies can make more profit . governments do not like deflation , because it means that they can collect less tax .
