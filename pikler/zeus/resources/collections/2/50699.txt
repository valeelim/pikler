Peanut     a peanut is a herbaceous plant in the legume family , `` fabaceae '' . it is native to south america , central america and mexico . peanuts are annual herbaceous plants growing 30 to 50 cm ( 1 to 1.5 ft ) tall . the peanut plant flowers above ground , then develops its pods underground . because of this , peanuts are often called groundnuts . other names include goobers , pinders , arachides ( french/italian ) , and man√≠ ( spanish ) . this strange legume yields shell-covered pods ( fruits ) that contain one or more seeds . a nut is a hard shelled fruit that comes from a plant whose fruit does not open to release its seed . a nut is a composite of the fruit and seed , some examples of true nuts are : acorns , beechnuts , chestnuts and hazelnuts . so despite the name , the plant is not a nut in the biological sense , but a legume . peanuts grow by starting out as an above ground flower that , due to its heavy weight , bends towards the ground . the flower eventually burrows underground , which is where the peanut actually matures .
