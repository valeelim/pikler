Inca road system     the inca road system ( `` el camino inca '' ) of peru was the most extensive among the many roads and trails that were constructed in pre-columbian south america . it went across the andes mountains and reached heights of over 5,000 m ( 16,500 feet ) above sea level . the inca road system covered approximately 22,500 kilometres ( 14,000 mi ) and provided access to over three million kmÂ² of territory . because the incas did not make use of the wheel for transportation , and did not have horses until the arrival of the spanish in peru in the 16th century , the trails were used almost exclusively by people walking , sometimes accompanied by pack animals , usually the llama . the trails were used by the inca people as a means of relaying messages , carried via knotted-cord quipu and by memory ; and for transporting goods . messages could be carried by runners covering as much as 240 km ( 150 mi ) per day , working in relay fashion much like the pony express of the 1860s in north america . there were approximately 2,000 inns , or `` tambos '' , placed at even intervals along the trails . the inns provided food , shelter and military supplies to the tens of thousands who traveled the roads .
