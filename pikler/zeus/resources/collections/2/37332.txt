Polonaise     the polonaise is a polish dance . it started as a folk dance and then became popular among the polish nobility . it is in 3/4 time . it follows a distinctive rhythm as illustrated above . many polonaises are composed in what is called ternary form , or song form , or minuet and trio . these forms all follow an a-b-a pattern . the music of the a sections is similar in both sections , if not exactly identical . the b section is entirely different . it provides contrast in some way to the a sections . in the courts of the aristocracy musicians would often play a polonaise from the gallery while the people danced below in the reception hall . polish culture was very popular in europe in the 1830s and so the polonaise became known in other countries . composers started to write polonaises for the piano . pieces called `` polonaise '' had already been composed by bach , handel , françois couperin and others , but it was frédéric chopin who in the 19th century wrote several polonaises for piano which became famous . most of them are very difficult to play , especially the famous polonaise in a flat , op . 53 .
