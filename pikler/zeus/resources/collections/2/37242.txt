Existence     existence usually means `` the state or fact of being '' , but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence , and what it means to exist . in english , existence is usually connected with the verb `` to be '' . 1. i am a human . 1. this is a pen . 1. the sky is blue . 1. four plus three is seven . the first sentence can be understood to say `` i `` exist '' as a human '' , and simply speaking , this is probably true . the fourth sentence is more difficult to understand , because it can be understood to say `` seven `` exists '' as the sum of four and three '' , but `` seven '' is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human . the question `` what is existence ? '' is a very important one for philosophers , and many people think aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question . other websites . - `` a treatise on book titles '' is an old book written by muhammad al-amidi . it talks about existence and is written in arabic .
