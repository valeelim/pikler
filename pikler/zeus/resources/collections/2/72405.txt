Brazilwood     brazilwood or pau-brasil , sometimes known as pernambuco ( `` caesalpina echinata '' ) is a brazilian tree . it has a dense , orange-red wood ( which takes a high shine ) , and it is the most frequently used wood for making bows for string instruments from the violin family . the wood also gives a red dye called brazilin . there are actually several trees in this family which have very similar properties , including the development of red dye . so the term `` brazilwood '' is sometimes used for these other species as well . the tree was exploited for their dye in the 18th century , and is now lost over much of its original range . when pedro Ã¡lvares cabral found brazil , he named it after the brazilwood that he found there .
