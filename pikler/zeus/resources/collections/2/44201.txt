Ore Mountains     the ore mountains ( german `` erzgebirge '' , czech `` krušné hory '' ) are a mountain range in germany and the czech republic . they form the border between both countries for 150 km , extending from the western border of saxony to the elbe river . they are named for their plentiful metal ores . the ore mountains are famous for many christmas traditions . as the ores silver and tin were not found any more in the mines , former miners had to look for new ways to feed their families . in addition to lace making and weaving , the inhabitants went into wood carving . nutcrackers , `` smoking men '' , `` pyramids '' ( carousels with figures of the christmas story or from mining ) and `` schwibbogen '' ( wooden arcs with candles in the windows , symbolising the opening of a mine ) are some of many christmas goods made in the ore mountains . `` seiffen '' in the east ore mountains was a centre of the wooden toy industry .
