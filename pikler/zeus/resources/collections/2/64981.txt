Golden Raspberry Awards     the golden raspberry awards or razzies , first awarded in 1981 , were made by john j. b. wilson in 1980 , with the goal of being the opposite of the academy awards by dishonoring the worst movies . it is usually a plastic raspberry spray-painted gold and mounted on a plastic base , however bill cosby accepted a custom-made one made out of 24 carat ( 99.99 % ) gold and italian marble . today , awards are voted by the membership of the `` golden raspberry award foundation '' ( graf ) , and anyone can become a member of the foundation , something that does not happen with the academy awards . usually , nominations are made public one day before the motion picture academy says its oscar nominations , and the awards are presented one day before the oscar ceremony . the term `` raspberry '' is used as a joke , as in `` blowing a raspberry .
