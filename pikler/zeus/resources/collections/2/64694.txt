Jihad     jihad is an arabic word meaning `` to struggle '' . muslims ( believers in islam ) use this word to talk about defending the faith and protecting their family and nation , as well as defending innocent people . it can also mean fighting with yourself to become a better person . it is an official part of shi'a islam , but it is not an official part of sunni islam , though some call it the sixth pillar of islam . in some cases , there have been 'jihads ' that have self immolated themselves , in order to get into heaven . there are suicide bombers , who blow themselves up , because they think that it is right and that they are cleaning the world 's filth . this is , however , wrong in islam . it is a major sin to commit suicide or homicide . killing another human being in islam is the equivalent of killing all of humanity . on the contrary , saving another human being 's life is the equivalent of saving all of humanity .
