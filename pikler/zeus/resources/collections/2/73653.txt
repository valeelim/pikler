Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State     the executive council was the cabinet of the irish free state , it was headed by the `` president of the executive council '' . constitution of the irish free state said that the vice president would act for the president of the executive council while he was absent , or until a new president was elected because the executive council only had five , six or seven members , the vice president was also a minister in charge of a department . neither the ministry of the irish republic nor the provisional government had a deputy head of government , so the office of vice-president of the executive council was a new idea of the free state . in 1937 when the constitution of the irish free state was replaced by bunreacht na héireann the vice president was replaced by the tánaiste .
