Solar power in Spain     spain is the fourth largest manufacturer in the world of solar power technology and exports 80 percent of this output to germany . spain is one of the most attractive countries with regard to the development of solar energy , as it has the greatest amount of available sunshine of any country in europe . the spanish government wants to produce 12 percent of primary energy from renewable energy by 2010. that would mean a solar generating capacity of 400 megawatts . through a ministerial ruling in march 2004 , the spanish government removed economic barriers to grid-connection of renewable energy . the widely applauded royal decree 436/2004 equalises conditions for large-scale thermal and photovoltaic plants and guarantees feed-in tariffs . in march 2007 , europe 's first commercial concentrating solar power tower plant was opened near the sunny southern spanish city of seville . the 11 megawatt plant , known as the ps10 solar power tower , produces electricity with 624 large heliostats . each of these mirrors has a surface measuring 120 square meters ( 1,290 square feet ) that concentrates the sun 's rays to the top of a 115 meter ( 377 foot ) high tower where a solar receiver and a steam turbine are located . the turbine drives a generator , producing electricity . ps10 is the first of a set of solar electric power generation plants to be constructed in the same area that will total more than 300mw by 2013. this power generation will be accomplished using a variety of technologies .
