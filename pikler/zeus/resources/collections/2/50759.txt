Matter     matter is the substance of which all material is made . that means objects which have mass . more specifically , they must have `` rest '' mass , which is a form of energy that matter has even when it is not moving ( it has no kinetic energy ) , is extremely cold ( it has no thermal energy ) , etc . `` matter '' is a word that is sometimes used in varying ways in everyday life , whereas `` mass '' is a well-defined concept and quantity at least in physics . they are not the same thing , though they are related . `` ordinary '' matter is made of tiny particles called atoms . the atoms have spaces between them and they move or vibrate all the time . the particles move faster and move further apart when heated , and the reverse when cooled . nearly all matter that may be experienced in everyday life is baryonic matter . this includes atoms of any sort , and gives those the property of mass . non-baryonic matter , as implied by the name , is any sort of matter that is not composed mainly of baryons . this might include neutrinos and free electrons , dark matter , such as supersymmetric particles , axions , and black holes .
