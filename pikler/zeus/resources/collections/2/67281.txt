Ethmoid bone     the ethmoid bone ( from greek `` ethmos '' , `` sieve '' ) is a bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain . as such , it is located at the roof of the nose , between the two orbits . the cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction . the ethmoid bone consists of four parts : - the horizontal cribriform plate ( `` lamina cribrosa '' ) , part of the cranial base - the vertical perpendicular plate ( `` lamina perpendicularis '' ) , which is part of the nasal septum - the two lateral masses or labyrinths . blows to the head can shear off the olfactory nerves that pass though the ethmoid bone and cause anosmia , an irreversible loss of the sense of smell and a great reduction in the sense of taste ( most of which depends on smell ) . this not only deprives life of some of its pleasures , but can also be dangerous , as when a person fails to smell smoke , gas , or spoiled food . other pages . - bone terminology other websites . - http : //www.theregister.com/2006/11/17/the_odd_body_nose_compass/
