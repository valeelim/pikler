Uncle Ben     in marvel comics , benjamin `` ben '' parker , usually called uncle ben was spider-man ’ s uncle . he was made by writer stan lee and artist steve ditko . in the comics , uncle ben with his wife may parker had adopted peter parker before peter became spider-man . he was first made in `` amazing fantasy '' # 15 ( august 1962 ) when he was killed by a burglar that spider-man could have stopped . this caused spider-man to fight crime as a superhero ever since . even though he wasn ’ t alive in spider-man ’ s story for long , uncle ben ’ s death has made him a very important character in the spider-man comics . he has often appeared in spider-man ’ s memories and visions . ben may have in fact first had a role in a story called , “ goodbye to linda brown , ” also written and drawn by stan lee and steve ditko . this story was in a comic called 'strange tales '' # 97 , which was released two months earlier than the first spider-man story . in it , uncle ben and peter parker ’ s aunt may are shown as they are in the spider-man tales . their first names are the same but their last names are never told . the story is about linda brown , may and ben ’ s niece and adopted daughter who has to ride in a wheelchair . at the end of the story linda turns out to be a mermaid ( her fins were always covered by a blanket ) and swims away to the ocean . this tale has not been kept in the spider-man ’ s main story line . linda ’ s last name , brown , shows that she most likely would have to be the daughter of a brother or sister other than peter parker 's parents . the story was later printed again in the comic , `` marvel tales '' # 83 in 1977. an editor opened it saying , `` the resemblance is startling ! are these people the parkers ? only stan and steve know -- and they 're not talking !
