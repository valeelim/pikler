Chin     the chin is the bottom part of the face . it is under the mouth and is the forward part of the jaw . the chin is unique to present-day humans , our species . it is not present in the anthropoid apes , nor in any other hominin . even neanderthals did not have a human-type chin . in medical anatomy , the chin is called the `` mental eminence '' . its absence in `` homo floresiensis '' is grounds for thinking that small hominin was not of our species . it is thought that our chin may have become shaped like this to improve the muscle attachments of the lips and tongue . chins can be larger or smaller , depending on the person . even though chin sizes vary a lot , it is usually further forward than the rest of the face in normal humans .
