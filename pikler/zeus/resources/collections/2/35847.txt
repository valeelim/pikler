Guide dog     guide dogs are dogs trained to help blind people live on their own . they are sometimes called `` seeing eye '' dogs . guide dogs are one type of assistance animals , which are animals trained to help people with a disability to lead more complete lives . the blind person ( sometimes called a `` handler '' ) and the dog need to work together . both the dog and the handler must take special training to learn how to work as a team . the handler needs to let the guide dog know the direction they want to go . the dog can lead the person around things that may be dangerous , such as moving cars or other things . also , guide dogs may be taught to press buttons to work elevators or get things for their handler . because dogs can not see colors as well as people , they can not read traffic signals , so the handler must use ways to tell if it is safe to cross a street . because the guide dog and handler will be in public , it is important that the dog stays calm in busy or loud areas . in many countries , guide dogs are allowed inside places where animals normally are not allowed , such as restaurants , stores , buses and trains .
