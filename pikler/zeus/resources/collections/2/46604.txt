Rosaceae     rosaceae ( rose-like plants ) is a large family of plants . there are about 100-120 genera with between 3,000 and 4,000 species in them . well-known plants from the family include : - roses - strawberries - raspberries - apples , and pears - peaches , cherries , and apricots plants in rosaceae usually have flowers with five petals . however , some decorative roses have many more . species of dryas usually have eight petals . the rosaceae family has been divided into subfamilies ; usually the following four subfamilies are used : - rosoideae - spiraeoideae - maloideae - amygdaloideae ( incorrectly called prunoideae ) . however , it has become clear that the last three of these subfamilies can not be divided in a clear way . also , there is a small group that is so different from other rosaceae , that it is now given its own name . botanists now use only three subfamilies in rosaceae : - rosoideae - amygdaloideae - dryadoideae
