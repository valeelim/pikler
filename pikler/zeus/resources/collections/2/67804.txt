Knot (speed)    knot ( speed ) `` “ knots ” redirects here . for other uses , see knot ( disambiguation ) . '' a knot is a unit of speed . it is abbreviated kt or kn . it is a non-si unit accepted for use with the si . it is used around the world in meteorology and for maritime and aviation purposes . 1 international knot = 1 nautical mile per hour = 1.852 kilometres per hour exactly . this is based on the internationally agreed length of the nautical mile , as adopted by the us in 1954 ( which previously used the us nautical mile of 1853.248 m ) , the uk in 1970 ( which previously used the uk or admiralty nautical mile of 1853.184 m ) and other countries . this is the definition used in most , if not all , modern circumstances . knot is sometimes used for the nautical mile itself , but this is incorrect . the speed of a vessel relative to the fluid in which it travels is usually measured in knots . this may be referred to as 'boat speed ' , 'vessel speed ' and , for aircraft , 'air speed ' . the speeds of relevant fluids , such as tidal streams , river currents and wind speeds , are also usually specified in knots . knots are then also used to describe the actual speed of a vessel over the ground ( sog ) and for its rate of progress toward a distant point ( 'velocity made good ' or vmg ) .
