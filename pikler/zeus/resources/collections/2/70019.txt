Atomic force microscope     atomic force microscopes ( afms ) are a type of microscope . afms provide pictures of atoms on or in surfaces . like the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , the purpose of the afm is to look at objects on the atomic level . in fact , the afm may be used to look at individual atoms . it is commonly used in nanotechnology . the afm can do some things that the sem can not do . the afm can sometimes provide higher resolution than the sem . further , the afm does not need to operate in a vacuum . in fact , the afm can operate in ambient air or water , so it can be used to see surfaces of biological samples like living cells . the afm works by employing an ultra-fine needle attached to a cantilever beam . the tip of the needle runs over the ridges and valleys in the material being imaged , `` feeling '' the surface . as the tip moves up and down due to the surface , the cantilever deflects . in one basic configuration , a laser shines on the cantilever at an oblique angle , and allows for the direct measurement of the deflection in the cantilever by simply changing the angle of incidence for the laser beam . in this way , an image may be created revealing the configuration of the molecules being imaged by the machine .
