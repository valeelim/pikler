Moment (physics)    moment ( physics ) in physics , moment of force ( often just moment ) is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis . in this concept the moment arm , the distance from the axis of rotation , plays an important role . the lever , pulley , gear , and most other simple machines create mechanical advantage by changing the moment arm . the si unit for moment is the newton meter ( nm ) . formula for moment : moment= force multiply by perpendicular distance the principle of moment states that when a system is in equilibrium the sum of its clockwise moments equals the sum of its anticlockwise moments . some examples where moments ( turning effect ) are applied are in the use of levers . these examples are : seesaw , opening and closing of doors , nutcracker , can opener , crowbar , etc . a lever is a simple machine in which one force called the effort is used to overcome another force called the load . in physics , moment is a combination of a physical quantity and a distance . the principle of moments is derived from archimedes ' discovery of the operating principle of the lever . in the lever one applies a force , in his day most often human muscle , to an `` arm '' , a beam of some sort . archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object , the `` moment of force '' , is defined as `` m = rf '' , where `` f '' is the applied force , and `` r '' is the distance from the applied force to object .
