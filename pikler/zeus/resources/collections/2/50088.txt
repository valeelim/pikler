Euler's totient function    euler 's totient function in number theory , the totient of a positive integer is the number of integers smaller than `` n '' which are coprime to `` n '' ( they share no factors except 1 ) . for example , formula_1 , because the four numbers : 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 do n't share any factors with 8. the function formula_2 used here is the totient function , usually called the euler totient or euler 's totient , after the swiss mathematician leonhard euler , who studied it . the totient function is also called euler 's phi function or simply the phi function , since the greek letter phi ( formula_2 ) is so commonly used for it . the cototient of `` n '' is defined as formula_4 . the totient function is important mainly because it gives the size of the multiplicative group of integers modulo `` n '' . more precisely , formula_5 is the order of the group of units of the ring formula_6 . this fact , together with lagrange 's theorem , provides a proof for euler 's theorem . a common use of the totient function is in the rsa algorithm . the rsa algorithm is a popular method of encryption used worldwide .
