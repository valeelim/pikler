Twin Prime Conjecture     the twin prime conjecture is a mathematical theory . it says that it is possible to find two twin primes that are as big as wanted . twin primes are prime numbers that differ by two . for example 3 and 5 are both prime and differ by two . they are twin primes . 23 is prime , but it is not a twin prime . the primes nearest to 23 are 19 and 29. twin primes were discovered by euclid in 300 b.c . since euclid 's time mathematicians have wondered whether there are an infinite number of twin primes . many mathematicians are still trying to find the answer .
