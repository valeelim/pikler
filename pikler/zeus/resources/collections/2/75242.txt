William Walton     sir william walton om , ( born oldham , 29 march 1902 ; died ischia , italy , 8 march 1983 ) was a british composer and conductor . he was one of the most important british composers of the mid-20th century , a period that included benjamin britten and michael tippett . his music has very lively rhythms which are often jazzy . walton â€™ s family were musical but they had very little money . both his parents sang , and walton sang in the local church choir . his father would hit him if he made a mistake . this may be why in later life he was so careful about every note he wrote . at the age of ten he joined the choir of christ church cathedral in oxford . he learned the piano and violin . he was only 16 years when he went to university of oxford where he was at christ church , oxford . most of what he knew about composing he taught himself . he studied the scores of works by stravinsky , debussy , sibelius and others . he had some lessons from hugh allen , the cathedral organist . at oxford walton became friends with two poets : sacheverell sitwell and siegfried sassoon . most of the music he wrote when he was very young has been lost , but the choral anthem `` a litany '' , written when he was just fifteen , shows his musical talent with its modern harmonies .
