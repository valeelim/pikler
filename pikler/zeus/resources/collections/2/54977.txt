Vassal     a vassal during the feudalism of medieval europe , was someone who had shared duties with a lord . usually the vassal provided soldiers to the lord . the lord used his army of soldiers from all of his vassals to protect those vassals . the lord also gave him the piece of land that he held as a fief . by analogy the term `` vassal '' is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies . the development of the `` vassal '' , in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of `` lordship '' – in french the `` seigneur '' – is one sign that antiquity ended and the early middle ages began . lordship is the basic social institution as tacitus described them in his book `` germania '' . the roman west experienced them for the first time in the migration period . as the system developed in the seventh century , the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves , in some degree of formality , to the authority of a leader , from whom they could expect to be fed , clothed and armed . the quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty . the etymology ( where the word came from ) of `` vassal '' is from a celtic word `` gwas '' `` boy '' that meant a young male slave , with a latinised form , `` vassus '' that appeared in salic law ( rouche 1987 p 429 ) , like the way `` knight '' came from the from old english word `` cniht '' and similar words in frisian and dutch , all meaning `` lad '' .
