Roller derby     roller derby is a sport played on roller skates . it used to be played by both men and women , but it was restarted by women . there are now a growing number of men 's and mixed ( or co-ed ) teams around the world who are playing roller derby . for a long time , many people did not believe roller derby was a real sport . they thought it was like professional wrestling , because it had fake fighting and other things for tv . but in 2002 , a group of women in austin , texas started playing it as a real game , with nothing fake . a tv show called `` rollergirls '' was made about some of these women . by 2006 , women in every big city in the usa and canada were starting their own roller derby clubs . there were even clubs starting up in europe , australia , and new zealand . two teams of roller derby players skate around an oval track . the track can be flat or banked ( raised up around the outer edges ) . there are 5 players on each team : - 1 `` jammer '' , who races around the track faster than the rest of the team
