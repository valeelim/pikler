Rehearsal     a rehearsal is a practice before a concert or play in a theatre or some other performance . the group of will get together to rehearse . they may rehearse together many times before the performance so that they get used to performing with one another . a dress rehearsal is the last rehearsal before the performance . it is called a 'dress rehearsal ' because in a theatre the actors will be wearing their costumes . when an orchestra or other music group have a 'dress rehearsal ' this does not mean that they have to dress up . it simply means that it is the last rehearsal , and it will be in the hall where they are going to perform so that everything is as it will be for the performance . orchestras often have section rehearsals or sectionals . this means that each group of instruments rehearse separately , e.g . the string sectional will be all the string instruments rehearsing together . this can be useful because they can concentrate on the bits which are particularly difficult for them : the string instruments can talk about the bowing etc .
