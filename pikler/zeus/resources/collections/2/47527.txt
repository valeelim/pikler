Checksum     a checksum is a number . it is a kind of redundancy check . there are different ways to calculate it . it serves as a check , that no errors have been made when writing down the number . in its simplest form , the digits are simply added up . this can however not detect errors of swapping digits around . better ways ( algorithms ) of calculating a checksum are to use a hamming code , a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic . one of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly . portuguese bank account identifiers are a good example of how checksums work . they have 21 digits . the first 19 digits identify the bank , branch and account number . the last two digits are `` mod 97 '' checksum digits based on modular arithmetic . a typical portuguese bank account number is 0002.0123.12345678901.54. the digits have the following meanings : if 000201231234567890154 ( the bank account number without the dots ) is divided by 97 , the answer is 207458809978249 remainder 1. since the remainder is `` 1 '' , the bank account identifier is probably correct . if the person writing down the number missed a digit , swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been `` 1 '' . if this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error message .
