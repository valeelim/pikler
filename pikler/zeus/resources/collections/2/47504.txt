Vibrator (sensual)    vibrator ( sensual ) a vibrator is a device that is made to vibrate against the body , thereby stimulating the nerves and giving a pleasurable and possibly erotic feeling . the electrically powered vibrator was invented in the 1880s by doctors , who were treating women for `` hysteria '' for centuries by performing what today would be considered masturbation . at the time , however , not only did doctors regard the `` vulvular stimulation '' required as having nothing to do with sex , they reportedly found that it took a lot of time to do and it was hard work . the vibrator did it more quickly and easily , and because of this it was very popular with doctors . home versions soon started being made and they were also popular , with adverts in places like `` needlecraft '' , `` woman 's home companion '' , `` modern priscilla '' and the sears catalog . these disappeared in the 1920s , apparently because their appearance in pornography made it no longer tenable for polite society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices .
