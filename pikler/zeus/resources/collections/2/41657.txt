Orphan     an orphan is a child that has no parents . their parents are either dead or did n't want them . orphans end up in a house called an orphanage . this is where children with no parents live . many children that live in an orphanage get fostered or adopted by a person or a couple . sometimes parents get sick and die while their child or children are still young , and if no close relatives take care of them , if they can not or will not do so , they are normally raised in an orphanage . when several children , brothers or sisters are left orphaned they are normally split up ; one child going to one family or one child going to a foster family while another may stay in the orphanage . sometimes parents may not have jobs or money and abandon their children because they can not afford to bring them up . the parents may feel that if someone else brings them up they may have a better future in the long run . in many poor countries orphans are often seen wondering about begging for money and food ; many may not be going to school . not much organised help exists for them in poor countries .
