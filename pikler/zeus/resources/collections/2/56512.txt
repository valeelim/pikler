Immunization     immunization is a way of preventing a person from getting a disease . this is done by making the person 's body come into contact with a bit of the disease so that the body learns how to fight it . the body 's ability to fight off a disease is called its immune system . the material is known as an immunogen . immunization is the same as inoculation and vaccination because inoculation and vaccination use an infecting agent ( something that infects ) in the same way that immunization does . when the human immune system is exposed to an infection once , it can learn how to cope quickly if it is exposed to it again . by exposing an individual to an immunogen in a controlled way , the body will be able to protect itself from that infection later on in life .
