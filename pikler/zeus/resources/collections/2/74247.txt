Newport Pagnell     newport pagnell is a town in england . it is in the borough of milton keynes . the town was first mentioned in the domesday book of 1086 as `` neuport '' , which is an old english word meaning `` new market town '' . at that time it was fairly new , having been founded by norman invaders . the suffix `` pagnell '' came later , when the manor passed into the hands of the pagnell ( paynel ) family . at one time newport pagnell was one of the largest towns in the county of buckinghamshire but today the new town of milton keynes has made it much less important . tickford bridge , over the river ouze , was built in 1810. it is the only iron bridge in britain that still carries main road traffic . this is the oldest iron bridge in the world that is still in constant use . there is a plaque near the footbridge on the side that gives details of its history and construction . a large set of sluice gates used to control downstream flooding of the river great ouse is near the bridge . since 1954 , tickford street in newport pagnell has been the home of the aston martin site , where all aston martin cars were built , until the recent opening of the new ford motor company luxury division plant for aston martin built at gaydon , warwickshire .
