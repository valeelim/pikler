Race (biology)    race ( biology ) in biology , races are distinct populations within the same species with relatively small morphological and genetic differences . the populations are `` ecological races '' if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or `` geographic races '' when they are geographically isolated . if sufficiently different , two or more races can be identified as subspecies , which is an official biological taxonomy unit below 'species ' . if not , they are called `` races '' , which means that a formal rank should not be given to the group , or taxonomists are unsure whether or not a formal rank should be given . according to ernst mayr , `` a subspecies is a `` geographic race '' that is sufficiently different taxonomically to be worthy of a separate name '' the key lime is a shrub that grows to a size of about 5 metres in height . it has many thorns . it produces a fruit that is yellow when it is ripe . this fruit is preferred by bartenders to mix cocktails . they prefer this lime , rather than the persian lime .
