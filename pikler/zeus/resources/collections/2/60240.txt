Christian denomination     the word denomination is used for a large group of christian people right across the world who use the same name , the same sort of organisation and have the same ( or very similar ) beliefs . christianity is divided into five main groups . these groups all branched out at different dates from the early christianity founded by the followers of jesus . the splits generally happened because they could not agree on cetain beliefs or practices . the groups then divided into smaller groups . each group that has its own separate name is a `` denomination '' . the word `` denomination '' means `` having a name '' . worldwide christianity is divided into five major groups of churches : - roman catholic - eastern orthodox - oriental orthodox - anglican - protestant . each of these five has important subdivisions . there are also other ( smaller ) groups that are not mentioned here . the protestant branch of christianity is much more divided up than any of the others . all the many divisions of protestantism are not shown on the diagram . each separate protestant church is called a `` denomination '' . while the roman catholic church looks to a single earthly leader , the pope , and has similar beliefs right across the world , the protestant denominations do not look to a single leader and sometimes have beliefs that are very different from each other .
