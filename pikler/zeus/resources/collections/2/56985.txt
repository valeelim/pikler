Incisor     incisors are special kinds of teeth that can be found in some mammals , such as humans . they are the eight large flat teeth with straight edges that are at the front of a person 's mouth , in between the canine teeth , which are pointed . the straight edges of the `` incisors '' are useful for biting because they cut sharply . they come together like a pair of pincers . in a human , the two teeth at the middle of each jaw are called the `` central incisors '' , and the side ones are the `` lateral icisors '' . ( lateral means `` to the side '' ) . some humans never grow `` lateral incisors '' or have very small ones , particularly at the top . in many herbivores ( plant-eating animals ) these front teeth are used to cut off stems of grass and other growing things , that are then ground up by the molars at the back of the mouth . some omnivores ( animals that eat both plants and meat ) , like humans , have incisors like herbivores . in carnivores ( meat-eating animals ) like cats , the incisors are often quite small and the canine teeth are very long and suitable for tearing meat . carnivores use their incisors for many jobs that need fine control , such as catching fleas , carrying a kitten or peeling the skin off a fish . if a dog or a member of the cat family needs to cut something with their teeth , they use their back teeth like scissors .
