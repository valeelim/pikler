Red dwarf     a red dwarf is a kind of star . red dwarf stars are smaller than half the size of the sun . they are also cooler than most stars . red dwarfs burn their fuel slowly , so they shine with less light than hot stars . red dwarf stars are the most common in our galaxy , at least near our sun . the closest star to the earth is named proxima centauri . the latin word `` proxima '' means `` nearest to '' . proxima centauri is a red dwarf . red dwarfs can live trillions of years , much longer than brighter stars . a red dwarf dies when it burns all of its fuel . to start with , the fuel is the chemical element hydrogen . at present , no red dwarf star is known which has gone beyond this stage . red dwarfs are small stars that are around 0.2 solar mass ( the sun is equal to 1 solar mass ) . this is small for a star but is still 60,000 times the mass of the earth . they are formed in nebulas , like all stars are , and originally they are protostars . they start their nuclear fusion about 10,0000 years after being created when they get their red glow , this is also where they get their heat . these stars burn at less than 4,000Â°k .
