Vande Mataram     vande mataram is the national song of india . it is not to be confused with the national anthem of india . the lyrics were written by bankim chandra chattopadhyay , in a mix of sanskrit and bengali . the song was written in 1876 , but published in 1882. the title means `` long live the mother [ land ] '' . the first version of the flag of india had `` वन्दे मातरम् '' ( vande mataram ) written on it . jana gana mana was chosen over `` vande mataram '' as the national anthem of independent india in january 24 , 1950 , although before this date , `` vande mataram '' was treated as such . vande mataram was rejected because it offended muslims by calling india `` mother durga '' ( a hindu goddess ) , equating the nation with hinduism , and by its origin as part of `` anandamatha '' , a book they felt had an anti-muslim message . mother , i salute thee ! rich with thy hurrying streams , bright with orchard gleams , cool with thy winds of delight , green fields waving mother of might , mother free . glory of moonlight dreams ,
