Twin     twins are two animal ( including human ) offspring that are born from the same pregnancy . `` human twins '' are two people that shared the uterus during a single pregnancy , and one is normally born quickly after the first . because of the size of the uterus , multiple pregnancies are less likely to last the full 38 weeks than most single birth pregnancies . on average , they last 35 weeks . this also means about 50 % of twins are born prematurely . there are 2 types of twins . they are : fraternal twins are also known as `` non-identical twins '' or `` dizygotic twins '' . they happen when two ova are released from the ovary at the same time , and each is fertilized by a different sperm . this results in the birth of fraternal twins . they can be of different sexes . genetically , they are no more similar than any two siblings . identical twins or `` monozygotic twins '' : a single ovum is fertilized to form one zygote . this zygote later splits , and each half of the zygote becomes a twin . the twins have the same genes .
