Hardanger fiddle     a hardanger fiddle or hardingfele in norwegian , is a traditional string instrument used mainly in the south west of norway . it is similar to the violin , but it has eight or nine strings and the wood is thinner . four of the strings are strung and played like a violin , while the other strings are sympathetic strings ( they vibrate when the others are played ) . the hardingfele is used for dancing . the player stamps his foot loudly while playing . it was the norwegian tradition for a bridal procession to be led to the church by a hardanger fiddler . the instrument has a lot of decoration , with a carved animal ( usually the lion of norway ) or a carved woman 's head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox , mother of pearl in the tailpiece and fingerboard , and black ink decorations called 'rosing ' on the body of the instrument . sometimes pieces of bone are used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument . the earliest known instrument is dated 1651 although we do not know whether this date is correct . by 1850 it had developed into the hardanger fiddle known today .
