Volt     the volt ( symbol : v ) is the si derived unit of electric potential difference or electromotive force . it is named in honor of the italian physicist alessandro volta ( 1745–1827 ) , who invented the voltaic pile , the first chemical battery . the volt is defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power . hence , it is the base si representation m · kg · s · a , which can be equally represented as one joule of energy per coulomb of charge , j/c . in the `` hydraulic analogy '' sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them to water-filled pipes , voltage is likened to water pressure - it determines how fast the electrons will travel through the circuit . current ( in amperes ) , in the same analogy , is a measure of the volume of water that flows past a given point , the rate of which is determined by the voltage , and the total output measured in watts . the equation that brings all three components together is : volts × amperes = watts
