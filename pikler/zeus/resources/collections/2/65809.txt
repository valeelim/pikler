Megalosaurus     megalosaurus was a large meat-eating theropod dinosaur of the middle jurassic of europe . it was found in 1824 , and was the earliest dinosaur named . in 1827 , gideon mantell included `` megalosaurus '' in his geological survey of southeastern england . he gave the species its name , `` megalosaurus bucklandii '' . because a complete skeleton of it has never been found , much is still unclear about its build . the first naturalists who investigated megalosaurus thought it was a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length . in 1842 richard owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres , standing on upright legs as a quadruped . later it was realised that all theropods were bipedal . today is known that the early proto-dinosaurs in the late middle triassic were also bipedal . certainly `` eoraptor '' , from 231.4 million years ago , was bipedal . that means the dinosaurs were bipedal from the start , and only the heavier sauropods and armoured dinosaurs reverted to standing on all four legs .
