Semiconductor     a semiconductor is a material that in some cases will conduct electricity but not in others . good electrical conductors , like copper or silver , easily allow electricity to flow through them . materials that block the flow of electricity , like rubber or plastic , are called insulators . insulators are often used to protect people from electric shock . as the name implies , a semiconductor does not conduct as well as a conductor . semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics . by the addition of different atoms into the crystal lattice ( grid ) of the semiconductor it changes its conductivity by making n-type and p-type semiconductors . silicon is the most important commercial semiconductor , though many others are used . they can be made into transistors , which are small amplifiers . transistors are used in computers , mobile phones , digital audio players and many other electronic devices . like other solids , the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands ( i.e . ranges of energy levels ) between the energy of the ground state , corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material , and the free electron energy , which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material .
