Kayak     a kayak is a small boat that is driven by manpower . it typically has a covered deck , and a cockpit covered by a spraydeck . it is propelled by a double-bladed paddle by a sitting paddler . the kayak was used by the native ainu , inuit , aleut and eskimo hunters in sub-arctic regions of northeastern asia , north america and greenland . modern kayaks come in a wide variety of designs and materials for specialized purposes . kayaks typically are built for one , two or occasionally three paddlers who sit facing forward in one or more cockpits below the deck of the boat . the spray skirt or similar waterproof garment attaches securely to the edges of the cockpit , so that no water from waves or spray may enter the boat . therefore , in most styles the boat can roll upright again without it filling with water or ejecting the paddler . kayaks differ distinctly in design and history from canoes , which are craft propelled by single-bladed paddles by a kneeling paddler , although some modern canoes may be difficult for a non-expert to distinguish from a kayak . kayaks are often called canoes in great britain and ireland .
