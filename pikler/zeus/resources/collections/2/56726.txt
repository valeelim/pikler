Water heating     water heating is a thermodynamic process using an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature . typical domestic uses of hot water are for cooking , cleaning and bathing , and space heating . in industry both hot water and water heated to steam have many uses . the most common energy sources for heating water are fossil fuels : natural gas , liquefied petroleum gas , oil or sometimes solid fuels ( coal or firewood . these fuels may be consumed directly or by the use of electricity ( which may derive from any of the above fuels or from nuclear or renewable sources ) . alternative energy such as solar energy , heat pumps , hot water heat recycling , and sometimes geothermal power , may also be used as available , usually in combination with gas , oil or electricity . solar collectors for solar powered water heaters are installed outside dwellings , typically on the roof or nearby . nearly all models are the direct-gain type . they consist of flat panels in which water circulates . in countries like iceland and new zealand , and other volcanic regions , water heating may be done using geothermal power , rather than combustion .
