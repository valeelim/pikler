Transposon     a transposon is a sequence of dna that can move to new positions within the genome of a single cell . the press called them jumping genes , but it is not correct to call them 'genes ' . transposons were first found by barbara mcclintock while working on maize . she received a nobel prize for her work in 1983. transposition can create significant mutations and alter the cell 's genome size . transposons are only one of several types of mobile genetic elements . transposons themselves are of two types according to their mechanism , which can be either `` copy and paste '' ( class i ) or `` cut and paste '' ( class ii ) . class i ( retrotransposons ) : they copy themselves in two stages , first from dna to rna by transcription , then from rna back to dna by reverse transcription . the dna copy is then inserted into the genome in a new position . retrotransposons behave very similarly to retroviruses , such as hiv . class ii ( dna transposons ) : by contrast , the cut-and-paste transposition mechanisms of class ii transposons do not involve an rna intermediate .
