Renewable energy     renewable energy comes from renewable resources . it is different from fossil fuels as it does not produce as many greenhouse gases and other pollutants as fossil fuel combustion . there are a lot of traditional uses of wind power , hydropower , biofuel , and solar energy in developed and developing countries . but the mass production of electricity using renewable energy sources is now becoming more common . from the end of 2004 , worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10â€“60 % annually for many technologies . for wind power and many other renewable technologies , growth sped up in 2009 relative to the previous four years . more wind power was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology . however , grid-connected pv increased the fastest of all renewables technologies , with a 60 % annual average growth rate . projections vary , but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100 % of the world 's energy with wind , hydroelectric , and solar power by the year 2030. wind power capacity has expanded quickly to 336 gw in june 2014 , and wind energy production was about 4 % of total worldwide electricity usage , and growing fast . wind power is widely used in european countries , and more recently in the united states and asia . wind power accounts for approximately 19 % of electricity generation in denmark , 11 % in spain and portugal , and 9 % in the republic of ireland . these are some of the largest wind farms in the world , as of january 2010 :
