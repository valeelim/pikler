Fuel cell     a fuel cell converts the element hydrogen into electricity by mixing it with oxygen , which then creates water . it is like a battery that is constantly fed with fuel . it is an important part of the hydrogen economy . note , that , unlike oil , hydrogen is not found in nature and is not an energy source , but an energy carrier . it has to be produced first , and if this is done by burning fossil fuels , it does not help against climate change . but , the hydrogen fuel cell will help against climate change in future , because scientists are trying to find new ways to make hydrogen without using fossil fuels . water is a molecule that consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms . it takes energy to separate water into oxygen and hydrogens . and energy is released when they are put back together . a fuel cell does the latter . hydrogen ( the energy source ) and oxygen ( which can come from plain air ) are put into the fuel cell . each is put near a metal plate on two opposite sides of the fuel cell . in the middle of the fuel cell there is a screen that separates hydrogen from the oxygen . this screen will only let one type of hydrogen atoms pass through to the oxygen . these hydrogen atoms lack the electron , and they are called ions . the electrons were split off from the hydrogen fuel by the metal plate at the hydrogen side ( the metal plate acts as a catalyst ) . because the screen does n't let electrons pass through , they go through a separate wire , to the other metal plate on the oxygen side . the travel of electrons creates electric energy ( electricity ) . the wire is where electricity can be used . for example , the wire can be cut in half , and a light bulb can be connected in between the two halves .
