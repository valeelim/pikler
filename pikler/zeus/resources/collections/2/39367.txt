Recursion     recursion is a word from mathematics and computer science . it is used to define a thing , such as a function or a set . a recursive definition uses the thing it is defining as part of the definition . usually , a recursive function refers to itself in some cases ( or inputs ) , but not in every case . a function that referred to itself in every case would never terminate . when a function refers to itself , it often uses a smaller input than the input it was given . in this way , it can solve a problem by first solving a simpler version of the problem . an example of a recursive function formula_1 is : - if formula_2 then return formula_3 . - if formula_4 then return formula_5 . this function computes the factorial of a natural number . it works because formula_6 and formula_7 . the definition has two cases : a recursive case for formula_8 , and a case for formula_9 that is not recursive . the case that is not recursive is called a `` base case '' . recursion can be used to write computer programs . a program that uses recursion may be easier to write and understand than a program that does the same thing without recursion .
