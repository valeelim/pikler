Shikon no Tama     the shikon no tama ( english : the jewel of four souls ) is the fictional magic jewel in the anime and manga series inuyasha . it is called the jewel of four souls because it has four souls of 4 different names : aramitama ( courage ) , nigimitama ( friendship ) , kushimitama ( wisdom ) and sakimitama ( love ) . the souls can make a person very powerful . when midoriko was about to die fighting a demon , she joined her 4 soul inside her heart , with the soul of the demon to make it good and pure . by doing that , she killed herself and the demon . this created the shikon jewel . inside it , midoriko and the demon souls still fought each other . this battle is depends to the person who has the jewel . the jewel can become pure ( become good because midoriko is winning ) or impure ( become bad because the demon is winning ) . many creatures want the jewel because it can make them powerful like midoriko . they can do anything they want with it . if someone wants to become a full demon then they will become that , just like naraku wants to .
