Pelagic zone     the pelagic zone is the part of the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast or sea floor . the name comes from the greek πέλαγος ( `` pélagos '' ) , which might be roughly translated as `` sea '' but is more accurately translated as `` open sea . '' the pelagic ( or open-ocean ) zone is divided into a number of sub-zones : - epipelagic ( surface to 200m ) : the illuminated surface zone where there is enough light for photosynthesis . because of this , plankton , and the food chain which feeds on it , are concentrated in this zone . the top predators are fish such as tuna and many sharks . - mesopelagic ( from 200m to 1000m ) : the twilight zone . although some light penetrates this deep , it is insufficient for photosynthesis . the name comes from greek μέσον , `` middle '' . - bathyal zone ( from 1000m to 4000m ) : by this depth the ocean is almost entirely dark ( with only the occasional bioluminescent organism ) . there are no living plants , and most animals survive by consuming the snow of detritus falling from the zones above , or ( like the marine hatchetfish ) by preying upon others . giant squid live at this depth , and here they are hunted by deep-diving sperm whales . from greek βαθύς ( bathys ) , `` deep '' .
