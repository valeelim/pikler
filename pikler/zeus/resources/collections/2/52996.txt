Hull (watercraft)    hull ( watercraft ) a hull is the body of a ship or boat . it is a central concept in floating vessels as it provides the buoyancy that keeps the vessel from sinking . almost all watercraft , from small boats to the largest ships , have a general form that is necessary for stability and efficient propulsion , which includes : - horizontal cross-sections that have narrow , usually pointed , fronts ( at the bow ) , - smooth widening from the bow until roughly the middle of the length ( midships ) , and often narrowing smoothly but usually significantly to the extreme end ( the stern ) . - a keel may be fitted on a hull to increase the transverse stability ( if filled with a heavy weight ) , directional stability or to create lift as in a sail boat . - control devices such as a rudder , trim tabs or stabilizing fins may be fitted . archimedes , a greek doctor , inventor , and mathematician , made the science of `` hydrostatics '' , the study of liquids and pressure . the archimedes principle says that the force holding up an object that is inside a liquid in part or totally . so , a ship actually does sink , until it moves an amount of water that is the same weight of the weight of the ship . the weight must be over a wide area to work . this explains why ships and boats ( including submarines ) float . an object 's weight pulls down in the direction of gravity , but the water 's buoyant ( floating ) force pushes it up . because these forces counteract each other , the object seems to lose weight . nasa uses this principle to prepare their astronauts for the weightlessness of space , so they had the astronauts work on parts of the space ship inside water tanks 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) deep .
