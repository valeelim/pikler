Optical fiber     an optical fiber is a thin fiber of glass or plastic that can carry light from one end to the other . the study of optical fibers is called fiber optics , which is part of applied science and engineering . optical fibers are mainly used in telecommunications , but they are also used for lighting , sensors , toys , and special cameras for seeing inside small spaces . it is sometimes used in medicine to see inside people , like down their throat . guiding light by internal reflection , the principle that makes fiber optics possible , was first demonstrated by daniel colladon and jacques babinet in paris in the early 1840s . john tyndall included a demonstration of it in his public lectures in london , 12 years later . the principle was first used for internal medical examinations by heinrich lamm in the 1930s . modern optical fibers , where the glass fiber is coated with a transparent cladding to offer a more suitable refractive index , appeared later in the decade . charles k. kao and george a. hockham of the british company standard telephones and cables ( stc ) were the first to show that the loss of intensity in optical fibers could be reduced , making fibers a practical communication medium . they proposed that the defects in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities which could be removed . they pointed out the right material to use for such fibers : silica glass with high purity . this discovery earned kao the nobel prize in physics in 2009 .
