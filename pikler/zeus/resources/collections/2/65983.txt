Heat capacity     heat capacity is a measure of how much materials can store up heat as they change temperature . materials with high heat capacities require a lot of heat to be stored up before a small change in temperature can be measured . materials with low heat capacities require very little heat to be stored up before a large change in temperature can be measured . the heat capacity of one gram ( or some other unit of mass ) of a material is called the specific heat capacity of the material , so that the heat capacity of something is its mass times its specific heat capacity . specific heat capacities are often listed in tables , like this one :
