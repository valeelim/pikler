Sheet music     sheet music is a type of printed music . the music that musicians have in front of them when they play is printed music . the sheet or sheets of paper that contain ( s ) the written notation of what the musician are to play is called printed music . sheet music usually refers to a `` single sheet '' of music ; that is , one song or piece printed separately . printed music includes sheet music but also includes music published in collections . people often confuse sheet music with printed music . sheet music can be published as a separate copy for one piece or song , or it can be a collection of pieces in a larger book . if there is a piece of music for violin and piano , then the pianist will play from the piano part , which will have the piano music written , as usual , on two staves . above those two staves , printed slightly smaller , will be another stave with the violin part . the violinist will play from a separate part which will just have the violin music . this means that the pianist can always see what the violin should be playing , but not the violinist will not be able to see what the pianist is playing . the violinist may need to look at the piano part sometimes to see how the violin and piano part fit together . it would be difficult for the violinist to play from music with both parts because he would need to turn the pages too often . ( unless the violinist had a few measures of rest right before the page turn , the violinist would miss playing some of his/her part while turning the page . )
