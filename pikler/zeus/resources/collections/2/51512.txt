Argonauta     argonauta , the argonauts , is the only living genus in the argonautidae family . they are a group of pelagic octopods . they are also called paper nautiluses , because of the paper-thin eggcase that females make . this structure does not have the gas-filled chambers of nautilus shells , and is not a true cephalopod shell . it is an evolutionary innovation unique to the genus `` argonauta '' . argonauts are found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide : they live in open ocean . like most octopods , they have a rounded body , eight arms and no fins . however , unlike octopuses , argonauts live close to the sea surface rather than on the seabed . `` argonauta '' species have very large eyes and small distal webs . they have a mantle-funnel locking apparatus , which is a way to identify the genus . it consists of knob-like cartilages in the mantle and corresponding depressions in the funnel . unlike the closely related genera `` ocythoe '' and `` tremoctopus '' , `` argonauta '' species lack water pores . in argonauts , males and females are quite different in size and lifespan . females grow up to 10 cm and make shells up to 30 cm , while males rarely grow larger than 2 cm . the males only mate once in their short lifetime , but the females can get pregnant repeatedly . the females have been known since ancient times while the males were only described in the late 19th century . the males use a modified arm , the hectocotylus , to transfer sperm to the female . for fertilization , the arm is inserted into the female 's pallial cavity , then is detached from the male .
