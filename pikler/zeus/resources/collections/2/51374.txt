Monopolistic competition     monopolistic competition is a market form . like with perfect competition , there are many buyers and sellers . but the market is not perfect . this is because the products are not homogeneous , or because the buyers have explicit or implicit preferences . this market form is quite common . as an example , take a bakery . there are many bakeries in the town , but one of those bakeries can demand a slightly higher price for bread , because it is the only one in a certain part of the town . monopolistically competitive firms are able to gain a greater degree of market share and as a result , increase prices . if a particular bakery is known for selling the best pies and pasties in town , they can increase their prices for pies and pasties as they know consumers will pay slightly more for a superior product . this is known as establishing a brand name and brand loyalty . other pages . - constitutional economics - political economy
