Binary star     a binary star is two stars which orbit around each other . for each star , the other is its `` companion star '' . many stars are part of a system with two or more stars . the brighter star is called the primary star , and the other is the secondary . binary stars are important in astrophysics because looking at their orbits allows scientists to find out their masses . from this is got the massâ€“luminosity relationship , and from this is got the masses of individual stars . binary stars are not the same as line-of-sight `` optical double stars '' , which look close together but are not connected by gravity . optical double stars may actually be far apart in space , but binary stars are quite close together . the first person to discover and prove true binary stars was the anglo-german astronomer william herschel . he published the first catalogue of binary stars , and his son john herschel found several thousand more and updated the catalogue . by the modern definition , the term `` binary star '' is generally restricted to pairs of stars which revolve around a common centre of mass . binary stars which can be resolved with a telescope or interferometric methods are known as `` visual binaries '' . for most of the known visual binary stars one whole revolution ( complete circle ) has not been observed yet , they are seen to have travelled along a curved path or a partial arc .
