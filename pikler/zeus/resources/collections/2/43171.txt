Appalachian Mountains     the appalachian mountains ( french : les appalaches ) are a large group of north american mountains . they are partly in canada , but mostly in the united states . they form an area from 100 to 300 miles wide , running 1,500 miles from the island of newfoundland in canada to central alabama in the united states . the individual mountains average around 3,000 ft ( 900 m ) in height . the highest is mt . mitchell in north carolina ( 6,684 ft or 2,037m ) . mt . mitchell is also the highest point in the united states east of the mississippi river as well as the highest point in eastern north america . the appalachians today are the worn-down remains of a once huge mountain chain . they first formed about 480 million years ago during the ordovician and once reached heights similar to that of the alps and the rocky mountains . the appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel as ridgelines and valleys run north-south and travelers must climb them again and again . only a few mountain passes run east-west . the erie canal was built through one of them . in most places the appalachians are the watershed between the drainage basins of the mississippi river and the atlantic ocean .
