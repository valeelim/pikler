Primality test     a primality test is a method ( or algorithm ) to find out if a certain number is a prime number . cryptography uses prime numbers , and needs to test if a certain number is prime . the official proof of a prime is through its primality certificate . simple methods . - sieve of eratosthenes : determine if there is a number ( between 2 and n , the number to test ) that divides n , without a rest - wilson 's theorem ( inefficient ) : formula_1 evaluates to -1 mod p where p is the candidate prime number better methods . - fermat 's primality test .
