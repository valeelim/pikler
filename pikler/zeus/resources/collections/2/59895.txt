20th-century classical music     20th-century classical music is classical music written during the last century . during earlier periods of music history composers from different countries wrote in styles which were often quite similar . for example , composers in the classical music period ( about 1740-1820 ) had fairly similar ideas about what forms to use ( e.g . sonata form ) , what instruments should be used in orchestras or how to write good tunes . classical music from the 20th century is extremely varied . there are lots of different “ schools ” ( meaning : ways of thinking ) as lots of composers had their own ideas about how to compose in ways that were different from what had been done before . a lot of these genres ( types of music ) had names ending in “ ism ” : there was serialism , expressionism , neoclassicism , impressionism as well as jazz , world music ( music from non-european cultures ) and folksong and , later on electronic music and then minimalism and even post-modernism . the names of periods in history were usually given to them many years afterwards . for example , the term middle ages was not used until long after the middle ages had finished . it is difficult to know what to call the period we live in now . in music people often talk about “ modern music ” meaning any music written after 1900. we also talk about “ contemporary music ” meaning more or less the same thing ( “ contemporary ” means “ things that are happening in our time ” , i.e . “ living composers ” ) . now that the 21st century has started some musicians are starting to talk about “ 20th century music ” ( 1900-2000 ) and a period called “ contemporary music ” ( 1975-today ) .
