American bison     the american bison ( american buffalo or just buffalo ) is a bovine mammal . `` buffalo '' is something of a mistake ( a 'misnomer ' ) as it is only distantly related to the water buffalo and the african buffalo . bison are a keystone species . their staple foods are grasses and sedges . they once roamed the north american continent in great herds , and their grazing helped shape the ecology of the great plains . the bisons has a large head with relatively small , curving horns . its dark brown coat is long and shaggy on the forequarters , including the front legs , neck , and shoulders , while the rest of the body has shorter , finer hair . american bison live in river valleys , and on prairies and plains . typical habitat is open or semi-open grassland , as well as sagebrush , semi-arid lands and scrublands . bison will also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep . though not particularly known as high altitude animals , bison in the yellowstone park are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the henry mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the henry mountains , utah , as well as in mountain valleys of the henry mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet .
