Salt mine     a salt mine is a mine where salt is taken from the earth . very often , this is done in the mountains . it is different from a salt evaporation pond , where salt is taken from salt water . getting salt from different layers of rock in a mountain used to be a very dangerous job . the romans used to sentence prisoners to this kind of labour . usually the salt is mixed with rock that has chlorides and sulfates . empty salt mines are used very often as a storage area , for example , for unused radioactive elements ( from nuclear power plants ) . salt mines are empty if there is no salt left to take , or if taking the salt that is left would be too expensive .
