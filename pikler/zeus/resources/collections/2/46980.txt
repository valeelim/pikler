Colorado potato beetle     the colorado potato beetle , `` leptinotarsa decemlineata '' , is a beetle . it is sometimes just called the colorado beetle . it is one of the worst potato pests in the world . the beetle is notable for its ability to resist pesticides . over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides , including cyanide . however , not every population is resistant to every chemical . the colorado beetle first lived in the southwest united states and northern mexico . now it lives in most of north america and also in europe and asia . the colorado potato beetle now eats cultivated potato plants . both larvae and adults eat the leaves and strip the plant down to a skeleton . they may also attack tomato and eggplants . there can be so many colorado potato beetles in potato farms that they destroy the potatoes . because the beetle rapidly evolves resistance to chemicals , the best defence may be biological control . a ground beetle , `` lebia grandis '' is a predator of the eggs and larvae , and its larvae are parasitoids of the colorado beetle 's pupae .
