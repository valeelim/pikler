Trial     a trial is where two people or two groups of people argue in a court . in a civil trial , there is a plaintiff and a defendant . the plaintiff tries to prove that he or she has a reason why the defendant needs to give him or her money . in a criminal trial , there is a prosecutor and a defendant . the prosecutor works for the government and tries to prove that the defendant committed a crime . it often takes a long time to get a trial scheduled as the courts can be very busy . in the united states , federal court can take up to 10 months to get a court date . the judge contols the courtroom . he or she decides who speaks when , and they decide what evidence and arguments can be used . sometimes , a jury is brought in to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty . if there is no jury , the judge or judges decide whether the defendant is proven guilty or not . if the defendant is proven guilty of the crime , the judge will decide the punishment , which is also called the `` sentence '' . if the crime is serious , the defendant may go to prison or , in some countries , be executed . for smaller crimes , there is often a fineâ€”money that must be paid , in addition to having a criminal record .
