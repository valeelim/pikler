Seppuku     seppuku is a japanese ritual where a samurai kills himself by cutting into his belly . after one had done so , a second person would cut off his head . it was thought that seppuku was an honorable way to die . sometimes , it is called hara-kiri , which is translated from japanese as `` belly-cutting '' . seppuku was a key part of bushido , the honor code of the samurai warriors . it was used by warriors so that they would not fall into enemy hands and be shamed . it was possible also that a samurai received an order from his master to commit seppuku . because seppuku was an honorable act , a warrior who was caught by the enemy was sometimes given the choice between seppuku and being executed . if he chose seppuku , he could protect his honor . samurai women had to ask for permission to commit seppuku . this act could be performed either with a ritual , or quietly on the battlefield while other warriors fight the enemy . the main weapon used was the samurai 's knife called tant≈ç or the short sword , called wakizashi . a samurai who wants to commit seppuku would take the weapon , open his kimono and stab the blade into his belly . he would make a deep cut from left to right . an assistant of the warrior committing seppuku ( called `` kaishakunin '' ) would immediately cut off his head .
