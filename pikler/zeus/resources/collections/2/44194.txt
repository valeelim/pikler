Siegfried     sigurd ( old norse : sigurðr ) is a strong hero in the `` nibelungenlied '' , a epic poem written about the year 1200. he killed the dragon fafnir and took its treasure , the `` nibelungenschatz '' . after killing the dragon , he bathed in its blood and so changed his skin , so that he could not be wounded any more . the earliest extant representations for his legend come in pictorial form from seven runestones in sweden and most notably the ramsund carving ( c. 1000 ) and the gök runestone ( 11th century ) . but a leaf fell from a linden tree above while he was bathing and landed on his back , and the little patch of skin that it covered did not touch the dragon 's blood , so that siegfried remained vulnerable ( he could be hurt ) in that one spot . siegfried wants to marry kriemhild , the sister of gunther , kin of the burgundians in worms . but before he is allowed to marry her he has to help gunther to win against brünhild , the queen of iceland . he does it with the help of a cloak which lets him become invisible .
