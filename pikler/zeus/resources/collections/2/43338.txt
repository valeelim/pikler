Transistor     a transistor is an electronic component that can be used as an amplifier , or as a switch . it is made of semiconductor material . transistors are found in most electronic devices . a transistor has three connectors or terminals . in the older bipolar transistor they are the collector , the emitter , and the base . the flow of charge goes in the collector , and out of the emitter , depending on the charge flowing to the base . in this way , it is possible for the base to switch on or off the flow through the transistor . a mosfet names its terminals differently because it works differently . the transistor can be used for a variety of different things including amplifiers and digital switches for computer microprocessors . digital work mostly uses mosfets . some transistors are individually packaged , mainly so they can handle high power . most are inside integrated circuits . transistors have three parts , the gate , the drain , and the source ( also , the wires can be called the emitter , the collector , and the base ) . when the source is connected to the negative terminal of the battery , and the drain to the positive terminal , no electricity will flow in the circuit ( assuming you have only a lamp in series with the transistor ) . but when you touch the gate with the drain , electricity will flow . this is because when the gate is positively charged , the positive electrons will push other positive electrons in the transistor letting the negative electrons flow through . the transistor can also work when the gate is just positively charged , so it does n't need to be touching the drain .
