Monty Hall problem     the monty hall problem is a famous problem in probability ( chance ) . the problem is based on a television game show from the united states , `` let 's make a deal '' . it is named for the host of this show , monty hall . in the problem , there are three doors . a car ( prize of high value ) is behind one door and goats ( booby prizes of low value ) behind the other two doors . first , the player chooses a door but does not open it . then the host , who has knowledge of what is behind every door , opens a different door which they are certain has a goat behind it ( opening either door with equal chances if the car is behind the player 's door ) . last , the host lets the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change choices to the third door ( the one the host did not open ) . the rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind and has to let the player switch . the question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car .
