Database     a database is a system for storing and taking care of data ( any kind of information ) . a database engine can sort , change or serve the information on the database . the information itself can be stored in many different ways - before digital computers , card files , printed books and other methods were used . now most data is kept on computer files . a database system is a computer program for managing electronic databases . a very simple example of a database system would be an electronic address book . the data in a database is organized in some way . before there were computers , employee data was often kept in file cabinets . there was usually one card for each employee . on the card , information such as the date of birth or the name of the employee could be found . a database also has such `` cards '' . to the user , the card will look the same as it did in old times , only this time it will be on the screen . to the computer , the information on the card can be stored in different ways . each of these ways is known as a database model . the most commonly used database model is called `` relational database model '' ; it uses relations and sets to store the data . normal users talking about the database model will not talk about relations , they will talk about database tables .
