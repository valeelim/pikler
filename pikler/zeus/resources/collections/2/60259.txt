Phenotype     the phenotype of an organism is the whole set of characters ( or traits ) of that organism . it does not mean just 'what you can see on the surface ' . rather , it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means . for example , blood groups are definitely a part of the phenotype . however , they are not visible just by looking at a person . in biology , the phenotype is distinguished from the genotype . this was proposed by wilhelm johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism 's heredity and what that heredity produces . the distinction is similar to that proposed by august weismann , who distinguished between `` germ plasm '' ( gametes or their stem cells ) and `` somatic cells '' ( the body ) . the phenotype is important because it is exposed to natural selection : phenotypes are determined mainly by genes and are influenced by environmental factors . so , knowing the genome of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype . traits vary greatly in how much they owe to heredity ( nature vs nurture ) . the interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship :
