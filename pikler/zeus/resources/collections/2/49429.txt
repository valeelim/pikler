Nagamaki     nagamaki is a japanese pole weapon with a large and heavy blade . it is very much like a glaive . it was introduced and used primarily during the kamakura ( 1192 - 1333 ) , nanbokucho ( 1334 - 1392 ) and early muromachi ( 1392 – 1573 ) periods . it was a long sword with 2–4 foot blade and a handle with 2–3 foot length . the blade was single-edged . it was also sharpened along the back edge to reduce its weight . it looks similar to a traditional naginata , but the main difference was that the handle ( tsuka ) of the nagamaki was not constructed of wood ; it was made more like a katana handle . even the name `` nagamaki '' is given by the tradition of handle wrapping . the word `` nagamaki '' means `` long wrapping '' . the nagamaki handle was wrapped with cords in criss-crossed manner , very similar to the wrapping that is made on katana . the nagamaki is considered to be a type of the no-dachi sword . this one was a variation of long samurai sword . the way to hold nagamaki was also very specific . it was held with the two hands in a fixed position in the same way a katana sword is held . unlike the naginata , the hands did not change when handling the weapon and the right hand was always the closest to the blade . while handling nagamaki not too many sliding actions on the handle were performed as it was in naginata 's case , where you use the entire length of the shaft . the nagamaki was not spread and developed until much later like the naginata sword . during the middle of the muromachi period ( 1336-1600 a.d. ) it reached its peak of usage .
