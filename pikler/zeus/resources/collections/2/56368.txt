Surface wave     in physics , a surface wave can refer to a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media , usually two fluids with different densities . a surface wave can also be an electromagnetic wave guided by a refractive index gradient . for radio waves , a ground wave is a surface wave that propagates close to the surface of the earth . related pages . waves . - ocean surface waves , internal waves and crests , dispersion , and freak waves - list of wave topics people . - arnold sommerfeld â€“ published the mathematical treatise on the `` zenneck wave '' other articles , further reading , and references . other websites . - eric w. weisstein , `` et al . `` , `` '' surface wave '' , eric weisstein 's world of physics , 2006 . - `` surface waves '' . integrated publishing ( tpub.com ) . - brett ketter , `` surface wave theory '' . university of wisconsin - milwaukee . - david reiss , `` electromagnetic surface waves '' . the net advance of physics : special reports , no . 1 - gary l. peterson , `` rediscovering the zenneck wave '' . feed line no . 4 .
