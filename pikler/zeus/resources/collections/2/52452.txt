Michelson–Morley experiment     the michelson–morley experiment was a scientific experiment to find the presence and properties of a substance called aether , a substance believed to fill empty space . the experiment was done by albert a. michelson and in 1887. since waves in water need something to move in ( water ) and sound waves do as well ( air ) , it was believed that light also needed something to move in . scientists in the 18th century named this substance `` aether , '' after the greek god of light . they believed that aether was all around us and that it also filled the vacuum of space . michelson and morley created this experiment to try and prove the theory that aether existed . they did this with a device called an interferometer . the earth travels very quickly ( more than 100,000 km per hour ) around the sun . if aether exists , the earth moving through it would cause a `` wind '' in the same way that there seems to be a wind outside a moving car . to a person in the car , the air outside the car would seem like a moving substance . in the same way , aether should seem like a moving substance to things on earth .
