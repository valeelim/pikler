Proto-Indo-European language     proto-indo-european language ( pie ) is the ancestor of the indo-european languages . far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language , and it is by far the best-understood of all proto-languages . the techniques of comparison and analysis are called historical linguistics . there are several competing hypotheses about when and where pie was spoken . scholars estimate that pie may have been spoken as a single language ( before divergence began ) around 3700 bc . estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium . the most popular hypothesis for the origin and spread of the language is the kurgan hypothesis , an origin in the pontic-caspian steppe of eastern europe . there is no direct evidence of pie , because it was never written . all pie sounds and words are reconstructed from later indo-european languages . the asterisk is used to mark reconstructed pie words , such as * ' 'water ' , * ' 'dog ' , or * '' '' 'three ( masculine ) ' . many of the words in the modern indo-european languages seem to have derived from such `` protowords '' by regular sound changes , such as grimm 's law .
