Hypothalamus     the hypothalamus is a brain part at the base of the brain . it connects the endocrine system to the nervous system . the word `` hypothalamus '' is a greek word which means `` under the thalamus '' ; it is used because hypothalamus is below the thalamus , and above the brain stem . the hypothalamus controls body temperature , hunger , thirst and circadian cycles . it is the control system which regulates the pituitary gland , the 'master gland ' of the body . the thalamus sits above the hypothalamus , and the hypothalamus sits above the pituitary gland . that area at the base of the brain down to the pituitary is the centre of neurosecretion . some neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus produce hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin . these hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary . it is the main way the nervous system controls the hormones in our bodies .
