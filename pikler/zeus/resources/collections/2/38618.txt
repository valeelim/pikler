Jam     jam is a condiment . it is made from pressed fruit usually , by adding sugar , and sometimes pectin . most jams are cooked . after making , jam is normally put into a jar . usually a jam contains as much sugar as it contains fruit . the two parts are then cooked together . in the european union , there is the jam directive ( council directive 79/693/eec , 24 july 1979 ) . it sets minimum standards for the amount of `` fruit '' in jam , but the definition of fruit was expanded . this was done to take several unusual kinds of jam made in the eu into account . for this purpose , `` fruit '' is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated as fruits , such as tomatoes ; fruits that are not normally made into jams , such as melons and watermelons ; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams , such as : rhubarb ( the edible part of the stalks ) , carrots , sweet potatoes , cucumbers , and pumpkins . this definition continues to apply in the new directive , council directive 2001/113/ec ( 20 december 2001 ) . marmalade is jam made from oranges and tends to have pulp and peels .
