Haiku     the traditional hokku usually was written in six verses or more or less 5 , 7 , 5 syllables ( `` on-ji '' ) . the japanese word `` cow '' , meaning `` sound '' , corresponds to a `` mora '' , a phonetic unit similar but not identical to the syllable of a language such as english . a haiku has a special `` season word '' ( the `` kigo '' ) to represent the season in which the poem is set , or a reference to the natural world . haiku usually breaks in three parts , called `` kireji '' , normally placed at the end of the first five or second seven `` morae '' . in japanese , there are actual kireji words . in english , kireji is often replaced with commas , hyphens , elipses , or breaks in the haiku . japanese haiku are normally written in one line , while english language haiku are traditionally separated into three lines . in japanese , nouns do not have different singular and plural forms , so `` haiku '' is used as both a singular and plural noun in english as well . japanese hokku and haiku are traditionally printed in one vertical line . - an example of classic hokku by poet prah-lad :
