Puddle     a puddle is a small mass of liquid , usually water , uncontained on a surface . it can form either in depressions in the surface , or directly upon the flat surface , held together by surface tension . a puddle is generally considered to be small enough to step over or shallow enough to walk through , and too small to traverse with a boat . puddles commonly form during rainstorms , and can cause problems for transport , especially when combined with cold conditions to form patches of ice , which are highly slippery and difficult to see .
