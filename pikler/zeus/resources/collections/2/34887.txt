Kingdom (biology)    kingdom ( biology ) kingdom is the highest rank , after the domain , which is normally used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms . each kingdom is split into phyla . there are 5 or 6 kingdoms in taxonomy . every living thing comes under one of these kingdoms and some symbionts , such as lichen , come under two . there are at least : - prokaryotes or monera – the most simple living things : bacteria and archaea - protista – eukaryotes that are not plants , fungi , or animals - fungi – mushrooms , moulds and other fungi - plantae – all plants , such as moss , trees and grass - animalia – all animals , including people . see list of animal phyla the kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms . sometimes entries in the table , which are next to each other , do not match perfectly . for example , haeckel placed the red algae ( haeckel 's florideae ; modern rhodophyta ) and blue-green algae ( haeckel 's archephyta ; modern cyanobacteria ) in his plantae , but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively . however , despite these differences , the table gives a useful summary .
