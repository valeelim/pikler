Potter's wheel    potter 's wheel the potter 's wheel , also known as the potter 's lathe , is a machine used in the shaping of round ceramic wares . however , the name potter 's lathe is also used for the machine used for another shaping process , turning , which is similar to that used for the shaping of metal and wood articles . the wheel may also be used during the process of trimming excess body from dried wares and for applying incised decoration or rings of colour . many early ceramics were hand-built using a simple coiling technique in which clay body was rolled into long threads that were then pinched and beaten together to form the body of a vessel . in the coiling method of construction , all of the energy required to form the main part of a piece is supplied directly by the hands of the potter . this changed with the introduction of the fast-wheel , early forms of which utilised energy stored in the rotating mass of the heavy stone wheel itself . in ancient egyptian mythology , the god chnum was said to have formed the first humans on a potter 's wheel .
