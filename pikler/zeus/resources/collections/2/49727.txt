Free good     in economics free good means a good that is available without production , and therefore not scarce . it is available in as much quantity as desired , with zero opportunity cost to society . a good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good . for example , a shop might give away its stock in its promotion , but for the production of these goods , resources were needed , so this would not be a free good in an economic sense . there are three main types of free goods : - resources that are so abundant in nature that there is enough for everyone to have as much as they want . an example of this is the air that we breathe . - resources that are jointly produced . this type of free good is produced as a by-product of something else that is more valuable . waste products from factories and homes , such as discarded packaging , are often free goods . - ideas and works that can be copied at zero cost , or almost zero cost . for example , if someone invents a new device , many people could copy this invention , with no danger of this `` resource '' running out . other examples include computer programs and web pages .
