Ductility     ductility is when a solid material stretches under tensile stress . if ductile , a material may be stretched into a wire . malleability , a similar property , is a material 's ability to deform under pressure ( compressive stress ) . if malleable , a material may be flattened by hammering or rolling . both of these properties are aspects of plasticity . plasticity is how far a solid material can be deformed without fracture . these properties are are commonplace in metals , and are dependent on temperature and pressure . this was investigated by percy williams bridgman as part of his 1946 nobel prizeâ€“winning work on high pressures . ductility and malleability do not always go together . gold has high ductility and malleability , but lead has low ductility and high malleability . the word `` ductility '' is sometimes used to embrace both types of plasticity . gold , copper , aluminium , and steel have high ductility . related pages . - stress ( mechanics )
