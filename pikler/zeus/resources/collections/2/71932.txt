Mercenary     mercenaries are soldiers who fight mainly for money , rather than for their country or for their political beliefs . mercenaries are a very old phenomenon , and they are mentioned already in the old testament - king david had a bodyguard of cretan and philistine mercenaries . the carthaginians often used mercenaries . the so-called free companies in the middle ages were mercenary companies which consisted of rogue knights and archers . the japanese `` ronin '' were mercenary samurai . for many years in the middle ages soldiers from switzerland fought battles for which ever side paid them . the popes would hire soldiers from switzerland to fight for them . the swiss guard is all that is left of switzerland 's mercenary tradition . however the modern swiss guard are not mercenaries , because the guards are all catholic and are prepared to fight not for their country but for their beliefs . soldiers of professional volunteer armies , like those of the us army are not considered as mercenaries as they fight for their country and fatherland . likewise , foreign volunteers in standing armies , such as french foreign legion are not considered as mercenaries as they are loyal to the country they serve . but various private military contractors are considered mercenaries . they have very bad reputation amongst real soldiers .
