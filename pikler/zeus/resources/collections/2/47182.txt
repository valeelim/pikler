Natural capital     natural capital is a metaphor for the mineral , plant , and animal formations of the earth 's biosphere when viewed as a means of production of oxygen , water filter , erosion preventer , or provider of other ecosystem services . in a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production , natural capital would usually be understood as `` land '' and therefore something else than `` capital '' in its original sense . at the beginning of reflection about economics `` land '' was seen as something natural , but `` capital '' as man-made goods only . but the benefits which humans have from nature are many . 17 of them were closely looked at by robert costanza . these benefits are in some ways similar to those that owners of `` capital '' have as their capital produces more goods , e.g . a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples . this is an approach to ecosystem valuation , an alternative to the traditional view of all non-human life as passive natural resources . but human knowledge and understanding of the natural environment is never complete , and therefore we can not yet know what `` natural capital '' means exactly .
