Troodon     troodon ( or `` troödon '' ) is a genus of relatively small , bird-like dinosaurs , from the later part of the cretaceous period , 75–65 million years ago . the alternate spelling `` troödon '' shows that the 'o 's are pronounced separately , as in 'zoology ' . they were probably carnivorous , but details of their teeth are a bit unusual . some experts suggest they may have included plant material in their diet , but this is not a majority view at present . discovered in central montana in 1855 , it was among the first dinosaurs found in north america . its species ranged widely , with fossil remains recovered from as far north as alaska , and the judith river formation of alberta , and as far south as wyoming and even possibly texas and new mexico . `` troodon '' had a large brain in proportion to its body weight . it had a sickle claw , an enlarged and retractable second toe claw bone . `` troodon '' had 122 teeth . the size and shape of the leg bones show that the `` troodon '' would have been a fast runner . the view that `` troodon '' was a predator is supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good binocular vision .
