Double stopping     double stopping means playing two notes at once on a bowed string instrument by drawing the bow across two strings at once while `` stopping '' two notes by pressing the fingers down on the fingerboard : one finger on each of the two strings being played . on instruments such as the violin the player is mostly playing one note at a time . it is not difficult to play two open strings at once , but fingering two strings at once can be very difficult , so double stopping is an advanced technique . sometimes triple or quadruple stopping is needed . this is sometimes called multiple stopping . it is not really possible to play three or four notes at the same time on a violin . the bridge is curved so that the player can bow on one string without hitting the others by accident . multiple stopping is done by playing first two strings and then , while still letting the sound from these two ring , quickly playing the other two strings . multiple stopping was used a lot in renaissance music when playing the viol . baroque composers such as johann sebastian bach in germany or arcangelo corelli in italy often require double stopping when writing for solo string instruments . it is also used a lot in virtuoso music of composers in the romantic period such as niccol√≤ paganini .
