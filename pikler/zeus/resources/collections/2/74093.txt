Lancelet     the lancelets , or cephalochordata , are a group of primitive chordates which were formerly called `` amphioxus '' . it includes `` pikaia '' . lancelets are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage , with a fossil record dating back to the cambrian period . the lancelets are usually said to be the sister group of the craniates . they are a small group of about 30 species in two genera . lancelets are usually found buried in sand in shallow parts of temperate or tropical seas . in asia , they are harvested commercially as food for humans and domesticated animals . they are an important object of study in zoology as they give indications about the origin of vertebrates . lancelets serve as an intriguing comparison point for tracing how vertebrates have evolved and adapted . although lancelets split from vertebrates more than 520 million years ago , their genomes hold clues about evolution , particularly how vertebrates have employed old genes for new functions . they are regarded as similar to the archetypal vertebrate form .
