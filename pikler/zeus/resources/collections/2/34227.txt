Hummingbird     hummingbirds are small birds of the family trochilidae . they are among the smallest of birds : most species measure 7.5–13 cm ( 3–5 in ) . the smallest living bird species is the 2–5 cm bee hummingbird . they can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–80 times per second ( depending on the species ) . they are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards . their rapid wing beats do actually hum . they can fly at speeds over 15 m/s ( 54 km/h , 34 mi/h ) . hummingbirds help flowers to pollinate , though most insects are best known for doing so . the hummingbird enjoys nectar , like the butterfly and other flower-loving insects , such as bees . hummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell ; instead , they are attracted to color , especially the color red . unlike the butterfly , the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it , like a moth . when it does so , it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place , which makes it look like a blur and also beats so fast makes a humming sound . a hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly . when it takes its head back out , its head is covered with yellow pollen , so that when it moves to another flower , it can pollinate . or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak .
