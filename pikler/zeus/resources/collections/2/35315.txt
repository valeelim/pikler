Bribery     bribery means offering something ( e.g . money ) to a person in return for some favour which is bad in some way . the money that is offered is called a bribe and the verb is to bribe . `` active bribery '' is offering payment and asking for favour , and `` passive bribery '' is asking for payment and offering favour . it 's still called bribery , even if the trade is never done . it is sometimes difficult to decide whether something is a bribe or just a reward . if a father pays his son for washing the car , this is just a reward or payment . but if a parent pays a child for eating up its dinner this might be thought of as a bribe , because most people would think this was not right . bribery can be a crime , in more serious cases , like when a person offers money so that he does not get into trouble . if a motorist is caught speeding by a policeman and he offers the policeman money or a bottle of vodka to persuade him not to fine him , this is bribery . if someone wants to take something into a country that they are not allowed to take in ( or that they would have to pay tax on ) they might offer the customs officer a bribe to persuade him to let them through . some corrupt people will not do their jobs at all ( like delivering some package ) unless they get a bribe on top of their normal pay .
