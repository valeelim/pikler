Somersault     a somersault is an acrobatic move where a person moves the feet over the head whilst in mid-air . the somersault can be done forwards , backwards , or sideways and is similar to a `` flip '' ( or , if performed backwards , a `` backflip '' ) . a backwards somersault while still moving forward is called a `` gainer '' the word comes from the old french word `` sombresault '' , which is no longer used .
