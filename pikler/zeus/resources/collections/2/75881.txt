Henry Cavendish     henry cavendish frs ( 10 october 1731-24 february 1810 ) was a british scientist . he is famous for discovering hydrogen . cavendish measured the earth 's mass and density with the cavendish experiment . he studied at peterhouse , which is part of the university of cambridge , but he left without graduating . he built a laboratory in his father 's house in london , where he worked for nearly fifty years , but he only published about 20 scientific papers . even so , he is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of his time . cavendish claimed that the force between the two electrical objects gets smaller as they get further apart . if the distance between them doubled , the force would be one quarter what it was before . this was the basis of the inverse-square law . he explained the concept of electric potential , which he called `` the degree of electrification '' . he developed the thought of all points on a good conductor 's surface have the same potential energy beside a common reference point . having no way to measure electric current , he used his body as a machine which measures strength of electric current . all cavendish 's explorations in his notebook was found and confirmed by james clerk maxwell .
