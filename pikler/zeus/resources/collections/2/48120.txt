Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof     bremerhaven hauptbahnhof is the central railway station in bremerhaven , germany . the station lies on the line from bremen to cuxhaven . the line from bremen was built in 1862 , and a station for that was built in geestemünde . at the time , geestemünde did not belong to bremerhaven , but was a separate town . the line from geestemünde to cuxhaven was then built in 1896. because there were too many trains in the old station and it is connected only with single-track , it was decided to knock down the old station . the new station , which is now bremerhaven hauptbahnhof , is opened in 1914. because it still was in geestemünde , but not as far away as the old station , it was called geestemünde-bremerhaven . in 1924 , some other towns joined bremerhaven , and the city got a new name , wesermünde . the station got a new name , wesermünde-bremerhaven , because of that . in 1944 , in the middle of world war ii , the hall over the railway tracks was destroyed by a bomb that was thrown from an american plane . the hall was not built again after the war .
