River source     the source of a river or stream is the original point from which the river flows . it may be a lake , a marsh , a spring or a glacier . this is where the stream starts . the source is the farthest point of the river stream from its estuary or its confluence with another river or stream . the farthest stream is called the headstream or headwater . they are usually cool waters because of shade and barely melted ice or rain . they may also be glacial headwaters . these are waters made by the melting of the ice of glaciers . where a river is fed by more than one source , it is usual to regard the highest as its source . the source is where a river begins , and the mouth is where it joins the sea.the source of a river generally discharges water with less force leading to the formation of interlocking spurs . the mouth is not to be confused with the source . the mouth is the delta ( where the river meets the ocean ) .
