Ohana     ohana is an idea in hawaiian culture . the word `` ohana '' means family in the hawaiian language , but in a much wider sense , to include not only one 's closer relatives , but also one 's cousins , in-laws , friends , race , and other neighbours . the idea is also that family and friends are bound together and everyone must work together and not forget each other . the word is related to the word `` whānau '' meaning the same , used by the maori of new zealand . it comes from the hawaiian word `` ohā '' meaning the root of the taro plant , the most important plant in hawaiian culture . `` ohana '' is also one of the main ideas of the disney animated movie lilo & stitch . ( `` ohana `` means family , and family means nobody gets left behind . or forgotten . '' '' ) the director of the movie , dean deblois , says the movie 's makers learned about this from their tour guide when they went to hawaii to get ideas for the movie . he said that everywhere they went , the guide seemed to know people , and that he explained about `` ohana '' to them . they liked the idea so much that it became one of the main ideas for the story , the one thing that changes the character of stitch , even though he was created to destroy .
