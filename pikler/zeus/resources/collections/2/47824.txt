History of Taiwan     taiwan ( minus the pescadores ) is an island of eastern asia . its first people were related to oceanic people with small numbers of chinese . after the arrival of the dutch in the 1600s , many chinese moved to taiwan to work . few european people moved to taiwan , and the native people married with chinese or moved away from the west side of the island . when the qing dynasty began in china , a supporter of the old ming dynasty hid in taiwan . eventually the qing came to taiwan , defeated him , and added taiwan to china . taiwan remained chinese territory through most of the qing dynasty until it was taken by japan in 1895. taiwan became a colony of japan for fifty years until the end of world war two . for a brief time it was under the control of china through the guomindang government , but that government lost a civil war and moved to taiwan . the rule of the guomindang is considered controversial in the modern day . some criticize its treatment of the people of taiwan , but others focus on positive political and economic change that it made . in the 1980s , the government taiwan has became more democratic . this has also become controversial because it has allowed different political parties to compete . the democratic progressive party gained influence in the government . during this time , taiwan has officially been called the republic of china but has acted independently of china . the people 's republic of china demands that taiwan must become a part of china , while most taiwanese debate the appropriate political status for today . these perspectives create a complicated situation in the politics of taiwan .
