Inert     in chemistry , the term inert is used to describe something that is not chemically active . the noble gases were described as being inert because they did not react with the other elements or themselves . inert gases are completely inert to basic chemical reactions ( such as combustion , for example ) because their outer valence shell is completely filled with electrons . with a filled outer valence shell , an inert atom is not able to acquire or lose an electron , and is therefore not able to participate in any chemical reactions . for inert atoms or molecules , a lot of energy is involved before it can combine with other elements to form compounds . a high temperature and pressure is necessary , and sometimes requires the presence of a catalyst . for example , elemental nitrogen is inert under standard room conditions and exists as a diatomic molecule , n. the inertness of nitrogen is due to the presence of the very strong triple covalent bond in the n molecule . inert atmospheres of gases such as dinitrogen and argon are routinely used in chemical reactions where air sensitive and water sensitive compounds are handled .
