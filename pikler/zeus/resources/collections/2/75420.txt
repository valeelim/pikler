Bas-relief     bas-relief is a type of relief ( sculpture ) that has less depth to the faces and figures than they actually have , when measured proportionately ( to scale ) . this technique retains the natural contours of the figures , and allows the work to be viewed from many angles without distortion of the figures themselves . there is a continuum of the bas-relief technique into the next category , alto-relievo , or high relief . that technique combines the rounded figures with significantly deeper backgrounds . instead of backgrounds being between a fraction of an inch to few inches deep as they are in bas-relief , they may be a foot to several feet deep in alto-relievo . some of the most impressive examples are the assyrian lion hunt reliefs which are housed at the british museum . the attention to detail and capture of the lions in motion make them stand out artistically especially considering the time period they were created in . these images are designed to appear in 3d with the use of colored glasses , and may not appear correctly without them .
