Genome     the genome of an organism is the whole of its hereditary information encoded in its dna ( or , for some viruses , rna ) . this includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the dna . the term was coined in 1920. winkler 's definition , in translation , runs : however , no single haploid chromosome set defines even the dna of a species , because of the huge variety of alleles carried by a population . even a diploid individual carries genetic variety . for that reason dobzhansky preferred `` set of chromosomes '' , and the definition now must be broader than winklers ' definition . the genome of a haploid chromosome set is merely a `` sample '' of the total genetic variety of a species . the term 'genome ' can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of nuclear dna ( the 'nuclear genome ' ) but can also be used of organelles that contain their own dna , as with the mitochondrial genome or the chloroplast genome . `` note : '' the dna from a single human cell has a length of ~1.8 m ( but at a width of ~2.4 nanometers ) .
