Horn (musical instrument)    horn ( musical instrument ) the horn is a brass instrument . it developed from the horns that some animals have on their heads . modern horns are often called french horns . horns were often used during hunting . these early brass instruments were round so that the hunter could put his arm through it and carry it on his shoulder and blow it while riding a horse . the riders could send messages to one another by blowing particular notes . in the 17th century the modern orchestra was developing . orchestras played for operas . opera stories in those days were usually about gods and goddesses or kings and queens . there was often a hunting scene in the story . hunters were asked to come and play their horns in the orchestra for these scenes . this is how the horn became an orchestral instrument . a brass instrument gives one basic note . changing the pressure with the lips produces a few other notes . gradually horn players discovered that if they put their right hand in the bell they could change the basic note . this made it possible to play lots of different notes . when mozart wrote his horn concertos he was writing for a hand horn . when a note is played using the hand in the bell it makes the note sound different : more muffled ( a bit like speaking while covering your mouth with your hand ) . a mozart horn concerto sounds very different when played on a modern horn .
