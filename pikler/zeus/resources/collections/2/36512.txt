Anura     the order anura includes the frogs and toads . they are the most successful living amphibia , judged by number of species . there are about 7400 different species of amphibians , and about 6500 are in the anura . there is no fundamental difference between frogs and toads . frogs have a short body , webbed digits ( fingers or toes ) , protruding eyes , forked tongue and no tail . they are exceptional jumpers : many of their features , particularly their long , powerful legs , are adaptations to improve jumping performance . they often live in semi-aquatic or humid areas . a popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance . the warty skin of toads is an adaptation for making their toxic slime . apart from these glands , their skin is dry , and that is an adaptation to drier habitats . these features have evolved a number of times independently : convergent evolution . the distinction has no taxonomic basis : the anura are not divided into frogs and toads . the only family exclusively given the common name `` toad '' is the bufonidae ( the `` true toads '' ) , but many species from other families are also called `` toads '' .
