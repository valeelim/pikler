Moment of inertia     moment of inertia ( formula_1 ) , also called `` angular mass '' ( kgÂ·m ) , is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation . it is a rotating body 's resistance to angular acceleration or deceleration , equal to the product of the mass and the square of its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation . other pages . - angular momentum - torque other websites . - angular momentum and rigid-body rotation in two and three dimensions - a table of moments of inertia - parallels between rotation and translation `` hyperphysics ''
