Waits     waits or waites were british town musicians . from medieval times up to the early 19th century , every important british town and city had a band of waites . some other countries in europe also had waits . they were called stadtpfeifer in germany and pifferi in italy . the duties ( things they had to do ) varied in different towns and at different times in history . one of their most important jobs was to play at certain times of day so that people knew what the time was . they often played from the top of church towers . sometimes they were also guards , watching from the towers so that they could spot any danger . they were like watchmen , making sure everything was all right ( there was no police at that time ) . they woke people up in the mornings by playing music in the streets . the instruments they played also varied . mostly they were loud wind instruments such as the shawm . it was a paid job . the waits wore smart liveries and silver chains of office with the town 's arms . in germany the stadtpfeifer would also play at church services . they would play shawms or trombones on normal days , but trumpets and drums on feast-days .
