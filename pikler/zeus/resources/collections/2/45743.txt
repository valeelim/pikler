.htaccess     .htaccess is a type of computer file for the configuring of some web servers . .htaccess files can be used to create custom error pages , or to prevent visitors from directly linking pictures , also known as hot-linking to their own sites , costing the website owner money . a .htaccess file is put onto the website , so that people will not be able to go onto the url of the image ( picture ) ( example : www.website.com/image.filetype ) . owners can replace this picture , after they upload the file , with a message , or it can be made to redirect to an error page . by default , mediawiki uses http : //www.example.org/index.php/main_page type of url to display the main page . but by changing the .htaccess and localsettings.php , it can display urls like http : //www.example.org/wiki/main_page so that it will look nicer ( like wikipedia ) . by default , all posts made in wordpress uses http : //www.example.org/ ? p=123 to display posts . but it can be changed into urls like http : //www.example.org/2010/06/postname in .htaccess and the permalink setting in the site admin of that blog .
