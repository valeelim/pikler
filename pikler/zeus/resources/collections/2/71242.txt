Hippie     a hippie ( sometimes spelled as hippy ) is a label for a person of a certain counterculture that started in the united states and spread to other countries in the 1960s . hippies have their own views on drug use , sexual liberation , and women 's rights . the first people to be called `` hippies '' were young adults and teenagers in the 1960s who grew out of the beatnik movement . these people were supporters of civil rights for african-americans in the southern usa . they soon developed their own music scene in neighborhoods in new york city ( greenwich village ) and san francisco ( haight-ashbury ) . they were also strongly against the vietnam war , nuclear weapons , and what they called the `` establishment '' ( this was a word for mainstream society ) . they were also against the `` military-industrial complex '' . this phrase was taken from a warning in the farewell speech of president dwight eisenhower in 1961. many more people began to see hippies in the news after the human be-in ( january 1967 ) and the 1967 `` summer of love '' were held in san francisco . by this time , they had developed their own lifestyle that included psychedelic styles , drug use , usually some amount of travel , and much longer hair than other people . these styles quickly spread across the country , especially to college campuses where students were protesting president lyndon johnson 's policies in vietnam , the assassination of dr. martin luther king , jr. in 1968 , and other events . they also spread to the uk , netherlands , france , italy , germany , australia , new zealand and canada , among other places .
