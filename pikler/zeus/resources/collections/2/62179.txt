Bigotry     a bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions , lifestyles , or identities that are different from his or her own . mostly , the person 's opinions are based on prejudice . the origin of the word `` bigot '' in english dates back to at least 1598 , via french . it started with the sense of `` religious hypocrite '' , especially a woman . the word `` bigot '' is often used as a pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to negative prejudices , even when those prejudices are proven to be false . forms of bigotry may have a related ideology . the exact origin of the word is unknown , but may have come from the german `` bei '' and `` gott '' , or the english `` by god '' . william camden wrote that the normans were first called bigots , when their duke rollo , who receiving gisla , daughter of king charles , in marriage , and with her the investiture of the dukedom , refused to kiss the king 's foot in token of subjection , unless the king would hold it out for that purpose . and being urged to it by those present , rollo answered hastily , `` no by god '' , whereupon the king turning about , called him `` bigot '' ; which name passed from him to his people . this is likely fictional , however , as gisla is unknown in frankish sources .
