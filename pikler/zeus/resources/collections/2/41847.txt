Herb     herbs are plants that are grown either as a food ( usually as a condiment ) , or because they have some use in treating diseases ( or making them better ) , or for spiritual reasons ( for example , their smell ) . some herbs may act as an aphrodisiac . the word herb comes from the latin word `` herba '' , meaning grass , green stalks , or blades . botanists use the word to mean any plant with soft , succulent tissues . but many people use the word to mean only herbs with some economic value . herbs are small plants that have a fleshy or juicy stem when they are young . the stems of some herbs develop hard , woody tissue when they grow old . most herbs are perennials . this means that the tops of the plants die each growing season , but the roots remain alive and produce new plants year after year . some herbs are annuals . they live for only one growing season and must be raised from seed each year . the leaves , stems , or seeds of herbs can be used fresh , or they can be dried for later use . dried herbs can be pounded to a fine powder , placed in airtight containers , and then stored .
