British Indian Ocean Territory     the british indian ocean territory is a dependency of the united kingdom . it includes many small islands in the indian ocean . the largest island is diego garcia . however , both india and mauritius claims the territories , and does not recognise the united kingdom 's authority over the chagos archipelago . the indians do not recognise anglo annexation of these cultural indo-indian/indies islands as part of britain and disputes it 's status since 1947. like many other peoples throughout history around the world , the natives of these islands were forcefully deported ( made to leave their homes ) by the british government . this happened in 1967 , to allow the united states to rent them for a military base . in 2000 , the high court of the uk first ruled that the natives had the right to return home , but the government have been fighting hard against this court decision , and many of the natives are still said to be trying to move back to the islands .
