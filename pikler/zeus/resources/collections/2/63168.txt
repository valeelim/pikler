Kinetic theory     kinetic theory or `` kinetic theory of gases '' attempts to explain overall properties of gases , such as pressure , temperature , or volume , by considering their molecular composition and motion . the theory basically states that pressure is not caused by molecules pushing each other away , like earlier scientists thought . instead , pressure is caused by the molecules colliding with each other and their container . kinetic theory is also known as `` kinetic-molecular theory '' or `` collision theory '' . there are three main components to kinetic theory : - no energy is gained or lost when molecules collide - the molecules in a gas take up a negligible ( able to be ignored ) amount of space in relation to the container they occupy - the molecules are in constant , linear motion related pages . - heat - thermodynamics references . - the mathematical theory of non-uniform gases : an account of the kinetic theory of viscosity , thermal conduction and diffusion in gases , sydney chapman , t. g. cowling
