Gabriel Pascal     gabriel pascal ( 4 june 1894 â€“ 6 july 1954 ) was a hungarian movie producer and director . gabriel pascal was born in transylvania ( which is now part of romania ) in 1894. pascal is best known for having turned some of the best plays by the famous irish playwright george bernard shaw into successful movies . his most famous movie made from one of shaw 's plays was `` pygmalion '' in 1938 . `` pygmalion '' tells the story of a bet that two rich men made over whether one of them , professor higgins , could turn a poor uneducated girl into a sophisticated lady . the movie was so successful that after gabriel pascal died it was made into a huge broadway musical called `` my fair lady '' , and amazingly this musical was then made into another movie . so `` pygmalion '' was first a play , then a movie based on the play , then a play based on the movie , and then a new play based on the movie made from the old play . it is therefore quite a remarkable history and it was gabriel pascal 's idea to make the play a musical , though he did not live long enough to do it himself .
