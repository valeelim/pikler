W. M. Keck Observatory     the w. m. keck observatory is a pair of two large , ground-based telescopes located at mauna kea , hawaii . sitting more than two miles above sea level , the paired telescopes are used to examine light from distant stars in great detail . the primary mirrors of each of the two telescopes are 10 meters ( 33 feet ) across , making them slightly smaller than the gran telescopio canarias primary mirrors . however , all of the light collected by the keck observatory primary mirrors ( 75.76m2 ) is sent to the secondary mirror and the instruments , compared to gtc 's primary mirror , which has an effective light-collection area of 73.4m2 , or 25.4 square feet less than each of the keck observatory primary mirrors . because of this fundamental difference in design , keck observatory 's telescopes arguably remain the largest steerable , optical/infrared telescopes on earth . related pages . - la silla observatory - very large telescope other websites . - w.m . keck observatory ( official site ) - the mauna kea observatory ( official site )
