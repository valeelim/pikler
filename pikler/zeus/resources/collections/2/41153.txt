Adenosine triphosphate     adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) is a nucleotide used in cells as a coenzyme . it is often called the `` molecular unit of currency '' : atp transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism . every cell uses atp for energy . it consists of a base ( adenine ) and three phosphate groups . one molecule of atp contains three phosphate groups , and it is produced by atp synthase from inorganic phosphate and adenosine diphosphate ( adp , the di meaning two phosphate groups ) or adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) . the atp molecule is very versatile , meaning that it can be used for many things . energy is stored in its chemical bonds . when adp binds with another phosphate , energy is stored that can be used later . in other words , when a bond is made , energy is stored . this is an endothermic reaction . when atp breaks a bond with a phosphate group and becomes adp , energy is released . in other words , when a bond is broken energy is released . this is an exothermic reaction . the atp phosphate exchange is a nearly never-ending cycle , stopping only when the cell dies .
