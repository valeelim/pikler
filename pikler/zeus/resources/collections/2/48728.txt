Nobility     nobility was the highest social class in pre-modern societies . in the feudal system ( in europe and elsewhere ) , the nobility were mostly those who got land from the monarch and had to provide services to him , mainly military service . men of this class were called noblemen . it soon became a hereditary class , sometimes with a right to bear a hereditary title and to have financial and other privileges . today , in most countries , `` noble status '' means no legal privileges ; an important exception is the united kingdom , where certain titles ( titles of the peerage , until recently guaranteed a seat in the upper house of westminster parliament , that is why it is called house of lords ) , and still means some less important privileges . other websites . - the german nobility - old noble family trees - ww-person , an on-line database of european noble genealogy - paul theroff 's `` an online gotha '' - genealogics , an extensive database of european nobles - worldroots , a selection of art and genealogy of european nobility
