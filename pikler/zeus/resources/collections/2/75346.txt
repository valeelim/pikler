Monsoon     a monsoon is a seasonal wind which lasts for several months . the word was first used in english for the seasonal rains in the indian subcontinent . these rains blow in from the indian ocean and arabian sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area . monsoons also occur in other regions such as in north america , sub-saharan africa , brazil and east asia . the mechanism is simple : land heats up faster than water . the temperature difference between the land and sea can be as much as 20°c – land temperatures in india can be hotter than 45°c , while the surrounding water in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea remains in the low 20s . the heat absorbed by the land warms the air above it . the hot air rises , and cooler ocean air rushes inland to replace it . as it moves , it carries moisture with it , releasing it over land as the summer monsoon ( also known as southwest monsoon ) . the hot air over the land tends to rise , creating an area of low pressure . this creates a steady wind blowing toward the land , bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it . rainfall is increased by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains , as with the tibetan plateau , and by surface heating .
