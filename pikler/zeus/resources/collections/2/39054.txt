Extrasolar planet     an extrasolar planet ( or exoplanet ) is a natural planet in a planetary system outside our own solar system . in 2013 , estimates of the number of terrestrial planets in the milky way ranged from at least 17 billion to at least 144 billion . an analysis was done of planet candidates gathered by the kepler space observatory . among them are 461 earth-size planets , at least four of which are in the `` habitable zone '' where liquid water can exist . one of the four , dubbed kepler-69c , is a mere 1.5 times the size of the earth and around a star like our own sun â€“ about as near as the current data allow to finding an `` earth 2.0 '' . earlier work suggested that there are at least 100 billion planets of all types in our galaxy , an average of at least one per star . there are also planets that orbit brown dwarfs , and free-floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do . it is unclear whether either type should be called a `` planet '' . in the sixteenth century , the italian philosopher giordano bruno , an early supporter of the copernican theory that the earth and other planets orbit the sun , put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the sun and are likewise accompanied by planets . bruno was burnt at the stake by the holy inquisition .
