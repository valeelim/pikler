Histogram     a histogram is a concept from statistics . it is a graphical display that tells us about the distribution of the samples involved . they are commonly a picture made from a table with many categories . the table tells how many samples there are in each category . the word `` histogram '' is derived from `` histos '' and `` gramma '' in greek . `` histos '' means `` web '' or `` mast '' . `` gramma '' means `` drawing '' , `` record '' or `` writing '' . a histogram of something is therefore , etymologically speaking , a drawing of the web of this something . the histogram is one of the six basic tools of quality control , which also include the pareto chart , check sheet , control chart , cause-and-effect diagram , flowchart , and scatter diagram . a generalization of the histogram is kernel smoothing techniques . this will construct a smooth probability density function from the supplied data .
