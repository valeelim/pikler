Dahlerau train disaster     the dahlerau train disaster was a railway disaster that happened on 27 may 1971. it happened in dahlerau , which is a part of radevormwald in germany . a passenger train carrying pupils was travelling on the railway line from wuppertal to radevormwald on the evening of 27 may 1971. the pupils belonged to the final year of a school in radevormwald and were returning from a trip to bremen . around 21:00 , the train had just left the railway station in `` wuppertal-beyenburg '' and was a few minutes away from the railway station in `` dahlerau '' . farther south , a freight train was traveling from radevormwald to wuppertal , and had just arrived outside the dahlerau station . the freight train would have to wait in the station to allow the passenger train to pass . this was necessary because the passenger train was 30 minutes late and there was only one track on the railway line outside the station . the dispatcher in the station would have to go outside and show a red lantern to the freight train , because there were no signals in the station . nobody knows for sure what happened , but the freight train went right through the station and onto the track where the passenger train was running . the driver of the freight train later told that the dispatcher in the station had shown him a green light . this was the signal not to stop .
