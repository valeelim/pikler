Mineralization     mineralization may mean : - in palaeontology : the process where organic material is converted to inorganic substance and so mineralized . waterborne minerals replace organic material in the body of an organism that has died and was buried by sediments . the minerals may be such as calcium carbonate ( calcite ) , iron oxide ( hematite or limonite ) or silica ( quartz ) . - in mining geology , the deposition of metals as ore bodies or `` lodes '' by various processes . for example , the hydrothermal deposition of economically important metals . - in soil science , the release of organic compounds during decomposition .
