Brights     the brights is a group that was started by paul geisert and mynga futrell to make a name that sounds good for people who have views on life based on nature ( naturalistic worldviews ) . they did not like that names like `` atheist '' and `` non-believer '' sounded bad to some people and they wanted a word that sounded better to these people . paul geisert chose the word `` bright . '' mynga futrell says a bright is a person who has views on life that are free of more-than-natural ( supernatural ) ideas . she says these persons ' morals come from their views on life . well-known brights . - richard dawkins - daniel dennett - penn jillette and teller - james randi - richard roberts - michael shermer some people , both religious and non-religious , do not like the brights using the word `` bright '' in this way . they believe it suggests that people with views on life based on nature are smarter than those with other views on life . however , this is not why the name was chosen ; it tries to show that people with views based on nature are `` looking on the `` bright '' side '' of life .
