Key (cryptography)    key ( cryptography ) in cryptography , a key ( or cryptographic key ) is a piece of information that allows control over the encryption or decryption process . there are two basic types of cryptographic algorithms . - `` symmetric algorithm '' : if there is just one key for encrypting and decrypting , the algorithm is called `` symmetric '' . - `` asymmetric algorithm '' : if there are two different keys , each of which can be used only to encrypt data or only to decrypt it , the algorithm is called `` asymmetric '' . if an algorithm is asymmetric , one person publishes a key and accepts messages encrypted with that key . anyone can encrypt a message , but only the person who owns the other key can decrypt it . this is how online stores , banks , etc. , work . for symmetric algorithms , a minimum key size of 128 bits is recommended . for applications that need extreme security , such as top secret documents , 256 bits is recommended . many older ciphers used 40 , 56 , or 64-bit keysâ€”these have all been cracked by brute force attack because the key was too short .
