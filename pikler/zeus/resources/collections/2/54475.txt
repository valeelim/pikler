Schism (religion)    schism ( religion ) the word schism ( 'sɪzəm or ) , from the greek σχίσμα , `` skhísma '' ( from σχίζω , `` skhízō '' , `` to tear , to split '' ) , means a division or a split , usually in an organization or a movement . a schismatic is a person who creates schism in an organization or who is a member of a splinter group . `` schismatic '' as an adjective means belonging to a schism or schisms , or to those ideas , policies , etc . that are thought to lead towards schism . the words `` schism '' and `` schismatic '' have found perhaps their heaviest usage in the history of christianity , to speak of splits within a church . within christianity the word `` schism '' may refer to : - the offense of creating divisions among christians . - the event of two groups of christians ceasing to be in full communion with each other , so that , they decide they must worship separately because of disagreements between them . - any christian communion or sect that has left the `` one holy catholic and apostolic church '' . `` which '' church constitutes the one holy catholic and apostolic church has long been disputed : for instance , the roman catholic church claims that title and thinks the eastern orthodox communion to be in schism . the eastern orthodox communion also claims that title and holds that the catholic communion is schismatic . the protestant movement thinks that both are in error , so does the restorationist movement .
