Biodiesel     biodiesel is a type of fuel prepared by changing vegetable oil , animal fat , special types of algae and possibly even sewage . it is considered a type of renewable energy , since it all comes from living plants and animals . it can be used to power an engine , usually for vehicles , including airplanes . it replaces diesel that comes from petroleum , a type of fossil fuel . biofuel prepared from biomass is different since it does not start from oil and uses a different chemical process to make the fuel . biodiesel is much cleaner and has less pollution than diesel fuel made from fossil fuels . it also acts as a solvent ( like soap ) . in fact , it cleans the engine so much that it might pull out old dirt in the engine and clog up the filters . after the filters are replaced then it is fine . in the united states and several other places , new laws say that regular diesel fuel must be low in sulfur . this gets rid of pollution , especially acid rain , but it also makes the fuel less slippery . adding in biodiesel helps keep the fuel slippery and the engine running smoothly .
