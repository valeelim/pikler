Japanese traditional dance     there are two types of japanese traditional dance : `` odori '' , which was created in the edo period ; and `` mai '' , which was created in the western part of japan . odori came from `` kabuki '' drama , where it is danced by men . mai derives from `` noh '' drama , also danced by men . today it is usually danced by female dancers , and is mostly done in houses , instead of on stage . a type of the mai style of japanese dance is the `` kyomai '' or kyoto style dance . kyomai was created in the 17th century tokugawa cultural period . noh drama , music and dance was heavily influenced by the elegance of the manners of the japanese imperial court . kabuki drama , and hence odori , was a more democratic form , but still ( viewed with modern eyes ) quite traditional .
