Meerkat     a meerkat ( `` suricata suricatta '' ) is a small mammal that lives in the kalahari desert in southern africa . it is a member of the mongoose family . a group of meerkats is called a `` mob '' or `` gang '' , and usually all of the meerkats are relatives . meerkats live in burrows in the ground . they are active during the day , except when hot during the afternoon sun . they also live in large family groups . the group is led by a female and a male . the meerkats are often all family . they get rid of fleas in each other 's fur to become friends , which is called `` grooming '' . sometimes if a minor member is in trouble with the leader it will groom the leader to try and calm them down . the meerkats help each other . when the family is eating or playing together , one meerkat acts a sentry , and looks out for predators . if he or she sees one , then he gives a chirp and the group runs to a burrow to be safe . also , when pups are looking for food , adults bring them food and teach them how to eat it . before pups start looking for food with the group , they are babysat by older members at the burrow to protect them from danger . sometimes a female who never gave birth will produce milk for the pups .
