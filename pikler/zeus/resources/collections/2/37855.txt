Plutonium     plutonium is the chemical element with the atomic number 94 and chemical symbol pu . it is a highly radioactive metal . it is the metal used in most nuclear weapons . the chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes . the most important isotope of plutonium is pu ( or plutonium-239 ) . it takes 24,110 years for half of a sample of plutonium-239 to decay , which is called its half-life . it can be made from natural uranium . it is fissile and a nuclear fuel . the isotope that has the longest half-life is pu ( or plutonium-244 ) . plutonium-244 has a half-life of about 80 million years . the half life of pu is long enough that some of this isotope of plutonium is found in very small amounts in nature . plutonium-238 is used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators . like other transuranium elements , plutonium can react with water , oxygen , carbon , halogens , nitrogen , and silicon . it forms oxides and hydrides in moist air , causing the plutonium sample to expand by up to 70 % . plutonium from the expanding sample can flake off and catch fire at room temperature . plutonium is also toxic , although it is less toxic than many people think . the reactivity and toxicity of plutonium make it difficult to handle .
