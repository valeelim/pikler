Existentialism     existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking . it sees humans , with will and consciousness , as being in a world of objects which do not have those qualities . the fact that humans are conscious of their mortality , and must make decisions about their life is what existentialism is all about . it was started by the danish philosopher søren kierkegaard ( 18131855 ) . as it developed in the 20th century , it was an atheistic philosophy , although existentialism 's founder , søren kierkegaard , was a deeply religious man . most of its main thinkers and writers were in europe . sartre , for example , spent most of the second world war in a german prison camp , reading the philosophy of heidegger . when he came out he gave a lecture called `` existentialism and humanism '' . this early lecture may be easier to read than his later work . many religions and philosophies ( ways of thinking about the world ) say that human life has a meaning ( or a purpose ) . but people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have `` no meaning unless people give them meaning '' : `` existence precedes [ is before ] essence '' . this means that we find ourselves existing in the world , and then we give ourselves meaning , or 'essence ' . as sartre said , `` we are condemned to be free '' . this means that we have no choice but to choose , and that we have full responsibility for our choices .
