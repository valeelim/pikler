Decimal     the decimal is a way of managing numbers that has ten as a starting point , or base . it is sometimes called the base ten or denary numeral system . the word `` decimal '' is also used instead of the word `` period '' to point out the dot that is sometimes used to separate the positions of the numbers in this system . almost everyone uses this nowadays and prefers the convenience of it probably because it shows up most often in calculations in nature and has `` one '' as another starting point for the system . the number one is usually the easiest to work with in calculations . decimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system , which uses various symbols ( called digits ) for no more than ten distinct values ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ) to represent any numbers , no matter how large . these digits are often used with a decimal separator which indicates the start of a fractional part , and with one of the sign symbols + ( positive ) or âˆ’ ( negative ) in front of the numerals to indicate sign .
