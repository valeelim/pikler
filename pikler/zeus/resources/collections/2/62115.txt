Biennial     a biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle . in the first year the plant grows leaves , stems , and roots ( vegetative structures ) ; then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months . usually , the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground , forming a rosette . many biennials require a cold treatment , before they will flower . the next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer . the plant then flowers , produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies . there are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals . under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time ( e.g . 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years ) . this is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions , before they were planted in the ground . this behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas . flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone `` gibberellin '' , but this is rarely done commercially .
