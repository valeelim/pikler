Compass and straightedge construction     compass-and-straightedge or ruler-and-compass construction is drawing of lengths , angles or shapes using only a ruler and compass . some things can not be drawn this way . for example , there are only 32 regular polygons with an uneven number of sides which are known to be constructible . it has been proven that a square with the same area as the area of a circle can not be constructed . this is called `` squaring the circle '' .
