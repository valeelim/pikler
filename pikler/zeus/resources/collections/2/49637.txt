Imbolc     imbolc is a festival belonging to brigid , the celtic goddess who , in later times , became famous as a christian saint . at first , her festival on february 1 was known as `` imbolc '' or `` oimelc '' , two gaelic names which refer to the lactation of the ewes . lactation is the flow of milk that happens when the baby lambs are born in the spring , and gaelic languages are those spoken in countries like ireland and scotland . imbolc was , and still is , a time to celebrate that winter would soon be over . sometimes in ireland , the first flowers are coming up at the time of this festival , even when there is still snow on the ground . later , the roman catholic church replaced this festival with candlemas day on february 2 , a day that now belongs to the virgin mary . on this day , people may have ceremonies or processions by candlelight - walking together in the dark , with the only light coming from candles they carry . the may also sing songs to brigid , or say poems or prayers to her . in both pagan and christian celebrations , brigid is celebrated as a powerful female figure , who brings light , inspiration , and healing to the world .
