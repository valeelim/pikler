E-book     an electronic book ( also called an e-book , ebook or digital book ) is a book in digital form . e-books can be read on computers or other electronic devices such as e-book readers . e-book readers , such as the amazon kindle , are devices which are dedicated to showing e-books . the first e-book might have been the index thonisticus , prepared by roberto busa in the late 1940s . however , this is sometimes not not called an ebook because the digital text was ( at least at first ) meant to develop an index and concordance , rather than as a published edition in its own rights . despite the extensive earlier history , it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is michael s. hart . in 1971 , hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the xerox sigma v mainframe at the university of illinois . seeking a worthy use of this resource , he created his first electronic document by typing the united states declaration of independence into a computer . one early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer , the dynabook , in the 1970s at parc : a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading .
