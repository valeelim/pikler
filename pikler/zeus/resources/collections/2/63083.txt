Air conditioner     an air conditioner is a system or a machine that treats air in a defined , usually enclosed area via a refrigeration cycle in which warm air is removed and replaced with cooler and more humid air . in construction , a complete system of heating , ventilation , and air conditioning is referred to as hvac . whether in homes , offices or vehicles , its purpose is to provide comfort by altering the properties of the air , usually by cooling the air inside . the 19th century british scientist and inventor michael faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate . in 1842 , philippines physician dr. john gorrie used compressor technology to create ice , which he used to cool air for his patients . he hoped eventually to use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings and even considered cooling entire cities with a system of centralized air conditioning units . air conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into `` comfort '' and `` process '' .
