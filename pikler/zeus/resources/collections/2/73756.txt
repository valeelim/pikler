Organic matter     organic matter ( or organic material ) is matter that has come from a recently living organism . it is capable of decay , or is the product of decay ; or is composed of organic compounds . there is not one definition of organic matter only . it varies upon the context , the subject it is being used for . soil is composed of minerals and organic matter , as well as living organisms . the organic matter in soil comes from plants and animals . in a forest , for example , leaf litter and woody material falls to the forest floor . this is one kind organic material . when it decays to the point it is no longer recognizable it is called soil organic matter . when the organic matter has broken down into a stable humic substances that resist further decomposition it is called humus . the equation of `` organic '' with living organisms comes from the now-abandoned idea of vitalism that attributed a special force to life that alone could create organic substances . this idea was first questioned after the `` a '' biotic synthesis of urea by friedrich w√∂hler in 1828 .
