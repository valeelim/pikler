Kendo     kendo means the `` way of the sword '' . the rules and gear of kendo were first created in the 18th century and its modern rules and styles date to 19th century . an opponent may be struck at seven places : both sides and top of helmet ( `` men '' ) , on either hand ( gloves , `` kote '' ) or either side of the body breastplate ( `` do '' ) . there is also one legal thrust ( `` tsuki '' ) on throat . the `` men '' can only be struck from face , not from back . however only one of the two hands can be struck , it depends on which kind of posture ( `` kamae '' ) your opponent are using . a struck to the right side of body ( one kind of `` do '' ) will often be ignored by referee because in the old days samurai will have a smaller sword in this position , which gives this position a good protection . very important , because `` tsuki '' is somehow dangerous , junior practicer perform `` tsuki '' is forbidden both in match and daily training . in a match , the attacker must name the location of each strike . often , name these locations by japanese list before ( `` men '' , '' kote '' , '' do '' , '' tsuki '' ) , but some people will name it by korean or chinese or other language , or even a meaningless shout . all these kinds of shout name `` kiai '' . an effective attack must contains `` kiai '' besides other essential factors .
