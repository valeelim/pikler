Subset     a subset is a set which has some ( or all ) of the elements of another set , called superset , but does not have any elements that the superset does not have . a subset which does not have all the elements of its superset is called a proper subset . we use the symbol ⊆ to say a set is a subset of another set . we can also use ⊂ if it is a proper subset . the symbols ⊃ ⊇ are opposite - they tell us the second element is a ( proper ) subset of the first . examples : - { 1,2,3 } is a proper subset of { -563,1,2,3,68 } - the interval [ 0 ; 1 ] is a proper subset of the set of real numbers or the set of positive numbers . - { 46,189,1264 } is its own subset , and it 's a proper subset of the set of natural numbers .
