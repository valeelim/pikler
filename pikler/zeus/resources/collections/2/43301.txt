Allosaurus     allosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur from the jurassic period , a predatory carnivore . `` allosaurus '' averaged 8.5 metres ( 28 ft ) in length , though some remains suggest it could reach over 12 meters ( 39 ft ) . its three-fingered forelimbs were smaller than its large hind legs , and the body was balanced by a long , heavy tail . it weighed 2/3 tons . it is the most common large predator found in the morrison formation of north america . this formation was laid down 155 to 145 million years ago , in the jurassic . `` allosaurus '' was at the top of the food chain . it probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators ( e.g . `` ceratosaurus '' ) . potential prey included ornithopods , stegosaurs , and sauropods . some paleontologists think `` allosaurus '' had cooperative behavior , and hunted in packs . others believe they may have been aggressive toward each other . groups have been found together in the fossil record . this might be evidence of pack behavior , or just the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcass .
