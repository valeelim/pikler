Satellite city     satellite cities are smaller cities that are near to a large city that is the center of a metropolitan area . they are different from suburbs , subdivisions and bedroom communities because they have their own centre . satellite cities could be separate cities outside of the larger metropolitan areas . however , working as part of a metropolis , a satellite city gets `` cross-commuting '' ( people living in the city working outside of the city and people from other places working in the city ) .
