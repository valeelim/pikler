Boomerang     a boomerang is a flying tool that is best known for its ability to return to the thrower . in the past , it was made of wood , but most of the modern boomerangs are made of other materials . most people know that australian aborigines used boomerangs for hunting . but the oldest boomerang was found in a cave in poland and is more than 20,000 ( twenty thousand ) years old . this kind of boomerang does not return to the thrower , but it can fly longer distances and more stably than other things which can be thrown . these days ( returning ) boomerangs are usually used for recreation . most of the boomerangs do not have the classical `` l '' -shape . the modern boomerang is special in that it will return to the one who threw it , if it is thrown correctly . however , some boomerangs do not return because their wings do not have the right profile . most of the boomerangs are made for right-handed use . left-handed people have to use other boomerangs that are mirror-inverted , or have to throw with their right hand .
