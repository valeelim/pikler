1988 Winter Olympics     the 1988 winter olympics , officially known as the xv olympic winter games , were held in calgary , alberta , canada and opened by governor general jeanne sauv√© . the olympics were highly successful financially as they brought in million-dollar profits . the games left a lasting impression on the host city and gave it a new identity from a cowtown to a large commercial sector of the country . 1988 was also the last year that the paralympic games and the winter olympics were held in separate cities ; all subsequent games have been hosted by the same city or a city nearby . as at the 1976 summer olympics in montreal , the canadian team failed to win a gold medal , matching only yugoslavia in the dubious distinction of not having won a winter gold medal on home soil . calgary first tried for the olympics in 1964 , and again in 1968 .
