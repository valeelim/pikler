Logarithmic spiral     a logarithmic spiral , equiangular spiral or growth spiral is a special kind of spiral curve which often appears in nature . the logarithmic spiral was first described by descartes and later extensively investigated by jakob bernoulli , who called it `` spira mirabilis '' , `` the marvelous spiral '' . in polar coordinates ( `` r '' , θ ) the curve can be written as or hence the name `` logarithmic '' . in parametric form , the curve is with real numbers `` a '' and `` b '' . the spiral has the property that the angle ɸ between the tangent and radial line at the point ( `` r '' , θ ) is constant . this property can be expressed in differential geometric terms as the derivative r ' ( θ ) is proportional to the parameter `` b '' . in other words , it controls how `` tightly '' and in which direction the spiral spirals . in the extreme case that `` b '' = 0 ( `` ɸ '' = π/2 ) the spiral becomes a circle of radius `` a '' . conversely , in the limit that `` b '' approaches infinity ( `` ɸ '' → 0 ) the spiral tends toward a straight line . the complement of ɸ is called the `` pitch '' .
