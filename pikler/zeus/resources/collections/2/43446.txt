Minmi     minmi is a genus of small ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the lower cretaceous of australia , about 119 to 113 million years ago . a recent cladistic analysis suggests that `` minmi '' is the most basal known ankylosaur . that does not mean it was the ancestor of the group ; it is far too late for that . it means its body is not specialized , and is relatively unchanged from whatever was the ancestral group . two good specimens of `` minmi '' have been described , including a mostly complete skeleton , and additional fragments may belong to this genus . the dinosaur grew to about 2 m ( 6.5 ft ) long ( holtz ) , or 3 m long and weighed about 300 kilograms ( paul ) . it was roughly 1 m ( 3 ft ) tall to the top of the shoulder . `` minmi '' is classified in the ankylosauria , but is too 'primitive ' ( basal ) to be included in either the ankylosauridae or nodosauridae . as with other ankylosaurians , `` minmi '' was herbivorous unlike most herbivorous dinosaurs , there is direct evidence of the diet of `` minmi '' : gut contents are known from the well-preserved nearly complete specimen . the gut contents consist of fragments of fibrous or vascular plant tissue , fruiting bodies , spherical seeds , and tissue ( possibly from fern sporangia ) . the most common remains are the fibrous or vascular fragments , which have clean cut ends .
