Gamete     a gamete is a specialized sex cell that fuses with another gamete during fertilization ( conception ) in organisms that reproduce sexually . gametes are produced by germ cells . in species which produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes , and in which each individual produces only one type , a female is any individual which produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum ( or egg ) —and a male produces the smaller type—called a spermatozoon ( or sperm cell ) . the name gamete was introduced by the austrian biologist gregor mendel . gametogenesis is the development of diploid germ cells into haploid eggs or sperm , ( respectively oogenesis and spermatogenesis ) . it is different for each species but the general stages are similar . the development of eggs ( oogenesis } and sperm ( spermatogenesis ) have many features in common . they both involve : - meiosis - extensive morphological cell differentiation - unable to survive for very long if fertilization does not occur they also have major differences , especially
