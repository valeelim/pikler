Sawmill     a sawmill is a place where lumber is cut into boards . sawmills today work like sawmills from hundreds of years ago ; a log enters on one end , and pieces of wood of a specific shape and size exit from the other end . - trees are chosen to be harvested . - the tree is chopped so that it falls over ; this is known as `` felling '' . - the tree is cut at both ends so that it is exactly as long as it needs to be ; this is called `` bucking '' . - branches are cut off the trunk . this is known as `` limbing '' . - logs are taken by logging truck , by train , or by a log drive to the sawmill . - logs are measured by a log scaler , either on the way to the mill or when they arrive at the mill . - `` debarking '' removes bark from the logs . - logs are sorted by species , size , and end use ( lumber , plywood , chips ) . this is called `` decking '' . - a sawyer uses a head saw , head rig , or primary saw to break the log into cants ( smaller logs to be worked on some more ) and flitches ( unfinished planks ) . - depending upon the species and quality of the log , the cants will either be further broken down by a resaw or a gang edger into multiple flitches and/or boards
