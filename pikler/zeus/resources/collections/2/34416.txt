Performing music from memory     performing music from memory means knowing a piece of music well enough to be able to play or sing it without the written music . although some people can learn music by ear , most people who are taught to play musical instruments learn new pieces by reading the printed music which is in front of them on a music stand . when someone has learned to play a piece of music well enough to perform it , it is good if they can learn to play it without the printed music . this is called “ playing from memory ” or “ playing by heart ” . when a musician is practising a piece of music so that it can be played from memory this is called memorizing the music . most classical musicians will agree that it is good to play from memory when performing as a soloist . it means that the player understands the music really well , and he is able to concentrate completely on the way he plays the music ( the interpretation ) . in some music competitions the competitors are expected to play from memory . a pianist playing a recital will usually play everything from memory . it is particularly important for singers who are performing songs ( lieder ) to sing without music because they can then communicate directly with the audience using the expression on their faces . some conductors conduct from memory . if they do , they ought to know every single note for every single instrument from memory . there are some conductors who have such amazing memories that they can do this .
