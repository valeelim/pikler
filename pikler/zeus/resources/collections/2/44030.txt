Spinosaurus     spinosaurus ( which means 'spiny lizard ' ) was a huge semi-aquatic dinosaur from the cretaceous , 112 to 93.5 million years ago . it had paddle-like feet and nostrils on top of its crocodile-like head . this would let it submerge as a crocodile does . the same research suggests it was perhaps larger than `` tyrannosaurus rex '' , but more clumsy on land , moving as a quadruped . all these ideas had been suggested before . the discovery of a more complete skeleton made palaeontologists think they were correct . the fossil was found in morocco by a private collector who let scientists examine it . `` spinosaurus '' bones were first discovered in egypt in 1912 by german paleontologist ernst stromer in 1915. two species , `` s. aegyptiacus '' and `` s. marocannus '' , are recognized by many paleontologists , but there may only be one . `` spinosaurus '' looked like `` baryonyx '' except it was larger and more heavily built . six specimens of `` spinosaurus '' have been uncovered . apparently , good material was destroyed in a ww2 bombing raid .
