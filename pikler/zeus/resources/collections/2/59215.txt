Retina     the retina is the thin layer of cells that lines the back of the eyeball in humans and in many animals . it is made mainly of neurons and its role is to sense the light which gets into the eye and send information about it to the brain . most information about light that leaves the retina travels through the optic nerve , and is used by the brain to recognize what you 're seeing . information about light which travels through the `` retino-hypothamalic tract '' is for adjusting circadian rhythms to the 24-hour day . the center of the human retina , called the `` fovea '' , has the most rod cells and cone cells for receiving light . even though the fovea takes up only 1.5 square millimeters , it plays the most important roles in vision . it is only around 1 % of the human retina , but the fovea sends about as much information to the visual cortex as the rest of the retina combined .
