Booing     booing means shouting `` boo ! '' if people shout `` boo '' after a performance ( for example , a concert , play or opera ) they are showing that they did not like it . it is the opposite of applause ( clapping to show that the performance was good ) . booing and hissing used to be very common , especially at the opera . in the early days of opera ( from the 17th to the early 19th century ) opera audiences often behaved badly . they went to the opera to chat with their friends , to cheer their favorite singers and to boo the singers they did not like , not to listen carefully to the music . booing has recently become less common in western culture except at sports events because people think it is rude . audiences today are more likely simply not to clap if they do not like a performance . slow hand-clapping is also a way of showing sarcastic applause . other pages . - applause - claque
