Dipole     dipole can mean two things in physics . the first is an `` electric dipole '' which separates the positive charge from the negative charge . a simple example of this dipole is a pair of electric charges with the same magnitude but with the opposite type of charge ( positive and negative ) and are separated by a small distance from each other . the second is a `` magnetic dipole '' , a closed circulation of electric current . a simple example is a single loop of wire with electric current flowing through it . an important characeristic of dipoles is their dipole moment , which is a vector quantity with both a magnitude and direction . an example of an electric dipole moment occurring is in a pair of electric charges with opposite signs . the dipole moment would point from the negative charge towards the positive charge . the magnitude of the moment is equal to the strength of each charge multiplied by the distance separating between the charges . an example of a magnetic dipole moment occurring is in a wire loop with flowing current . the magnetic dipole moment would point through the loop ( according to the right hand rule ) , with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop .
