High-definition television     high-definition television ( hdtv ) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television . with hdtv , people can watch television in higher quality than old television , giving a more vivid and clear screen . most hdtv systems use digital signals with a 16:9 aspect ratio ( width to height ) . this is different to sdtv ( standard-definition television ) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio . hdtv picture resolution is at least twice that of sdtv , so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or dvd . hdtv can control resolution efficiently . some videos on the website youtube , a free video sharing website that lets people upload and view videos , are in hd . there are different standards . common ones are : - 2560Ã—1440 , progressive scan , requiring about 3,68 megapixels per frame . this is known as 1440p or `` wqhd '' . it is a new standard , which is slowly replacing many 1080p-computer-monitors in the household ( everyday use ) .
