Statistical mechanics     statistical mechanics is the application of probability theory , which includes mathematical tools for dealing with large populations , to the field of mechanics , which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force . it provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life , therefore explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics and mechanics ( classical and quantum ) at the microscopic level . in particular , it can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of bulk materials from the spectroscopic data of individual molecules . this ability to make macroscopic predictions based on microscopic properties is the main asset of statistical mechanics over thermodynamics . both theories are governed by the second law of thermodynamics through the medium of entropy . however , entropy in thermodynamics can only be known empirically , whereas in statistical mechanics , it is a function of the distribution of the system on its micro-states .
