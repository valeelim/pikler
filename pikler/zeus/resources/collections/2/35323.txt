Rubella     rubella ( also known as german measles ) is a disease caused by the rubella virus . it is often mild and an attack can pass unnoticed . however , this can make the virus very difficult to diagnose . the disease can last 1â€“5 days . children recover more quickly than adults . the virus usually enters the body through the nose or throat . like most viruses living along the respiratory tract , it is passed from person to person by tiny droplets in the air that are breathed out . rubella can also be transmitted from a mother to her developing baby ( fetus ) through the placenta . this can be very dangerous to the fetus , especially if the mother gets rubella early on in her pregnancy . rubella can cause deafness , heart problems , intellectual disability , and many other problems in developing fetuses . the virus has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks during which it becomes established . common symptoms are a red/pink rash , swollen lymph nodes , and a high fever . the disease is named `` german measles '' because it has a similar red rash to measles and was first described in detail by german doctors .
