Audio engineer     an audio engineer ( or simply engineer for short ) is a person who operates , and usually chooses and sets up recording equipment . the term applies mainly to a person who works in a recording studio but can also apply to people who do the same kind of work , in other places . an engineer may work with multitrack recordings or stereophonic remixes . audio engineering deals with the recording and reproduction of sound through mechanical and electronic means and is a part of audio science . the field draws on many disciplines , including electrical engineering , acoustics , and music . an audio engineer is closer to the creative and technical aspects of audio than an acoustical engineer . some amateur ( and a few professional ) engineers are self-taught , and learn mostly by doing , or with the help of an instruction manual . many engineers started in other studio jobs ( such as running errands ) , and learned about recording as they became familiar with the studio where they worked . an engineer learns about the use and placement of microphones , how to operate and maintain an audio mixer , recording deck , sound effects , and other machines , and how to switch between live and recorded sounds , to make the best , and often the most unique , recording possible . a good engineer will strive to make recordings that are both of high technical quality , and also pleasing to hear .
