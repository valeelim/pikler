Beetle     beetles , the order coleoptera , are the largest group of insects . there are 350,000 different species of beetles which have been named : about 40 % of all known insects . there are an estimated 800,000 to a million living species . beetles live almost everywhere , though not in the ocean or in places that are very cold , such as antarctica . beetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history . the evolution of flowering plants helped drive the diversification of beetles . four of the six biggest families of beetles mainly eat flowering plants . in common with other insects , there are three main parts to a beetle 's body : the head , the thorax ( the middle part ) , and the abdomen ( the back part ) . on the head , beetles have antennae ( feelers ) , eyes , and a mouth . the legs and wings of the beetle are attached to the thorax . the abdomen of a beetle does not usually have special parts on the outside , but it has the beetle â€™ s gut inside . like other insects , beetles have no internal bones , but instead have a hard exoskeleton on the outside of the body . the exoskeleton is made of hard plates of chitin .
