Cork oak     the cork oak ( `` quercus suber '' ) is a medium-sized , evergreen oak tree . it grows southwest europe and northwest africa . it grows to up to 20 m , but in its native environment it is usually not that tall . the leaves are 4–7 cm long , dark green above , paler beneath , with the leaf margins often downcurved . the acorns are 2–3 cm long . the tree forms a thick , corky bark . over time this bark can develop considerable thickness and this is harvested every 10–12 years as cork . the harvesting of cork does not harm the tree and a new layer of cork regrows , making it a renewable resource . the tree is widely cultivated in spain , portugal , algeria , morocco , france , italy and tunisia . cork oak forests cover approximately 2.5 million hectares in those countries . portugal accounts for 50 % of the world cork harvest . cork oaks can not legally be cut down in portugal , except for forest management felling of old , unproductive trees . cork oaks live about 150–250 years . virgin cork ( or 'male ' cork ) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees . another 10–12 years is required for the second harvest , and a tree can be harvested a dozen times in its lifetime . cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery .
