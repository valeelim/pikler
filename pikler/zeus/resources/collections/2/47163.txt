Etruscan civilization     the etruscan civilization lasted from about 800 bc to 100 bc . it was a culture in ancient italy . the romans called them etrusci or tusci . the ancient greeks called them tyrrhenoi or tyrrsenoi . the etruscans called themselves rasenna . the etruscan civilization began in pre-history . when it was most powerful , it had three confederacies ( areas like modern states ) . these three confederacies were etruria , latinum and the po valley , and campania . the etruscans ruled rome until 396 bc . we do not know much about the etruscan language . they did have writing , but not much survives . most of what we have comes from engraving on tombstones . they used an alphabet rather like those of phoenicia and greece . their language is related to the tyrrhenian language family and is not clearly related to other languages . some etruscan letters were used by the romans in the latin alphabet , which english uses . some romans , such as cicero , were fluent readers of etruscan , but few of the writings survive .
