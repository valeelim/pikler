Short Parliament     the short parliament in english history lasted from april 13 to may 5 1640. it is called `` short '' because it only lasted for three weeks . charles i of england , who was also king of scotland , was having problems with the church of scotland and war with them was breaking out again . charles had spent the last 11 years ruling directly , without calling a parliament even once . he did this because he had little use for elected representatives trying to decide policy . but now with the problems with the scots , charles needed money to pay for his war . to get more money for war meant he had to call a parliament so they could vote on it . the problem was that the members of parliament were unhappy about the things he had done since 1629 , when he was ruling without them . they wanted to talk about these things instead of giving the king his money . john pym , member for tavistock , gave fiery speeches refusing to give money unless the abuses were talked about . charles responded by closing the parliament and sending them home again , and he tried to fight the scots without the money . but when this did not work and as a result of his defeat had to agree to pay the scots , he was forced to call parliament again . this became known as the long parliament , and the constitutional crisis that followed led to the bloody english civil war .
