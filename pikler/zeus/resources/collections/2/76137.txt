Toki Pona     toki pona ( in toki pona it means `` good language '' or `` simple language '' ) is a constructed ( made-up ) language . sonja lang ( in past time `` sonja elen kisa '' ) , canadian translator and linguist , made the language . it is based on simple ideas that are known to all cultures . it is not created to be an international auxiliary language ( a language for communication between people speaking different languages ) . it is meant to test ideas about minimalism and pidgins . it is influenced by taoist ideas . it has only 120 root words , although there is over 50,000 different possible combinations . toki pona relies very heavily on expressing ideas by combining root words . for example , `` jan pona '' means `` friend '' in toki pona ( literally it means : `` good person '' ) . normally toki pona uses the latin alphabet , but many toki pona speakers create other systems of writing for this language . there are some attempts to create a writing system based on pictograms , but they have not been very successful . lord 's prayer ( translated by pije/jopi ) :
