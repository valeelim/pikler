Factorial     n factorial ( written n ! ) is the number we get when we multiply every number from 1 to `` n '' . if `` n '' is 0 , n factorial is 1 . `` n '' ! is not defined for negative numbers . however , the related gamma function is defined over the real and complex numbers ( but the integers it is defined over are positive ) . it is used to find out how many possible ways there are to arrange n objects . for example , if there are 3 letters ( a , b , and c ) , they can be arranged as abc , acb , bac , bca , cab , and cba . that 's 6 choices because a can be put in 3 different places , b has 2 choices left after a is placed , and c has only one choice left after a and b have been placed . that is 3×2×1 = 6 choices . more generally , if there are three objects , and we want to find out how many different ways there are to arrange ( or select them ) , for the first object , there are 3 choices , for the second object , there are only two choices left as the first object has already been chosen , and finally , for the third object , there is only one position left .
