Cytosine     cytosine is one of the 5 main nucleobases used in storing and transporting genetic information within a cell in the nucleic acids dna and rna . in dna and rna , cytosine is paired with guanine . however , it is unstable , and can change into uracil ( spontaneous deamination ) . this can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the dna repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase , which cleaves a uracil in dna . other websites . - computational chemistry wiki
