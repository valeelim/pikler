Dimetrodon     dimetrodon was a pelycosaur ( early synapsida ) from the first part of the permian period ( about 295â€“272 million years ago ) . `` dimetrodon '' walked on four legs and had a tall , curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws . most fossils have been found in the southwestern united states , from red beds in texas and oklahoma . the largest known species of `` dimetrodon '' is `` d. angelensis '' at and the smallest is `` d. teutonis '' at . `` dimetrodon '' was a carnivore , probably the top predator in its environment . its main feature is the large sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending upwards from the vertebrae . the spines would be joined by skin . the general opinion of palaeontologists is that it was a temperature-regulating device . the idea is that the animal could warm up in the early morning by placing itself broadside to the sun , and later could cool off in the shade , or arrange for its body to get less sunlight . at this stage in evolution , no land animals were homoiotherms . very likely the sail was also used for sexual or territorial signalling . in which case , the skin would be coloured . this , of course , is supposition , but it does make sense of the animal 's most extraordinary feature .
