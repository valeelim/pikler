Pun     a pun is a joke which is a “ play on words ” ( a game using words ) . people make puns in order to make other people laugh . many jokes are actually puns . a pun usually uses a word which can have more than one meaning , even if the spelling is different : sometimes a pun may use a whole phrase that can be heard in more than one way , as in the following knock-knock joke : - “ knock-knock ! ” - “ who ’ s there ? ” - “ dishwasher. ” - “ dishwasher who ? ” - “ dishwasher way i ushed to shpeak before i got my falsh teesh ” . ( the last sentence is supposed to mean : “ this was the way i used to speak before i got my false teeth ” ) . there is a joke about a man who sent ten different puns to friends in the hope that at least one of the puns would make them laugh . unfortunately , no pun in ten did . ( the joke here is on “ no pun intended , ” which is said when a person unintentionally says a pun by coincidence , and announces the find ) . there are many websites and books which have jokes , very often with puns . puns are easier to make in some languages than others . languages with many homophones ( words which sound the same but have a different meaning ) such as the chinese language are most suitable for puns .
