Stomata     in botany , a stoma ( also `` stomate '' ; plural stomata ) is a tiny opening or pore that is used for gas exchange . they are mostly found on the under-surface of plant leaves . in a stoma , there is the chloroplast , a cell wall , a vacuole and a cell nucleus . air enters the plant through these openings . the carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis . some of the oxygen produced is used in respiration . surplus oxygen exits through these same openings . also , water vapor goes into the atmosphere through these pores in transpiration . the pore is formed by a pair of cells known as guard cells . these adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing . to open a guard cell , protons ( hydrogen ions , h ) are pumped into the guard cells . water enters them , the cells get hard , and they push open .
