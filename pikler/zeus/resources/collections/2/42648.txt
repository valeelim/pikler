Depleted uranium     depleted uranium is what is left over after uranium is enriched . enriched uranium can be used in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons . depleted uranium is made up mostly of the isotope uranium-238 . uranium-238 is mildly radioactive . it is very dense , or heavy for its size . because of this , depleted uranium is used in armor piercing bullets and heavy machine guns . its high density allows weapons to put more energy into a fired bullet which causes more damage to its targets . bullets made from it will burn when they hit something hard , and their smoke is dangerous to breathe . depleted uranium has long been thought to be useless for producing nuclear energy , but a new kind of `` traveling wave reactor '' has been proposed to use it .
