Improper rotation     an improper rotation can be understood as an inversion followed by a proper rotation . equivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a point on the axis . therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion . a simple example of an improper rotation in 3d ( but not in 2d ) is a coordinate inversion : x goes to −x , y to −y and z to −z . under this transformation , a and b go to −a and −b ( by the definition of a vector ) , but p clearly does not change . ( it follows that any improper rotation multiplies p by −1 compared to the rotation 's effect on a true vector . )
