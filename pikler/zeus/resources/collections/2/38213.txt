Domestic sheep     a domestic sheep ( `` ovis aries '' ) is a domesticated mammal related to wild sheep and goats . it is a type of cattle , and is owned and looked after by a sheep farmer . female sheep are called `` ewes '' . male sheep are called `` rams '' . young sheep are called `` lambs '' . they are kept for their wool and their meat . the wool of sheep , after cleaning and treating , is used to make woollen clothes . the meat of young sheep is called `` lamb '' , and the meat from adult sheep is called `` mutton '' . both are economically important products which have been used since prehistoric times . sheep are domesticated animals which have been bred by man . there are breeds which specialise in wool or meat . the plural of `` sheep '' is just `` sheep '' . a group of sheep is called a flock . sheep follow each other in basically the same way all the time , so there are special names for the different roles sheep play in a flock . the sheep that is farthest away from the others is called the outlier , a word that is also used in statistics . this sheep is willing to go out farther away from the safety of the flock to graze , but takes a chance that a predator like a wolf will attack it first , because it is alone . another sheep , the bellwether , which never goes first but always follows an outlier , is the one that signals to the others that it is safe to go that way . when it moves , the others will also move . tendency to be outliers or to be bellwethers , or stick in the middle of the flock , seems to stay with a sheep its whole life . there might be genes that make them repeat this role behaviour .
