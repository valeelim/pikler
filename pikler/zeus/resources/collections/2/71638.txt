Flag of Dominican Republic     the dominican constitution says that the flag of the dominican republic has a white cross in the centre ; the arms of the cross get to the sides of the flag and divides the flag into four rectangles â€”the left rectangles are blue ( top ) and red ( bottom ) , and the right ones are red ( top ) and blue ( bottom ) . the width of the white cross is half the height of one of the rectangles . the national flag , like the state and war flags of other latin american countries , has a small coat of arms in the centre of the white cross but there is not a coat of arms in the ensign ( the flag used by commercial ships ) . the dominican flag was created the first day of independence ( 27 february 1844 ) ; it was created from the haitian flag but with a white cross ; that is , two blue rectangles on the top and two red rectangles on the bottom . the colors are from the french flag . that was the `` first national flag '' . the first dominican constitution of 6 november 1844 did not say anything about the distribution of the rectangles but from the start the flag was represented with alternation of the colors ( that is , blue and red on top and red and blue on bottom ) ; this is the `` second national flag '' . only the constitution of 1908 is specific about the color distribution .
