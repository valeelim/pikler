Bishop (chess)    bishop ( chess ) a bishop ( ) is a piece in the board game of chess . each player starts the game with two bishops . one starts between the king 's knight and the king , the other between the queen 's knight and the queen . the pieces are called either the `` king 's bishop '' or the `` queen 's bishop '' . in chess notation the starting squares are c1 and f1 for white 's bishops , and c8 and f8 for black 's bishops . the bishop first appeared in that form in medieval european chess . in chaturanga he was represented as an armed attendant who sat on the back of an elephant . the arabs called this figure `` al-fil '' , which means `` elephant '' . the problem was that in central europe elephants were not known , so they could not recognize the figure . the bishops were interpreted differently by the different nations . that is why the bishop is a `` l√§ufer '' ( runner ) in germany , a `` fou '' ( fool ) in france and a `` alfiere '' ( standard-bearer ) in italy . the bishop moves diagonally , and can move as far as a player wants it to unless another piece blocks it . a bishop can never leave the color of square that it starts on , and so can only move to 32 squares of the board .
