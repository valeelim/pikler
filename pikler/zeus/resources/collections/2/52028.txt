Coulomb     the coulomb ( sometimes written c ) the si unit of electric charge . it is named after charles-augustin de coulomb . a coulomb is a quantity of electric charge . the movement of electric charge is called current in an electric circuit . for example , a flashlight bulb that has a current of one ampere will pass one coulomb of charge every second . so in ten seconds , ten coulombs have passed through the light bulb . in an electric wire the charge that moves is in a particle called the electron . each electron has a very small electric charge of negative one elementary charge . the elementary charge is the smallest electric charge found in a stable particle . a coulomb is equal to 6,241,509,629,152,650,000 elementary charges . the coulomb was named in honor of charles-augustin de coulomb who worked on understanding electric charge in the late 1700s . technical definition : 1 coulomb is the amount of electric charge carried by a current of 1 ampere flowing for 1 second .
