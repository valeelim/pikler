Base (chemistry)    base ( chemistry ) a base is a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion ( h+ ) from another substance . a chemical can accept a proton if it has a negative charge , or if the molecule has an electronegative atom like oxygen , nitrogen , or chlorine that is rich in electrons . like acids , some bases are strong and others are weak . the weak bases are less likely to accept protons , while the strong bases quickly take protons in solution or from other molecules . an acid is a base 's `` chemical opposite '' . an acid is a substance that will donate a hydrogen atom to the base . bases have a ph greater than 7.0. weak bases generally have a ph value of 79 while strong bases have a ph value of 9â€“14 . bases can be used to neutralize acids . when a base , often oh , accepts a proton from an acid , it forms a water molecule which is harmless . when all of the acids and bases react to form water molecules and other neutral salts , it is called neutralization . acids can also be used to neutralize bases . every base has a conjugate acid formed by adding a hydrogen atom to the base . for example , nh ( ammonia ) is a base and its conjugate acid is the ammonium ion , nh . a weak base forms a strong conjugate acid and a strong base forms a weaker conjugate acid . since ammonia is a moderately strong base , ammonium is a considerably weaker acid .
