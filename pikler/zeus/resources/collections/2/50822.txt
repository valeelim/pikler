Signal (electrical engineering)    signal ( electrical engineering ) in the fields of communications , signal processing , and in electrical engineering more generally , a signal is any time-varying quantity . the concept is broad , and hard to define precisely . definitions specific to subfields are common . for example , in information theory , a `` signal '' is a codified message , i.e. , the sequence of states in a communications channel that encodes a message . in a `` communications system '' , a `` transmitter '' encodes a `` message '' into a signal , which is carried to a `` receiver '' by the communications `` channel '' . for example , the words `` mary had a little lamb '' might be the message spoken into a telephone . the telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical voltage signal . the signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires ; and at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds . examples of signals . - `` motion '' . the motion of a particle through some space can be considered to be a signal , or can be represented by a signal . the domain of a motion signal is one-dimensional ( time ) , and the range is generally three-dimensional . position is thus a 3-vector signal ; position and orientation is a 6-vector signal .
