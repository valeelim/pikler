Opera buffa     opera buffa is an italian term meaning “ comic opera ” . it is mainly used for 18th century italian comic operas . opera buffa contrasts with opera seria ( “ serious opera ” ) in which the story was a tragedy . opera seria was supposed to be “ serious ” , while opera buffa was an entertaining musical comedy . like the opera seria , everything was sung , there was no spoken dialogue . this was different from comic opera in other countries . the story in opera buffa is told in recitative and then there were arias for the characters to show their feelings and show off their voices . although we use the term “ opera buffa ” today , in the 18th century they called such operas by other names , e.g . “ commedia in musica ” , “ dramma giocosa ” , “ operetta ” , “ burlesca ” etc . an opera buffa was usually a full length work : one which would fill a whole evening ’ s entertainment . it was different from an “ intermezzo ” or “ farsa ” which was a short musical comedy that was performed during the intervals of a musical tragedy , although the difference between the two is not always obvious . the intermezzo became longer and longer during the 18th century and gradually developed into opera buffa . pergolesi ’ s `` la serva padrone '' was an intermezzo which became very famous after pergolesi ’ s death . it influenced opera buffa .
