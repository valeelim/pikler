Endoskeleton     an endoskeleton is a structure that holds an animal from inside . one can find endoskeletons in three phyla and one subclass of animals : in chordata , echinodermata , porifera and coleoidea . an endoskeleton allows the body to move and gives the body structure and shape . a true endoskeleton develops from mesodermal tissue . such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates . the coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense ; here , a mollusc exoskeleton developed into several sorts of internal structure , the `` cuttlebone '' of cuttlefish being the best-known version . an important advantage of an endoskeleton over an exoskeleton is that the endoskeleton provides more structural support .
