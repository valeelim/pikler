'' - ( from 2004 ) : `` moving from the position of united states poet laureate to new york state poet laureate might seem like a demotion or a drop in rank to the military-minded . it might even appear that i am heading toward eventually being crowned laureate of my zip code . but in fact , it is very gratifying to be honored again as a representative of poetry , this time by my native state where i grew up — more or less — and continue to live .
