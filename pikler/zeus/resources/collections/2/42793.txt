Thallium     thallium is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol tl . it has the atomic number 81. its standard atomic weight is 204.4. it is found in group 13 of the periodic table . thallium is a gray metal that is very toxic . thallium is a soft , malleable , grayish post-transition metal . it can be cut with a knife at room temperature . it melts at a low temperature , 304Â°c . this is typical of a post-transition metal . thallium has 25 isotopes and two stable ( nonradioactive ) ones . it is extremely toxic . thallium is a moderately reactive metal . it corrodes easily in air with a blue-gray color that is similar to lead . if it is kept in air for a long time , a large amount of thallium ( i ) oxide will build up . it corrodes in the presence of water to make the hydroxide . it burns with a greenish flame . it reacts with most acids . thallium makes chemical compounds in two oxidation states : +1 and +3 . the +1 state is more common and less reactive . its chemical compounds are very similar to potassium or silver compounds . it makes a hydroxide that in a strong base when dissolved in water . most other transition metal and post-trnansition metal hydroxides do not dissolve in water . this reacts with carbon dioxide to make thallium ( i ) carbonate , which is also water-soluble and very heavy . it is the only heavy metal carbonate that can dissolve in water . other compounds are similar to silver compounds . thallium ( i ) bromide turns yellow when exposed to light , similar to silver ( i ) bromide . thallium ( i ) sulfide is black , similar to silver ( i ) sulfide . the +3 state compounds are oxidizing agents . the black oxide , thallium ( iii ) oxide and the hydroxide , thallium ( iii ) hydroxide , are the only stable +3 compounds . they break down to oxygen and thallium ( i ) oxide when heated . thallium and its compounds are rare because they are toxic and polluting .
