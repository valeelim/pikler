Glycolysis     glycolysis is a metabolic process in most organisms . it is the first stage in cellular respiration . it allows both aerobic and anaerobic respiration . glycolysis releases only a small amount of energy . glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway . it occurs , with variations , in nearly all organisms , both aerobic and anaerobic . the wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways . glycolysis has ten intermediate compounds , catalysed by ten different enzymes . only the broad outline is described here . the second half of glycolysis is known as the 'pay-off phase ' , by the net gain of the energy-rich molecules atp and nadh . since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase , each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule . this yields 2 nadh molecules and 4 atp molecules , leading to a net gain of 2 nadh molecules and 2 atp molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose molecule .
