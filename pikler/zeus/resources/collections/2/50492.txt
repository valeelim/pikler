Caesar cipher     the caesar cipher is a method of cryptography . it is named after julius caesar who used it to communicate with his army . to encrypt a message with a caesar cipher , each letter in the message is changed using a simple rule : shift by three . each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in the alphabet . a becomes d , b becomes e , and so on . for the last letters , we can think of the alphabet as a circle and `` wrap around '' . w becomes z , x becomes a , y becomes b , and z becomes c. to change a message back , each letter is replaced by the one three before it . however it is very easy to break a caesar cipher using microsoft excel . using a more difficult or complicated encryption would be better . changing by three is the rule that julius caesar used , but the same idea works for any number . rot13 is a modern version and even easier to break . the caesar cipher is a `` substitution cipher '' : each letter is replaced by another . no substitution cipher is really safe .
