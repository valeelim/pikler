Orchestra pit     an orchestra pit is the space where an orchestra plays in a theatre or opera house . the actors or singers are on the stage , and the orchestra pit is normally lower than the stage so that the audience can watch the play or opera . depending on where they sit , the audience may just be able to see the heads of the musicians in the orchestra pit . it is important that singers can see the conductor so that they can watch the beat out of the corner of their eye . opera houses nowadays often have close-circuit television monitors at the sides so that singers can watch the conductor even when they are not facing him . the orchestra pit in the bayreuth festspielhaus is unusual . this opera house was designed by the composer richard wagner for the performance of his own operas . he did not want the audience to be able to see the orchestra at all , so it is very low . the orchestra members do not have to dress up in ties and jackets because they can not be seen anyway .
