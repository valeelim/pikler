Interregnum     an interregnum is a period between monarchs , between popes of the roman catholic church , emperors of holy roman empire , polish kings ( elective monarchy ) or between consuls of the roman republic . it can also refer any gap in the continuity of a government , organization , or social order . the period of interregnum may be peaceful , or it may collapse into chaos and anarchy . in some monarchies , such as the united kingdom , an `` interregnum '' is usually avoided due to a rule described as `` the king is dead , long live the king '' , i.e . the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor 's death or abdication . this famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty . this is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch 's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event . an `` interregnum '' occurs also upon the death of the roman catholic pope , though this is generally known as a `` sede vacante '' ( vacant seat ) . the interregnum ends immediately upon election of the new pope by the college of cardinals .
