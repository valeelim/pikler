Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia     grand duchess anastasia nikolaevna of russia ( , , â€“ 17 july 1918 ) was the youngest daughter of tsar nicholas ii of russia and his wife alexandra fyodorovna . anastasia was murdered with her family on 17 july 1918 by the bolshevik secret police . she was a sister of grand duchess olga , grand duchess tatiana , grand duchess maria , and alexei nikolaevich , tsarevich of russia . during the years of communist rule nobody knew where she was buried . this led to many stories that she could have escaped and still be alive . the bodies of the tsar , tsarina , and three daughters were found in a grave near yekaterinburg in 1991 ; however , the bodies of alexei nikolaevich and one of his sisters ( either anastasia or maria ) were not there . in january 2008 , russian scientists said that the remains of a young boy and woman found near yekaterinburg in august 2007 might be the missing bodies . on 30 april 2008 , russian scientists used dna testing to prove that they were the tsarevich alexei and his sister . in march 2009 , the last results of the dna testing were published by dr. michael coble of the us armed forces dna identification laboratory . this proved that all four grand duchesses were murdered .
