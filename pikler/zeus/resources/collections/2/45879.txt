Flowering plant     flowering plants ( also called angiosperms or magnoliophyta ) are the dominant land plants today . together with the gymnosperms they make up the seed plants . they are different from the gymnosperms because angiosperms bear flowers , and have enclosed ovules . gymnosperms bear naked seeds on cones or open structures . angiosperms have a number of derived characters , which evolved as they split off from the gymnosperms . - flowers flowers , the reproductive organs of flowering plants , are the most remarkable feature distinguishing them from other seed plants . flowers , with their colour and their nectar , act to attract pollinators , which are mostly insects and birds . whereas gymnosperms are almost entirely wind-pollinated , early flowers were probably all insect-pollinated . some present-day flowering plants are wind-pollinated , but that is a secondary feature . - fruits the fertilized angiosperm ovule develops into a seed , and the ovary develops into the fruit . the fruit is often a way to use animals to spread the seeds far and wide . the fruit is made out of the carpel and some tissue round it . the carpel hold inside itself the ovules .
