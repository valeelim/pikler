Mjolnir     in norse mythology , mjolnir is the war hammer of thor , the god of lightning , thunder , wind , rain , and oak trees . mjolnir is the most feared weapon of the norse gods . it was believed to be able to knock down giants and entire mountains with only one hit . there are different stories about where the war hammer came from . one theory is that odin had the weapon made in the heart of a supernova when thor was born . other stories say that it fell to earth like a meteorite . because of this , many norse followers believed that lightning strikes were a sign of mjolnir on earth . mjolnir was the symbol of regeneration . it was not just about destruction . when thrown , thor 's hammer would return to his hand after hitting its target . it is said that mjolnir was used by thor to slay jörmungandr during ragnarök . `` ... he ( thor ) would be able to strike as firmly as he wanted , whatever his aim , and the hammer would never fail , and if he threw it at something , it would never miss and never fly so far from his hand that it would not find its way back , and when he wanted , it would be so small that it could be carried inside his tunic .
