Taxon     a taxon ( plural taxa ) is a taxonomic group or taxonomic unit . it is a group of organisms which a taxonomist decides belong together in biological classification . taxa can be big or small , a fairly small taxon is the giraffes , a very big one is the beetles . a taxonomist can assign a scientific name and rank to a taxon ; this places it at a particular level in a hierarchy . it is not strictly necessary to assign either a name or a rank to a taxon , but doing so makes it much easier to refer to the taxon . however , many taxa have to wait for years before getting a name . there is no limit to the number of ranks that may exist , but the most important ranks are , in hierarchical order : note : `` phylum '' applies formally to any biologial domain but traditionally it was always used of animals whereas `` division '' was traditionally often used of plants , fungi etc . a simple phrase to remember the order is `` dignified kings play chess on fine green silk '' ( there are many other such phrases ) . a distinction is made between taxonomy and systematics . systematics deals with how groups relate to each other . taxonomy deals with making groups ( taxa ) , deciding what belongs together . taxonomy is also known as classification .
