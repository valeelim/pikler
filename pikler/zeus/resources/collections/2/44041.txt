Rhamphorhynchus     rhamphorhynchus is a genus of long-tailed pterosaurs in the upper jurassic . it is the best-known of the long-tailed pterosaurs , the sub-order rhamphorynchoidea . `` rhamphorhynchus '' had a long tail , stiffened with ligaments , which ended in a small diamond-shaped rudder on the end of its tail which helped keep it stable when it was flying . the jaws of `` rhamphorhynchus '' housed needle-like teeth , which were angled forward , with a curved , sharp , beak-like tip lacking teeth . their diet was mainly fish and insects . like other pterosaurs , its body was covered with hairs , which suggests it had termperature regulation ( 'hot-blooded ' ) and a high rate of metabolism . this is also found in birds and bats , and seems necessary for active flight . the genus was quite successful : it is the most common pterosaur found in the solnhofen limestone beds in bavaria , germany . these are the same strata where `` archaeopteryx '' was found . this early group flourished from the upper triassic to the end of the jurassic . when we first see them in the fossil record they have developed three families , so biologists know their early evolution is not yet revealed . these three families are represented by the three genera `` rhamphorhynchus '' , `` dimorphodon '' and `` eudimorphodon '' . this sub-order was the earliest kind or pterosaur , which were succeeded by the more 'derived ' short-tailed pterosaurs , the pterodactyloids , such as `` pterodactylus '' . in the upper jurassic both the two sub-orders were extant ( living ) .
