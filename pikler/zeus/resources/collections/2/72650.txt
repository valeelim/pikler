ROT13     rot13 ( or rot-13 ) is a very simple form of encryption cipher . it is a variant of a caesar cipher . in it , the alphabet is written in two lines , of 13 characters each . encryption , and decryption is done by simply switching the letters that are below each other . that way , `` a '' becomes `` n '' , `` b '' becomes `` o '' , and so on . it is widely used in usenet forums . rot13 can also be used for letter games . there are some words , that will produce another existing word , when they are treated with rot13 . the longest example in the english language is the pair of 7-letter words abjurer and nowhere ; there is also the 7-letter pair chechen and purpura . other examples of words like these are shown in the table . the 1989 international obfuscated c code contest ( ioccc ) had an entry by brian westley . westley 's computer program can be rot13 'd or reversed and still compiles correctly . its operation , when executed , is either to perform rot13 encoding on , or to reverse its input . the newsgroup `` alt.folklore.urban '' made a wordâ€”furrfu . it was the rot13 encoding of the frequently encoded utterance `` sheesh '' . `` furrfu '' evolved in mid-1992 as a response to postings repeating urban myths on alt.folklore.urban , after some posters complained that `` sheesh ! '' as a response to newcomers was being overused .
