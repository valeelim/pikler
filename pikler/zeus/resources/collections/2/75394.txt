Bartolomeo Tromboncino     bartolomeo tromboncino ( born verona around 1470 ; died in or near venice in 1535 or later ) was an italian composer . he lived in the renaissance period . he is famous as a composer of songs called `` frottole '' . he is also remembered because he murdered his wife . we know very little about his life . he probably grew up in mantua . in a letter he says that he came from verona . until around 1500 he lived and worked in mantua , but sometimes he went to other towns when he was in trouble . in 1499 he found his wife with another man , so he murdered her . he may also have murdered the other man . we can not be sure about this . he does not seem to have been punished . this may be because a rich lady called isabella d'este liked him . from 1502 tromboncino was employed by a rich lady called lucrezia borgia . she is remembered today because she was a very bad woman . he wrote music for the court and for her wedding to alfonso d'este . sometime before 1521 he moved to venice , where he probably spent the rest of his life .
