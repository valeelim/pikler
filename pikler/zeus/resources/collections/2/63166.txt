Thermal physics     thermal physics is the combined study of thermodynamics , statistical mechanics , and kinetic theory . this umbrella-subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat-related subjects . other authors , however , define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . thermal physics , generally speaking , is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective . starting with the basics of heat and temperature , thermal physics analyzes the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics from the statistical perspective , in terms of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate . in addition , the concept of entropy is studied via quantum theory . a central topic in thermal physics is the canonical probability distribution . the electromagnetic nature of photons and phonons are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common . waves form a basis for both , provided one incorporates quantum theory .
