Railway signal     a railway signal or just signal is a mechanical or electrical machine that gives train drivers or engineers information about the line ahead . this way , they know whether the train must stop or may continue . it can also tell what speed the train may go . in britain , modern signalling uses a system similar to road traffic lights . the signals are coloured lights mounted on a pole . a red signal means 'do not go further ' . a yellow signal gives a warning to the driver that the next signal is showing a red . some signals can show two yellow lights , known as a `` double yellow '' and are warnings to the driver that the next signal is showing a yellow . a green signal means 'you can continue ' . on older lines semaphore signals are still used . these are poles with a coloured bar at the top , which can be moved so that it is either horizontal , or at an angle . when a red bar is horizontal this means that the train must stop , and when it is pointing diagonally up or down it means that it 's safe for the driver to continue . there are also signals with yellow bars which give warnings in the same way as yellow lights on newer signals .
