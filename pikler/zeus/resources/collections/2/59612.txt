Antiparticle     there is an antiparticle corresponding to most kinds of particle . it has the same mass and opposite electric charge . even electrically neutral particles , such as the neutron , are not identical to their antiparticle . in the example of the neutron , the 'ordinary ' particle is made out of quarks and the antiparticle out of antiquarks . particle-antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other if they are in appropriate quantum states . they can also be produced in various processes . these processes are used in particle accelerators to create new particles and to test theories of particle physics . high energy processes in nature can create antiparticles . these are visible in cosmic rays and in certain nuclear reactions . the word antimatter properly refers to ( elementary ) antiparticles , composite antiparticles made with them ( such as antihydrogen ) and to larger assemblies of either . in 1932 , soon after the prediction of positrons by paul dirac , carl anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber a particle detector in which moving electrons ( or positrons ) leave behind trails as they move through the gas .
