Heat engine     in engineering and thermodynamics , a heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical work by using the temperature difference between a hot `` source '' and a cold `` sink '' . heat is transferred from the source , through the `` working body '' of the engine , to the `` sink '' , and in this process some of the heat changes into work by using the qualities of the gas or liquid inside the engine . there are many kinds of heat engines . each has a thermodynamic cycle . heat engines are often named after the thermodynamic cycle they use , like the carnot cycle . they often pick up everyday names , such as gasoline/petrol , turbine , or steam engines . some heat engines may generate heat inside the engine itself . others may absorb heat from an external source . heat engines can be open to the air or sealed and closed off to the outside ( this is called an open or closed cycle ) . when scientists study heat engines they come up with ideas for engines that can not actually be built . these are called ideal engines or cycles . real heat engines are often confused with the ideal engines or cycles they attempt to mimic .
