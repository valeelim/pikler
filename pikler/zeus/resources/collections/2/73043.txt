Translation (genetics)    translation ( genetics ) translation is the second part of protein biosynthesis ( the making of proteins ) . it is part of the process of gene expression . before translation comes : 1. transcription , which produces a chain of introns and exons . 1. rna splicing by spliceosomes which remove introns , and 1. formulation of the messenger rna from exons . in eukaryotes , translation happens on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum . in bacteria , translation happens in the cell cytoplasm : they have no nucleus . ribosomes are made of a small part and a large part which surround the mrna ( messenger rna ) . in translation , mrna has the base sequence to make a specific polypeptide . this sequence is originally specified by the dna , and copied by the mrna . the polypeptide can be a whole protein . or , it can be just a part , waiting to be combined with other polypeptides so it can make a whole protein . the polypeptide also has to be folded before it works as a protein . amino acids are carried by specific trnas with anticodons to connect with mrna 's matching codons . each trna has its own anticodon and carries an amino acid . an anticodon is always together with the same amino acid .
