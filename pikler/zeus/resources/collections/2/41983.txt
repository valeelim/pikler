Caliph     in arabic , caliph means `` a successor to the prophet '' . this is what leaders of the islamic faith came to be called . their rule is called a caliphate . some of the early leaders of the muslim community following muhammad 's ( 570–632 ) death called themselves `` khalifat allah '' , meaning `` representative of god '' . but the other title of `` khalifat rasul allah '' , meaning the successor to the prophet of god , became the common title . some academics write the term as `` khalīf '' . caliphs were often also called `` amīr al-mu'minīn '' ( ) , `` leader of the muslims '' . this title has since been shortened to `` emir '' . it is also found as a personal name in some countries . after the first four caliphs ( abu bakr , umar ibn al-khattab , uthman ibn affan , and ali ibn abi talib ) , the title was used by the umayyads , the abbasids , and the ottomans , as well as by other dynasties in southern pakistan , spain , northern africa , and egypt . most historical muslim rulers simply titled themselves sultans or emirs , and the caliph himself often had very little real authority . the title was not used after the republic of turkey abolished the ottoman caliphate in 1924 .
