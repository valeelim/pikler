Therizinosaur     therizinosaurs ( or segnosaurs ) are a clade of theropod dinosaurs which appear to be herbivorous . therizinosaur fossils have been found in cretaceous deposits in mongolia , the people 's republic of china and western north america . various features of the forelimbs , skull and pelvis show they are theropods and maniraptorans , close relatives to birds . early finds were incomplete , and showed strange anatomy with features typical of theropods , prosauropods and ornithischians . this led some scientists to think that segnosaurs were a late-surviving suborder of primitive dinosaurs . it was not until the mid-1990s , that their true identity as herbivorous descendants of the carnivorous theropods became generally accepted . `` alxasaurus '' was discovered , and had more typical theropod features ; and `` therizinosaurus '' was recognized as a member of the segnosaur group . the connection between the therizinosaurids and other theropods was made clear when primitive members of the group , such as `` beipiaosaurus '' ( 1999 ) and `` falcarius '' ( 2005 ) were discovered . the scientists who described `` falcarius '' noted that it seemed to represent an intermediate stage between carnivorous and herbivorous theropods , a sort of `` missing link '' between predatory maniraptorans and plant-eating therizinosaurs .
