Octopoda     octopods are the order which contains the common octopus and some other types . fossila are rare , but they do have a fossil record starting in the later carboniferous . octopods are put into two suborders . one , the incirrina , is composed of the well-known `` octopus '' of rocky shores and coral reefs and its relatives . the other suborder , the cirrina , contains octopods whose tentacles are linked by an umbrella-like mantle , so their activity is rather different from the common octopus .
