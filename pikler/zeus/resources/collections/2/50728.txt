Fixed Dose Procedure     the fixed-dose procedure ( fdp ) was proposed in 1984 to test a substance 's acute oral toxicity using fewer animals with less suffering than the older ld test which was developed in 1927. fdp uses 10-20 animals to find the dose that produces toxicity signs but not death , and from there predicts the lethal dose . ld ( `` lethal dose 50 % '' ) uses 60-80 animals to find a dose that kills 50 % of animals in a given time . fdp sometimes needs retesting using slightly higher or lower doses . other websites . - department of applied statistics , university of reading , uk .
