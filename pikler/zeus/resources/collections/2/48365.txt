Notostraca     the order notostraca has just two living genera in it . `` triops '' and `` lepidura '' . the two genera are considered 'living fossils ' , as they have not changed in outward form since the triassic . notostracans , or tadpole shrimps , are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes . they live in pools of water on every continent except antarctica . they grow very quickly , and can reach adulthood in a week . `` triops '' only live for a short time ; a record-breaking female only lived to be 100 `` days '' . when their pools dry up , adult tadpole shrimp die . their eggs , however , stop developing for a time . when they are in water again , they come to life , and new `` triops '' are hatched . this is because of a state known as diapause , where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again . the fossil record of notostraca is extensive . they occur in a wide range of geological deposits , reaching back to the carboniferous . the lack of major morphological change since 250 million years ago has led to notostraca being described as living fossils .
