Pangolin     pangolins ( or scaly anteaters ) are mammals which live in africa and asia . they have scales on their skin . they are the only mammals which have this adaptation . there are three genera of pangolin , all of which eat ants and termites . they catch their food using their tongues , and they do not eat anything else . pangolins have features of armadillos ( long , ant eating tongue and broad tail ) and sloths ( claws ) , but the pangolin is in a completely different order . the pangolin belongs to the order pholidota . pangolins have is marked by large , hardened , overlapping plate-like scales . the pangolin scales are made of keratin . and are attached to muscles under the skin . and can be moved to point towards predators . hair grows between the scales and near the rear of the animal . the pangolin 's scaled body is a bit like a pine cone or globe artichoke . it can curl up into a ball when threatened , with its overlapping scales acting like armour while it tucks its face under its tail . the scales are sharp , providing extra defence from predators .
