Pierre Curie     pierre curie ( paris , 15 may 1859 â€“ 19 april 1906 , paris ) was a french physicist . he shared the 1903 nobel prize in physics with his wife , marie curie and henri becquerel , for the work on 'spontaneous radioactivity ' which becquerel discovered . pierre curie is not as well known as marie curie , although pierre and his brother had done a lot of work before pierre 's marriage and work with marie . they were the first to use the term 'radioactivity ' , and were pioneers in its study . pierre and his brother , jacques curie , built a special meter for measuring small amounts of electricity which pierre and marie used in their other discoveries . pierre died after a carriage accident in paris on 19 april 1906. his head was crushed under the wheels . if he had lived he would probably have died by radiation poisoning , as marie did . as they were the first to study radioactivity , they did not know how dangerous it was . after pierre 's death , a group of scientists at the radiology congress decided to honour him by naming the unit of radioactivity a curie .
