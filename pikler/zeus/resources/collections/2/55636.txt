Ecclesiology     in christian theology , ecclesiology is the study of doctrine about the church itself as a community and about the churches own view of its mission and role . that means that ecclesiology looks at the role of the church in salvation , at its origin , its relationship to the historical christ , its discipline , its destiny ( see eschatology ) and its leadership . in addition to describing a broad discipline of theology , ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denomination â€™ s character , self-described or otherwise . this is the sense of the word in such phrases as `` roman catholic ecclesiology '' , `` lutheran ecclesiology '' , and `` ecumenical ecclesiology '' . ecclesiology asks the questions : - who is the church ? is it a visible or earthly corporation -- a `` church '' in the sense of a specific denomination or institution , for instance ? or is it the body of all believing christians regardless of their denominational differences and disunity ? what is the relationship between living christians and departed christians ( the `` cloud of witnesses '' epistle to the hebrews 12:1 ) -- do they ( those on earth and those in heaven ) constitute together the church ?
