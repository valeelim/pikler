Statistical hypothesis test     a statistical hypothesis test is a method used in statistics . it helps you describe the results you get from an experiment . the hypothesis test tells you the likelihood that a specific result would happen by chance . statistical hypothesis tests answer the question : `` assuming that the null hypothesis is true , what is the probability of getting a value which is at least as extreme as the value that was actually observed ? '' . so , for example , if the result would only happen by chance 5 % of the time , then the experimental hypothesis is supported to the 95 % level .
