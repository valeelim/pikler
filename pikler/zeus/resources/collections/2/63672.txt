John Cage     john milton cage , jr. usually known as just john cage , ( september 5 , 1912 - august 12 , 1992 ) was an american composer , writer , philosopher , and visual artist . he was one of the first composers ( or `` musicians '' ) to introduce different styles of music to popular culture . he made mostly avant-garde music and electronic music , and was very well known for making the piece 4'33 '' , which challenged what music is . he also wrote music for pianos that had been `` prepared '' by having screws and nails placed in them . he was gay . his life partner from 1943 until his death was choreographer merce cunningham ( 1919-2009 ) . cage died of a stroke in new york city . this piece is in 3 movements ( sections ) , and is special in that all of the movements are silent , the score having the latin word for silence three times ( tacit , tacit , tacit ) . some people think that it is just a joke because of this , as there is nothing to listen to . it was written in 1952 , and is 4 minutes and thirty three seconds long . cage got the idea from being in a soundless chamber , but realising that even here there was no true silence because he could hear his heart beating .
