Wire rope     wire rope consists of several strands laid ( or 'twisted ' ) together like a helix . each strand is likewise made of metal wires laid together like a helix . initially wrought iron wires were used , but today steel is the main material used for wire ropes . modern wire rope was invented by the german mining engineer wilhelm albert in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the harz mountains in clausthal , lower saxony , germany . it was quickly accepted because it was better than ropes made of hemp or to metal chains , such as had been used before . wilhelm albert 's first ropes consisted of wires twisted about a hemp rope core , six such strands then being twisted around another hemp rope core in alternating directions for extra stability . earlier forms of wire rope had been made by covering a bundle of wires with hemp . in america wire rope was later manufactured by john a. roebling , forming the basis for his success in suspension bridge building . roebling introduced a number of innovations in the design , materials and manufacture of wire rope .
