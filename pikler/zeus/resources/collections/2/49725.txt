Celts     the celts were a large group of caucasian tribes in europe . they first appeared in the early iron age , around 1200 b.c . in austria . it 's an interesting fact that the name 'celt ' comes from the romans , and in fact , the celts would never have used that word themselves.they came from the hallstatt and la t√®ne cultures . their culture and genes spread through much of europe , and by the time the greeks and later the romans started emerging , the british isles and parts of western , southern and eastern europe were celtic - the most prominent celtic tribes were in gaul . the celts spoke celtic languages . today , the celtic languages that remain are the breton , cornish , welsh and gaelic languages . celtic society and technology , although not as advanced as the romans , was far from being primitive for its time . the celts lived a way of life based on ethical codes and honor codes and had developed a culture of their own , full of unique drawings , sculptures , jewellery , folklore , and building designs and techniques . they were also skilled in blacksmithing , farming and diplomacy .
