Homophony     homophony means music in which the voices or instruments sing or play chords ( chords are when two or more notes are played together . ) in homophonic music all the choir ( sopranos , altos , tenors and basses ) are singing the same words at the same time . there is a tune on top and the lower parts are the accompaniment . this is what happens in hymn singing . the opposite is polyphony . polyphonic writing is more complicated : the choir sing different melodic lines at the same time ( see counterpoint ) . the terms `` homophony '' ( literally : `` one sound '' ) and `` polyphony '' ( literally : `` many sounds '' ) are mostly used for choir music . in homophonic music it is easy to hear the words that are being sung . in polyphonic music it is much harder for the listener to understand the words . composers often used polyphony when writing music for the mass because everyone knew the words anyway . homophonic music became more important when composers started to write operas and madrigals where a story is being told and the words must be heard clearly .
