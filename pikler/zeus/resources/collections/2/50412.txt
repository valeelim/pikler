Second War of Scottish Independence     the second war of scottish independence began in 1333 when edward iii of england did not accept the 1328 treaty of northampton any more , under which england recognised the legitimacy of the dynasty established by robert bruce . edward was determined to support the claim of edward balliol , the son of the former king , john balliol , over david ii , bruce 's son and heir . balliol had ruled in scotland for a short time in the autumn of 1332 , but was thrown out of the country later in the year . the war itself lasted until 1357 , when david ii was released from english captivity . english involvement in scotland was also one of the factors that lead to the outbreak of the hundred years ' war with france in 1337. other pages . - wars of scottish independence - first war of scottish independence primary - `` anonimalle chronicle , 1333-81 '' , ed . v. h. galbraith , 1927 . - bower , walter , `` scotichronicon , '' ed . d. e. r. watt , 1987-96 . - `` brut , or the chronicles of england '' , ed . f. w. d. brie , 1906 .
