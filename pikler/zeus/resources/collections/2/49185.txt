Polar moment of inertia     polar moment of inertia is a measure of a circular beam 's ability to resist torsion . it is required to calculate the twist of a beam subjected to a torque . it is analogous to the area moment of inertia , which characterizes a beam 's ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement . the larger the polar moment of inertia , the less the beam will twist , when subjected to a given torque . the `` polar moment of inertia '' must not be confused with the `` moment of inertia '' , which characterizes an object 's angular acceleration due to a torque . unlike other forms of inertia , polar moment of inertia has units of length ( si m ) related pages . - moment ( physics ) . other websites . - torsion of shafts - engineeringtoolbox.com - elastic properties and young modulus for some materials - engineeringtoolbox.com
