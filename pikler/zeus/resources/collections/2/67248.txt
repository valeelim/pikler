Flag of Canada     the maple leaf flag became canada 's flag on 15 february 1965. before this , canada used the british red ensign with canada 's coat of arms on it . flag experts say that the red ensign was `` defaced '' by the coat of arms . flag and heraldry experts also call the design of the flag a `` canadian pale '' . this is because the white stripe in the middle ( called a pale in heraldry ) was not the usual narrow stripe but was half the width of the flag . this was the first time a design like this was used . on some days the canadian government flies the `` royal union flag '' next to the maple leaf flag . the royal union flag is the british union jack , and is a symbol that canada is a member of the commonwealth , and that canada and britain share a history and a monarch . the queen of great britain , had some say in what the flag was to be . she thought that the maple leaf greatly represents the country of canada .
