Homeostasis     homeostasis is self-regulation , a basic property of all self-organising systems . in biology , it is the keeping of a stable internal environment . the most important example of homeostasis is life . animals keep their body in a stable condition . they do so by regulating their inner equilibrium . for example , they adjust their ph , temperature , amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood and so on . in living things , the study of how they keep in a stable condition is called physiology . mostly , our physiology works unconsciously throughout life . we have many feedback systems which adjust our physiology so that we stay alive . these systems are self-organising and do not need to be learnt . they are inherited . the concept was described by claude bernard , and the term was later coined by walter cannon in 1926 , 1929 , and 1932. walter cannon thought these were the features of homeostasis : examples of homeostasis : - the operation of a central heating system - the regulation of water and minerals in the body
