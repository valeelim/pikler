Bromeliad     bromeliads are a family of tropical plants which includes the pineapple and several colourful houseplants . they are nearly all from latin america and the caribbean islands , except for spanish moss from the southern united states , and a single kind from africa . pineapples ( latin name : `` ananas '' ) . see pineapple . air plants ( latin name : `` tillandsia '' ) are very curious because they do not need any roots to stay alive . instead they soak up moisture from the air around them through tiny , silvery scales on their leaves . they have so many of these scales that the whole plant can look grey . in the wild they grow on tree banches in rainy and misty areas . in the caribbean there is a kind that grows on telephone wires ! urn plants ( latin name : `` aechmea '' ) are easy to keep . they grow to about 60 cm across , but because the stiff , green-and-grey leaves have spiny edges , they need to be out of the way . urn plants got their name because they have a hole in the middle made by the ring-shaped arrangement of their leaves . this central urn fills up with rainwater in the wild and is often home to insects and frogs . its flowers are held high on a single stem , and protected by a globe of small , pink leaves which lasts for several months .
