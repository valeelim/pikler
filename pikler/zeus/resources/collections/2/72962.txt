List of hurricanes in California     a california hurricane is a tropical cyclone that affects the state of california . usually pacific hurricanes weaken a lot before getting to land . normally , rainfall is the only effect that pacific hurricanes have on california . sometimes , this rainfall is strong enough to cause flooding and some damage . for example , floods from hurricane kathleen in 1976 created damages scattered across the southeastern california area and killed three people . the main reason why hurricanes do not hit california is because of cold sea surface temperatures off the california coastline and the california current . tropical cyclones usually need sea surface temperatures above 26.5 째c ( 80 째f ) with a depth of 50 metres ( 160 feet ) to survive . but the waters off the california coast are too cold for tropical cyclones , even during the summer . normally , the waters ' temperatures do not get above 17 째c ( 70 째f ) , although el nino effects may sometimes warm the waters a little bit . also the california current moves down from the northwestern us coast to the southern tip of the baja california peninsula , which is the opposite in which northern hemisphere tropical cyclones move . while a few tropical cyclones may hit the southern and central areas of the baja california peninsula , they do not make landfall any farther north than that .
