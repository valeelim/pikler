Autogenic training     autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the german psychiatrist johannes schultz and first published in 1932. the technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes , usually in the morning , at lunch time , and in the evening . during each session , the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation . each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures ( `` e.g . '' lying down , sitting meditation , sitting like a rag doll , `` etc. '' ) . schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation . however , unlike some forms of yoga and meditation , autogenic training is devoid of any mysticism . it is a method for influencing one 's autonomic nervous system . example of an autogenic training session . 1. sit in the meditative posture and scan the body 1 . `` my left arm is heavy and warm '' ( repeat 3 times ) 1 . `` my arms and legs are heavy and warm '' ( repeat 3 times ) 1 . `` my heartbeat is calm and regular '' ( repeat 3 times )
