Field strength     in physics , the field strength of a field is the magnitude ( size ) of its ( vector ) value . this means that the force exerted by the field on a given object is proportional to the field strength . in differential geometry , the field strength is another name for the curvature form . for the electromagnetic field , the curvature form is an antisymmetric matrix whose elements are the electric field and magnetic field : the electromagnetic tensor . in radio engineering , field strength is the strength of radio waves in a particular location .
