Kappa (letter)    kappa ( letter ) kappa ( uppercase/lowercase κ κ ) , is the letter of the greek alphabet , used to represent the `` k '' sound in ancient and modern greek . in the system of greek numerals , it has a value of 20. letters that came from it include the roman k and cyrillic к. the letter κ denotes always the sound `` k '' in greek . it is customary to transliterate ( re-write ) κ as `` c '' in english , but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as `` s '' before e , i and y , which does not happen in greek .
