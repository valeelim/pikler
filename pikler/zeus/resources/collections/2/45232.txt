Maser     a maser is a device that produces light and heat by using atoms to release energy . it was invented by charles hard townes in the 1950s . a maser takes the small vibrations in atoms and amplifies them to release light and heat . originally , they were referred to by the acronym maser or 'microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . unlike most radio transmitters , maser waves tend to have very similar wavelengths . their usage was first predicted by albert einstein . in the 1960s masers were made to emit optical wavelengths , and soon were called lasers .
