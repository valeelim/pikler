Hestia     hestia is a virgin greek goddess of the hearth , home and fire . it was believed all hearths were her altars . she also symbolized the alliance between colonies and their mother cities . her sacred animal is the donkey . hestia is the older sister of demeter and hera , and is also the sister of zeus , poseidon , and hades . her parents are titans rhea and kronos . hestia was originally one of the twelve olympians . her throne was described as plain , being made of wood with a woolen white cushion . she did not choose an emblem for herself . hestia was the first to be swallowed by her father kronos when he ate the twelve olympians , and the last to be disgorged . she gave up her throne on mount olympus , and gave it to dionysus to avoid a possible civil war . hestia instead tended to the sacred fire on mount olympus . because she could not leave from the hearth , hestia did not have many stories centered around her . there is no source of hestia taking a husband or leaving her post at the hearth . hestia was always the first to receive offerings at every sacrifice in a household . any hearth of a household was forbidden to go out unless the fire was ritually extinguished and ritually revived . the hearth of the prytaneum was hestia 's official sanctuary . when a new colony was formed , a flame from hestia 's puplic hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement .
