Stairs     stairs , staircase , stairway , stairwell , and flight of stairs are all names for a construction designed to bridge a large vertical distance by dividing it into smaller vertical distances , called steps . stairways may be straight , round , or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles . special stairways include escalators and ladders . alternatives to stairways are elevators and inclined moving sidewalks . the step is composed of the tread and riser . - tread - the part of the step that is stepped on . it is constructed to the same specifications ( thickness ) as any other flooring . the tread `` length '' is measured from the outer edge of the step to the vertical `` riser '' between steps . - riser - the vertical portion of the step between steps . this may be missing for an `` open '' stair effect . - nosing - an edge part of the tread that protrudes from the riser beneath . if it is present , this means that horizontally , the total `` run '' length of the stairs is not simply the sum of the tread lengths , the treads actually overlap each other slightly
