Pattern     a pattern is an idea , a concept or a model . the model is usually abstract , and can then be applied to the domain where it is used . pattern matching is checking if a certain pattern is present . many patterns can directly be recognised by the senses . some patterns are based on the fact that there are repetitions , that a certain thing occurs over and over again . an example of a simple pattern might be the tiling of a floor . for example , lots of bathrooms have a paisley or floral tiling pattern on the floor . in computer science , design patterns are model solutions for problems that occur very often . in mathematics , there are many different patterns . for example , the fibonacci sequence is a complex type of pattern . there are some simple ones like : 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , ... in this pattern , the next number is the product of the previous number multiplied by 2. basically a mathematical pattern is a sequence of numbers which follows one rule .
