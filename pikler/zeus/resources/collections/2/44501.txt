Ununseptium     tennessine is the superheavy ( very heavy ) , manmade chemical element with a symbol ts and atomic number 117. it is the second-heaviest element of all , and is the second-to-last element . it is placed in group 17 in the periodic table , where the halogens are . its properties are not yet fully known . it is probably a metalloid , but its ( boiling and melting points , and first ionization energy ) is expected to follow the periodic table . the discovery of tennessine was announced in 2010 by scientists in russia and the united states , who collaborated . it is the most recently discovered element as of 2017. in 2004 , the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) team in dubna , moscow oblast , russia planned an experiment to synthesize ( create ) element 117 ( it is called `` element 117 '' because the number of protons in its atom is 117 ) . to do this , they needed to fuse the elements berkelium ( element 97 ) and calcium ( element 20 ) . however , the american team at oak ridge national laboratory , the only producer of berkelium in the world , had stopped making berkelium for a while . so , they synthesized the element 118 first using californium ( element 98 ) and calcium .
