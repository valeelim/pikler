Dream     dreams are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are sleeping . they are often similar to real life in some ways , but can also be very strange . dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep . sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming , but keeps having the dream . this is called a lucid dream . this happens very little for most people , but for some people it happens often . during lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream , and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they ca n't do in the real world . most people remember their dreams in some way or another , even if it 's only a small part , but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly . it 's often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up . because of this , many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have .
