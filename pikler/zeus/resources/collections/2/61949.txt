Basic Roman     the basic roman spelling of english is a 2002 proposal for regular english spelling . it is based on five principles : - the basic roman alphabet , with no additional letters or diacritics used ; - one spelling , with no phoneme ( sound ) written by two or more graphemes ( letters ) ; - short vowels are spelled by single letters , while long vowels and diphthongs are spelled by two-letter combinations ; - diphthongs are spelled by their components , and long vowels either as diphthongs or by doubling the letters of the short vowels ; - short vowels and consonants are spelled as in the tradition of most romanized languages . the basic roman system serves no particular standard of english pronunciation . instead , it gives one way to spell the different varieties of english . the system uses 22 roman letters to represent the set of english phonemes considered by j.c. wells . the letters ‘ j ’ , ‘ q ’ , ‘ w ’ and ‘ x ’ are not used ( letters ‘ j ’ and ‘ w ’ are used in an extended version of the basic roman spelling , see below ) .
