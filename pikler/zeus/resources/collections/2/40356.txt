Experience     experience is knowledge a person gets by doing something or watching someone else do it . experience is learning through actions . some religious groups and teaching methods value learning by experiencing . for example , if someone wants to learn about the game chess , they would play several games . by making mistakes and learning from them , they learn more rather than just reading about playing . experience is often divided into four types : someone who experienced by watching or doing something himself is said to have `` first-hand experience '' . when one person tells another person , the other person has `` second-hand experience '' . when an experience is felt or enjoyed through imagined participation , the person has had a `` vicarious experience '' . a religious experience is a spiritual event seen by someone . holy books like the bible talk about visions or dreams where men like moses , daniel or jesus met god . mystics also describe these events , and offer advice . william james wrote a famous book about the kinds of religious experience .
