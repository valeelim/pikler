Harmonics (music)    harmonics ( music ) harmonics in music are notes which are produced in a special way . they are notes which are produced as part of the “ harmonic series ” . in physics a harmonic is a wave which is added to the basic fundamental wave . in this article we are talking about sound waves , and we can understand it clearly by looking at the strings of a musical instrument . when a violinist plays a note on a violin string the string starts to vibrate very fast . this vibration makes the air vibrate and the sound waves travel to our ear so that we can hear it . if the note were absolutely pure the string would move in a perfect sinusoidal shape and produce only one frequency , but instead there are multiple frequencies being produced at the same time along with the main one . the note played on the violin string makes the string vibrate in a very complicated way . there is the basic note ( the fundamental ) , but added to that are lots of other little notes that all add up to a sound in a special way that tells us that it is a violin playing and not a clarinet or a human voice .
