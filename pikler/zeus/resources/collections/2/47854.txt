Hegemony     hegemony ( pronounced with a soft or hard 'g ' ) is the power of one group over other groups . hegemony is mostly used to refer to relationships between different nations ( or countries ) . this might be direct dominance , such as through military might , but may be indirect dominance , such as when a nation can dictate the terms of trade to its advantage . this word is most often used when talking about international relations . hegemony often describes the relationship of a great power to nearby less powerful countries . the term is greek , and was first used about the influence of a great city over the cities which were allied to it . examples are the peloponnesian league of sparta ( 6th to 4th centuries bc ) ; the short-lived delian league of athens , and the league of corinth headed by philip ii of macedon . a hegemonic relationship is usually described as less than an empire , but more than a regional power . this means a hegemon may not actually take over other nations , but has the power to greatly influence what they do . on the other hand , a global hegemon is more powerful than , say , iran is in the middle east .
