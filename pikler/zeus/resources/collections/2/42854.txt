Gadolinium     gadolinium is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol gd . it has the atomic number 64. it is part of a group of chemical elements in the periodic table named the lanthanides . it is a rare earth element . it is silvery white , malleable and ductile . its main uses are as chemical compounds in color televisions and nuclear magnetic resonance radio contrast agents . in color cathode ray tube televisions ( the type first produced , not flat televisions ) some of the pixels are dots gadolinium compounds . when the electrons from the cathode ray tube hit the pixels and transfer energy to the gadolinium compounds they give out light as energy . nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) imaging is used in medicine where it is named mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . it is used to take picture of inside the body . how the pictures look is changed by the gadolinium compounds and how much water is around . it makes the images clearer because it makes the difference in the concentration of water in different parts of the body look more clear ( more contrast ) in the picture that is made .
