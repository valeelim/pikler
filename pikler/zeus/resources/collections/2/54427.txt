Middle C     middle c is the name given to the musical note c which is in the middle of the piano keyboard . it is not actually quite the middle note of the keyboard , but very nearly , and of all the cs on the piano it is the one nearest to the middle . when writing middle c in music notation it is just below the stave when using the treble clef and just above the stave when using the bass clef . this is shown in the first and last notes of the musical example below . the middle c sits on a ledger line ( an extension of the stave written just for one note ) . on the piano the middle c key is c4 . when starting to learn the piano , most books make their easiest pieces start on middle c. this is because the right hand can then play tunes using 5 notes ( c to g ) using white notes only ( no sharps or flats ) . it is also easy to recognize middle c in notation . it is also a help to find the correct place to sit at the piano ( middle c is opposite the player 's `` middle '' ( tummy ) ) . one problem can be that young children learning the piano may think that all pieces start on middle c. pieces can start anywhere on the keyboard .
