Parliament of England     the parliament of england was the legislature of the kingdom of england . its roots go back to the early medieval period . it took over more and more from the power of the monarch , and after the act of union 1707 became the main part of the parliament of great britain , and later the parliament of the united kingdom . today there have been increasing calls for england to receive its own , independent parliament , as is the case with the other nations of the united kingdom , scotland , wales , and northern ireland . this is called devolution . the origin of parliament can be found in the times of the anglo-saxons . anglo-saxon kings were advised by a council known as the `` witenagemot '' , to which belonged the king 's sons and brothers . the ealdormen , or executive heads of the shire and the senior clergymen of the state , had seats as well . the king still had the highest authority , but laws were made only after seeking the advice ( and , in later times , the consent ) of the `` witenagemot '' .
