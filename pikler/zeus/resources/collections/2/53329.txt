Winter War     the winter war ( 30 november 1939 - 13 march 1940 ) was a conflict fought between the soviet union and finland . it began when the soviet union tried to invade finland soon after the invasion of poland . the soviet military forces expected a victory over finland in a few weeks , because the soviet army had many more tanks and planes than the finnish army . however , the finnish forces resisted both better and longer than expected . one reason the finnish forces did better is because they had good winter clothes and they wore white coats which camouflaged them in the snow . as well , the finnish soldiers moved around on skis , which made it easy for them to sneak up on the soviet soldiers . the soviet army did not have good winter clothes , and they wore dark green coats , which made them easy to see in the snow . the defeated finns had to give up 10 % of their country . they tried to get it back in the continuation war . other pages . - world war ii
