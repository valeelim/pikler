Singing     when people sing they use the air in the lungs . the pressure with that the air comes out of the lungs can be controlled with several respiratory muscles , including the muscle called the diaphragm which goes across the front of the body below the ribs . people who have singing lessons spend a lot of time practising “ breath control ” . the air comes through the throat where the larynx is like a reed on a clarinet : it vibrates , controlling the passage of air , and this makes the note higher or lower depending on how it is controlled . the sound comes into the mouth which is space where the sound can be made bigger ( it “ resonates ” ) . professional singers even learn to think of the whole head as a resonator . they sometimes talk about the “ mask ” , i.e . they imagine a mask in front of the face and this makes the sound bigger . the sound then comes out of the mouth so that it can be heard . singing is different from speaking because of the special way the vocal cords in the throat are used . most people can sing notes which cover more than an octave . people who sing a lot will probably be able to sing over two octaves . singers can be called according to whether they have higher or lower voices : soprano , mezzo-soprano and contralto for women , tenor , baritone or bass for men . some men are able to train their voices to sing alto by using a falsetto voice . children ’ s voices are often called treble .
