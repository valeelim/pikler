Trebuchet     a trebuchet was a device used in wars and sieges in the middle ages . it could be used to throw stones at ramparts , trying to break them down . it could also be used to throw things over the walls of a city . these could be corpses of animals or people that had died of the plague . trebuchets were more accurate than other medieval catapults . the trebuchet works in a simple way . the basket of the trebuchet is filled with heavy rocks . this acts as a counterweight for the other end , which is usually filled with one large rock . several men arm the trebuchet by raising the counterweight up and the firing arm down . at this point the arm is released , the heavy basket swings down and the arm swings up , launching the rock far and fast . the sling adds an additional 10-15 feet of arm length and gives the projectile a whip like speed then releases . the sling gives the projectile most of its speed . other websites . - secrets of lost empires : medieval siege ( building of and history of trebuchets ) , from the nova website
