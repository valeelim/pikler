Isra and Mi'raj     the isra and mi'raj are two parts of a story that muslims tell about muhammad . they say that in the year 621 , while he was resting in the kaaba in mecca , an angel came to him , with an animal called a buraq . the buraq carried muhammad to a mosque that was far away , and then the buraq took muhammad up into heaven . while in heaven , muhammad met adam and moses and allah ( god ) , and then came back down to earth . every year , muslims hold a festival for the isra and mi'raj . they bring their children to the mosques , where the children can hear the story , and then pray with the grownups . afterwards there is a feast and everyone can eat . different people disagree about whether the story is true or not . some say it was real , and some say that muhammad had a dream . there is also disagreement about where the `` farthest mosque '' is . most people say that it 's in jerusalem , but some people say it may be other places too .
