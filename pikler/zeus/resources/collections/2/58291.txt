Clam     a clam is a type of shellfish . clams can be found in saltwater and freshwater . clams eat plankton , and are eaten by small sharks and squid . clams can be eaten by people . they may be found on menus in restaurants that serve seafood . clams are a fairly common form of bivalve , therefore making it part of the phylum mollusca . there are many clams in the ocean , but some can also be found in some lakes , streams , and rivers . a clam does not have any of the five senses so they can not smell , taste , feel , hear or see . clams have a burrowing foot that they use to dig down into the sand or mud to hide . if you go to the beach and see little holes that appear in the sand each times the waves go away , it is probable that clams made them . scientists classify clams by how far down they dig and what kind of surface they dig into . some burrow less than an inch under the sand , while others dig several inches below the surface . the shell has 3 layers . the top one is called mother-of-pearl because it is a coating of pearl material .
