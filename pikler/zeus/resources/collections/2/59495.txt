Logarithmic scale     a logarithmic scale is a scale of measurement that uses the logarithm of a physical quantity instead of the quantity itself . on a logarithmic scale , each tick mark on the scale is the previous tick mark `` multiplied '' by some number . the logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values â€“ the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range . some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion ( multiplying the actual input strength adds a constant to the perceived signal strength , see : stevens ' power law ) . that makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate . in particular , our sense of hearing perceives equal `` multiples '' of frequencies as equal `` differences '' in pitch . on most logarithmic scales , `` small '' multiples ( or ratios ) of the underlying quantity correspond to `` small '' ( possibly negative ) values of the logarithmic measure . well-known examples of such scales are : - richter magnitude scale and moment magnitude scale ( mms ) for strength of earthquakes and movement in the earth .
