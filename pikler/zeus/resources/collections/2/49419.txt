Racial segregation     racial segregation means separating people because of their races . segregation was legal and normal in many countries across the world , for many years . for example , until 1964 , it was still legal to separate white and african-american people in some states . in south africa , from the 1940s until the 1990s , a system called apartheid kept white and black south africans separate . racial segregation has happened in many other countries , throughout history . segregation is not as simple as having `` separate but equal '' places for people of different races . segregation happens when a country or a society views one race as better than another . the goal of segregation is to keep the `` inferior '' race away from the `` better '' race . because one race is seen as `` inferior , '' people of that race are not treated well . they go through discrimination . often they are not given basic rights , like the right to vote . as a united states supreme court judge said in a case about segregation in schools : `` separate facilities are [ always ] unequal .
