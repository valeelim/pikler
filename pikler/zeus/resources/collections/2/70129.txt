Frozen dinner     a frozen dinner is a kind of ready-to-prepare meal , or convenience food . frozen dinners are prepared in bulk , cooked until ready to serve , divided into single servings for freezing , to be reheated later . an entr√©e of meat or other protein is included , along with vegetables , a carbohydrate food ( such as potatoes or rice ) , and a sweet dessert . frozen dinners are helpful for persons who do not have time to cook , or who lack meal-planning or cooking skills . they are also known as `` tv dinners '' , because they were long advertised as suitable to warm up and eat while watching television . both inventions became popular at around the same time ( during the 1950s ) , and each one sold more of the other . for many years , frozen dinners came packaged with a shaped aluminium foil cooking tray . this made them easy to reheat in a normal gas or electric stove 's oven . the trays were sometimes reused or recycled by users . when microwave ovens became common , frozen dinners could not be cooked in them because the metal tray would damage the oven . early packaged foods for the microwave often could not be cooked in a regular oven , because the heat would make the package catch fire or fall apart . new packaging had to be developed , so the same frozen dinner could be heated in both kinds of ovens . this succeeded during the 1980s . some new trays can be reused , while others are made of paper and meant to be thrown away .
