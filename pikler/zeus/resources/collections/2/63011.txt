Colorimeter     a colorimeter is a device used for measuring colours , or colorimetry . it measures the absorbance of different wavelengths of light in a solution . it can be used to measure the concentration of a known solute . different chemical substances absorb different wavelengths of light . when the concentration of the solute is higher , it absorbs more light in a specific wavelength . this is known as the beer-lambert law . the most important parts of a colorimeter are : - a light source , which is usually an ordinary filament lamp - an aperture , which can be adjusted - a set of filters in different colors - a detector that measures the light which has passed through the solution different filters are used to select the wavelength of light which the solution absorbs the most . this makes the colorimeter more accurate . solutions are usually placed in glass or plastic cuvettes . the usual wavelengths used are between 400 and 700 nanometers . if it is necessary to use ultraviolet light ( below 400 nanometers ) then the lamp and filters must be changed .
