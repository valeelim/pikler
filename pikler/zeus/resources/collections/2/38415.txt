Cyanide     cyanides are chemicals that contain the `` cyano-group '' . in that group a carbon atom has three chemical bonds to a nitrogen atom . this group is present in many substances . many of them are gases , but some are solids or liquids . those substances that can release the compound cn are highly poisonous . certain bacteria , fungi and algae are able to produce cyanides . cyanides are also found in certain foods or plants . the cyanides serve as a defense against being eaten by herbivores . in popular culture , cyanides are said to be highly toxic . but there are many cyanides that really are , but many others that are not . prussian blue , a cyanide compound , is given as a treatment to poisoning with thallium and caesium , for example . the poisons referred to are usually hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) , and the chemicals which are similar to it , like potassium cyanide ( kcn ) , and sodium cyanide ( nacn ) . ( such substances are called derivatives of hydrogen cyanide ) . organic compounds that contain the cn group are called nitriles . many of them are not as toxic . some of them are even used to produce drugs .
