Dorus Rijkers     theodorus `` dorus '' rijkers ( january 28 1847 â€“ april 19 1928 ) was a famous dutch lifeboat captain and folk hero , he is most famous for his sea rescues of 487 shipwrecked victims over a total of 38 rescue operations and at least 25 before joining the lifeboat-service . dorus received his nickname `` grandpa '' ( dutch : '' opa '' ) while still a young man . he had married neeltje huisman , a fisherman 's widow who already had 6 children . shortly after the marriage , the oldest of neeltje 's daughters had a child of her own , and so at only 23 years old dorus became known as `` opa '' in den helder where he lived . although the nickname began as a joke , dorus soon started acting and looking like a grandpa , and from that time on he became primarily known by his nickname . dorus gained most of his fame as a result of his service to the noord- en zuid-hollandsche redding maatschappij ( nzhrm ) , one of the two main dutch lifeboat-societies at the time . the nzhrm would later become the koninklijke nederlandse redding maatschappij ( knrm ) .
