Orchestration     orchestration in music can have two meanings : it can mean : the study of how to write music for an orchestra . it can also mean the list of instruments that are used in a particular piece of music . people who want to compose music for orchestras need to study orchestration . they can do this by reading books about orchestration , but also they can do this by studying orchestral scores and listening to orchestras in concerts or on cds . students at music colleges will also practise orchestration by taking piano music and arranging it for orchestra . the word instrumentation means almost the same thing as “ orchestration ” . “ instrumentation ” means : understanding each instrument and knowing about all the sounds they can make . it can be about any music with instruments , whereas “ orchestration ” refers to the orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present . orchestration is all about understanding how to write well for different instruments , how to combine them so that they sound well together and balance well .
