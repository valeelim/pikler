German Bundestag     the german bundestag ( commonly referred to as `` bundestag '' ) is the legislature of germany . it meets in berlin , in the reichstag building , which was specially rebuilt ready for the bundestag to move from bonn . the bundestag has at least 598 members . every 4 years the german people vote . a party gets seats when it gets at least 5 % of the votes . every voter has two votes , one for a person and one for a party . 299 members each represent a constituency , just as in the british house of commons or the us house of representatives . the other half are elected from a party list in each land . the total number of seats a party gets depends on the number of the second `` party votes '' it gets . but if a party wins more constituency seats than its share of the party votes , then it keeps those extra seats . these extra seats , or `` extra mandates '' , are the reason the bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members . if a party gets extra mandates , the other parties get some extra seats too to make sure every party gets exactly its share of party seats . this system of giving extra mandates was changed in 2013. before 2013 , if a party won extra mandates , then it got to put more members in the bundestag , which gave the party more influence over the bundestag than it won in the elections .
