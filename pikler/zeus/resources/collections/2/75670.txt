Fabaceae     fabaceae is the systematic name of the plant family that is commonly known as the pea family . it consists of three subgroups : caesalpinioideae , mimosoideae and papilionoideae ( or better faboideae ) . in modern systems like apg ii this family fabaceae is closely related to quillajaceae , polygalaceae or milkworts ( including the families diclidantheraceae , moutabeaceae , and xanthophyllaceae ) , and surianaceae . the leaves are usually alternate and compound , in the mimosoideae and the caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate ( e.g . `` acacia '' , `` mimosa '' ) . in many species the leaves have structures evolved to attract ants , that , being predatory , protect the plant from herbivore insects . extrafloral nectaries -a gland secreting nectar -are common among the mimosoideae and the caesalpinioideae and are also found in some faboideae ( e.g . vetches `` vicia sativa '' ) . fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants ( i.e . they are pollinated by insects ) and the flower are usually showy to attract the pollinators .
