Woodstock Festival     the woodstock music and art festival was a rock music festival at max yasgur 's 600 acre ( 2.4 km² ) dairy farm in the town of bethel , new york from 15–18 august 1969. it might be the most famous rock concert and festival ever held . for many , it showed the counterculture of the 1960s and the `` hippie era '' . many of the most famous musicians at the time showed up during the rainy weekend , as can be seen in a 1970 movie , `` woodstock '' . joni mitchell 's song `` woodstock '' , about the event , also became a major hit song for crosby , stills , nash & young . in recent years , a number of attempts were made to recreate it , but the original woodstock festival of 1969 has proven to be legendary . the festival was called `` woodstock '' , because the investment group that backed the concert was called `` woodstock ventures . '' it was originally planned for saugerties , and then the town of wallkill , in orange county ( not to be confused with the hamlet of wallkill , in ulster county ) . people in the town of wallkill , meaning those on the town board , quickly passed a law that required a permit to hold any gathering for over 5,000 people . a permit was applied for , but it was denied because the portable toilets proposed were considered to be inadequate . a sullivan county farmer named max yasgur heard about the festival and the problems and offered his farm in the town of bethel . he was paid $ 10,000 for the three days .
