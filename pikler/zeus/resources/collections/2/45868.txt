Binomial nomenclature     in biology , binomial nomenclature is how species are named . the name of a species is made of two parts : one indicating the genus and one indicating the species . binomial nomenclature means `` two-part name '' or `` system of two-part names '' . the person who popularized this system for use was swedish botanist and physician carolus linnaeus ( 1707â€“1778 ) . he gave a two-part name to every species he knew . this kind of naming had been used before linnaeus by some naturalists , but after linnaeus , it was accepted as a good method . the value of the binomial nomenclature comes from several things . it saves words because it replaces long descriptions , it is used everywhere , and the names are unique and stable . the system ended the use of local common names , which was the source of much confusion . when science was done by just a few european countries their common names for species were well-known . but as it happened , the common names in all countries was rather different . the same name might be used for more than one species , and several species given the same name . in the linnaeus system , everyone uses the same name for the same species . linnaeus chose latin names . first , because it avoided competitive nationalism ; second because most educated people in his day learnt latin .
