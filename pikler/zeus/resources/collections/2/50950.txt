Commodity     commodity is a term with distinct meanings in both business and in marxian political economy . for the former , it is a product , that is traded solely on the basis of price . for marxian political economy it means wares offered for exchange . in the world of business , a commodity is an product , good or service that is traded based solely on its price , rather than quality and features . examples include : electricity ( most users of electric power are only concerned with energy consumption ; only a minority of users are concerned with the quality and technical details of voltage and frequency deviations ) , wheat , bulk chemicals such as sulfuric acid , metals , and even orange juice . in the original and simplified sense , `` commodities '' were things of value , of uniform quality , that were produced in large quantities by many different producers ; the items from each different producer are considered as of the same value . wheat is an example of a soft commodity . wheat from many different farms comes together . generally , it is all traded at the same price ; wheat from farm a has not another price than wheat from farm b. some uniform standard of quality is assumed . ( there may be various standards leading to different pools : one say for genetically modified wheat , and one for unmodified wheat . )
