Pedal (music)    pedal ( music ) pedals on musical instruments are used to control parts of the instrument , or provide extra notes . there are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons . the piano has at least two pedals ; large concert grand pianos always have three . the pedal on the right ( operated by the player 's right foot ) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed . it does this by lifting the dampers from the strings . some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well ( `` in sympathy '' ) . the pedal on the left makes the sound quieter . it is called the `` una corda '' pedal ( italian for `` one string '' ) . this is because , in the early days of the piano , the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three ( most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound ) . on modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one . they also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer , away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead . on an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard .
