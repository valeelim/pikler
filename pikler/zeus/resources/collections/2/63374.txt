Tritium     tritium is an isotope of hydrogen , the lightest element . tritium has one proton and two neutrons , making it heavier than ordinary hydrogen or its isotope deuterium . hydrogen does not have any neutrons , only a proton . the chemical symbol for tritium is h or t. in nature , tritium is made when cosmic rays hit nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere . tritium has a half-life of a little more than eight years , so there is not much in the atmosphere . people make much more tritium in nuclear reactors , so that they can make things from it . tritium is important for nuclear fusion power . tritium is added to nuclear bombs to make them more powerful when they explode . tritium is often used with phosphors to make glow in the dark key-rings , and sights on rifles . tritium makes the phosphors glow because it is radioactively unstable and gives energy to the phosphor so it can make light . before lots of tritium could be made , people used radium to make things light up but this gave people cancer . radioactive decay produces tritium . high levels of tritium were found in 2013 in the sea near the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant two years after the fukushima nuclear disaster .
