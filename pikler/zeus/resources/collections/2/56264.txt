Popular science     if a book or a tv show is about science , but it 's made so it 's easy for everyone to understand , then it is popular science . it has `` popular '' in its name because it 's made for the whole `` population '' , not just for scientists . nature documentaries ( nature shows ) are examples of popular science . popular science is non-fiction , so it is not the same as `` science fiction '' . popular science is also not the same as `` science journalism '' . science journalism is what journalists write to report the newest theories and discoveries made in science , but popular science is not always about what is newest . some famous people who make popular science are isaac asimov , jared diamond , stephen hawking , bill nye , and carl sagan . when scientists write about their work , first they write books and periodicals meant for the same kind of scientists to read -- `` scientific literature '' . the purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists , and people who are not scientists , will easily understand . when people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science , important things about that idea are often left out or added in .
