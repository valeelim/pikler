Biological classification     biological classification is how biologists group organisms . the classification has its root in the work of aristotle who invented a multi-ranked system . a great influence was carolus linnaeus , who popularized the idea of binomial nomenclature using a two-part name indicating the genus , and the species . the human species is named `` homo sapiens '' . names of species are often printed in italics , although there is no obligation to do so ( this also goes for names of genera , etc. , etc . ) biological classification is also known as taxonomy . it is a science , and like most sciences has evolved over time . at various times different principles were adopted , and it is not rare for different scientists to use different methods . since the early 20th century , groupings are supposed to fit the darwinian principle of common descent . these days , molecular evolution studies , which use dna sequence analysis as data , are popular . this is often called `` phylogenetics '' , a branch or form of cladism . this approach creates an evolutionary tree of life ( biology ) and uses characters ( traits ) to decide on the branches of the taxonomy .
