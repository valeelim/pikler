DNA repair     dna repair means the processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to its dna molecules . in cells , normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as uv light and radiation damage dna . there are as many as a million molecular lesions per cell per day . many of these lesions cause structural damage to the dna molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the affected gene . other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it divides . the dna repair process must be constantly active so it can respond rapidly to any damage in the dna structure . the rate of dna repair depends on many factors , including the cell type , the age of the cell , and the extracellular environment . a cell that has accumulated a lot of dna damage , or one that no longer effectively repairs damage , can enter one of three states : 1. an irreversible state of dormancy , known as senescence 1. cell suicide , also known as apoptosis ( programmed cell death )
