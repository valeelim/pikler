Bar (music)    bar ( music ) a bar or measure is used in writing music . it is a way of organizing the written music in small sections . each bar is a small amount of time . most music has a regular beat ( or pulse ) which can be felt . each bar usually has the same number of beats in it . music that feels like 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 will be divided into bars with four beats worth of music in each bar . the bar line ( or barline ) is a vertical line written in the music which separates the bars . at the beginning of a piece of music there will be a time signature . the top number shows how many beats there are in each bar . a double bar does not mean `` two bars '' . it is two single bar lines drawn close together . these are simply ways of visually dividing the music into sections . a double bar line can be written with one being thicker than the other . this double bar line shows the end of a piece of music . if there are two dots on the left of the double bar line , this is a repeat sign . the player should go back to the beginning and start again . if the composer only wants the performer to repeat a section of the music , and not go back to the beginning , they can put in a `` start repeat '' sign . this is a double bar line with two dots on the right .
