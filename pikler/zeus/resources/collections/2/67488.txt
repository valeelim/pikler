Haemophilia     haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop . the bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot . people with hemophilia lack proteins in the blood that make scabs and blood clots . a person with a small cut or internal bleed ( bruise ) could bleed to death . they do not bleed more than a normal person , but they bleed for much longer . the word comes from the greek words `` haima '' ( `` blood '' ) and `` philia '' ( `` to love '' ) . to treat this , an affected person can get a blood donation from someone without hemophilia . the donor â€™ s blood has the clotting proteins and can temporarily make a normal scab . 30 % of hemophilia a and b cases are the first person in their family to have hemophilia which is the result of an unexpected mutation ( this means that there is an unexpected change in the body ) . it usually affects males . it is passed from mother to child through genes . there are 3 types of haemophilia : - haemophilia a - about 90 % of cases . there is no blood clotting ability .
