Polar low     a polar low is a small sized and short-lived atmospheric low pressure system that is found over the ocean areas pole ward of the main polar front in both the northern and southern hemispheres . the systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than 1,000 km and live for less than a couple of days . they are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems . polar lows can be difficult to detect using standard weather reports and are a problem to high-latitude operations , such as shipping and gas and oil platforms . polar lows have been also known as by using many other terms , such as `` comma cloud '' , `` mesocyclone '' , `` polar mesoscale vortex '' , `` arctic hurricane '' , `` arctic low '' , and `` cold air depression '' . today the term is usually set aside for the more-energetic systems that have near-surface winds of at least gale force ( 17 m/s ) . other websites . - european polar lows working group - nsidc - polar low forecasting by meted rasmussen , e.a . and turner , j.
