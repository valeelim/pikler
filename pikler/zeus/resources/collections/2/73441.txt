Zuiderzee Works     the zuiderzeewerken ( `` zuiderzee works '' ) are a system of dams , land reclamation and water drainage works in the netherlands during the twentieth century . plans for the works date back to the 1600s , but it was not until a very bad flood in 1916 , that the dutch parliament finally agreed to pay for the works . now it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world . first some dams or dykes were built to separate the south sea ( ) from the north sea . the biggest was the `` afsluitdijk '' ( 'closure dyke ' ) . it is long . when it was finished in 1932 , the south sea was completely cut off and from then on would become a lake called the `` ijsselmeer '' . land reclamation meant building more dams and pumping out the water inside . the new land is called a polder . polders make new land for agriculture and make flood protection better , because the lake is smaller . there are gates and sluices at the ends of the afsluitdijk . the gates , called locks , can be opened to let ships through . the sluices let water out of the ijsselmeer . if there were no sluices the lake would fill up and flood the countryside . this is because it is always being filled with water from rivers and the polders which are still being drained .
