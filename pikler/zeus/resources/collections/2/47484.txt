Presbyterianism     presbyterianism is a kind of protestant christianity . it is very conservative when compared to other kinds of christianity . it was started off in scotland by john knox and became powerful in england during the civil war . today there are presbyterian churches across the world . presbyterians ( followers of presbyterianism ) believe that the bible is the most important thing in their church because it was given to humans by god and has no errors in it . they believe that god has control over everything and has chosen to make some people to follow jesus christ but not others , and that only followers of jesus may get into heaven . ( see calvinism ) presbyterian churches may be led by men called ministers , rectors or elders . some presbyterian churches have women as elders . there is no overall leader and there are no bishops in the presbyterian tradition . on sunday the bible , which they consider the 'word of god ' , is read and a sermon preached by the minister is at the heart of a morning worship service , which also includes group singings of some worship songs .
