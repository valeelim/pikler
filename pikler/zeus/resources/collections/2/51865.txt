Inverse function     an inverse function is a concept of mathematics . a function will calculate some output formula_1 , given some input formula_2 . this is usually written formula_3 . the inverse function does the reverse . let 's say formula_4 is the inverse function of formula_5 , then formula_6 . or otherwise put , formula_7 . an inverse function to formula_8 is usually called formula_9 do not confuse formula_10 with formula_11 : the first is a value of an inverse function , the second is reciprocal of a value of a `` normal '' function . let 's take a function formula_12 over real formula_2 . then , formula_14 not all functions have inverse functions : for example , function formula_15 has none ( because formula_16 , and formula_17 should give both 1 and -1 when given 1 ) ) , but every binary relation has its own inverse relation . finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do .
