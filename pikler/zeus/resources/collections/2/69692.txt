Quilt     a quilt is a type of blanket made of three layers : a top piece of cloth , a layer of insulating material often called `` batting '' , and a bottom piece of cloth for backing . the layers are joined together either by sewing or by tying the layers together with pieces of yarn , thread , or ribbon . the top layer of the quilt can be made from many pieces of cloth sewn together in patterns , known as `` patchwork '' . other patterns can be made by running lines of stitching through the three layers . sometimes quilts are not used as bedding , but are works of art made to be hung on a wall ( wall hangings ) or used as decoration . quilting is done in many cultures , such as the amish , in hawaii , and in india .
