Abstract algebra     abstract algebra is a part of math which studies algebraic structures . these include : - groups - rings - fields - vector spaces - algebras - boolean algebra it is normal to build a theory on one kind of structure , like group theory or category theory . the purpose of the theory of each concept is to organize the precise definition of the concept , examples of it , its substructures , the ways to relate different examples of the concept algebraically ( these are called morphisms in some cases ) , and the concept 's applications , both inside its own theory and outside in other areas of mathematics . during history , different fields of mathematics have used algebras . algebras are about finding or specifying rules on how to calculate with certain mathematical formulas and expressions . another algebra ( which is not `` abstract '' ) is elementary algebra , for example . examples . - solving equations with many variables . this leads to matrices , determinants and linear algebra . - finding formulas for polynomial equations . this led to the discovery of groups , as an expression of symmetry .
