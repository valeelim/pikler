Gentile     a gentile is a person who is not jewish . it is polite to use this word when needed to describe a person who is not jewish , as in `` my friend robert is a gentile . '' up until about a hundred years ago , it was very hard ( and unlikely ) for jews and gentiles to be close friends . this is because they would be expected to ask each other over for dinner , but jews follow strict laws about what they can and can not eat . they can only eat what is kosher . related pages . - goy - israelite
