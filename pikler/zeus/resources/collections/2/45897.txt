Comparison of the Imperial and US customary systems     the imperial and u.s. customary systems are very similar but there are some differences between them . the main difference is in units of volume . the american system has two gallons : a wet and a dry one . the imperial gallon is bigger than each of these . however , the imperial fluid ounce is slightly smaller than the american one . the international yard is exactly 0.9144 metres . this definition was agreed upon by the united states , canada , the united kingdom , south africa , australia and new zealand in 1959. however , the united states continued to use its old length units for surveying purposes . the us survey foot is exactly 36/39.37 metre . another difference is in units of mass . in britain people often use the stone . one stone is 14 pounds . eight stones are one hundredweight ( 112 lb ) . twenty hundredweights are one ton . so one british ton is 2240 pounds . it is very close to the tonne of the metric system . in the united states people do not use the stone . they usually use a hundredweight of 100 pounds . this hundredweight is also called a `` short hundredweight '' . twenty short hundredweights are one short ton . the british hundredweight is also called the `` long hundredweight '' and the britsh ton is also called the `` long ton '' .
