Decidability theory     decidability theory is a branch of mathematics . suppose there is a set , and there is an element . there is also an algorithm . the algorithm will simply check if the element belongs to the set or not . if the algorithm stops ( after a limited time ) and has reached a decision , if the element is in the set or not , this is called decidable . in simple terms , if there is a shopping bag , decidability is that one is able to check whether or not there is some salad in the bag . some logical problems can not be decided that way ( `` this statement is false '' ) . they are called undecidable there is a weaker property too , called semidecidable . a set is called semidecidable ( or recursively enumerable ) , if the algorithm described above can only decide if an element is in the set or is not in the set in finite time , but not both .
