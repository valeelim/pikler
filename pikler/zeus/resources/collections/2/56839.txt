Carbon monoxide     carbon monoxide , with the chemical formula co , is a colorless , odorless , and tasteless gas . it consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to one oxygen atom . it is made when carbon compounds burn and there is not enough oxygen . it is a good fuel and burns in air with a blue flame , making carbon dioxide . it is very toxic , but it is useful for modern technology as well . the most important use for carbon monoxide in industry is making iron from iron ore. the carbon monoxide takes the oxygen from the iron ore when heated in a large oven called a blast furnace . liquid metal iron is left behind . the carbon monoxide turns into carbon dioxide . carbon monoxide can accidentally form when there is too little air to burn all the fuel into carbon dioxide . such a situation may happen if the oven shutters are closed too early or if a mobile cooker is used in a small tent with no ventilation ( ventilation is fresh air coming in and smoke going out ) . many people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning . carbon monoxide poisoning can cause feelings of paranoia and hallucinations , and has been determined to be a major cause of `` haunted '' houses . small amounts of it are found in coal gas , a fuel produced by heating coal without any air .
