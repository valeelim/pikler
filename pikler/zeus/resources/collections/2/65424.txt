Jury nullification     jury nullification means a knowing and deliberate ignoring of evidence or a refusal to apply the law as explained in the jury instructions . a jury may feel the application of the law is unfair , unjust or is immoral in some way . or , they may want to `` send a message '' about some social issue . jury nullification is not a legal function of a jury and is not usually considered to be consistent with a jury 's duty to judge a case on the facts and the law . it is clear that juries do have the power to nullify . but do they have the right to nullify is another question . once the verdict of `` not guilty '' is returned , double jeopardy applies and the defendant can not be tried again . if a judge learns that a juror intends to nullify the verdict , the judge has the right to remove that juror . typically , jurors are not told by the court that they have the power to nullify . that has both good points and bad . judges fear if they told jurors they would have jury anarchies on their hands with jurors doing whatever they please . however , jury nullification can provide valuable feedback and can sometimes do some good if used wisely .
