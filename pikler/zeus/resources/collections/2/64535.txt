Fundamental theorem of algebra     the fundamental theorem of algebra is a proven fact about polynomials , sums of multiples of integer powers of one variable . it is based on mathematical analysis , the study of real numbers and limits . it was first proven by german mathematician carl friedrich gauss . it says that for any polynomial formula_1 with the degree formula_2 , where formula_3 , the polynomial equation formula_4 must have at least one root formula_5 , and not more than formula_2 roots altogether . some remarks : - the degree formula_2 of a polynomial is the highest power of formula_5 that occurs in it - some of the roots may be complex numbers - it is possible to 'count ' a root formula_9 twice , if formula_9 is still a root of the polynomial formula_11 ; if you will 'count ' the roots in this way , then the polynomial formula_1 with degree formula_2 has `` exactly '' formula_2 roots - it is not a theorem of pure algebra . it is not possible to prove this theorem without an element of analysis . this element has been reduced to the observation that , firstly , for polynomial functions formula_15 of odd degree the pair of values formula_1 and formula_17 has opposite positive and negative signs when formula_5 is large enough . and secondly , that any polynomial function formula_15 on the real line that takes positive and negative values for formula_20 has to cross formula_5 axis .
