Cassini−Huygens     cassini–huygens is a spacecraft that was sent to study the planet saturn , its rings , and its moons . it is a mission made by nasa , the european space agency ( esa ) , and italian space agency ( asi ) . the spacecraft has two main parts : the cassini orbiter and the huygens probe . it was launched on october 15 , 1997 and entered into orbit around saturn on july 1 , 2004. it is the first spacecraft to orbit saturn and the fourth one to visit saturn ( the others were `` fly-by 's '' and did not enter orbit ) . the mission has been extended until 2017. the orbiter is named after the italian-french astronomer giovanni domenico cassini , who discovered some moons of saturn . most of the orbiter was designed and built by nasa , although asi built and programmed some parts that talked to the huygens probe . the spacecraft is still in operation , sending back data . esa ( european space agency ) made the huygens probe , named after the dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist christiaan huygens who discovered titan . on december 25 2004 , the huygens probe left the orbiter . a couple weeks later , the probe parachuted onto saturn 's largest moon titan . astronomers have wondered what the surface of titan was like , since it was hidden under thick clouds . it is the only moon in our solar system with a thick atmosphere . the probe descended and sent pictures and other data back for scientists to study . after 90 minutes on the moon , the spacecraft stopped working , as expected . it is the farthest place we have ever landed a spacecraft . the pictures sent while parachuting showed that there were rivers , probably of liquid methane . it is much too cold for water .
