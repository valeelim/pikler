Bottle cap     bottle caps are used to seal the opening of bottles . for glass bottles , these are usually small , specially adapted pieces of metal . with plastic bottles , plastic caps are used instead . the original bottle cap was called crown cork . it is pressed onto the bottle , and can be removed , using a bottle opener . in recent years bottle caps with screw on mounts are used that way , a bottle opener is no longer required .
