Claymore     the claymore is a scottish sword . it is double-edged . the word itself is of gaelic origins and means “ great sword ” . the claymore is indeed a big sword and was held only with two hands . in some sources the broad claymore sword is called “ claidheamh da lamh ” , which means “ two-hand sword ” . it was very popular in the 16th century when scottish warriors ( highlanders ) used it against the englishmen . the claymore sword was in average about - overall length , the blade was about long . it weighed around . it possessed a very broad blade and a slim channel for blood flood ( fuller ) . there also existed a version of claymore that had a single-edged blade and a basket-shaped handle . the basket of the handle was used as protection to the hand . the blade was very long so the basket was designed for balance too . the making of these swords was widespread especially during the mid-1600s . the places where the claymore swords were made were : edinburgh , canongate , stirling and glasgow . beginning around 1350 , very long claymore swords were used . the handles and the blades became longer . this was because of the heavy armour , that was almost impossible to penetrate . the scottish claymore was one of the two swords which could cut through the armour . the second was the germanic landsknecht sword .
