Trigonometric function     in mathematics , the trigonometric functions are a set of functions which relate angles to the sides of a right triangle . there are many trigonometric functions , the 3 most common being sine , cosine , tangent , followed by cotangent , secant and cosecant . the last three are called reciprocal trigonometric functions because they act as the reciprocals of other functions . secant and cosecant are rarely used . the trigonometric functions sometimes are also called circular functions . they are functions of an angle ; they are important when studying triangles , among many other applications . trigonometric functions are commonly defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle , and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle ( a circle that has a radius of one ) . in order to define the trigonometric functions for the angle `` a '' , start with a right triangle that contains the angle `` a '' : we use the following names for the sides of the triangle :
