Ledger line     a ledger line is a short line used to write notes which would otherwise be too high or too low for the staff . a short line ( slightly longer than the note ) is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff , and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it . notes with at least three or four ledger lines are rarely used for composing and arranging . it is easier to change the clef or use the “ 8va ” sign ( called `` ottava '' sign ) . the piccolo always sounds an octave higher than the music written and the double bass always sounds an octave lower than written . some wind instruments also transpose up or down an octave to make it easier to read , e.g . the bass clarinet sounds a ninth ( just over an octave ) lower than the music which is written in the treble clef ( this makes it the same fingering as the clarinet ) . references . - anon . 2001 . `` leger [ ledger ] line '' . `` the new grove dictionary of music and musicians '' , second edition , edited by stanley sadie and john tyrrell . london : macmillan publishers .
