Lymphatic system     in mammals , the lymphatic system is a network of thin vessels that branch , like blood vessels , into tissues throughout the body . it is part of the immune system . it is a one-way system which carries cells and fluid back to the blood system . lymphatic vessels carry lymph , a colorless , watery fluid and white blood cells . it comes from interstitial fluid in the tissues which is squeezed out of the blood vessels . the lymphatic system transports infection-fighting cells called lymphocytes , and is involved in the removal of foreign matter and cell debris by phagocytes . a second function is to transport fats from the small intestine to the blood . lymphatic fluid gathers from the tissues and enters the valved lymphatic ducts . it is the valves which make sure the lymph flows the right way . on its way back to the blood system , the lymph passes through glands called lymph nodes , in places like the back of the neck , the armpits and the groin . lymph nodes swell in the region of an infected body part . this acts to keep the infection from spreading . it prevents or reduces the pathogens getting into the general blood circulation and reaching other parts of the body .
