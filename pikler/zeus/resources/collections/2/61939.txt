Pentecostalism     pentecostalism is a faith within evangelical christianity . it believes in a personal experience with god through the baptism of the holy spirit ( ) ; the same as in the biblical account on the day of pentecost . pentecostalism is similar to the charismatic groups , but it came about earlier and separated from the main church branches . charismatic christians , at least in the beginning , tended to stay in their denominations and did not divide away . there are three types of pentecostal churches . most believe that one must be saved by believing in jesus as their savior ; to be forgiven for their sins and to be pleasing to god . pentecostals also believe , like most other evangelicals , that the bible is true and must be obeyed in decisions of faith . in this majority group , speaking in tongues is the sign of the baptism of the holy spirit and is not required for salvation . to this group , the baptism of the holy spirit is a supernatural gift for ministry that one receives after they have become a christian .
