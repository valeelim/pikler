Sow bug     a sow bug or woodlouse is a small land arthropod ( jointed-legged animal ) . they are often confused with centipedes , millipedes or insects , but are actually crustaceans . they have fourteen legs and breathe through gills . because of the gills , woodlice need water in the air around them . they mostly eat dead plants , and are considered helpful , because they act as `` garbage collectors . '' some species can roll up into a ball when in danger . in such position , their hard shell faces out , protecting the softer parts of the body . sow bugs do not look like shrimps or crabs , although they are closely related .
