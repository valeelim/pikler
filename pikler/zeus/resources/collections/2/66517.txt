Loyalty     loyalty is a devotion for someone or something . someone who is loyal can be trusted , because they never betray the people they are loyal to . being loyal can also bring good to business because the boss , or person in control , may let the person do something difficult but greatly paid . this is because loyal people are expected and trusted to behave responsibly . some firms ( e.g . insurance brokers ) may give `` loyalty discounts '' to customers who stay with them for a long time ( who are loyal to the firm ) . some stores may offer their customers `` loyalty cards '' to get some money off their purchases .
