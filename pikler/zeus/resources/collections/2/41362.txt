Solution     in chemistry , a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances . the substances that are dissolved are called solutes . the substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent . an example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar ( which are crystalline solids ) , dissolved in a liquid ( like water ) . gases can dissolve in liquids . an example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water . liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases . the amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution . the solution with the large amount of solute is called a concentrated solution ; the solution with less solute is called a dilute solution . examples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals . for example , brass is an alloy of copper and zinc . related pages . - hypertonic - hypotonic
