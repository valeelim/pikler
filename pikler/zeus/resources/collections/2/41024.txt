Respiration     during respiration energy is released in a form that can be used by cells . all living things respire . both plant and animal cells use the process of respiration to release energy from glucose . there are two types of respiration . one is aerobic respiration and the other is anaerobic respiration . breaking down of food in presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration , whereas breaking down food in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic respiration . - animals obtain carbohydrates , such as starch and sugars , by eating them . some heat is released by these chemical reactions in cells , and it is this we experience as body heat . - plants make their own carbohydrates during photosynthesis . they get carbon dioxide from the environment and their energy from the sun . respiration takes place in a special structure called the mitochondria inside all eukaryote cells . see these ( in this order ) for an outline of the biochemistry of aerobic respiration : 1. cellular respiration 1. glycolysis
