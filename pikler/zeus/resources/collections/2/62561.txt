Burqa     a burqa is a piece of clothing . it is for muslim women . they can wear it as an outer garment . it only leaves a semi-transparent mesh in front of the woman 's eyes , so she can see . the rest of the body is covered by it . other garments for muslim women that cover less of their body are the hijab and the niqab . people often call the hijab and the niqab 'burqa ' because they do not know the right word for those garments . the quran does not say that women need to cover their faces with a veil , or cover their bodies with the full-body burqa . in france , italy , and the netherlands wearing a burqa in public is illegal .
