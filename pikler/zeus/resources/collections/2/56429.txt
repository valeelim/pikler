Division (mathematics)    division ( mathematics ) in mathematics , the word `` division '' means the operation which is the opposite of multiplication . the symbol for division can be a slash , a line , or the division sign ( formula_1 ) , as in : each , of those three , means `` 6 divided by 3 '' giving 2 as the answer . the first number is the dividend ( 6 ) , and the second number is the divisor ( 3 ) . the result ( or answer ) is the quotient . whole numbers , any left-over amount is called the `` remainder '' ( such as 14/4 gives 3 with the remainer as 2 , as the number , same as or 3.5 ) . the numbers can be very big , such as with two hundred : 200/5 = 40 , or with 7 billion : 7,000,000,000 / 1000 = 7,000,000 ( equals 7 million ) . if `` c '' times `` b '' equals `` a '' , written as : where `` b '' is not zero , then `` a '' divided by `` b '' equals `` c '' , written as : for instance , since in the above expression , `` a '' is called the dividend , `` b '' the divisor and `` c '' the quotient . division by zero ... is not defined . division is most often shown by placing the `` dividend '' over the `` divisor '' with a horizontal line , also called a vinculum , between them . for example , `` a '' divided by `` b '' is written
