Minister-President     a minister-president ( german : `` ministerprÃ¤sident '' ) is the head of government in a number of european countries or subnational governments , who presides over the council of ministers . the title is similar to prime minister , first minister , and president of the council . the german word means `` president of the ministers '' , therefor `` ministers ' president '' would be a more accurate translation . this person is the equivalent of a state premier in australia , a provincial premier in canada , or the governor of a state in the usa . each year one of the ministers-president , or one of the senior mayors of the city states of berlin , hamburg and bremen , is the president of the bundesrat . because germany does not have a vice president , the president of the bundesrat will act as the federal president if the federal president dies or is out of the country .
