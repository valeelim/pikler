Ankylosaurus     ankylosaurus ( `` ankylosaurus magniventris '' ) was a type of armoured dinosaur . it was the largest of its type , with a maximum length of 9 metres ( 30 feet ) . the body was broad and low-slung and covered in armour . carnivores , attacking from above , would find no weak points , and the animal could defend itself by using its clubbed tail . `` ankylosaurus '' was a herbivore , or plant-eater . because there was no grass in the dinosaur times , the ankylosaurus probably ate ferns and low shrubs . the most obvious feature of `` ankylosaurus '' is its armour , consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone , known as osteoderms or bony scutes , embedded in the skin . osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles , armadillos and some lizards . the bone was probably overlain by a tough , horny layer of keratin . these osteoderms ranged greatly in size , from wide , flat plates to small , round nodules . the plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animal 's neck , back , and hips , with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates . smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail . compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid `` euoplocephalus '' , the plates of `` ankylosaurus '' were smooth in texture , without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid `` edmontonia '' . a row of flat , triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail . tough , rounded scales protected the top of the skull , while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners .
