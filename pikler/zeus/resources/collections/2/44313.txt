Muon-catalyzed fusion     muon-catalyzed fusion ( Î¼cf ) is a type of cold nuclear fusion , which means that nuclear fusion can happen at low temperatures and under normal pressure . there need to be 3 particles : a muon , a positively charged triton and a positively charged deuteron . the muon , which has a greater mass ( when its not moving ) than an electron , drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it , creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion . this means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more protons then electrons , that contains a muon , and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier . this reaction can be done at room temperature or below , such as -270 degrees celsius . to create these , a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium , deuterium and tritium ( 3 first isotopes of hydrogen ) . the muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom . because the electron is replaced , any 2 atoms are bound together . this makes a molecular ion , also called a special muonic molecule . a muon is 207 times more massive then an electron . because of the difference in mass , the atom changes . because it is heavier , the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together , and then the nuclei , the centers of the atoms , join together . the following process is called nuclear fusion . the 2 nuclei join together and `` glue '' together . but , their weights do not just add up , a part of their mass is released as energy . this is the energy used .
