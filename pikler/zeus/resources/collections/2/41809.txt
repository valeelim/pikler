Meteor burst communication     meteor burst communication uses radio waves which bounce off the ionized trails made by meteors as they enter the earth ’ s atmosphere . it is also called meteor scatter communication . meteors are lumps of rock which are floating about in space . there are always meteors which are entering the earth ’ s atmosphere . they normally burn up in the atmosphere . a few very large ones that hit the earth are called 'meteorites ' . most meteors are only tiny specks of dust . as they enter the atmosphere the heat made by air friction rips off electrons . this produces an ionized trail . this trail can reflect radio waves in the same way that a wire would . the meteors that are used for meteor burst communication are between one thousandth and one hundredth of a gram . meteors which are smaller than this are too weak to be used . larger ones are not frequent enough . the ionized trail can last for several seconds . during this time messages can be sent between two radio communication stations . the messages will be transmitted very fast : about 200 times as fast as with ordinary shortwave radio communication . a teletypewriter may type several lines of text during a meteor burst . the two stations that want to communicate will have to be ready all the time as they never know when the next burst of communication will come . they may have to use several meteor bursts before the whole message is received . the transmitters are often put on buoys in the sea .
