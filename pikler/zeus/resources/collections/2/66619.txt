Intelligent design     intelligent design is a type of creationism . it believes that the universe is so complex that it must have been designed by a higher intelligent being . this theory is that life did not evolve by natural selection . creationists use intelligent design as an explanation of how life was formed . scientists in biology who believe evolution is true , think intelligent design is not real science because it is not supported by any scientific evidence . they think it is a religious idea instead of a scientific fact . intelligent design was developed by a group of american creationists to get around legal judgements like edwards v. aguillard , which said that creationism could not be taught in schools because of the first amendment . the first use of the term in this form was in the creationist textbook `` of pandas and people '' , published in 1989. intelligent design suggests that life is too complex to have evolved . scientists have discovered that even a single cell is complex . the genes in a cell code have a huge amount of information . therefore that information , like computer programming , has to come from an intelligent source and can not be made randomly . this is thought to be because the properties of entropy say things can not grow in complexity by randomness .
