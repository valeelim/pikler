Dissociative identity disorder     dissociative identity disorder ( did ) , is a mental disorder . it was called multiple personality disorder ( mpd ) . it is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual dsm iv . this is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it . the main symptoms of did are a person showing two or more `` identities '' or `` personality states '' . the person behaves differently depending which identity is in control . the second important symptom is when a person forgets important , personal things which people normally do not forget . a person is not diagnosed with did if the symptoms are caused by drugs , illness or ( with children ) pretending to play with imaginary friends . doctors must also rule out pretending to have did for attention or sympathy , and malingering ( pretending to have did for some personal gain ) . most patients with did are also diagnosed with other mental disorders . the dsm iv uses the terms `` identity '' , `` personality states '' and `` alternate identities '' when talking about did and other people use the term `` alters '' to mean the same thing . these words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition . professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a personality ; other terms , including dissociation and amnesia , may also be defined differently by different professionals . when talking about did , saying someone changes personalities or alters means the person speaks and acts differently , and usually responds to a different name .
