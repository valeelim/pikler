Valence electron     in chemistry , valence electrons are the electrons in the outside or `` valence '' electron shell of an atom . valence electrons are important in how a chemical element reacts with other elements . elements which have eight valence electrons ( noble gases ) are inert and they do not tend to create chemical reactions with other elements in the periodic table group . the number of valence electrons is also important for determining the group of an element in the periodic table , because an element 's number of valence electron is the same as the number of its group in the periodic table . to calculate the amount of valence electrons present in an element you have to find the last number of the electron configuration .
