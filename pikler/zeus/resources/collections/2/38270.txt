Cataract     a cataract is when the lens of the eye gets cloudy . cataracts can cause short-sightedness ( myopia ) , which means you can not see things in the distance but can see things up close . if not fixed by surgery , some types of cataracts will cause blindness ( which means you can not see anything at all ) . in a simple operation , the old lens can be replaced by a new plastic one . many thousands of people have had this operation .
