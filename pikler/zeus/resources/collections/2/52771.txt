Ion channel     ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help to establish and control the small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of all living cells ( see resting potential ) by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient . they are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells . an ion channel is an integral membrane protein or more typically an assembly of several proteins . the 2003 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to peter agre and roderick mackinnon for their discovery of ion channels . notes . - bertil hille : `` ion channels of excitable membranes '' , 3rd ed. , sinauer associates , sunderland , ma ( 2001 ) . isbn 0-87893-321-2 other websites . - an interview with roderick mackinnon freeview video by the vega science trust . - the voltage sensor in voltage-dependent ion channels - x-ray crystal structure of a potassium channel - neuromuscular disease center at washington university - nobel prize press release - international union of pharmacologists , ion channel compendium
