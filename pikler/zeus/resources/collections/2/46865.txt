Complexity theory     complexity theory is a type of computer science . it looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer , and how good particular solutions ( algorithms ) to that problem are . different algorithms that solve a problem may be better or worse in multiple ways . an algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm , but it may need more resources , like memory . part of complexity theory is understanding how algorithms perform in their worst-case scenario . an algorithm 's worst-case scenario is a problem that will take a long time , or lots of resources , to solve . if people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case , they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in `` every '' case . people are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average ; many algorithms are very inefficient in their worst case , but are okay on most cases . knowing how good an algorithm is on average lets people know what to generally expect when using that algorithm . related pages .
