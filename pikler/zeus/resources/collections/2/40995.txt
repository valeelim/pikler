Problem     a problem is a situation that is hard to deal with . the word comes from a greek word meaning an `` obstacle '' ( something that is in your way ) . if someone has a problem , they have to find a way of `` solving '' the problem . the way to solve it is called a solution . `` john has locked his car keys inside his car so that he can not get at them . john has a problem '' . some problems are made up for fun . these are like puzzles . some of them can be solved with logic , others can be solved by trial and error or by a `` heuristic '' . here is an example of a mathematical problem : `` john is three times as old as mary . in three years time he will be twice as old as mary . how old are john and mary ? '' the answer to this problem is that john is 9 and mary is 3. children often like to give one another problems that can be solved by `` lateral thinking '' . this means using the imagination rather than strict logic . here is an example : `` peter , ruth , samuel and jessica live in the same house . peter and ruth went out . when they returned they found jessica lying dead , surrounded by glass . they were sure samuel had done it . why did they not call the police ? '' the answer is : samuel was the cat and jessica was a goldfish .
