Boer     boer ( ipa : /bur/ ) is the dutch word for farmer which is used to call the descendants of the dutch farmers of southern africa during the 1700s , as well as those who left the cape colony during the 1800s to live in the orange free state , transvaal . they did this to escape the british rule , and the wars between the british imperial government and the native tribes on the eastern frontier . in 1657 , “ vrybriewe ” was granted to 9 burgers , the first farmers or boers ( boere ) at the cape . although they were not known as afrikaners , they did not regard themselves as living in a european country . as more and more immigrants from europe arrived at the cape the more international marriages took place . soon their language and culture was lost and transformed into the dietse nation . they regarded themselves as a new nation . paul heyns , born in 1696 christened his son michiel afrikanus ( the afrikaner ) . one hendrik bieslow in 1707 proclaimed in public “ ik ben een afrikaander ” . the boer later created the boer republics , which were deafeated in the 1880-1881 and 1899–1902 anglo-boer wars ( anglo-boere-oorlog ) . after that , many boers emigrated to other countries , but many still live in modern south africa , swaziland and rhodesia .
