Byzantium     byzantium ( greek : βυζάντιον ) was an ancient greek city . the name `` byzantium '' is a latinization of the original name byzantion . the city became the center of the byzantine empire , ( the greek-speaking roman empire of late antiquity and the middle ages ) , but at that time it was already called constantinople . the origins of byzantium are not clear . there is only a legend . it tells that a certain byzas from megara ( a town near athens ) , founded byzantium , when he sailed northeast across the aegean sea . he had asked the oracle at delphi where he should found his new city . the oracle told him to find it `` opposite the blind . '' at the time , he did not know what this meant . but when he came upon the bosporus he realized what it meant : on the asiatic shore was a greek city , chalcedon . it was they who must have been blind because they had not seen that obviously superior land was just a half mile away on the other side of the bosporus . byzas founded his city here in this `` superior '' land and named it byzantion after himself .
