Air gun     an air gun is a gun which uses gas to fire a projectile instead of burning gunpowder that an ordinary gun uses . the oldest air guns used a spring to compress ( squeeze ) air in a tube . when the gun was fired the air was released . the only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out . a spring loaded gun can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset . newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge , these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled . the projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet . some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call `` bb '' s. some people think this means ball bearing , but it does not . the letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges , this was used in the first bb guns . the most popular calibres ( pellet sizes ) for air weapons are mm ( also called .177 to .22 ) . in many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one .
