Divisor     in mathematics , a divisor of an integer `` n '' , also called a factor of `` n '' , is an integer which evenly divides `` n '' without leaving a remainder . any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself , which are two of the divisors . a prime number has no other divisors . finding one or more factors of a given number is called factorization . for example , 7 is a divisor of 42 because 42÷7 = 6. we also say 42 is divisible by 7 or 42 is a multiple of 7 or 7 divides 42 or 7 is a factor of 42 and we usually write 7 | 42. for example , the positive divisors of 42 are 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 42. in general , we say `` m÷n '' for non-zero integers `` m '' and `` n '' iff there exists an integer `` k '' such that `` n '' = `` km '' . thus , divisors can be negative as well as positive , although often we restrict our attention to positive divisors . ( for example , there are six divisors of four , 1 , 2 , 4 , -1 , -2 , -4 , but one would usually mention only the positive ones , 1 , 2 , and 4 . ) 1 and -1 divide ( are divisors of ) every integer , every integer is a divisor of itself , and every integer is a divisor of 0 , except by convention 0 itself ( see also division by zero ) . numbers divisible by 2 are called even and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd .
