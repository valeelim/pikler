European Union member state     a european union member state is any one of the twenty-eight countries that have joined the european union ( eu ) since it was found in 1958 as the european economic community ( eec ) . from an original membership of six states , there have been five successive enlargements . the largest happened on 1 may 2004 , when ten member states joined . following the addition of croatia in 2013 , the eu 's membership now stands at twenty-eight . negotiations are also under way with other states . the process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as european integration . however , this term is also used to refer to the intensification of cooperation between eu member states as national governments allow for the gradual centralising of power within european institutions . before being allowed to join the european union , a state must fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the copenhagen criteria : these basically require that a candidate member state must enjoy a secular , democratic system of government , together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions , and respect the rule of law . under the terms of the treaty on european union , enlargement of the union is conditional upon the agreement of each existing member state as well as approval by the european parliament .
