Cogeneration     cogeneration ( also combined heat and power , chp ) is the use of a heat engine or a power station to make both electricity and useful heat at the same time . conventional power plants emit the heat created as a byproduct of electricity generation into the environment through cooling towers , as flue gas , or by other means . combined heat and power captures the byproduct heat for domestic or industrial heating purposes , either very close to the plant , or - especially in scandinavia and eastern europe - for distribution through pipes to heat local housing . byproduct heat at moderate temperatures ( 100 to 180Â°c ) can also be used in absorption chillers for cooling . a plant producing electricity , heat and cold is sometimes called regeneration or more generally : polygene ration plant . cogeneration is a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel . in separate production of electricity some energy is lost as waste heat , but in cogeneration this energy performs useful work ( see energy ) . thermal power plants ( including those that use fissile elements or burn coal , petroleum , or natural gas ) , and heat engines in general , do not convert all of their available energy into electricity . in most heat engines , a bit more than half is wasted as excess heat ( see : second law of thermodynamics ) . by capturing the excess heat , chp uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional power plant , potentially reaching an efficiency of up to 70 % , compared with at most 40 % for the conventional plants . this means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy . also , less pollution is produced for a given economic benefit .
