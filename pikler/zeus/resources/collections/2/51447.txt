Mussel     mussels are several families of bivalve molluscs . mussels live in lakes , rivers , and creeks . they sometimes also live in intertidal areas along coastlines worldwide . the freshwater mussels ( several allied families , the largest being the unionidae ) and saltwater mussels ( family mytilidae ) are not closely related , despite the fact that they may look similar . they are grouped in different subclasses . the freshwater zebra mussels and their relatives ( family dreissenidae ) live attached to rocks in a manner similar to marine mussels , but are classified with the heterodonta , the taxonomic group including most bivalves referred to as `` clams '' . from archeology , it is known that humans have been eating mussels for thousands of years . they can be cooked or eaten raw . care must be taken however as mussels quickly become poisonous after they die . other websites . - freshwater mussel genera - methods of mussel farming - photo of `` bouchot '' pilings for growing mussels - gilbertson , lance .
