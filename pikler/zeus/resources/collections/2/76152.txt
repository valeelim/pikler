Extrusion     extrusive means to the mode of igneous volcanic rock formation in which hot magma from inside the earth flows out ( extrudes ) onto the surface as lava or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff . this is opposed to intrusive rock formation , in which magma does not reach the surface . extruded when talking about an artificial material like soft metals like aluminium , plastic or glass means that it is pushed out of a nozzle when the material is in a soft state . the shape of the nozzle will vary depending on the shape required in the finished product
