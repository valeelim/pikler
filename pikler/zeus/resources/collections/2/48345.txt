Cell theory     cell theory is a way to describe the biology of living things . cell theory says that the cell is the basic unit of life . cells by themselves are alive , but they can also be part of a larger living thing . the smallest living organisms ( like bacteria but not viruses ) and the biggest ones ( like humans and whales ) are all made of cells . very small organisms like bacteria and amoebas are only made of one cell each , so they are called unicellular organisms ( `` uni '' means `` one '' ) . larger organisms are made of many cells , and they are called multicellular organisms . cell theory has three basic points : 1. all living things are made of cells . 1. the cell is the smallest living thing that can perform all the functions of life . 1. all cells come from pre-existing cells . cells are born from older cells , in a process called cell division . cells contain information that is passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells , so that the daughter cells can do what they need to do . this information is carried on molecules called dna .
