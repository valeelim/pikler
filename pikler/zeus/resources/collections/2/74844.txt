Parking     parking a vehicle means stopping and leaving it somewhere . it is important to make sure that the vehicle is parked somewhere where parking is allowed , otherwise the driver may have to pay a fine , or even worse , the vehicle may be clamped . cars are usually parked in driveways , parking lots , garages , or on the side of the street . parking a car is easier than parking a large vehicle such as a lorry ( truck ) or a coach . these large vehicles often have to go to special parks . rules about parking are part of traffic rules , and these will vary a lot from one country to another . it is illegal to park on the sidewalk when driving along a road , the driver may see a space big enough for him to park his vehicle . he should stop just after he has passed the space , alongside the next car , then reverse ( go backwards ) slowly in , aiming towards the curb , then turning the steering wheel so that he just misses the car in front . then he can adjust , leaving equal room between the two cars . this process is called `` parallel parking '' . if the space is wide enough for two cars he can drive forwards into the space instead of reversing in . parking correctly takes practice and some experience . the driver should not ram or scrub a wheel against the curb . this can puncture the tire .
