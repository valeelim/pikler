Fall of Man     the fall of man ( also called `` the story of the fall '' or `` the fall '' ) is the story in the book of genesis in the torah ( old testament ) of when adam and eve , in god 's eyes , lost their innocence . genesis says that adam and eve ate from the tree of knowledge even after god told them it was not allowed . adam and eve lost their innocence and were thrown out of the garden of eden , where the tree of knowledge was . in christian religion , all of man lost their innocence because adam and eve disobeyed god and had to be punished , so man can now tell good from bad and life from death . the fall , for many christians , means humans can not make themselves holy enough to get into heaven when they die . it is only possible to get into heaven because jesus christ sacrificed himself . judaism , christianity and islam believe the story of the fall is the truth , but each explains it differently . islam says the fall was just a historic event and did not change human nature at all . it says adam and his wife were thrown out of the garden of eden and forced to work and suffer because adam ate from the tree of knowledge . but god still gave others who were still loyal to him the chance to get into heaven .
