Juan Crisóstomo de Arriaga     juan crisóstomo de arriaga y balzola ( born bilbao 27 january 1806 ; died paris 17 january 1826 ) was an early 19th-century spanish composer . he was still only 19 years old when he died . like mozart , he was a child prodigy and he might have become one of the world ’ s most famous composers if he had lived . juan crisóstomo arriaga was born in bilbao , in the basque country in spain . his father and older brother first taught him music . he started to compose when he was 11 and had already written 20 works by the time he was 15. many of these are now lost . he may have thrown them away later thinking that they were not very good . in 1921 he went to paris where he studied the violin with pierre baillot , and counterpoint and harmony with françois-joseph fétis at the paris conservatoire . he was so good that by 1824 he had become a teaching assistant in fétis 's class . arriaga died in paris at the age of nineteen , probably of a lung disease and exhaustion . arriaga has been called “ the spanish mozart ” . his music , however , does not sound particularly spanish . it has a more general european character , based on the style of mozart and beethoven . he wrote a symphony which sounds at times like schubert . he also wrote an opera `` los esclavos felices '' ( `` the happy slaves '' ) , and three string quartets . the string quartets were the only works that were published while he was still alive .
