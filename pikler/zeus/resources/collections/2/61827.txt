Spectrometer     a spectrometer is an optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum . the independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light . the variable measured is most often the light 's intensity but could also , for instance , be the polarization state . a spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities . spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths , from gamma rays and x-rays into the far infrared . in general , any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum . below optical frequencies ( that is , at microwave , radio , and audio frequencies ) , the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device . spectrometers are used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials . spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry . early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light . modern spectroscopes , such as monochromators , generally use a diffraction grating , a movable slit , and some kind of photodetector , all automated and controlled by a computer . the spectroscope was invented by gustav robert georg kirchhoff and robert wilhelm bunsen .
