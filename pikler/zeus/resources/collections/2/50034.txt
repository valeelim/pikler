Autotroph     an autotroph ( from greek `` autos '' = self and `` trophe '' = nutrition ) is an organism that makes organic compounds from simple molecules . autotrophs are needed in every food chain in all ecosystems . they take energy from the environment ( sun light or inorganic sources ) and use it to make other organic molecules that are used to carry out various biological functions such as cell growth or repairing broken tissue . plants and other organisms that carry out photosynthesis are phototrophs ( or photoautotrophs ) . bacteria that use inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide , phosphorus or iron are called chemoautotrophs . other organisms , called heterotrophs , eat autotrophs . there are some species that need organic compounds as a source of food , but are able to use light as a source of energy . these are not autotrophic , but heterotrophic . a mixotroph is a ( micro ) organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon .
