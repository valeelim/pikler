Hemoglobin     hemoglobin ( or haemoglobin ) is a protein in red blood cells which contains iron . it is used to transport oxygen around the human body . hemoglobin is found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates apart from white-blooded fish . it also occurs in some invertebrates . hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases . it carries some of the body 's respiratory carbon dioxide ( about 20-25 % of the total ) . red blood cells get their color from hemoglobin , which is red . there are millions of hemoglobin molecules in each red blood cell and millions of red blood cells in the human body . when hemoglobin has oxygen attached , it is called oxyhemoglobin . the most common type of hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits . each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein ( globin ) with a heme group inside it . each heme group has one iron atom . this binds one oxygen molecule . so the complete hemoglobin molecule has four globin chains , four heme molecules , and four iron atoms . when hemoglobin is in the lungs , it picks up oxygen in its hemes , and carries it to the rest of the body .
