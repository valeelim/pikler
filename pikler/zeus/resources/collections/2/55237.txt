Bryozoa     bryozoans , or ectoprocta , are a phylum of small aquatic animals living in colonies . the colonies usually have a skeleton of calcium carbonate . bryozoans have a long fossil history , starting in the ordovician . in their life-style they resemble the polyps which form coral . bryozoa are known informally as moss animals or sea mats . they generally like warm , tropical waters but live all over the world . there are about 5,000 living species , and 15,000 fossil species are known . the colonies are formed by tiny ( ~0.2mm ) members called zooids . they secrete tubes , usually of lime ( caco ) , sometimes of chitin , an organic compound . the zooids in a colony are all clones , produced by asexual reproduction . despite this , most species produce different morphs : zooids with different functions . all bryozoa have a lophophore . this is a ring of ten tentacles surrounding the mouth , each tentacle covered with cilia . when feeding , the zooid extends the lophophore outwards ; when resting it is withdrawn into the mouth to protect it from predators .
