Decapod     decapoda is an order of crustaceans in the class malacostraca . many familiar groups , such as crayfish , crabs , lobsters , prawns and shrimp are in this order . many decapods are scavengers - they eat dead plants and animals . crabs are mixed feeders , taking algae and shellfish such as molluscs . lobsters eat mostly live prey . as their name suggests , all decapods have ten appendages . the last five pairs of appendages on the front half of the body , the `` cephalothorax '' , are used for walking . in many decapods , the front pair of appendages carry large pinching claws . the claws are called `` chelae '' , so these appendages may be called `` chelipeds '' . the front three pairs of appendages on the thorax are used as jaws , and called `` maxillipeds '' . on the abdomen are swimming appendages called `` pleopods '' , and the body ends in a tail fan . classification of the order decapoda depends on the structure of the gills and legs , and the way in which the larvae develop . there are two suborders : dendrobranchiata and pleocyemata . prawns ( including many so-called `` shrimp '' , such as the atlantic white shrimp ) make up the dendrobranchiata . the other groups , including true shrimp , are the pleocyemata .
