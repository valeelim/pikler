Endocarditis     endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart . endocarditis most often affects the heart valves . the heart valves are a part of the human body that does not get blood . this is odd because they are a part of the heart itself . because of this , if one of the valves gets infected with bacteria or protozoa , the body can not defend itself against those bacteria . this can cause the valve to not work the way it should .
