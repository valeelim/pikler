Artery     an artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to other parts of the body . almost all arteries carry blood with a lot of oxygen in it . the only arteries that do not carry oxygen-rich blood are the pulmonary artery , and ( in a fetus ) the umbilical artery . every artery has three layers . the outer layer is a thick covering made of stretchy tissue . the middle layer is made of muscle , so the artery can get wider or get smaller when the body needs it to . the inner lining is made of the same cells that line the heart . arteries are deep under the skin . they do not have valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards . instead , every time the heart beats , the arteries stretch out so the blood has room to go through . once the walls have completely stretched out , the muscles in the arteries make them shrink back to their normal size . this pushes the blood through . the aorta is the main artery in the human body . it starts in the left ventricle of the heart , which is full of blood that just picked up oxygen in the lungs . ( this is called `` oxygenated '' blood - meaning it has a lot of oxygen in it . ) the left ventricle pumps this oxygen-rich blood out through the aorta . the aorta brings this blood to every organ in the body .
