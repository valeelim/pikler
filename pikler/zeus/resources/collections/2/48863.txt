Defibrillator     a defibrillator is a machine that can help when ventricular fibrillation happens in the heart of a human . a defibrillator is a life saving device . fibrillation happens when many different cells in the heart begin to act as pacemaker cells . this means that many thousands of cells tell the heart to beat , all at different times and with no rhythm . this confusion causes the heart to become unable to move blood around the body . this causes cardiac arrest and death . a defibrillator sends a high energy pulse from the top-right of the heart to the bottom-middle of the heart . this causes the whole heart to stop all activity . the heart 's normal pacemaker then can try and restart normal beating . defibrillation does not always work . implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( icd ) are defibrillators that are designed to help patients from inside their body . they are put inside people that are at high-risk of going into cardiac arrest and monitor a person 's heart rate , rhythm , and waveform . by comparing the activity in the different chambers of the heart , an icd can detect cardiac arrhythmias and treat them quickly .
