Siegfried (opera)    siegfried ( opera ) siegfried is an opera by richard wagner . it is the third of the four operas that together tell a story called `` der ring des nibelungen '' ( `` the ring of the nibelung '' ) . the story continues from the end of the second opera which was called `` die walküre '' . the first performance of `` siegfried '' took place when the whole ring cycle ( all four operas ) were performed in the festspielhaus in bayreuth on 16 august 1876. the first part of the opera takes place in a forest where the giant fafner lives . he has used the magic tarn helmet to change himself into a dragon so that he can guard the treasure of the gold and the ring ( we saw how he got the treasure in the first opera , `` das rheingold '' ) . siegfried , who was not yet born at the end of the second opera , `` die walküre '' , is now a young lad . he has been brought up by the dwarf mime , alberich 's brother . mime is just as horrible as his brother . mime is hammering away at the anvil , trying to repair the sword that was smashed to pieces by wotan in act two of `` die walküre '' . he wants to make the bits into a strong sword , but every time he thinks he has managed it siegfried picks up the sword and breaks it with his strength . the reason that mime wants to make the sword is so that he can give it to siegfried ( who is obviously the hero who is meant to have the sword in the end ) and tell him to fight the dragon . then mime will be able to get the ring from him so that he can have power over all the world . when siegfried enters he brings a bear from the forest . the bear chases mime and siegfried laughs . then he lets the bear go free .
