Eutheria     eutheria is the taxonomical name for the main group of living mammals . this taxon contains the placental mammals , of which humans are one species . eutheria was introduced by thomas henry huxley in 1880. members of eutheria are now found on all continents and in all oceans . the terms 'eutheria and 'placental ' do not mean quite the same thing . a few early eutherians in the lower cretaceous were not placentals . `` eomaia '' is the earliest example . all living eutherians are placental mammals . this means that a eutherian fetus is fed during gestation by a placenta . the offspring of eutherians are carried in the mother 's uterus until fully developed . eutherians are different from other mammal groups such as monotremes and marsupials which ( like the earliest eutherians ) are not placental . monotremes , for example , lay eggs which protect the young until they are fully developed . marsupials give birth to young who are not completely developed . their young then move to a special pouch in the mother 's body to continue their development .
