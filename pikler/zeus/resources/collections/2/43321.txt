Movement (music)    movement ( music ) long pieces of classical music are often divided into movements . they are like different sections of the piece . movements can be quite short , or extremely long . if you listen to a symphony it may often be divided into four movements . in the time of haydn and mozart the four movements were normally : a fast movement , a slow movement , a dance-like movement ( minuet ) and a fast movement to end the work . concert programmes usually show how many movements there are in the work that is being performed . it may show this using italian musical terms ( e.g . `` allegro '' meaning `` fast '' , `` presto '' meaning `` very fast '' or `` andante '' meaning `` a gentle walking pace '' ) . here is an example : robert schumann : symphony no 4 in d minor op.120 1. andante con moto â€“ allegro di molto 1. romanze : andante 1. scherzo : presto 1. finale : allegro vivace - presto sometimes an orchestra will take a minute or two to retune their instruments , especially in a symphony by mahler or shostakovich where one movement might be as long as 25 minutes . at other times the conductor or performer will want to go almost straight on with hardly any break . sometimes the composer shows that there should be no break at all between movements .
