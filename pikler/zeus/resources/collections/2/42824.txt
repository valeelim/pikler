Mitosis     mitosis is part of the cycle of cell division . the chromosomes of a cell are copied to make two identical sets of chromosomes , and the cell nucleus divides into two identical nuclei . before mitosis , the cell creates an identical set of its own genetic information â€“ this is called replication . the genetic information is in the dna of the chromosomes . at the beginning of mitosis the chromosomes wind up into visible objects that can be seen with a light microscope . the chromosomes are now two chromatids joined at the centromere . since the two chromatids are identical to each other , they are called `` sister '' chromatids . mitosis happens in all types of dividing cells in the human body except with sperm and ova . the sperm and ova are gametes or sex cells . the gametes are produced by a different division method called meiosis . there are five phases of mitosis . each phase is used to describe what kind of change the cell is going through . the phases are prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase and telophase .
