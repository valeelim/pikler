Identity (mathematics)    identity ( mathematics ) in mathematics , the term identity has several important uses : - an identity is an equality that remains true even if you change all the variables that are used in that equality . an equality in mathematical sense is only true under more particular conditions . for this , the symbol â‰¡ is sometimes used . ( however , this can lead to misunderstandings since the same symbol can also be used for a congruence relation . ) - in algebra , an identity or identity element of a set `` s '' with a binary operation is an element `` e '' which combined with any element `` s '' of `` s '' produces `` s '' . - the identity function from a set `` s '' to itself , often denoted formula_1 or formula_2 , such that formula_3 for all `` x '' in `` s '' . - in linear algebra , the identity matrix of size n is the n-by-n square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere . a common example of the first meaning is the trigonometric identity which is true for all real values of formula_5 ( since the real numbers formula_6 are the domain of sin and cos ) , as opposed to
