Sharia     sharia , sharia law or islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the islamic tradition . the arabic word `` shar朝平ah '' ( ) refers to the revealed law of god and originally meant `` way '' or `` path '' . classical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life , including religious rituals , family life , business , crimes , and warfare . in former times , sharia was interpreted by independent jurists , who based their legal opinions on qur'an , hadith and centuries of debate , interpretation and precedent . some parts of sharia can be described as `` law '' in the usual sense of that word , while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with god 's will . modern countries in the muslim world all have their own laws . in most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia . muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world . people of different religions who speak arabic use the word `` shar朝平ah '' to describe a religous tradition that comes from teachings of prophets . christians and jews in the middle east have used it to describe their own religion . for many muslims the word `` sharia '' means simply `` justice '' . they will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society .
