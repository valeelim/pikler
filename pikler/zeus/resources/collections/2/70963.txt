Taíno     the taínos were an indigenous people that lived in the americas before columbus arrived there . they came from the caribbean coast of south america . around 1200 ce , they moved northward to the island chain of the lesser antilles and the greater antilles . when christopher columbus came to the americas , the taínos were living in the bahamas , the greater antilles ( cuba , jamaica , hispaniola and puerto rico ) , and some islands of the northern lesser antilles . their culture was different from the culture of the arawak people ( another indigenous group of south america ) . they were the first people that the spanish met in the americas . the name taíno was given by columbus . when he met some native men , they said `` taíno , taíno '' , meaning `` we are good , noble '' . columbus thought that taíno was the name of the people . rouse divides the taínos into three main groups . one is the classic taíno , from hispaniola and puerto rico . another is the western taíno or sub-taíno , from jamaica , cuba ( except for the western tip of the island ) and the bahamas . the third is the eastern taíno , from the virgin islands to montserrat .
