Four-wheel drive     a four-wheel drive ( also called 4wd and 4x4 ) is a vehicle on which all four wheels get power from the engine to move forward . this is as opposed to a two-wheel drive vehicle . 4wds are often used off road . part-time and full-time four wheel drive vehicles uses a transfer case as part of the drivetrain to direct power to one or both axles . by having a transfer case the driver can shift the vehicle into either `` two-wheel-drive '' or `` four-wheel-drive '' mode ( part-time systems ) . many transfer cases also have a low power range that multiplies the engine power when in four-wheel drive ( called four-wheel low gear ) . there are basically four types of four-wheel drive . part-time systems are the most basic type . they are also still the most popular type for using off-road . the can be shifted ( mechanically or electrically ) from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive . this gives them the versatility to operate both on and off-road . when the four-wheel drive system is engaged , the two axles turn at the same speed . there usually is no center differential . for that reason part-time four-wheel drive should not be used on dry pavement . if operated for any distance on dry pavement tire damage and drivetrain damage is very possible . because it operates off-road , the vehicle typically has a higher ride height . this is to go over obstacles on uneven ground without damage . even when operated in two-wheel drive on-road , this system will not get the fuel economy of a comparable two-wheel drive vehicle . locking hubs are available on some models . they help to get better fuel mileage by disengaging the front axle differential .
