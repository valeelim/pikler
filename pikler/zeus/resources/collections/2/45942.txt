Muon     the muon is an elementary particle . it has a negative electric charge and half spin . its symbol is `` Î¼ '' . it is one type of lepton . the muon has an average life time of 2.2 micro-seconds or 0.0000022 seconds . a muon is like an electron but it is 200 times heavier . unlike an electron , it decays into other particles . the superparticle of a muon is called a `` smuon . '' muons can be made in particle accelerators with energy levels above 105.7 mev . cosmic rays from the sun also make muons : 1. the photons in the cosmic rays crash into air molecules . 1. pions are made in the crash 1. the pions undergo atomic decay into neutrinos and muons . muons are unstable elementary particles and are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter than all other particles . they decay via the weak interaction . because the total of the lepton numbers of the starting and ending particles must be the same , one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino . because charge must be kept the same , one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon . so , all muons decay to at least an electron , and two neutrinos . sometimes , besides these necessary products , additional other particles that have a net charge and spin of zero ( e.g. , a pair of photons , or an electron-positron pair ) , are produced .
