Kangaroo rat     kangaroo rats are small rodents from north and central america . they got their name , because they look like small kangaroos , when standing upright . but they are not related to kangaroos , except that they are mammals . the genus of the kangaroo rats is called dipodomys . currently , there are 22 species in that genus . they vary in size from 10cm to 20cm , and weight between 35 and 180 grams for adult animals . kangaroo rats live in dry climates.they can live in deserts also , like thar desert . this means that they have developed traits to other species that live in such climates , but are not related to them . some of those species are the jerboas , which can be found in the deserts of africa and asia , and the hopping mice of the australian outback . all of those species have highly developed hind legs . they also live in deep burrows that protect them from the worst heat of the day . water may be difficult to find in such climates . therefore , they only rarely need to drink water . instead , they have a very efficient metabolism . their kidneys are much more efficient than human kidneys . they can also chemically split off water from the food they eat .
