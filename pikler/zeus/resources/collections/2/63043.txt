Illusion     an illusion is a distortion of perception . the brain arranges , sorts , and organises data from the senses . normally the system works well . sometimes it does not , and we see illusions . in general , they are shared by most people in the same situation . illusions can happen with all five senses ( taste , touch , sight , smell , and hearing ) , and some involve the way information from two senses is put together . some illusions happen because of disorders , but generally , all normal people can sense the same illusion . an illusion is different from a hallucination ; a halucination is sensing something which is not real , but an illusion is interpreting what we sense wrongly . optical illusions are the best known and understood . because they are illusions common to most people , it follows that they are a product of the visual system . the visual system , from the retina to the visual cortex , is what is common to most humans . these are illusions which are heard . the person listening hears sounds that aren ’ t really there , or sounds that can ’ t really happen . a shepard tone is an auditory illusion .
