Food chain     a food chain shows the feeding relationship between different living things in a particular environment or habitat . plants are the bottom of a food chain because they are autotrophs that make their food from the non-living environment . organisms that can make their own food are called producers . consumers are animals that eat producers or other animals . the animal that eats the producer is called the primary consumer . the animal that eats the primary consumer is called a secondary consumer . the animal that eats the secondary consumer is called a third order consumer and so on to fourth , fifth , etc . the direction of arrows between the organisms shows who eats what . also , a food chain represents a series of events in which food and energy are transferred from one organism in an ecosystem to another . food chains show how energy is passed from the sun to producers , from producers to consumers , and from consumers to decomposers . they also show how animals depend on other organisms for food .
