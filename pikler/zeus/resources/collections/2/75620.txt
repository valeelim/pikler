Kaaba     the kaaba is a large cube-shaped building inside the mosque known as al-masjid al-haram in mecca , saudi arabia . the mosque has hundreds of windows around it . the mosque was built around the original kaaba . muslims believe it is a reflection of a heavenly house primarily built by adam . it is made of standard blocks , with black and gold cloth around it . the kaaba is the holiest place in islam . muslims are required to make a pilgrimage ( hajj ) once in a lifetime to the kaaba . as it is the most holy place in islam all muslims pray towards this when they perform the five fardh ( necessary acts mentioned in the quran ) salaah or prayer . at the end of hajj season , there is a holiday called eid al-adha ( english : festival of sacrifice ) . muslims who can afford to do so or who have made the hajj must buy an animal , usually a goat , to sacrifice according to islamic laws and cook as food or give away to the poor , if they have the money for it . muslims believe that abraham , one of allah 's earliest messengers , was told by allah on the day of eid al-adha to sacrifice his son in jerusalem . but the angel gabriel congratulated abraham 's obedience to allah and gave him a lamb instead .
