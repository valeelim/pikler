Deutschland Tour     the deutschland tour ( english : `` tour of germany '' and sometimes `` deutschland-rundfahrt '' in german ) is the most important stage race in germany . initially the race was held in may/june . since 2005 it has been part of the uci protour and has been moved to august . already in 1911 a `` national '' cycling race of over 1,500 km was held in the german empire ( germany was then lots of more or less independent kingdoms , duchies , and other little countries ) . until 1931 several tours were held , organised by different groups . in 1931 the first `` deutschlandtour '' was held . the race was well organised and exciting between 1937 and 1939 , but stopped again at the start of world war ii . there was not a lot of road cycling in germany , and the tour 's popularity depended on german riders doing well in other races . this resulted in several parallel tours of west germany . but after jan ullrich 's 1997 tour de france victory , cycling became more popular . partly as because of germany 's new-found cycling enthusiasm , the `` bund deutscher radfahrer e.v . '' ( german cyclists ' federation ) and the company upsolut founded the deutschland tour `` gmbh '' ( ltd ) 1999 the `` deutschlandtour '' restarted , but has not been run since 2008 because of a lack of interest from tv sponsors .
