Wide Area Network     a wide area network , or wan , is made up of several computer networks connected together , often over the internet . in most cases , the networks in wans all belong to the same company or school . wans are used to connect lans and other types of networks together , so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations . many wans are built for one particular organization and are private . others , built by internet service providers , provide connections from an organization 's lan to the internet . wans are often built using leased lines . at each end of the leased line , a router connects to the lan on one side and a hub within the wan on the other . leased lines can be very expensive . instead of using leased lines , wans can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods . network protocols including tcp/ip deliver transport and addressing functions . protocols including packet over sonet/sdh , mpls , atm and frame relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in wans . x.25 was an important early wan protocol , and is often considered to be the `` grandfather '' of frame relay as many of the underlying protocols and functions of x.25 are still in use today ( with upgrades ) by frame relay .
