Quince     the quince is a fruit that grows on small trees . it is in the same family as apples and pears . it starts green colored and then ripens to a bright golden yellow color , and looks like a bumpy lemon . the quince fruit is too hard to eat . it can be cooked to make it soft . or it can be left out on purpose to rot a little which makes it soft . if it is damaged by frost , that helps start the process of making it soft and good to eat . quinces are mainly used for making jelly and jam . the interior of a quince is white when it is raw , but it becomes pinkish orange when it is cooked , so that is the color of the jelly or jam when it is made .
