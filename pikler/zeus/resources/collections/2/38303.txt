Maglev train     maglev trains are a very fast type of train . magnetic levitation is a technology that uses magnetic fields to make the train move . these fields lift the train a small distance above the tracks and moves the train . they are much faster than regular trains . by 2035 , a trip from toronto to vancouver will take 3 hours . this same trip takes three days on a regular train . after this technology has been perfected , people will be able to travel faster across land on a maglev train than they would in an airplane . the highest known speed of a maglev train is . this was done in japan in 2015. a maglev train does not have an engine . the trains are powered by a magnetic field created by the electrified coils in the guideway walls and the track . there are three parts to this system : 1. a large electrical power source 1. metal coils lining a guideway ( track ) 1. large guidance magnets attached to the under side of the train . with magnets , opposite poles attract and like poles repel each other . this is the basic principle behind electromagnetic propulsion . electromagnets are similar to other magnets in that they attract metal objects , but the magnetic pull is temporary . a small electromagnet can be made by connecting the ends of a copper wire to the positive and negative ends of an aa , c or d-cell battery . this creates a small magnetic field . if the wire is disconnected from either end of the battery , the magnetic field is taken away .
