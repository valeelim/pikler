Manure     manure is organic matter used as fertilizer in agriculture . manures improve the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients , such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil . higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life . the term `` manure '' was used for inorganic fertilizers in the past , but this usage is now very rare . the word manure came from middle english `` manuren '' meaning `` to cultivate land , '' and initially from french `` main-oeuvre '' = `` hand work '' alluding to the work which involved manuring land . there are two classes of manures in soil management : green manures and animal manures . compost is distinguished from manure in that it is the `` decomposed '' remnants of organic materials ( which may , nevertheless , include manure ) . most animal manure is fecesâ€“excrement ( variously called `` droppings '' or `` crap '' etc . ) of plant-eating mammals ( herbivores ) and plant material ( often straw ) which has been used as bedding for animals and thus is heavily contaminated with their feces and urine .
