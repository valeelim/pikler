Plow     a plow or plough is a simple machine used in farming . a plow is pulled across the ground by a human or animal . when pulled across the ground , the plow lifts up dirt and makes two lines of dirt behind it . the dirt lifted by the plow is more loose than before . ground that has been plowed is a good place for a farmer to grow food . early in the agricultural revolution , simple hand-held digging sticks or hoes would have been used in areas with good soil , such as the area near the nile river in africa . at the nile , the annual flood makes the soil better by `` rejuvenating '' it , to create places where seeds could be planted . to help crops grow in areas where floods were rare , the soil had to be rejuvenated in a different way . this is when plowing was first used , and hoes were the first plows .
