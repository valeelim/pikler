Tsetse fly     tsetse flies are large biting flies that live in the tropical regions of africa . they bite vertebrates , and drink their blood . they are the insect vectors of some serious diseases . they have been studied a lot because they can spread sleeping sickness and other diseases . the genus `` glossina '' has about 34 species in three groups of species . one group of species lives out on the savannah ; another group lives near rivers , and the third group lives in tropical forests . tsetse have an unusual life cycle . female tsetse only fertilize one egg at a time and keep each egg in their uterus while the offspring develops internally during the first larval stages . during this time , the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus . in the third larval stage , the tsetse larva finally leave the uterus and crawl into the ground . there it forms a hard outer shell and becomes the pupa . it completes its metamorphosis into an adult fly . this takes twenty to thirty days , while the larva relies on stored resources .
