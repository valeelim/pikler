Order of operations     the order of operations is a mathematical and algebraic set of rules . it is used to evaluate ( solve ) and simplify expressions and equations . the order of operations is the order that different mathematical operations are done . the standard mathematical operations are addition ( + ) , subtraction ( − ) , multiplication ( * or × ) , division ( / ) , brackets ( which are grouping symbols , like parentheses ( ) or [ ] ) and exponentiation ( ^n or , also called orders or indices ) . mathematicians have agreed on a correct order to use operations , and it is very important that they know these rules . when people are solving a problem with more than one operation , they will need to know the correct order to solve the problem correctly . otherwise the answer will be wrong . follow all the rules in this order from left to right in the equation . use operations inside brackets and solve any indices . you should always solve brackets first when solving an equation . example : when seeing an exponent , solve it first after solving the brackets . ( 5 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 )
