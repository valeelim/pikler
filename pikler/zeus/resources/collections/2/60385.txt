Cytosol     the cytosol ( cf . `` cytoplasm '' , which also includes the organelles ) is the internal fluid of the cell , and a part of cell metabolism occurs here . proteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis . cytosol mostly consists of water , dissolved ions , small molecules , and large water-soluble molecules ( such as protein ) . it contains about 20 % to 30 % protein . normal human cytosolic ph is ( roughly ) 7.0 ( i.e . neutral ) , whereas the ph of the extracellular fluid is 7.4. the texture of cytosol being described as granular can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture , an electron microsope must be used , which requires a process of dehydration prior to study . `` life : the science of biology '' . purves , sadava , orians , heller . sunderland , ma . sinauer associates , inc. 2004. isbn 0-7167-9856-5 ( ilm usa )
