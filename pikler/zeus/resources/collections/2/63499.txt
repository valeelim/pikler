Wehrmacht     wehrmacht was the name of the unified armed forces of nazi germany from 1935 to 1945. the `` wehrmacht '' consisted of the `` heer '' ( army ) , the `` kriegsmarine '' ( navy ) and the `` luftwaffe '' ( air force ) . the `` waffen-ss '' , an initially small armed section of heinrich himmler 's allgemeine ss that grew to nearly a million strong during world war ii , was not part of the wehrmacht , but subject to its supreme command . before the rise of the nsdap , the term `` wehrmacht '' was used in a generic sense to describe armed forces of any nation , being utilized as the `` home defence '' version of the more general `` streitmacht '' . for example , the term `` britische wehrmacht '' would identify the british armed forces . article 47 of the weimar constitution of 1919 declared `` der reichspräsident hat den oberbefehl über die gesamte wehrmacht des reiches '' ( meaning : `` the `` reichspräsident '' holds supreme command of all armed forces of the `` reich '' '' ) . to make a distinction , the term `` reichswehr '' was commonly used to identify the german armed forces .
