Integral     in calculus , an integral is the space under a graph of an equation ( sometimes said as `` the area under a curve '' ) . an integral is the reverse of a derivative . a derivative is the steepness ( or `` slope '' ) , as the rate of change , of a curve . the word `` integral '' can also be used as an adjective meaning `` related to integers '' . the symbol for integration , in calculus , is : formula_1 as a tall letter `` s '' . this symbol was first used by gottfried wilhelm leibniz , who used it as a stylized `` Å¿ '' ( for `` summa '' , latin for sum ) to mean the summation of the area covered by an equation , such as `` y '' = `` f ( x ) '' . integrals and derivatives are part of a branch of mathematics called calculus . the link between these two is very important , and is called the fundamental theorem of calculus . the theorem says that an integral can be reversed by a derivative , similar to how an addition can be reversed by a subtraction . integration helps when trying to multiply units into a problem . for example , if a problem with rate , formula_2 , needs an answer with just distance , one solution is to integrate with respect to time . this means multiplying in time to cancel the time in formula_3 . this is done by adding small slices of the rate graph together . the slices are close to zero in width , but adding them forever makes them add up to a whole . this is called a riemann sum .
