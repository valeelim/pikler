Icarus     icarus was the son of daedalus . daedalus was imprisoned in his own invention , the labyrinth . he helped the hero theseus kill king minos ’ s beast , the minotaur , and run away with king minos ’ s daughter , ariadne . daedelus came up with a plan . he knew that minos controlled all escape routes by land or sea , so he decided to go by air . he built wings for himself and icarus . they found their way out of the labyrinth and flew out of the highest tower . icarus foolishly ignored his father ’ s advice to fly on the same route as him so that the sun would not melt the wings and the sea would not dampen them . icarus flew up higher and higher toward the sun , and the wax in the wings melted and he fell into the sea and drowned . daedalus looked down towards the sea and saw the feathers floating on the water and figured out what happened . eventually daedalus found the body and buried it on the island of icaria , and the sea which icarus fell into is now called the icarian sea .
