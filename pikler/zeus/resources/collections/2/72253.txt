Glottalic theory     the glottalic theory says that proto-indo-european had ejective stops instead of voiced ones , namely p ’ t ’ k ’ rather than b d g , to the traditional reconstruction of the proto-indo-european sound system . the glottalic theory was made in the united states by paul hopper and in the soviet union by thomas v. gamkrelidze and vyacheslav v. ivanov . in its earliest theory , made by the danish linguist holger pedersen , it did not involve the use of glottalized sounds . while earlier linguists , such as andré martinet and morris swadesh , had seen the potential of substituting glottalic sounds for the supposed plain voiced stops of proto-indo-european , the request stayed speculative until more evidence for it was published in 1973 by hopper in the journal glossa and by gamkrelidze and ivanov in the journal phonetica . sources . - paul j. hopper , `` glottalized and murmured occlusives in indo-european .
