Incubus     in the middle ages , people in europe believed that incubi ( one incubus , several incubi ) were male demons . there were also female demons , called succubi . they lay on sleeping people , to have sexual intercourse with them . they would also do this to make other incubi . while they had sex with their victim , they drained its energy to sustain themselves . sometimes , having sex with an incubus may result in a child , as in the legend of merlin . some sources say that the incubus may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis . religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with such a spirit by either males or females may result in bad health , or even death . people have come up with different explanations for the incubus legends . in the middle ages , people worried a lot about sin , especially sexual sins of women . victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis . also , nocturnal arousal , orgasm or nocturnal emission could be explained by the idea of creatures causing an otherwise guilt-producing and self-conscious behavior . the influence of incubi could also have been used to explain how pregnancies happen outside marriage ; such pregnancies were often `` unexplainable '' .
