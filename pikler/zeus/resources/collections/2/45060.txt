E (mathematical constant)    e ( mathematical constant ) e is a number , about 2.71828. it is a mathematical constant . `` e '' also has other names , like `` euler 's number '' ( because of the swiss mathematician leonhard euler ) , or `` napier 's constant '' ( because of the scottish mathematician john napier ) . it is an important number in mathematics , like Ï€ and `` i . '' it is an irrational number , which means it is impossible to write as a fraction with two integers ; but some numbers , like 2.71828182845904523536 , come close to the true value . the true value of `` e '' is a number that never ends . euler himself gave the first 23 digits of e. the number `` e '' is very important for exponential functions . for example , the exponential function applied to the number one , has a value of `` e '' . e was discovered in 1683 by the swiss mathematician jacob bernoulli while he was studying compound interest . there are many different ways to define `` e '' . jacob bernoulli who discovered e , was trying to solve the problem : in other words , there is a number that the expression formula_2 approaches as n becomes larger . this number is `` e '' .
