Nautilus     nautilus is the common name for cephalopods of the family nautilidae . they are the only living members of the subclass nautiloidea . in appearance , they have not changed much in millions of years . the term `` chambered nautilus '' is also used for any species of the nautilidae . many biologists see them as 'living fossils ' , because they are the only living descendents of the group which gave rise to the ammonites in the palaeozoic era . today , there are six living species in two genera . the species `` nautilus pompilius '' , from western australia is the largest and best known . it get up to 27 cm in diameter . however , most other nautiluses never exceed 20 cm . the bellybutton nautilus , `` nautilus macromphalus '' , is the smallest species , usually measuring only 16 cm . the radula is wide and has exactly nine teeth . there are two pairs of gills . nautiluses are the only cephalopods who have an external shell . this is an ancestral or basal , feature . the animal can withdraw completely into its shell . it can the close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded tentacles . the shell is coiled and calcareous , with mother-of-pearl lining . it is pressure resistant , but will implode at a depth of about 800 m. the nautilus shell is made of two layers : the outer layer is a dull white , while the inner layer is a striking white with iridescence . the innermost portion of the shell is pearlescent , blue-gray . a osmena pearl is not a pearl , but a jewellery product got from this part of the shell .
