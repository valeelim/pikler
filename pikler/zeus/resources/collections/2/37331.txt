Prelude     a prelude is a short piece of music for a musical instrument . it is called a prelude because it is supposed to be played before something else ( latin `` pre '' =before ; `` ludere '' =to play ) . preludes started when lutenists ( people who played the lute ) improvised ( which means playing while making it up as they were going along ) a simple piece before a concert so that they could check whether their instrument was in tune . during the 16th century composers often wrote pieces which they called a “ prelude ” which was often a separate piece of music . these were often for lute , guitar or cittern . by the early 18th century the prelude was often a piece of music which was followed by a fugue . johann sebastian bach wrote lots of pieces called “ prelude and fugue ” . many of them are for organ . forty-eight of them are from a collection called the `` welltempered clavier '' . the first prelude in this collection is very famous . it sounds like an improvisation . it consists of gentle broken chords like a lutenist might play . ( this is the piece that charles gounod later used for his `` ave maria '' . preludes were also pieces which were followed by a series of dance movements ( a “ suite ” ) .
