Tynwald     it rules the isle of man , and while the island is a crown dependency , this ancient form of government enjoys a large amount of political power . tynwald is separated into 2 houses ( this is called a `` bicameral '' parliament , meaning it has 2 chambers ) - the house of keys , which is elected by the people of the isle of man , and the legislative council , which is not directly elected - instead , other members of the legislative council elect members of the house of keys ( mhk 's ) to sit on it . both houses of tynwald sit at the same time on tynwald day , at the site of the original parliament - tynwald hill - in st. john 's , a small village near peel , and once a month at parliament house in the island 's capital , douglas . the rest of the time , they sit separately at parliament house , with the house of keys making most of the laws , and the legislative council doing most of the work of changing and revising them . queen elizabeth ii is acknowledged as the lord of mann . tynwald can trace its descent from the viking and norse that first colonized the isle of man .
