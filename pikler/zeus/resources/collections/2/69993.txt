Scelidosaurus     scelidosaurus was a genus of thyreophorans , a lightly plated , herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long . it lived during the lower jurassic , 208 to 194 million years ago . its fossils have been found in both england and in arizona , in the united states . `` scelidosaurus '' has been called the earliest complete dinosaur . this and related genera have been found on three continents . it is one of the earliest and most basal of the armoured dinosaurs . a review by serano placed `` scelidosaurus '' as the sister group ( closest relative ) to both the stegosauria and ankylosauria . a full-grown `` scelidosaurus '' was rather small , compared to most other dinosaurs . some scientists have estimated a length of 4 metres ( 13 ft ) . `` scelidosaurus '' was quadrupedal , with the hindlimbs considerably longer than the forelimbs . it may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees , but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet , indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture . `` scelidosaurus '' and its jurassic relatives were herbivorous . however , while other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material , `` scelidosaurus '' had smaller , less complex teeth and a jaw capable of only simple up-and-down jaw movements . in this aspect , they resembled the stegosaurids , which also bore primitive teeth and simple jaws . also like stegosaurs , they may have swallowed gastroliths to aid processing of food ( because of the lack of chewing ability ) , in the same manner used by modern birds and crocodiles . their diet would have consisted of leaved plants or fruits , as grasses did not evolve until after `` scelidosaurus '' had become extinct .
