German Bundesrat     the german bundesrat ( commonly referred to as `` bundesrat '' ) is part of the parliament of germany . the cabinets of the 16 states of germany appoint the delegations that represent them in the bundesrat . they can remove them at any time . normally , a state delegation is headed by the head of government . the delegation is made up of members of the state government . thirteen of the states of germany ( in german : `` bundesländer '' ) have a minister-präsident ( prime minister ) , the other 3 are city-states which have a mayor . these prime ministers or mayors each act as chairman of the bundesrat for one year at a time . germany does not have a vice president . instead if the bundespräsident ( federal president ) can not do his job the president of the bundesrat can act in his place if necessary . although it is a part of the german parliament , the bundesrat does not meet in the same building as the bundestag . instead new offices and a modern meeting chamber were built inside the old prussian house of lords building .
