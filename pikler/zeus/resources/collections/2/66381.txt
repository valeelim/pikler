The Wash     the wash is the square-mouthed estuary on the northwest margin of east anglia on the east coast of england , `` where norfolk meets lincolnshire '' . it is among the largest estuaries in the united kingdom . it is listed as a ramsar site as being an important wetland area . the wash looks on the map like a large bite out of the coastline of eastern england . it separates the curved coast of east anglia from lincolnshire . it is formed by a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles , each about 25 kilometres ( 15 miles ) in length . all the eastern coast of the wash is in norfolk , and goes from hunstanton in the north to the mouth of the river great ouse at king 's lynn in the south . the coast on the opposite side goes from gibraltar point to the mouth of the river welland and is all in lincolnshire . the southern coast goes roughly northwest-southeast , joining these two river mouths . in the middle is the mouth of a third river , the river nene . the most famous thing that people remember about the wash is that `` king john lost his crown in the wash '' . this is because , according to reports from the time , king john travelled from spalding in lincolnshire to bishop 's lynn , in norfolk in the year 1216. he became ill and decided to go back . while he took the longer route through wisbech , he sent his luggage , including his crown jewels , along the seashore and across the mouth of the wellstream where the water was not deep . this route was only safe when the tide was low . the horse-drawn wagons moved too slowly for the incoming tide , and many were lost . the whole area at the time was an extensive wetland known as the fens , which was later drained . it is close to sea level .
