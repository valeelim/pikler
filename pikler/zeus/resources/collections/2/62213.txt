Religion in ancient Armenia     the early religions in armenia are not that well known . according to de morgan there are signs which indicate that the armenians , as their other aryan relatives , were initially nature worshipers and that this faith in time was transformed to the worship of national gods , of which many were the equivalents of the gods in the roman , greek and persian cultures . georg brandes described the armenian gods in his book : “ when armenia accepted christianity , it was not only the temples which were destroyed , but also the songs and poems about the old gods and heroes that the people sang . we have only rare segments of these songs and poems , segments which bear witness of a great spiritual wealth and the power of creation of this people and these alone are sufficient reason enough for recreating the temples of the old armenian gods . these gods were neither the asian heavenly demons nor the precious and the delicate greek gods , but something that reflected the characteristics of the armenian people which they have been polishing through the ages , namely ambitious , wise and good-hearted . ”
