Shrew     shrews are small mole-like mammals . they were classified in the old insectivora , but that is no longer used . now they are classified in the family soricidae , suborder soricomorpha . true shrews are not to be confused with west indies shrews , treeshrews , otter shrews , or elephant shrews , which belong to different families or orders . although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse , a shrew is not a rodent , as mice are . in fact it is related to moles . shrews have sharp , spike-like teeth , not the familiar gnawing front incisor teeth of rodents . shrews are distributed almost worldwide . of the major tropical and temperate land masses , only new guinea , australia , and new zealand do not have any native shrews . in south america , shrews are relatively recent immigrants and are present only in the northern andes . in terms of species diversity , the shrew family is the fourth most successful mammal family . with the discvery that the old insectivora was not a natural ( monophyletic ) group , new terms were invented to classify its former groups . that explains the little-known terms in the taxobox .
