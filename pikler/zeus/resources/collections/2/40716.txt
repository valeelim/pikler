Cocoon     a cocoon is a shell made of silk by most kinds of moth caterpillars and other insect larvae . some butterfly larvae ( in the family hesperiidae and subfamilies parnassiinae and satyrinae ) do spin cocoons . however , most butterfly pupae are called chrysalids . some caterpillars attach small twigs or pieces of vegetation to the outside of their cocoon to hide it from predators . others spin their cocoon in a hidden place . examples would be on the underside of a leaf , in a crevice , or down near the base of a tree trunk . silkworm cocoons are processed and used to produce natural silk for clothing .
