Once Upon a Time in America     once upon a time in america is a 1984 movie directed by sergio leone and starring robert de niro and james woods as jewish gangsters . the movie was sergio leone 's last before his death . the movie is set at three different times ; 1. the early 1920s ; the characters as children , 1. the early 1930s ; the characters as adults , 1 . 1968 ; the few still living characters in their old age . when leone finished making the movie it was 229 minutes ( 3 hours and 49 minutes ) and started with an old character ( robert de niro ) remembering his past ; it then showed him as a child and as a young adult . we call this flashbacks ; it can happen in movie but certainly not in real life . but when it was first shown to american audiences it was made much shorter and set in chronological order ; meaning the movie first showed the characters as children , then as young adults and then as older adults ; or 'from start to finish ' . we call this `` chronological '' ; this is what would happen in real life . many people agree that the longer version is much better than the shortened chronological version .
