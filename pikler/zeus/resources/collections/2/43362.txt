Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia     tsarevich alexei nikolaevich romanov ( 12 august 1904 â€“ 17 july 1918 ) was the heir apparent of russia during the russian revolution . he would have become tsar alexei ii . he was the youngest of five children and the only son of tsar nicholas ii of russia and alexandra fyodorovna . his sisters were olga , tatiana , maria , and anastasia . he had the disease hemophilia . he inherited the disease from his mother . the disease can be traced back to his great grandmother queen victoria . his father gave up the throne in 1917 and his family was exiled and then murdered in ekaterinburg in 1918. when alexei was struggling with hemophilia a russian orthodox monk named grigori rasputin , commonly known as rasputin , healed alexei better than any doctor could . this might have led to the family 's murder , because they were so fond of rasputin . once rasputin was murdered , alexei and his family were murdered only two years later . in 2000 , alexei and his family were made saints by the russian orthodox church .
