Hebrew calendar     the hebrew calendar or jewish calendar is the calendar used in judaism . it is used to set the dates of the jewish holidays and the weekly public reading of the torah . it is used to set the date for a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah , the day a young person is considered an adult in judaism . it sets the `` yahrzeit , '' the anniversary of the death of a relative . the daily jewish prayer service changes depending on the day of the hebrew calendar . the hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar which depends on both the moon and the sun . months of the hebrew calendar are based on the appearance of the new moon . at the same time , the holiday of passover must be in the spring . for this reason , years of the hebrew calendar are based on the sun . one solar ( sun-based ) year lasts about 365 days , but twelve lunar ( moon-based ) months only last about 354 days . for this reason , the hebrew calendar adds an extra lunar month seven times in each cycle of 19 years . this rule makes the average hebrew calendar year about the same length as a solar year , 365 days .
