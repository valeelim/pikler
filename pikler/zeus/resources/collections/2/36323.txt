Common Era     common era ( ce ) is a method used to identify a year . it means `` a year in our time '' ( rather than a year a very long time ago ) . it is the system for recording dates used almost everywhere around the world today : it is in common use . ce is an alternative to the ad system used by christians but the numbers are the same : this year is 2017 ce or equally ad 2017 ( but usually we just say `` this year is 2017 '' ) . ad is an abbreviation of `` anno domini '' , which means `` year of the lord '' . people who are not christian are not willing to accept that the lord of another ( or any ) religion should be named when a date is written . for this reason , another way to write a date was needed . when writing about calendars , an era is span of dates , starting from a particular moment in time . in the case of both ce and ad , that start date is approximately the date of the birth of jesus of nazareth . neither system uses a year zero ( 0 ) : the year before 1 ce was 1 bce . before common era ( bce ) is the system for the years `` before the common era '' . bce uses the same numbering as bc ( before christ ) . `` ce '' and `` bce '' are placed after the year number . thus we write `` right now our year is 2017 ce '' or `` artaxerxes iii of persia was born in 425 bce .
