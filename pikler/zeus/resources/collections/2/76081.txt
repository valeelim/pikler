Sol Invictus     sol invictus ( `` the unconquered sun '' ) or , more fully , deus sol invictus ( `` the unconquered sun god '' ) was a religious title applied to at least three distinct deities during the later roman empire : el gabal , mithras , and sol . the earlier cult of sol indiges ( `` the native sun '' or `` the invoked sun '' ) was agrarian . the title `` deus sol invictus '' was formed similar to the imperial titulature `` pius felix invictus '' ( `` dutiful , fortunate , unconquered '' ) . the romans held a festival on december 25 called `` dies natalis solis invicti '' , `` the birthday of the unconquered sun . '' the use of the title sol invictus allowed several solar deities to be worshipped together , including elah-gabal , a syrian sun god ; sol , the patron god of emperor aurelian ( ad 270-274 ) ; and mithras , a soldiers ' god of persian origin . emperor elagabalus ( 218-222 ) introduced the festival , and it reached the height of its popularity under aurelian , who promoted it as an empire-wide holiday . further reading . - halsberghe , l. 1972 . `` the cult of sol invictus '' ( leiden )
