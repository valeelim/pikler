Kamikaze     kamikaze ( japanese : 神風 ; literally : `` '' god-wind '' '' ; usual translation : `` '' divine wind '' '' ) is a word of japanese origin . it comes from the name the japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the mongol ships in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion . in western culture , the word `` kamikaze '' is used to mean the suicide pilots of the empire of japan , and their attacks on the ships of the allied powers in the final years of world war ii , during which they flew their planes into enemy ships . it has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attack . most people in western culture believe the word `` kamikaze '' was the name used by the japanese military for pilots , but that is not true . their correct name was `` tokubetsu kōgeki tai '' ( 特別攻撃隊 ) , which literally means `` special attack unit . '' this is usually abbreviated `` tokkōtai '' ( 特攻隊 ) in a shortened form . the suicide attacks made by navy pilots were called `` shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai '' ( 神風特別攻撃隊 , `` divine wind special attack units '' ) . the american translators used a different style of pronunciation of the japanese language by mistake , and read the word `` shinpū '' ( `` divine wind '' ) as `` kamikaze '' , as those japanese characters can be read both ways . the name became well known so , after the war , the japanese also started using it .
