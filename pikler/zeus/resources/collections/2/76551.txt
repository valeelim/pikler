Argument of periapsis     in astronomy , the argument of periapsis ( Ï‰ ) is a way of talking about the orbit of a planet , asteroid or comet . it is also known as the argument of perihelion or the argument of perifocus . it is the angle ( starting from the center of the orbit ) between an orbiting body 's periapsis and its ascending node . periapsis is the point when the orbiting object comes the closest to the thing it is orbiting around ; for example , the moon is at periapsis when it is closest to the earth . the ascending node is one of two places where an orbiting object passes through the reference plane , an imaginary flat surface which runs through the object being orbited around . the size of the angle depends on which way the object is orbiting . the angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion . for specific types of orbits , words such as `` perihelion '' ( for sun-centered orbits ) , `` perigee '' ( for earth-centered orbits ) , `` pericenter '' ( general ) , etc . may replace the word `` periapsis '' .
