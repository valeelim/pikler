Hotlinking     hotlinking is a term used on the internet that means displaying an image on a website by linking to another website to obtain the source data of the picture each time it is needed , rather than saving a copy of it on the website on which the image will be shown . so , instead of loading `` picture.jpg '' on to their own website , a website owner uses a link to the picture as `` http : //example.com/picture.jpg '' . when the hotlinking website is loaded , the image is loaded from the other website , which uses its bandwidth , costing the hotlinked website 's owners money . for this reason many website owners use .htaccess files to prevent hotlinking . in some cases website owners use the .htaccess file to replace any hotlinked images with an offensive image to deter any other website owners from hotlinking . the original image is probably owned by the original website , or maybe they got permission from someone else . it would probably be wrong to just make a copy of the original image file for use on a different web page , without being careful to get proper permission .
