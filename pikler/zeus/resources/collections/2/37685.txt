Counting     counting is something people do to find out how many things there are of any kind . the person counting in english usually starts with the number one , and gives this number to the first thing . the next thing is given the number two . then , the next thing is given the number three . if there is another thing , it gets the number four . if after this there is another thing , it gets the number five . more things get more numbers . each thing gets its own number in this way . the last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are . examples . - for example , to find out the number of hats in a group , a person counts the hats . the person gives a number to each hat . - there are the letters a , q , l , and s on a piece of paper . how many letters are there on the piece of paper ? counting is starting at a number and changing it up or down a certain number of times . in the examples above , counting started at one and then it changed by one each time something was counted . so at first the count was one . then the count was changed by one , and one plus one is two , so the count was two . then the count of two was changed by one again , and two plus one is three , so the count was three .
