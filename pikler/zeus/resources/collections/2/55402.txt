Cnidaria     cnidaria is a phylum with about 11,000 species of animals . all of them are simple and aquatic , and most of them live in the sea . some are colonial , composed of zooids which may be clones . cnidarian zooids may take the form of polyps or medusae at different phases of their life . cnidaria take their name from special cells which have organelles that sting : the nematocysts . this device is largely responsible for their success : it is their main specialised and distinctive cell type . the word cnidaria is spoken without the initial `` c '' , and with a long `` i '' . so it sounds like `` naidaria '' . in a similar way , the term ctenophore is pronounced as `` teenophore '' . originally , a greek kappa was in front of the words , and it was pronounced . there are five classes in the group . jellyfish occur in four of the classes . - subphylum and class anthozoa : the sea anemones and corals . - subphylum medusozoa : the jellyfish - class scyphozoa : the 'true ' jellyfish . - class cubozoa : the box jellies . - class hydrozoa : the hydroids : ( `` hydra '' ; portuguese man o ' war ) .
