Continuum     a continuum is a continuous series where all parts are very similar to their nearest neighbour , but the ends or extremes of it are different from each other . this describes something that changes gradually ( little by little ) from one condition , to a different condition , but without any sudden changes or discontinuities . the difference between a continuum , and something with very different changes that can be measured , is important for all continuum theories . continuum may also refer to : - the space-time continuum - continuum ( mathematics ) , the real line , or more generally any space , ordering , or cardinal that shares certain properties of the real line ( e.g. , `` connectedness '' or `` size '' ) - language continuum - a group of dialects , where the dialect of each area is understandable in neighboring areas , and these dialects may gradually 'slide ' from one language to another related language , even though speakers of the different languages who live farther apart may have more difficulty understanding one another .
