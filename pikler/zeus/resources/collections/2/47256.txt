Thermoplastic     a thermoplastic is a material , usually a plastic polymer , which becomes soft when heated and hard when cooled . thermoplastic materials can be cooled and heated several times without any change in their chemistry or mechanical properties . when thermoplastics are heated , they melt to a liquid . they freeze to a glassy state when cooled enough . thermoplastic materials have many features . some products made from thermoplastic materials are used for electronic applications . they protect against electrostatic discharge and radio frequency interference . thermoplastics are one of the main two types of plastics . thermoplastic can be moulded into any shape . thermoplastics differ from thermosetting polymers . thermosets form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process . polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) is the second largest volume thermoplastic produced . polypropylene is the most produced . related pages . - polycarbonate
