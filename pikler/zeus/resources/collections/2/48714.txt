Gecko     geckos are small to middle size lizards . lizards are reptiles . there are 1196 different kinds of geckos . they live in many warm countries . some kinds of geckos go into people 's houses . people are often happy to have them , because geckos eat many insects . unlike most lizards , geckos have voices . a gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog . in some languages these lizards have names that sound like their calls , for example , both english and indonesian call one kind gecko ( gek ko ) and tokay ( to-kay ) . another kind of gecko , with a different sound , is called chicak ( chee chak ) . geckos have no eyelids . instead , they have a clear membrane ( skin ) over their eyes . they lick the membrane clean with their tongues . like most lizards , they can regenerate their tail if they need to . many kinds of geckos can walk on walls , windows and ceilings . they can do this because they have special toe pads . a microscope can show that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair-like structures . each of these structures branches into many smaller ends .
