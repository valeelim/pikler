Aerial root     aerial roots are roots that are above ground . different plants have grown them . they can serve different purposes : - `` for support '' : sometimes such roots are grown for support . ivy plants have them to cling to structures , such as stone walls , or other trees . the banyan tree ( also known as `` strangler fig '' ) grows them downward from the place where it is . eventually , it will strangle the host . - `` roots for breathing '' : some plants grow in environments where there is much water in the soil . they may then grow such roots ( upwards ) to breathe air . black mangroves have such roots , for example . - `` as a parasite '' . parasites sometimes grow these , into the host to get nutritients . one example of this is the mistletoe . - `` roots to propagate '' : some plants have aboveground roots . in some places , little plants ( with leaves and roots ) develop . they will drop off at some point , and develop into new plants ( that are clones of the parent ) . examples for this are strawberries or the spider plant .
