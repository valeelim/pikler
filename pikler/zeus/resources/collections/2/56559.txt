Tomorrow Never Knows     tomorrow never knows is a song from the beatles 's `` revolver '' album , from 1966. john lennon wrote the song based on his readings of `` the psychedelic experience '' , which adapted the `` tibetan book of the dead '' for use as an lsd `` user 's manual '' , intending to give users a kind of religious experience . the song 's title came from his bandmate ringo starr , who was known for his but insightful comments about life . lennon wanted the sound of monks , to complement the beatles ' recording of the song . it was not possible to do this , but lennon 's voice was played through a special speaker ( called a leslie speaker ) , to give it a sound , like a voice calling from a hilltop . other sounds on the record came from tape loops , playing over and over , and from a sitar . the song has also been recorded by other artists . a dance cover version appeared in the 1990s .
