Tuatara     the tuatara are reptiles which look like lizards . however , they are the only surviving member of an order of reptiles which flourished 200 million years ago . there is now only the genus sphenodon , with two species of tuatara . both are endemic to ( only live in ) new zealand . lizards and snakes are the closest living relatives of the tuatara . tuatara are green-brown , and measure up to 80 cm from head to the end of their tail . they have a spiny crest along the back : the maori word `` tuatara '' refers to this . the crest is more pronounced in males . tuatara are special in many ways . one of these is the pattern of their teeth . they have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlap one row on the lower jaw . this is unique among living species . tuatara are also unusual because they have a third 'eye ' . they have two normal eyes . the third eye is on top of their head , in between their other eyes . it does not see like a normal eye . the parietal eye , as it is called , is only visible in hatchlings . they have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull . after four to six months this becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment .
