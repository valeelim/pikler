Tropical Storm Gamma     tropical storm gamma was the twenty-fourth named storm of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season . gamma formed in the eastern caribbean sea but quickly died a few days later from wind shear . on november 18 , it restrengthened and became a tropical storm for a few more days before dying off the coast of honduras on november 20. although gamma never made any landfall , it caused minor damages in the lesser antilles and medium damages in honduras . the national hurricane center began monitoring a tropical wave that would later become gamma around november 11 , but the system did not develop into a tropical depression until after it had passed the lesser antilles on november 13. at that time , the storm was called tropical depression twenty-seven and was predicted to strengthen into a strong tropical storm or a weak hurricane as it moved across the caribbean sea . however , a second system developing in the southwestern edge of the caribbean began pushing wind shear onto the depression on november 14 , then weakening the depression into a tropical low ; advisories were then temporarily stopped . on later reanalysis , it was found that the depression had probably become a tropical storm by november 15 at 0600 utc for less than 6 hours , but was not named during the time .
