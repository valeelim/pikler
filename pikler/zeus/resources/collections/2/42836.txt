Piccadilly line     the piccadilly line is a line of the london underground . it is coloured dark blue on the tube map . it is the fifth busiest line on the underground network judged by the number of passengers transported per year . it is mainly a deep-level line , running from the north to the west of london via zone 1. however , there are a number of surface sections mostly in its westernmost parts . out of the 53 stations served , 25 are underground . it is the second longest line on the system , after the central line . like most underground lines , the piccadilly line is operated by a single type of rolling stock . in this case it is the 1973 tube stock . the trains are painted in the standard london underground livery of blue , white and red . seventy-six trains out of a fleet of 88 are needed to run the line 's peak service . one unit ( 166-566-366 ) was severely damaged by the terrorist attack of 7 july 2005. the stock was recently refurbished , and was due for replacement by 2014 , but the order for new trains was cancelled in july 2010 .
