Remainder     in arithmetic , the result of the division of two integers usually can not be expressed with an integer quotient , unless a remainder –an amount `` left over '' – is also accepted . if `` a '' and `` d '' are natural numbers , with `` d '' non-zero , it can be proved that there exist unique integers `` q '' and `` r '' , such that `` a '' = `` qd '' + `` r '' and 0 ≤ `` r '' < `` d '' . the number `` q '' is called the `` quotient '' , while `` r '' is called the `` remainder '' . examples . - when dividing 13 by 10 , 1 is the quotient and 3 is the remainder , because 13=1×10+3 . - when dividing 26 by 4 , 6 is the quotient and 2 is the remainder , because 26=6×4+2 . - when dividing 56 by 7 , 8 is the quotient and 0 is the remainder , because 56=8×7+0 . - when dividing 9 by 10 , 0 is the quotient and 9 is the remainder , because 9=0×10+9 . if `` a '' and `` d '' are integers , with `` d '' non-zero , then a remainder is an integer `` r '' such that `` a '' = `` qd '' + `` r '' for some integer `` q '' , and with 0 ≤ | '' r '' | < | '' d '' | . when defined this way , there are two possible remainders . for example , the division of -42 by -5 can be expressed as either
