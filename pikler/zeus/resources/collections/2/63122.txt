Gas compressor     a gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume . compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature . compressors are similar to pumps : both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe . as gases are compressible , the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas . liquids are relatively incompressible , so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids . there are many different types of gas compressors . the two primary categories are : - positive displacement compressors with two sub-categories : - reciprocating - rotary - dynamic compressors also with two sub-categories : - centrifugal - axial the more important types in each of the four sub-categories are discussed below . centrifugal compressors use a vaned rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller , increasing the velocity of the gas . a diffuser ( divergent duct ) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy . they are primarily used for continuous , stationary service in industries such as oil refineries , chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants . their application can be from 100 hp ( 75 kw ) to thousands of horsepower . with multiple staging , they can achieve extremely high output pressures greater than 10,000 psi ( 69 mpa ) .
