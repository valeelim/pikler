Powiat     a county ( polish : `` powiat '' , pronounced `` povyat '' ; plural , `` powiaty '' ) is the polish second-level unit of administration , equivalent to a county , district or prefecture in other countries . a county is part of a larger unit called a `` voivodship '' ( in polish , `` województwo '' . one would call it in english `` province '' ) . most polish counties are named after their capital city , or county seat . if a county seat has a double-barreled name , as with `` maków mazowiecki , '' the county may become either `` maków county '' or `` maków-mazowiecki county . '' due , in all but the first case , to the existence , respectively , of two `` double-barreled '' county seats with the identical noun name , the corresponding adjectives `` '' bielski '' , '' `` '' grodziski '' , '' `` '' ostrowski '' and `` tomaszowski '' '' each denote `` two '' distinct counties . some polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the `` urban county '' ( `` powiat grodzki '' ) , similar in local administration and self-governance to `` land counties . '' an average county ( the largest being the powiat of białystok ) comprises 5 – 8 communes . the largest urban county , in terms of population and area , is the city of warsaw .
