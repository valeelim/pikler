Council of the European Union     the council of the european union `` ( often called council of ministers or just council ) '' is one of the three organisations that manage the european union . along with the european parliament , it is responsible for law making for the european union ( eu ) . its members are the government ministers of the member countries who are responsible for the law that is being discussed . as an example , suppose the law is going to be about farming , then the agriculture ministers are the council for that day . as well as making laws , they can meet to discuss their problems . for example , the european union does not decide on tax - each country decides on its own tax . but the finance ministers meet anyway because sometimes they can help each other catch people who do not want to pay tax at all . the council is called different things in different countries , according to the language they speak ( for example in french it is `` conseil de l'union européenne '' and in german it is `` rat der europäischen union '' ) . it is also known internationally , and so it appears on its logo , with the latin word consilium .
