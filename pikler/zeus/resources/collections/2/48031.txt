Special effect     special effects is a term for the things used in movies to create images that do not exist . there are many different types of special effects , for example , making little models or using computer animation . action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money to create in real life . for example , if an action movie shows a very big battleship blowing up in flames , it would be expensive to buy a battleship and dangerous to blow it up . for this reason , most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blowing up in flames . a movie maker could make a little model of a battleship that is only a few yards or meters long , and then blow it up while filming with the motion picture camera . this would be cheaper and safer . science fiction movies also often use special effects . they usually tell imaginary stories that take place in the future , on other planets . it would be impossible to actually make a science fiction movie on another planet . for this reason , filmmakers use special effects to create images that look like other planets . for example , for a science fiction movie about a world with three suns , the filmmaker could hire computer experts to create an image of three suns which would appear in the background of the movie scenes .
