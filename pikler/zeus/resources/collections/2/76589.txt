Ernestine duchies     the ernestine duchies , are sometimes called the saxon duchies , were a changing number of small states in the present german state of thuringia , governed by dukes of the ernestine line of the house of wettin the albertine duchies of weissenfels , merseburg and zeitz were are also sometime called `` saxon duchies '' and border several ernestine ones ) the old duchy of saxon began to split up in the 15th century , because law said that all sons should inherit . all of the sons of a saxon duke had the title of `` duke '' , sometimes brothers ruled the territory together , and sometimes they divided it up between them . some of the ernestine duchies stayed independent until 1918. the nearby royal houses of reuss and schwarzburg also divided up their territory , so thuringia was a tangle of little states , exclaves and enclaves from the late 15th century until the early 20th century . albert , grandson of albert `` the bear '' inherited the duchy of saxony from his father . albert 's sons divided saxony into the duchies of saxe-lauenburg and saxe-wittenberg . when duke of saxe-wittenberg died without an heir in 1422 , the emperor sigismund gave the duchy to frederick iv of the house of wettin . frederick was already margrave of meißen and landgrave of thuringia , and then became frederick i , elector of saxony . frederick was followed as elector by his son frederick ii , and when frederick ii died in 1464 his sons ernest and albert took over . because he was the older , ernest became elector of saxony , but the brothers shared ruling the lands until 1485. then ernest took northern meißen , southern thuringia , and wittenberg , with albert receiving northern thuringia and southern meißen
