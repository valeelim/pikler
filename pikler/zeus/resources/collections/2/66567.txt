Home row     on a qwerty keyboard , the letters `` asdfghjkl '' and the semicolon ( ; ) are called the home row , or sometimes the home keys . the home keys a , s , d , f , j , k , l and semicolon are where the fingers are placed , with both thumbs resting on the space bar . the pinkies ( plural of pinky ) go on the a and ; keys , the ring fingers ( fingers closest to the pinkies ) on s and l , middle fingers on d and k , and the index fingers ( those closest to the thumb ) on f and j. some computers have little bumps on the f and j letters to help the user tell where the home keys are . when the fingers are placed on the home keys , almost every key should be reachable from that position .
