Makalani     makalani is the name given to a certain palm tree , growing in northern namibia ( southern africa ) . the local owambo people call a full grown palm tree `` omulunga '' and a sapling `` oshivale . '' these palm trees grow very high and it takes many years for a makalani sapling to grow into a full-grown tree . the seeds look like small coconuts , and the local people , the owambos and himbas , peel the outer ginger looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art . the inner core is white with a dark brown skin , the size of a golf ball , and it is hollow inside . the makalani fruit ( ondunga/onduga ) is very useful to the local people . it can be eaten and can also be used to brew ombike/owalende : the oshiwambo brew that looks and taste similar to whiskey . there are now also some hotels , restaurants , and guesthouses which have adopted the name makalani ( in namibia ) . these include makalani sugar processors , makalani holdings and makalani airtime distributors .
