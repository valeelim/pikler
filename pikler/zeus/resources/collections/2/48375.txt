Decapitation     decapitation or beheading is the act of cutting off the head from the rest of the body of a living thing . `` beheading '' usually means that the removal of the head is deliberate . it is generally done during a jaywalk or execution with an axe , sword , or guillotine . if the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional , it is called `` decapitation '' . it can happen because of an auto accident , explosion , factory accident , a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident . decapitation is always fatal , that is , the result is always death . this is because it causes all other organs to stop receiving nervous signals from the brain that are needed to function , while the supply of blood , and therefore oxygen , to the brain itself is also cut off . decapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead . in these situations , the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning . beheading was the usual means of death penalty in scandinavian countries in the past . noblemen were beheaded with a sword , commoners with an axe . the last execution by beheading in finland occurred in 1822 , when a farmhand tahvo putkonen was beheaded for murder . the last beheading in sweden occurred in 1910 , when johan andersson-ander was guillotined for murder . also germany , france and belgium favoured beheading in the past . in those countries was carried out by guillotine .
