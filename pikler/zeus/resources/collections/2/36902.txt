Airship     airships are kind of aircraft . airships stay in the sky by floating . this is different from aeroplanes that stay in the sky by moving . an airship floats like a balloon . but an airship is different from a balloon . an airship has an engine for power and a way to control its direction of movement . a balloon does not have an engine or a way to control its direction of movement . some people may use the word `` airship '' to mean any kind of aircraft . this is not exactly correct . technical people use the word `` airship '' only to mean a aircraft that floats and has both an engine and a way to control its direction of movement . there are three kinds of airships . the difference is the amount of structure in the airship . - rigid airships - rigid airships have big structures in them . the biggest airships were rigid airships made in the 1920s and 1930s . big rigid airships were also called `` dirigibles '' . - semi-rigid airships - semi-rigid airships have small structures in them . there are only a few semi-rigid airships .
