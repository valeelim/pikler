Domain (biology)    domain ( biology ) in biological taxonomy , a domain ( also superregnum , superkingdom , or empire ) is a taxon in the highest rank of organisms , higher than a kingdom . domain ( or its synonyms ) is the most inclusive of these biological groupings . the arrangement of taxa reflects the fundamental evolutionary differences in the genomes . there are several modern alternative domain classifications of life . among them are : - the 'two-empire ' system , with top-level groupings of prokaryota ( or monera ) and eukaryota empires . - the six-kingdom system with top-level groupings of protista , archaebacteria , eubacteria , fungi , plantae , and animalia . - the three-domain system of carl woese , introduced in 1990 , with top-level groupings of archaea , bacteria , and eukaryota domains . after defining archaea as a new domain , woese redrew the taxonomic tree . his three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships . it divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains : bacteria , archaea , and eukarya . archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes . looked at another way , they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria .
