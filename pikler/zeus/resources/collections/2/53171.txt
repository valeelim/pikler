Redhead     redhead is a person with red or reddish-tinted hair . approximately 1 to 2 % of the world 's population has red hair . red hair is made by genes . the gene for red hair is recessive , meaning to be weaker than other genes , like the brown hair gene , for example . because of this , in order to have natural red hair a person needs to have red-haired ancestors present on both the maternal ( mother 's ) and paternal ( father 's ) side of the family . red hair is said to be most common close to the northern european coasts and islands of the atlantic ocean , like british isles , and in particular among celtic people . in ireland , the percentage of population with red hair is very high relative to the rest of the world at around 10 % , with 46 % carrying the gene . parts of the united kingdom such as scotland also have very high percentages with around 6 % . there was a misconception that red hair occurrence in scotland ran at around 13 % , due to this figure appearing in reliable media sources , however this figure was only an estimate and has since been disproved by research . dr. jim wilson of britain 's dna has carried out the only large scale genetic study of red hair using a sample of over 2,343 people ; and has found red hair occurrence of 6 % in scotland , this is concurrent with the largest ever study of hair colour in scotland which analysed over half a million people and found red hair prevalence of 5.3 % . a 1956 study of hair color among british army recruits also found high levels of red hair in wales and the english border counties .
