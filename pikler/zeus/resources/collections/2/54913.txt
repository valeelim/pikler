Bioluminescence     bioluminescence is the capacity of living things to produce light . often this is done by symbiosis . in this , the larger organism contains , often in a special organ , microorganisms which make the light . eukaryote protists have special organelles , and some bacteria also produce light . bioluminescence is the result of chemical processes , where the energy produced is released as visible light . bioluminescence has appeared many times during evolution . atp ( adenosine tri-phosphate ) , the biological energy source , reacts with luciferin with the aid of the enzyme luciferase to yield an intermediate complex . this complex combines with oxygen to produce a highly chemiluminescent ( brightly shining ) compound . the role of gamma proteobacteria in producing light is discussed in detail in reference works . the capacity to produce light is an extension of normal metabolism : all chemical reactions produce a few photons . visible light is produced when the photon production increases . in the case of bacteria , the original function of the reaction was probably to detoxify excessive oxygen .
