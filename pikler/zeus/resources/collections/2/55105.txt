Claw     a claw is a sharp object . it is found at the end of a toe or finger in many mammals , birds , and some reptiles . the word `` claw '' is also used in reference to an invertebrate . for example , the chelae of crabs and lobsters are often called claws or pincers . a claw is made of hard protein called keratin . they are used by some meat eating mammals such as cats to catch and hold prey , but they may also be used for other things such as digging , climbing trees , and so on , in those and other species . similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead . the correct name for an arthropod 's 'claw ' is chela ( plural `` chelae '' ) . legs that have a chela are called chelipeds . chelae are also called pincers . in tetrapods , claws are made of keratin and have of two layers . the unguis is the outside hard layer , which has keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an angle . the subunguis is the soft , flaky layer , and the grain is parallel to the direction of growth . the claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while traveling across the nail bed . the unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to make a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle , making a more or less sharp point . tetrapods use their claws in many ways , such as grasping or killing prey , digging , climbing , and hanging .
