Unit circle     in mathematics , a unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1. the equation of the unit circle is formula_1 . the unit circle is centered at the origin , or coordinates ( 0,0 ) . it is often used in trigonometry . in a unit circle , where formula_2 is the angle desired , formula_3 and formula_4 can be defined as formula_5 and formula_6 . using the function of the unit circle , formula_1 , another equation for the unit circle is found , formula_8 . when working with trigonometric functions , it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and formula_9 radians , or 0 through 90 degrees . it is possible to have higher angles than that , however . using the unit circle , two identities can be found : formula_10 and formula_11 for any integer formula_12 .
