1976 Winter Olympics     the 1976 winter olympics , officially known as the xii olympic winter games , were held in 1976 in innsbruck , austria . the games were originally awarded to denver , colorado , united states in may 1970 , but a 300 percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to voters ' rejection of a $ 5 million bond issue to finance the games in 1972 , so the ioc offered the games to whistler , british columbia ( canada ) , who had bid on the games , but they too declined due to a change of government there . ( whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring vancouver 's successful bid for the 2010 winter olympics . ) the ioc finally called on innsbruck , which had hosted the 1964 winter games just twelve years earlier , to also host the 1976 games . salt lake city , utah , which would eventually host in 2002 , offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of denver . the ioc declined . other websites . - olympic.org - official site
