Moat     a moat is a body of water around a castle or town to keep people out . at first , moats were simple and used only for protection . later on , moats became more complicated and were used for show . moats are deep , wide ditches filled with water . they were usually built near sources of water that flowed into the moats , filling them with water . the moats were filled with water for a few reasons . it made enemies swimming across the moat easy targets . it also made it impossible for enemies to dig underneath the castle walls , which was a common method of attack . it also prevented fires from destroying the castle . the word `` moat '' comes from the french word `` motte '' , which means hill . moats were first used in the medieval period , from 1066 to 1154. castles were built on the top of high hills . the area at the bottom of the hill was eventually called the moat . castle moats were usually between 3 and 30 feet deep , and they were not always filled with water . not all moats contained water , as a simple dry , wide ditch could prove an obstacle . these were called dry moats .
