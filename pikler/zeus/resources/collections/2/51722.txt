Polar coordinate system     in mathematics , the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by an angle and a distance . the polar coordinate system is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed with angles and distance ; in the more familiar cartesian or rectangular coordinate system , such a relationship can only be found through trigonometric formulae . as the coordinate system is two-dimensional , each point is determined by two polar coordinates : the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate . the radial coordinate ( usually denoted as formula_1 ) denotes the point 's distance from a central point known as the `` pole '' ( equivalent to the `` origin '' in the cartesian system ) . the angular coordinate ( also known as the polar angle or the azimuth angle , and usually denoted by θ or formula_2 ) denotes the positive or anticlockwise ( counterclockwise ) angle required to reach the point from the 0° ray or `` polar axis '' ( which is equivalent to the positive x-axis in the cartesian coordinate plane ) .
