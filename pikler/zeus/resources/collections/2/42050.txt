Technetium     technetium is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol tc . it has the atomic number 43. the color of technetium is silvery-grey . it is radioactive . it is a crystaline metal . in chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals . the chemistry of technetium is somewhere between rhenium and manganese . the isotope tc is used in nuclear medicine . it is used for many diagnostic tests . it has a short half-life . tc is used as a source of beta particles without emitting gamma rays . the ion that has oxygen and technetium bonded together ( tco ) is named the pertechnetate ion . the pertechnetate ion could be used as to prevent anodic corrosion in steel . before the element was found , many of the properties of element 43 were predicted by dmitri mendeleev . mendeleev saw a gap in his periodic table . he named the element in the gap ekamanganese . in 1937 the technetium isotope tc was the first element to be artificially produced . this gave the element its name . in greek τεχνητος means `` artificial '' . most technetium made on earth is a by-product of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors . it is extracted from nuclear fuel rods . on earth , technetium occurs naturally only in uranium ores as a product of spontaneous fission . the amount of technitium in the ore is very small but has been measured . no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years ( tc ) . this means that its detection in red giants in 1952 helped support the theory that stars can produce heavier elements . it is the first man made element in periodic table
