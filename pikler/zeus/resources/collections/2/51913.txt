Trades union     a trades union ( u.s : `` trade union '' ) is an organisation or group of workers who join together to negotiate pay , hours , benefits , and working conditions . union members and supporters of unions claim that they are necessary because the people that run companies want to pay as little as possible . in the united states , they are often called labor unions . the term as used in britain is trades union ( plural : `` trades unions '' ) because they were a joining of men `` working in different trades '' . for example : on the engine of a steam locomotive were two men : a driver and a stoker shovelling the coal into the oven . the driver was a skilled man , and paid much more than the stoker . they were two different trades . when they joined into the associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen ( aslef ) , their negotiations with management was done together . a quite different union , the national union of railwaymen ( nur ) looked after other employees of the railway compaies . that was a whole collection of different trades .
