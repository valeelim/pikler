Python     python is the name given to a family of constricting snakes . such snakes are not venomous . the family in question is the `` pythonidae '' . pythons are more closely related to boas than to any other snake family . boulenger ( 1890 ) thought this group was a subfamily ( pythoninae ) of the family boidae ( boas ) . however , boas produce live young , while pythons lay eggs . pythons can be found in australia , southeast asia and africa . pythons can range from 3 feet long in species like ball pythons to 29 feet in species like reticulated pythons . longer pythons have been seen , but the reports are not secured . larger pythons can prey on animals as large as a house cat or a full-grown deer . in africa , there are pythons that eat gazelles . to catch its prey , the python squeezes it to death , then swallows it whole . despite their size , pythons are rarely dangerous to humans . the python comes from asia . it can be up to 900 cm long and weigh up to 90 kg , but males are much smaller and lighter than females . the python can live up to 30 years . the breeding time is between 60 or 70 days .
