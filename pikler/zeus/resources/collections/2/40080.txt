Boson     a boson is a particle which has a whole number spin ( 'spin ' is a quality assigned to subatomic particles ) . bosons carry energy . a photon is an example of a boson as it has a spin of 1. bosons are different from fermions , which are particles that make up matter , because they obey bose-einstein statistics . ( this means that you can put two of them in the same place at the same time ) . `` gauge bosons '' carry forces . there are three known gauge bosons which are fundamental particles . for example , the photon carries the electromagnetic force . the four gauge bosons are as follows : photons for electromagnetism , gluons for strong force , and w and z bosons for weak force . other theoretical gauge bosons are predicted , such as gravitons for gravity . the higgs boson is another fundamental particle of a type called a scalar boson . paul dirac named this class of particles `` bosons '' in honor of a famous scientist called satyendra nath bose .
