Toccata     toccata is the title that was often given to pieces of music for solo instruments from the renaissance onwards . the word comes from the italian for `` to touch '' , also meaning `` to play a musical instrument '' . these pieces were often quite difficult , with a lot of fast notes which showed off how well the person could play . the first toccatas were written in northern italy by composers such as claudio monteverdi and giovanni gabrieli . they are pieces for the keyboard ( harpsichord or organ ) with lots of running scales in the right hand and accompanying chords in the left hand . toccatas became popular in germany with composers such as hans leo hassler who had studied in venice with gabrieli . many german baroque organ composers wrote toccatas : sweelinck ( who was dutch ) , pachelbel , buxtehude and johann sebastian bach . bach 's `` toccata and fugue in d minor '' is one of the most famous pieces of baroque organ music , and perhaps the most famous toccata ever written . after the baroque period composers did not often write toccatas . the toccata became popular again in the late 19th century with the french organ composers such as charles-marie widor whose toccata from his `` symphony no . 5 '' is very popular today , especially at weddings . it has lots of quick notes in the right hand ( and occasionally in the left ) and a big tune in the pedals . another famous organ toccata is by louis vierne . it is the last movement of his `` symphony no . 1 '' ( at this time french composers wrote organ works called `` symphonies '' ) .
