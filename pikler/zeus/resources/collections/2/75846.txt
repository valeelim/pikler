Niger River     the niger river is the main river of western africa . it is over 4180 km ( 2500 miles ) long . it has a crescent shape and it goes through guinea , mali , niger , on the border with benin and then through nigeria . finally , it reaches the sea at a large delta , called the niger delta of the oil rivers . this part of the atlantic ocean is called the gulf of guinea . the niger is the third-longest river in africa . only by the nile and the congo are longer . its main tributary is the benue river . no-one knows the origin of the name niger . many people think that it comes from the latin word for `` black '' , `` niger '' , but there is no evidence for this , and portuguese explorers would probaly have used their own word ( `` negro '' ) on their maps . also , the niger is not a blackwater river ( see rio negro ) . some people think that 'black ' may mean the color of the people in this area , but this did not happen with any other river in africa . therefore , most people think the name is from the original people of the area in the middle of the river where early european maps used the name `` quorra '' . one possibility is the tuareg phrase `` gher n gheren '' `` river of rivers '' , shortened to `` ngher '' or `` niger '' , from the middle of the river near timbuktu .
