Ohm's law    ohm 's law ohm 's law says that in an electrical circuit , the current passing through a resistor between two points , is related to the voltage difference between the two points , and inversely related to the electrical resistance between the two points . this relation is shown in the following where i is the current in amperes , `` v '' is the potential difference in volts , and `` r '' is a constant , measured in ohms , called the resistance . current is directly proportional to voltage loss through a resistor . that is , if the current doubles , then so does the voltage . to make a current flow through a resistance there must be a voltage across that resistance . ohm 's law shows the relationship between the voltage ( v ) , current ( i ) and resistance ( r ) . it can be written in three ways : voltage is how much energy is between two points on a circuit . these two points have different charges , one is higher and the other is lower . the difference between these two points of the charge is how we measure the voltage . the unit of “ volt ” is the name of the italian physicist alessandro volta who created the first chemical battery . the letter “ v ” represents voltage .
