Racquet     a racquet ( sometimes racket ) is used in sports to hit an object . it differs from a paddle because the head is a grid of strings instead of solid . a tennis racquet has a long handle and a large oval-shaped area used to hit the ball . it has many strings stretched across its surface ( or face ) both horizontally and vertically . the strings supply bounce to hit the ball . the handle and frame of the racquet is usually made out of light materials such as graphite . older racquets were made out of wood . tennis racquets come in different sizes and weights . tennis racquets can be bought at sports equipment stores or department stores . a beginner racquet can cost as little as $ 30 , but they can cost much more for very good quality rackets ( $ 500 or more ) . a badminton racquet has a longer , thinner neck than a tennis racquet with softer strings as the shuttlecock is hit up over a net .
