Matsya     hindus believe that the matsya was the first important avatar of vishnu . as the matsya avatar , vishnu took the form of a big fish . sometimes , it is said that he took the form of a half-man and half-fish . there is a story about this in hindu scriptures . the story tells about a demon ( an asura ) . that asura was very wicked . he snatched the vedas , the holy books of the hindus , and went deep inside the sea . at this point , vishnu changed his form . he became a `` matsya '' , that is , a fish . he entered the sea and brought back the vedas . he gave the vedas to manu . the hindu scriptures say that manu was the first man in the world . he may be compared with noah .
