Polyvinyl chloride     polyvinyl chloride , also called polychloroethene or pvc , is a thermoplastic . it turns soft when heated and hard when cooled . polyvinyl chloride is made by polymerization of the monomer vinyl chloride ( chloroethene ) ch=chcl . pvc can be made softer and more flexible by adding plasticizers . phthalates are often used to soften pvc in this way . vinyl polymers are the most common type of plastic . in popular usage , `` vinyl '' refers mostly to pvc , but there are two other vinyl polymers which are more common . the most common is polyethylene , the second most common is polypropylene . another , less used , is polystyrene . softened pvc is used in clothing , upholstery , electrical cable insulation , and other products instead of rubber . about half of the polyvinyl chloride resin manufactured each year is used to make pipes . pvc pipes are 66 % of the new water pipes in the us . pvc pipes are 75 % of new sewer pipes . pvc is useful because of its light weight , high strength , and low reactivity . also , pvc pipes can be glued together , or they can be connected by heating ( similar to joining hdpe pipe ) . both kinds of connections make permanent joints that do not leak .
