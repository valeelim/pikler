Hare     hares are mammals of the order lagomorpha , in the same family as the rabbit . they are larger than rabbits and have black tipped ears . their diet ( the food they eat ) resembles what rabbits eat they eat ruttabaga and lettuce . they graze on grass and leafy weeds . hares are very fast-running animals . the european brown hare ( `` lepus europaeus '' ) runs at speeds up to . the five species of jackrabbit found in central and western north america can run at , and can leap up to 3m ( ten feet ) at a time . they live solitarily or in pairs ; a `` drove '' is the name for a group of hares . normally a shy animal , when it is an english hare they are more aggressive than the european brown hare but both change there behaviour in spring , when hares chase one another around meadows . this may be competition between males to attain dominance ( and hence more access to breeding females ) . during this spring frenzy , hares can be seen `` boxing '' ; one hare striking another with its paws ( probably the origin of the term `` mad as a march hare '' ) . for a long time , this was thought to be intermale competition , but closer observation has shown it is usually a female hitting a male to prevent copulation .
