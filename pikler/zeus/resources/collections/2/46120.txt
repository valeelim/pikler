Microorganism     a microorganism or `` microbe '' is an organism which is microscopic , making it too small to be seen by the unaided human eye . the study of microorganisms is called microbiology . microorganisms include bacteria , fungi , archaea , protists and viruses . the first of these four types of microorganisms may either be free-living or parasitic . viruses can only be parasitic , since they always reproduce inside other living things . most micro-organisms are single-celled , or unicellular organisms , but there are unicellular protists that are visible to the human eye , and some multicellular species are microscopic . microorganisms live almost everywhere on earth where there is liquid water , including hot springs on the ocean floor and deep inside rocks within the earth 's crust . such habitats are lived in by extremophiles . microorganisms are critical to nutrient recycling in ecosystems , because they act as decomposers . because some microorganisms can also take nitrogen out of the air , they are an important part of the nitrogen cycle . pathogenic , or harmful , microbes can invade other organisms and cause disease .
