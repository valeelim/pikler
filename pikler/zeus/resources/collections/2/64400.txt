Gag     a gag is any thing used to stop a person from speaking . this is done by blocking or muffling the person 's mouth and making it difficult for them to move their jaw and tongue in a normal way . gags are very commonly seen in bdsm and bondage fantasy . many different items can be used , ranging from a hand simply clamped over the victim 's mouth , to a scarf tied between the jaws , to adhesive tape placed over the mouth and face to seal the lips . there are also many kinds of specially-made gags , which usually strap around or behind the head . special gags of that kind are usually made from leather or rubber . in real life it is quite difficult to gag a person in such a way that their speech can not be understood at all , and it is almost impossible to prevent a gagged person from making some kind of sound . it is also a risk to the person 's safety , as the more tightly and securely someone is gagged , the greater the risk that they will choke or suffocate .
