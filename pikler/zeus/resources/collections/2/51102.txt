Heart failure     heart failure is when the heart can not pump blood well . heart failure is different from cardiac arrest , because the heart is still working . heart failure can be sudden ( `` acute '' ) , like after a heart attack , or can come on slowly . someone with heart failure can have shortness of breath ( which may be worse when they lie flat ) , waking up breathless at night , swelling of the legs , and needing to urinate often during the night . there are many reasons why someone can get heart failure . most often , heart failure is caused by heart attacks , high blood pressure , or problems with the heart valves . a doctor makes a diagnosis of heart failure by asking about the symptoms above , and examining the heart , blood vessels , lungs , liver ( for swelling ) and legs ( for swelling or edema ) . other tests to prove the diagnosis are x-rays of the lungs , an echocardiogram ( an ultrasound test of the heart ) and blood tests . heart failure can only be cured with a heart transplant , which is not done often , but most people with heart failure need to take diuretic medicines and other medication ( ace inhibitor , statin ) . some people with heart failure are treated with an artificial pacemaker that makes the heart work better .
