Consecutive integer     consecutive integers are integers that follow each other in order . they have a difference of 1 between every two numbers . in a set of consecutive integers , the mean and the median are equal . if `` n '' is an integer , then `` n '' , `` n '' +1 , and `` n '' +2 would be consecutive integers . - examples 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 −3 , −2 , −1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 odd consecutive integers are odd integers that follow each other . they have a difference of 2 between every two numbers . if `` n '' is an odd integer , then `` n , '' `` n '' +2 , `` n '' +4 , and `` n '' +6 will be odd consecutive integers . the first number in the pattern is always the variable on its own or in this case , `` n '' . examples 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , etc . −23 , −21 , −19 , −17 , −15 , -13 , -11
