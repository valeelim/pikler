Subtropical cyclone     a subtropical cyclone ( also known as a subtropical storm ) is a cyclonic weather storm . subtropical cyclones have wide wind patterns with the winds getting stronger as they get farther away from the centre of the storm . a subtropical cyclone is more likely to be a tropical cyclone than an extratropical cyclone . subtropical cyclones are only found in the northern atlantic ocean and in the eastern pacific ocean . like normal tropical cyclones , most subtropical cyclones have maximum wind speeds of at least 39 mph to 74 mph ( 60 km/h to 110 km/h ) . subtropical cyclones that have wind speeds less than 39 mph are known as `` subtropical depressions '' . during the 1950s and 60s , subtropical cyclones were simply called `` semi-tropical '' . there was much discussion between meteorologists in the late 1960s as of what a subtropical cyclone was . so , in 1972 , the national hurricane center ( nhc ) officially classified the type under a new category , different from actual tropical cyclones . during the 1970s , the nhc began making a new list of names , separate for subtropical cyclones , although that process was soon canceled because it was rejected by many scientists . after that , subtropical storms were just numbered , such as hurricane karen from 2001 which was originally named `` subtropical storm one '' . but in 2002 , a policy change had tropical and subtropical storms share the same list of names for the whole season , which started with subtropical storm nicole in 2004 .
