Amorphous solid     an amorphous solid does not have a definite geometric or crystalline shape . it is a solid in which there is no long-term order in the positions of the atoms . most classes of solid materials can be found or prepared in an amorphous form . for instance , common window glass is an amorphous ceramic , many polymers are amorphous , and even foods such as cotton candy are amorphous solids . an amorphous solid is any noncrystalline solid in which the atoms and molecules are not organized in a definite lattice pattern . such solids include glass , plastic , and gel . solids and liquids are both forms of condensed matter ; both are composed of atoms in close proximity to each other . but their properties are , of course , enormously different . while a solid material has both a well-defined volume and a well-defined shape , a liquid has a well-defined volume but a shape that depends on the shape of the container . stated differently , a solid exhibits resistance to shear stress while a liquid does not . externally applied forces can twist or bend or distort a solid ’ s shape , but ( provided the forces have not exceeded the solid ’ s elastic limit ) it “ springs back ” to its original shape when the forces are removed . a liquid flows under the action of an external force ; it does not hold its shape . these macroscopic characteristics constitute the essential distinctions : a liquid flows , lacks a definite shape ( though its volume is definite ) , and can not withstand a shear stress ; a solid does not flow , has a definite shape , and exhibits elastic stiffness against shear stress .
