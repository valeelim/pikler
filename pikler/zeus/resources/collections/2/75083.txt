Cay     a cay ( also spelled key ; both pronounced alike as `` key '' ) is a small , low island consisting mostly of sand or coral and situated on top of a coral reef . the english word `` cay '' comes from the spanish word `` cayo '' and this from the taíno word `` cayo '' meaning `` small island '' . the english words `` key '' and `` quay '' ( which means wharf ) come from the old french `` kai '' meaning `` sand bank '' . because it is a taíno word , `` cay '' ( and the other forms ) are used mainly in the caribbean , but the type of island is found in the tropical seas where there are coral reefs . sand cays are built on the edge of the coral reefs , opposite the direction from which the wind blows most of the time . because of that , cays are often elongated . tides and wind ( and sometimes sea birds ) deposit coral debris . weather affects the formation of cays greatly ; large tides would bring much more debris onto the cay and thus make it larger , while a hurricane destroys a cay . some cays are very large ; cayo coco , north of cuba , is about 370 km . those large cays are being used for tourism because they have beaches with white sand and the presence of coral reefs .
