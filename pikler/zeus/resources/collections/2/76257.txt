Geometric albedo     the geometric albedo of an astronomical body is the ratio of its actual brightness at zero phase angle ( i.e . as seen from the light source ) to that of an `` idealized '' flat , fully reflecting , diffusively scattering ( lambertian ) disk with the same cross-section . the visual geometric albedo refers to the geometric albedo quantity when accounting for only electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum .
