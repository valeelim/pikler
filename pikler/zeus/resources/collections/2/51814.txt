Woodworking joints     joinery often refers to the part of woodworking that involves the joining together of parts of wood . traditional wood joinery techniques use the distinctive material properties of wood , often without mechanical fasteners . there are different types of joinery for different structures , for example the joinery used to build a house is different from that used to make puzzle toys , although elements overlap . wood is strong when stressed along the grain ( longitudinally ) , but weak across it ( radially and tangentially ) . it expands and contracts in response to humidity . this change is very small longitudinally . it is considerable , but unequal , in the radial and tangential directions . glue is highly effective for joining wood when both surfaces of the joint are edge grain . a properly glued joint may be as strong as a single piece of wood . however , glue is ineffective on end-grain surfaces . two of the most common traditions of joinery are japanese and european . the japanese in particular developed hundreds of types of joints and their furniture was often held together without glue or nails .
