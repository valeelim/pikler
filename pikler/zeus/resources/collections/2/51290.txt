Upper Cretaceous     the upper cretaceous is the last geological epoch in the cretaceous . it began 100.5 million years ago , and ended 66 million years ago . the cretaceous is traditionally divided into lower cretaceous ( early ) , and upper cretaceous ( late ) , because of the different rocks . the rocks reflect the conditions in which they were formed . the upper cretaceous is the chalk . it is composed of countless millions of calcareous ( caco ) plates called coccoliths . they are so small they can only just be seen with a light microscope ; details require an electron microscope . the plates are formed by single-celled planktonic algae called coccolithophores , and were laid down in the off-shore seas . the only other rock found in chalk is the flint , which is siliceous ( silica , sio ) . this derives from those algae and animals which have skeletons of silica . the cretaceous was the last period when dinosaurs were the dominant land animals . `` triceratops '' , `` tyrannosaurus '' and `` velociraptor '' lived at this time . the huge `` mosasaurus '' was the dominant marine predator . in the cretaceous period , birds became more diverse . flowering plants developed more , and became the dominant plants on land . the upper cretaceous ended with the k/t extinction event .
