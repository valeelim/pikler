Observer effect     the observer effect , or observer bias , means several things in different situations , although there are similarities . in science , the term observer effect means that the act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed . for example , for us to `` see '' an electron , a photon must first interact with it , and this interaction will change the path of that electron . it is also theoretically possible for other , less direct means of measurement to affect the electron ; even if the electron is simply put into a position where observing it is `` possible '' , without actual observation taking place , it will still ( theoretically ) alter its position . in physics , a more mundane observer effect can be the result of instruments that by necessity alter the state of what they measure in some manner . for instance , in electronics , ammeters and voltmeters usually need to be connected to the circuit , and so by their very presence affect the current or the voltage they are measuring . likewise , a standard mercury-in-glass thermometer must absorb some thermal energy to record a temperature , and therefore changes the temperature of the body which it is measuring .
