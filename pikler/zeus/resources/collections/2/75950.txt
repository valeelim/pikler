Axial tilt     in astronomy , axial tilt is the angle between a planet 's rotational axis at its north pole and a line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the planet . it is also called axial inclination or obliquity . the axial tilt of earth is the cause of seasons like summer and winter on earth . axial tilt of bodies in the solar system . - sun 7.25 ( to the ecliptic ) - mercury ~0.01 - venus 177.4 - earth 23.439281 - moon 1.5424 - mars 25.19 - ceres ~4 - jupiter 3.13 - saturn 26.73 - uranus 97.77 - neptune 28.32 - pluto 119.61 the axial tilts of venus , uranus and pluto are greater than 90 degrees because of following reasons . - venus : venus is rotating very slowly in a retrograde direction , opposite to the direction of planets like earth . the north pole of venus is pointed 'down ' ( southward ) ; hence the angle between the rotational axis of venus passing through its north pole and the line perpendicular to its orbital plane is 177.4 degrees . there are various theories as to why this is . its rotation and lack of a moon may be explained by gigantic impacts early in its life .
