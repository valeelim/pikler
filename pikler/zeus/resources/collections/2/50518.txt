Project     a project is a temporary undertaken to create a unique product or service . the word `` project '' comes from the latin word `` projectum '' from `` projicere '' , `` to throw something forwards '' which in turn comes from `` pro- '' , which denotes something that precedes the action of the next part of the word in time ( paralleling the greek πρό ) and `` jacere '' , `` to throw '' . the word `` project '' thus actually originally meant `` something that comes before anything else is done '' . when the word was initially adopted , it referred to a plan of something , not to the act of actually carrying this plan out . something performed in accordance with a project was called an object . this use of `` project '' changed in the 1950s when several techniques for project management were introduced . with this advent the word slightly changed meaning to cover both projects and objects . however in certain projects there may still exist so called `` objects '' and `` object leaders '' , reflecting the older use of the words . characteristics .
