Sun     the sun gives off energy as electromagnetic radiation . that includes light , infra-red energy ( heat ) , ultraviolet light and radio waves . it also gives off a stream of particles , which reaches earth as `` solar wind '' . the source of all this energy is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy . the sun is a star like many others in our milky way galaxy . it has existed for a little over 4.5 billion years , and is going to continue for at least as long . the sun is about a hundred times as wide as the earth . it has a mass of , which is 333,000 times the mass of the earth . the earth can also fit inside the sun 1.3 million times . scientists think that the sun started from a very large cloud of dust and small bits of ice about 4.567 billion years ago . at the center of that huge cloud , gravity caused the material to build up into a ball . once this got big enough , the huge pressure inside started a fusion reaction . the energy this released caused that ball to heat and shine .
