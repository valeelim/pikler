Logical volume management     logical volume management is a method of allocating computer storage . it is about allocating space on `` mass storage devices '' , like hard drives . it is more flexible than the partitioning of the drive into static ( unchangeable ) volumes . with a logical volume manager it is possible to grow partitions , even beyond the size of one physical disk . it is also possible to use striping or to put partitions together and combine them while they are being used . logical volume management is a form of virtualisation . it makes it easier to adapt to the changing storage needs of computer users . volume managers differ but some basic concepts exist across most versions . the volume manager starts with `` physical volumes '' or pvs , which can be hard disk partitions , raid devices or san luns . pvs are split into small chunks of even size ( a default of 4 mb on hp-ux ) called `` physical extents '' or pes . the pes are then pooled into a `` volume group '' or vg . the pooled pes can then be concatenated together into virtual disk partitions called `` logical volumes '' or lvs . these lvs behave just like hard disk partitions : mountable file systems can be created on them , or they can be used as raw block devices for swap .
