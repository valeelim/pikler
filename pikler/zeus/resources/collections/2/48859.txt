Defibrillation     defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to treat the heart when it is not pushing blood because the heart muscle is not working in any pattern . electricity causes a muscle to contract , this is how nerves cause muscles to work . the heart is a large muscle , and certain parts need to contract before other parts in order to push blood through the heart and out to the rest of body correctly . sometimes the heart muscle does n't contract in the correct way or at the correct speed , this is called an `` arrhythmia '' ( out of rhythm ) . fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia when the whole heart is quivering , not organized to make heart beats of any kind . cpr ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) can get blood to the body when the heart is fibrillating , but the heart still needs to be restarted . sometimes cpr will do that as well , but often a defibrillator is needed . defibrillation is done with a defibrillator . defibrillation works by carefully sending a strong electric current to the heart , which `` resets '' the heart , and hopefully returns a normal , coordinated heart rhythm . it needs to depolarise ( take away the existing electric charge ) from a large part of the heart muscle , which stops the arrhythmia and allows the normal heartbeat to return . defibrillators can work outside the body with the use of an external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator , or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator .
