Tundra     in physical geography , tundra is where where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons . the term `` tundra '' comes from `` tūndâr '' which means 'uplands , tundra , treeless mountain tract ' . there are three types of tundra : arctic tundra , antarctic tundra , and alpine tundra . in all of these types , the plants are mostly grass , moss , and lichens . trees grow in some of the tundra . the boundary between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.the area itself encircles the arctic ocean of the northern hemisphere . the climate in a tundra biome consists of freezing cold and dryness in the winter and cold summers . the tundra ground is a barren place , often covered with rocks . most water on the tundra is frozen within the soil . the permanent frozen soil is called permafrost . permafrost and fierce winds prevent large trees from growing deep roots . plants in the tundra are small and grow close to the ground . plants called cushions grow in tight clumps in the tundra , but lichens are the dominant plants . lichens cover the rocks . the few trees that do grow on the tundra are dwarf willows and birch .
