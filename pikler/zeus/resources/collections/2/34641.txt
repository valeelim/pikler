Windows NT     windows nt is a series of microsoft 's windows operating systems written in the c and c++ programming languages . they were the first to use their new 'nt ' ( new technology ) core . that meant it had a brand new core to do more things than the ms-dos-based one that they used in older versions of windows . also , it was more secure and crashed less . windows nt 3.1 was released as alpha versions in 1991-1992 and beta versions in 1993. microsoft decided to create a portable operating system , compatible with os/2 and posix and supporting multiprocessing , in october 1988. when development started in november 1989 , windows nt was to be known as os/2 3.0 , the third version of the operating system developed jointly by microsoft and ibm . to ensure portability , initial development was targeted at the intel i860xr risc processor , switching to the mips r3000 in late 1989 , and then the intel i386 in 1990. it is well believed that dave cutler intended the initialism 'wnt ' as a pun on vms , incrementing each letter by one . however , the project was named nt os/2 before receiving the windows brand . one of the original os/2 3.0 creators , mark lucovsky , claims that the name was taken from the original target processorâ€”the intel i860 , code-named n10 ( 'n-ten ' ) . various microsoft publications , including a 1998 question-and-answer session with bill gates , reveal that the letters were expanded to 'new technology ' for marketing purposes but no longer carry any specific meaning . the letters were dropped from the name of windows 2000 , though microsoft described the product as 'built on nt technology .
