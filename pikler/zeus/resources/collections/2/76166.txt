Pistol     a pistol ( also called an automatic or auto ) is a handgun but is not the same as a revolver . the cartridges are in a magazine , which is a metal or plastic box . the magazine is usually inside the handle of the pistol . when the pistol is fired , the empty cartridge pops out , and the next one comes up into position . the magazine is spring-loaded so it pushes the next bullet into place as the empty cartridge is ejected . for that reason pistols are sometimes called `` semi-automatic '' . when the magazine runs out of cartridges , it is reloaded with a `` clip '' , which is a device with rounds of ammunition ready to be put into the cartridge . there is a degree of confusion between pistols and revolvers . for example , in the american old west revolvers were used but were then ( and even today by some ) called pistols . one of the most important rules of gun safety is to keep guns out of the hands of children . guns should be locked up and kept away from children and others who do not appreciate how deadly they are . pistols like all guns should always be handled carefully . always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction . a shooter should keep their fingers away from the trigger until the moment they intend to shoot . always respect guns as a tool that can cause harm if used incorrectly . always assume a gun is loaded until you are certain it is not .
