Plasma window     a plasma window is a field of plasma that fills an area of space . it is similar to a force field . the area is created by using magnetism to hold the plasma in place . with current technology , this area of space is quite small . it is in the shape of a flat planes inside a cylinder . as plasma increases in temperature , it becomes thicker . at a high enough temperature , plasma is thick enough to separate a vacuum from normal atmosphere . plasma does not stop radiation , for example lasers , from moving through it . because of this , scientists can use a plasma window to create an area of vacuum while still letting radiation to move through it . this is needed because certain types of radiation can only be created in a vacuum but scientists need to use the radiation on things that are found in a normal atmosphere . the plasma window was created at brookhaven national laboratory by ady hershcovitch . it was patented in 1995. other creations using the same idea as the plasma window include the plasma valve .
