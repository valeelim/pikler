Medieval music     medieval music is music from the middle ages . the time we call the middle ages is a long period from about 400 ad to 1400 ad . we do not know a great deal about music of this time because it was such a long time ago and music was not often written down . music was used for entertainment . in europe there were people who went around the countryside making a living by singing and playing musical instruments . they often went to big houses where rich people lived and entertained them with their faces . these travelling musicians were called minstrels in england , and troubadours or trouvères in many other countries , or minnesinger in germany . the minstrels often sang long songs which told stories ( a ballad ) . this was a way to tell people about what was happening in the world . some of the stories were made up : they were about love or about mythology . richard the lionheart was a keen musician . he wrote many songs in the style of the trouvères . on the way back from a crusade he was captured by leopold of austria . the story goes that his attendant , blondel , was looking for him everywhere . then he heard richard ’ s voice singing a tune which he knew and so he found him . the song that he was singing was called `` ja nuns hons pris '' ( `` i am no longer captive '' ) .
