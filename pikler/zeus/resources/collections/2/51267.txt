Doppler effect     doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave . it is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave ( causer ) and whatever is measuring seeing or hearing the wave ( watcher or observer ) . it was first discovered by french scientist , hippolyte fizeau . kkkkkkk word for `` causer '' is `` sender '' . another word for `` change in distance '' is `` speed '' or `` relative velocity '' . a common example is sitting in a car while another car goes by the watcher . the watcher will hear a change in pitch , while the sender will not . for waves read all the waves that can send out or reflected by an object . and for reflection read change of direction of a wave . if observer and creator of the wave get closer , the frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter . - for light , this causes a shift in colour towards the blue end of the spectrum called a blueshift . - for sound , this causes the sound to become higher in pitch if the distance between the observer and creator gets longer , the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer .
