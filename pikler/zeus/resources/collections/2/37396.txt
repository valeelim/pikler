Diving     diving is a form of movement downwards , either from air to ground or to water . diving is also a sport . diving is often done from a springboard or an elevated platform . underwater diving includes scuba diving . scuba diving , however , is typically not considered a sport . dives used for scuba diving are relatively simplistic . an example of this is a giant stride entry , also known as a stride dive . there are six different types of dives , and four different body positions that a person can use when diving . there are six different types of dives . four of the types depend on whether the diver is facing towards the water or away from the water , and if they rotate towards or away from the water . the other two dives can be a part of the first four . for example , a diver can do a `` inward twisting '' or a `` forward armstand '' dive . the basic types of dives are : - forward – the diver faces towards the water and rotates forward . - backward – the diver stands with their back towards the water and rotates backwards , away from the board .
