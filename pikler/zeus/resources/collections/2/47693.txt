Guayana Esequiba     guayana esequiba is the name venezuela gives to a region that it claims in the west of guyana . its area is 159,500 square kilometers . for guyana , this area is divided into the six administrative regions of barima-waini , cuyuni-mazaruni , pomeroon-supenaam , potaro-siparuni , upper takutu-upper essequibo and essequibo islands-west demerara . spain made its first claim on this area in a report dated 10 july 1788 : `` it has been stated that the south coast of the orinoco from the point of barima , 20 leagues more or less inland , up to the creek of curucima , is low lying and swampy land and , so , reckoning all this tract as useless , very few patches of fertile land being found therein , and hardly any savannahs and pastures , it is disregarded ; so taking as chief base the said creek of curucima , or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the imataka , an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south-south-east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the rivers aguire , arature and amacuro , and others , in the distance of 20 leagues , direct to the cuyuni ; from there it will run on to the masaruni and essequibo , parallel to the sources of the berbis and surinama ; this is the directing line of the course which the new settlements and foundations proposed must follow .
