Prion     a prion is an infectious protein . the word is short for `` proteinaceous infectious particles '' . all known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue . at present they are untreatable and always fatal . prions cause many forms of encephalitis , or brain disease , such as scrapie , creutzfeldt-jakob disease ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) and kuru . prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the infected animals . while normal proteins have lots of alpha helices , or twisted parts , changed proteins have lots of beta sheets , or flat parts . the word is pronounced `` pree-on '' . because prions are proteins , and proteins can not reproduce themselves , it is a mystery how prions work . a vast amount of molecular biology research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves , with no clear result at present . related pages . - prion disease
