Monophyly     monophyly means common descent from a single ancestor . biologists have introduced a kind of taxonomy called cladistics . the aim of this is to make biological classification fit what we know about the way organisms evolved . if there is a group made of a common ancestor , and all its descendants , that group is monophyletic . ( greek : `` of one race '' ) . a group which contains organisms , without their common ancestor , is called polyphyletic . if a group contains the common ancestor , but leaves out some of its descendants , it is called paraphyletic . all living things on this planet are thought , on the basis of dna analysis , to be monophyletic , that is , to have one origin , not many . example : all species in the genus `` homo '' have come from the same ancestral form in the family hominidae , and no other descendants are known . thus the genus `` homo '' is monophyletic . if , on the other hand , it were discovered that `` homo habilis '' had developed from a different ancestor from `` homo sapiens '' , and this ancestor were not included in the genus , then the genus would be polyphyletic . since biologists by and large tend to prefer monophyletic groups , in this case , they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms .
