Molecular biology     molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level . the field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry , particularly cell biology , genetics , biophysics and biochemistry . molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell , including the interrelationship of dna , rna and protein biosynthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated . researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques that are typical for molecular biology , but they combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry . there is no hard & fast line between these disciplines , as there once was . the following figure is a schematic that shows one possible view of the relationship between the fields : - `` biochemistry '' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living organisms . - `` genetics '' is the study of inheritance the effect of genetic differences on organisms .
