Astronomical clock     an astronomical clock is a clock with special mechanisms and dials to display astronomical information . it shows the relative positions of the sun , moon , zodiacal constellations , and sometimes major planets . some examples are large public clocks , but others are instruments for use inside buildings . astronomical watches are made by several manufacturers . they are also extremely accurate . the clocks made in the middle ages used the geocentric method , showing the earth at the centre . the sun rotates round the earth : this accords with daily experience and with the world view of pre-copernican europe . the idea of an astronomical clock is ancient . although not a clock in the traditional sense , the 2nd century bc antikythera mechanism of ancient greece was used to calculate the positions of the sun , moon , and stars at any given point by use of complex mechanical gears . european astronomical clocks are probably descended from the technology of the antikythera mechanism . as cicero later wrote in the 1st century bc , archimedes and posidonius 's orrery achieved virtually the same thing .
