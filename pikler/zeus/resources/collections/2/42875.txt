Ur     ur was the one of the world 's first cities , in mesopotamia . it was a sumerian city-state , founded around 3,800 bc . there are written records dating from the 26th century . ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the river euphrates on the persian gulf . it is now well inland , south of the euphrates on its right bank , from nasiriyah , iraq . in the sumerian city , the ziggurat of ur stood a skyscraper over the city . it was about 20 metres ( 66 feet ) tall . later the ziggurat became more than a place for gods . there were workshops for craftworkers . for the priests , they were temples to do worship . there were big staricases to get up and down . the only level that remains today is the bottom . they tell a lot about the people who built them . sumerians had no tools and machinery like us . they were careful brick builders . brickmakers formed mud bricks there were perfect . after drying they take them to the site and set them in place with bitumen . bitumen is a thick sticky black stuff . it 's like asphalt , the stuff they use to pave roads . they braided reeds so they would be stronger , and hooked them up like steel cables .
