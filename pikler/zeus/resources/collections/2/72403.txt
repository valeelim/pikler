Bridge (instrument)    bridge ( instrument ) a bridge on a string instrument is something that stands on the body of the instrument and supports the strings . it sends the vibrations of the strings to the main part of the instrument so that the sound can be heard . the bridge of an instrument in the violin family ( violin , viola , cello and double bass ) can be seen very clearly . it is a piece of hardwood which is shaped like a bridge . the top is like an arch in shape because the player needs to be able to play on one string at a time . the feet of the bridge have to be shaped to fit on the front of the instrument ( the “ belly ” ) which is curved . the bridge is not fixed to the instrument : it is only held up because of the tension ( tightness ) of the strings . the soundpost , a small wooden column inside the body , is also held up by tension of the strings and the bridge . the part of the string which vibrates and gives the note is the part between the bridge and the top of the fingerboard ( or the part between the bridge and where the player puts his finger ) . the other end of the string is fixed to a tailpiece .
