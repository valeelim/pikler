Alpha helix     an alpha helix ( Î±-helix ) is a twisted part of a protein . it is one of the two most common parts of the secondary structure , or shape , of a protein . the other is the beta sheet . an alpha helix is created by alternating groups of atoms . there is a carbonyl group , created by a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom , and an amine group , created by a nitrogen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom . each section containing one of each of these groups is called a residue , a general term for a small part of a molecule . each amine group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group four residues earlier . a prion is a protein that causes disease by changing the shape of another protein . it does this by changing some of the alpha helices , which are more common in normal cells , to beta sheets , which are more common in prions . the alpha helix consists of 3.6 residues per turn . all hydrogen bonds face in the same direction . if two or more alpha helices come together , they become a tertiary structure . ( ex . five alpha helices arranged into a barrel shape )
