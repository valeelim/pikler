Gastropoda     gastropods , or `` univalves '' , are the largest and most successful class of molluscs . 60,000â€“75,000 known living species belong to it . most of are marine , but many live in freshwater or on land . their fossil record goes back to the later cambrian . slugs and snails , abalones , limpets , cowries , conches , top shells , whelks , and sea slugs are all gastropods . the gastropods are in origin sea-floor predators , though they did evolve into many other habitats . many lines living today evolved in the mesozoic era , taking advantage of the huge supply of food on the sea floor . snails have torsion , a process where the body coils to one side during development . the significance of this procedure is not yet clear . they have a well-defined head with two or four sensory tentacles . they also have a head-foot , which it moves on . the eyes at the tip of the tentacles range from simple to more complex eyes . most members have a shell , which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled ; it usually opens on the right hand side ( viewed with the shell apex pointing up ) . some species have an operculum , a lid or trapdoor to close the shell . in some , the slugs , the shell is absent , and the body is streamlined . the best-known gastropods are land slugs and snails , but more than half of all species live in a marine environment . marine gastropods include herbivores , detritus feeders , carnivores and a few ciliary feeders , in which the radula is reduced or absent . the radula is usually adapted to the food that a species eats .
