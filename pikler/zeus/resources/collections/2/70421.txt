Eneco Tour of Benelux     the eneco tour of benelux is a uci protour bicycle stage race . its name refers to its main sponsor , the energy company eneco energie . the first eneco tour of benelux took place from august 3 to august 10 2005 the tour of the netherlands began on 6 may 1948 , but only became an annual event in 1975. from about 2000 it was known as the eneco tour . the start of the uci 's protour in 2005 saw the tour reorganised . the then uci president hein verbruggen wanted to keep the tour of the netherlands for `` marketing reasons '' . ( part of the uci 's job is to make cycling more popular ) . the dutch tour organisation got a better sponsor ( eneco energie ) . but because the race was not difficult enough for the new protourthe race organisers asked the organisers of the tour of belgium and the tour de luxembourg . the idea was a tour of the benelux that would replace the three . the tours of belgium and luxembourg will carry on . the organisers of the tour of luxembourg did not want to join the new big race , so the eneco tour only covers belgium and the netherlands .
