The Crucible     the crucible is a 1950s play about the salem witch trials by arthur miller . miller wrote this play during the time of mccarthyism in america . many people were afraid that communism would stop the american way of life . some people falsely accused their enemies and even their friends of being communists during this time . miller writes about the ideas of fear and false accusation which affected him during this time . a `` crucible '' is a severe test or trial , which is exactly what happens in the play . miller intended `` the crucible '' as an allegory to mccarthyism . the events that took place during the time the play was written were very similar to the salem witch hunts . this is why miller named the book `` the cruicble '' after the salem trials . many of the characters in the crucible are based on real people who were at the salem witch trials . some are also based on people in the 1950s red scare , such as joseph mccarthy and julius rosenberg - john proctor- farmer in the town , had an affair with abigail williams , has three sons , is accused of being a witch , refuses to say he was wrong , and dies for his dignity .
