Exploration of Neptune     the exploration of neptune started on august 25 , 1989 , when `` voyager 2 '' became the first and so-far only spacecraft to visit the planet . like the other gas giants , neptune has no solid land on its surface so landing on neptune would be impossible . currently , nasa is thinking to send another spacecraft known as the `` neptune orbiter '' to study more about neptune ; the spacecraft is planned to be probably launched on 2035. in voyager 2 's last visit with a planet before leaving the solar system , voyager 2 came only 3,000 miles above neptune 's north pole , the closest approach it made to any planet after it left earth . voyager 2 studied neptune 's atmosphere , its rings , its magnetosphere , and its moons . several discoveries were made , including the discovery of the great dark spot and triton 's geysers . voyager 2 found that neptune 's atmosphere was very active , even though it gets only 3 % of the sunlight jupiter receives . voyager 2 discovered an anticyclone called the great dark spot , similar to jupiter 's great red spot . however , pictures taken by the hubble space telescope showed that the great dark spot had disappeared . also seen in neptune 's atmosphere at that time was an almond-shaped spot called `` d2 '' , and a bright , quickly moving cloud high above the cloud decks named scooter .
