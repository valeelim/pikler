Slide projector     a slide projector is a device that is used to view photographic slides by using optical and mechanical methods . it contains an electric light bulb . focusing lenses . reflector and condensing lenses . a holder that holds the slide . a flat piece of heat absorbing glass is often placed between the condensing lens and the slide , to avoid damaging the slide . this glass absorbs infrared . light passes through the transparent slide and lens , and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a screen . so the audience can view its reflection . the image may be projected onto a translucent `` rear projection '' screen . that is used for continuous automatic display for close viewing . this form of projection also avoids that people who look at the show interrupt the light stream or bump into the projector . slide projectors were common in the 1950s and 1960s as a form of entertainment ; family members and friends would gather to view slideshows . in-home photographic slides and slide projectors have largely been replaced by low cost paper prints , digital cameras , dvd media , video display monitors and digital projectors .
