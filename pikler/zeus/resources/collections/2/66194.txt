River Mersey     the river mersey is a river in north west england . it is 70 miles ( 112 km ) long , it stretches from stockport , greater manchester , and ends at liverpool bay , merseyside . for centuries , it formed part of the ancient county divide between lancashire and cheshire . the mersey is formed from three tributaries : the river etherow , the river goyt and the river tame . the modern accepted start of the mersey is at the confluence of the tame and goyt , in central stockport , greater manchester . however , older definitions , and many older maps , place its start a few miles up the goyt ; for example the 1911 encyclopaedia britannica states `` it is formed by the junction of the goyt and the etherow a short distance below marple in cheshire on the first-named stream . '' water quality in the river mersey has been severely affected by industrialisation . but salmon are now found in the river . they can be viewed on the salmon steps at woolston between the months of september and november . the river is now internationally famous thanks to the music of the 1960s known as merseybeat and its strong association with liverpool , which produced songs such as `` ferry cross the mersey '' .
