Freeganism     the word `` freeganism '' ( person : freegan ; related : freecycling ) means to get things for free rather than buy those items . a `` freegan '' is a person who does not like to pay for things , but does not steal either . freegans like to find things that other people throw away that are still useful . people often throw things away that are not used up or broken . sometimes they throw things away because they are bored of them and like to shop for new things . freegans look through other people 's rubbish bins and take what they can use , to the point of dumpster diving . this can be good for the environment , because no energy is used to make new things , in those cases . however , some cities have rules about taking things out of the rubbish , and freegans can get in trouble for this . the name `` freegan '' rhymes with `` vegan '' . it combines the words `` free '' and `` vegan '' . freegans are not necessarily vegans .
