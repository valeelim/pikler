Microraptor     microraptor was a small feathered dinosaur related to velociraptor . it had flight feathers , and could glide and probably fly . about two dozen well-preserved fossil specimens have been found in liaoning , china . they are from the lower cretaceous jiufotang formation , 125 million years old . adult specimens are 42–83 centimeters ( 1.4–2.7 ft ) long , so `` microraptor '' was one of the smallest dinosaurs . `` microraptor '' is one of a number of 'dinobirds ' found in the same area of china . they were buried in volcanic ash during huge eruptions . `` microraptor '' was among the first non-avian dinosaurs discovered with the impressions of feathers and wings . three specimens of `` m. zhaoianus '' have been described in detail , in addition to two specimens of `` m. gui '' and three specimens of `` m . sp . '' described by xu and colleagues in 2003 , from which most feather impressions are known . unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs , `` microraptor '' is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on its feet as well as its forearms and hands . this led xu xing to describe it as a `` four winged dinosaur '' , and to speculate that it may have glided using all four limbs for lift . their bodies had a thick covering of feathers . a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail gave stability during flight .
