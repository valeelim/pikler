Drone (music)    drone ( music ) in music , a drone is a note which sounds all the time while a piece of music is played . some folk instruments always make a drone when they are played : bagpipes and hurdy gurdies in european culture , sitars in indian music , and many other instruments in asian and african music . sometimes more than one drone is heard ( often two notes which are a fifth apart ) . music with drones has to have simple harmonies because it is not possible to modulate to different keys . other things can make up for this , for example , scottish bagpipe music has lots of little ornamental notes to make it interesting . some western composers liked to use a drone ( especially one in fifths ) to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments . bach , fran√ßois couperin and other baroque composers often called such pieces `` musette '' ( the french for `` bagpipes '' ) . sometimes they did this in orchestral music : haydn used a drone in the last part of his symphony no . 104 to accompany a folk tune . other pages . - pedal point
