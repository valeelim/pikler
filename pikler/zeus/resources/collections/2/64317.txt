Peripheral nervous system     the peripheral nervous system , or pns , is part of the nervous system . it consists of the nerves and ganglia which are outside the central nervous system ( the brain and spinal cord ) . the main function of the pns is to connect the central nervous system ( cns ) to the limbs and organs . the pns is not protected by bone like the central nervous system . therefore it is exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system ( sns ) and the autonomic nervous system ( ans ) . but the enteric nervous system ( ens ) can be seen as a third branch of its own and not as part of the autonomic nervous system . - the sns coordinates your body 's movement , receiving external stimuli , and regulates everything under conscious control . - the ans controls all automatic actions . that means that it controls all reflexes and actions during sleep . - the ens controls the gastrointestinal system .
