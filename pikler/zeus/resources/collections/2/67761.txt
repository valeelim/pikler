Wind shear     wind shear is a difference in either wind speed or direction over a fairly short distance in the atmosphere . wind shear can be divided into two different types : `` horizontal '' and `` vertical wind shear '' . weather situations when the wind shear is observed happen : - at `` weather fronts '' when the temperature difference across the front is 5 Â°c or more , and the front moves at 15 kt or faster . - at `` low level jets '' when a significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet . - at `` mountains '' when winds blow over and create vertical shear on the lee side . - at `` inversions '' when on a clear and calm night a radiation inversion is formed near the ground . - at `` downbursts '' when an outflow boundary moves away from a thunderstorm . - at `` sailing '' when wind shear affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the sailing mast . related pages . - aeroplane - refraction other websites . - national science digital library - wind shear
