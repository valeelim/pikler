Resistor     a resistor limits the electrical current that flows through a circuit . resistance is the restriction of current . in a resistor the energy of the electrons that pass through the resistor are changed to heat and/or light . for example , in a light bulb there is a resistor made of tungsten which converts the electrons into light . resistors can be linked in various combinations to help make a circuit : 1. series - where the resistors are linked `` one after another '' . 1. parallel - where the resistors are linked `` over one another '' . there are many different types of resistors . resistors have different ratings to tell electricians how much power they can handle before they break and how accurately they can slow the flow of electricity . connecting two resistors in series results in a higher resistance than when you connect the same two resistors in parallel . to prevent the resistor from reaching its capacity , place the resistors in parallel to keep the total resistance lower . nowadays the electrical industry in many cases uses so called surface-mount technology based resistors which can be very small .
