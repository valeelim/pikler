Premier     premier is sometimes used instead of prime minister . but it is also the title of the leader of the government in some territories . when a colony is first allowed to elect its own government the head of the government is called the `` chief minister '' . as the colony gets more able to rule itself it is given more powers and the title of the chief minister is changed to `` premier '' . when the colony becomes independent the premier becomes a prime minister , and british government ministers lose any authority to rule the new country . the leader of the federal governments in australia and canada is called the prime minister , but the leader of the governments in australian states and canadian provinces is called the premier . this is because the states and provinces are not independent .
