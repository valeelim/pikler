Resonator     a resonator is something that resonates . this may make a particular frequency of a sound or other vibration become bigger . in electromagnetics a cavity resonator is a resonator composed of a space that is usually surrounded by a dielectric or metal which allows standing wave patterns at particular frequencies , eigenmodes , correlated to their size , shape , and material . most musical instruments have resonators . they are the parts which makes the sound louder . a vibraphone , for example , has long tubes underneath the keys . it also has a special effect : a mechanism which , when it is turned on , opens and shuts the resonators very quickly so that a trembling sound is heard . the body of a violin is a resonator : without the body the sound of the string vibrating would hardly be heard , just as the sound of an elastic band stretched between two fingers can hardly be heard .
