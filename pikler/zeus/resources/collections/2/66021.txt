Diplomatic immunity     diplomatic immunity is a special law that covers people who work in embassies or consulates . the people are called diplomats . the diplomatic immunity means that although they live and work as a visitor inside a `` host country '' , they are not ruled by the law of that country . they are only ruled by the law of their home country . a diplomat can work without interference from the police and government of the country where he works . diplomatic immunity means that a diplomat can keep the secrets of his own country 's government , without the government of the host country being able to find out about them . police from the host country can not arrest a diplomat , or search a diplomat 's house or office . they can not even give a diplomat 's car a parking ticket without the permission of the diplomat 's government . honorary consuls only work part-time as diplomats , so only have diplomatic immunity when working as diplomats . police may search their offices , but not the part where they keep their diplomatic work .
