Scientific notation     scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that is often used by scientists and mathematicians to make it easier to write large and small numbers . a number that is written in scientific notation has several properties that make it very useful to local scientists . it makes very large numbers into smaller numbers using decimals and exponents . the basic idea of scientific notation is to express zeros as a power of ten . the notation for this can be written as : formula_1 where `` b '' is an integer , or `` whole '' number , that describes the number of times 10 is multiplied by itself and the letter `` a '' any real number , called the significand or mantissa ( `` using `` mantissa '' may cause confusion as it can also refer to the fractional part of the common logarithm '' ) . written in the form , exponent `` b '' is chosen such that the absolute value of `` a '' remains at least one but less than ten formula_2 . normal mathematics convention dictates a minus sign to precede the first of the decimal digits of `` a '' for a negative number ; that of `` b '' for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 , e.g . minus one half is . there is no need to represent zero in normalized form , the digit 0 is sufficient . the normalized form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign in `` a '' , as the exponent `` b '' gives the number 's order of magnitude .
