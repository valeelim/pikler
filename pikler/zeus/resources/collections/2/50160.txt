Bede     bede ( also saint bede , or the venerable bede ) ( 673â€“735 ) , was a monk and an early historian of the church in england . he was a member of the sister northumbrian monasteries of monkwearmouth-jarrow . he spent a great deal of time at jarrow with its large library . both were in the english county of durham ( now tyne and wear ) . he is well known as an author and scholar , whose best-known work , `` historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum '' ( `` the ecclesiastical history of the english people '' ) gained him the title `` the father of english history '' . bede became respectfully known as `` venerable bede '' soon after his death , but this was not linked to consideration for sainthood by the roman catholic church . bede himself said he was born in 673 and on the lands of the monastery of wearmouth . at age seven he was presented by his family to the abbot of wearmouth , benedict biscop , to be educated . bede does n't say if his family was noble or not . bede was ordained a deacon when he was nineteen and at age thirty he was ordained a priest . while he was active in his community bede found study , writing and teaching his favorite activities . he studied the bible and latin . he learnt latin because that was the language of the bible and other books in the monastery library . his teaching would have been very basic and his opinions were very conventional ( not radical in any way ) .
