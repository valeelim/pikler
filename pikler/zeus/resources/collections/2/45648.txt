Fluid     a fluid is a substance that can move easily and change shape such as water ( liquids ) , or air ( gases ) , or plasmas . they can 'flow'- flow and fluids both come from the same english word roots ( latin : `` fluere '' `` to flow '' ) and are pronounced similarly . the physics of fluids is called fluid mechanics . fluids usually take on the shape of their containers , in contrast to solids which maintain their own shape . some things are not exactly fluid and not exactly solid , such as silly putty . powders are made up of small solids that appear to flow but do n't actually . if you cool a fluid down enough it eventually becomes solid .
