Unitary authority     a unitary authority is a type of local authority that is responsible for all local government functions within its area . this is different from a system where local government functions are divided between different authorities . typically unitary authorities cover large towns or cities , which are large enough to be independent of county or regional administration . sometimes they consist of counties which have no lower level of administration . in the united kingdom , `` unitary authorities '' are english councils which are responsible for almost all local government functions within their areas . this is opposed to the system of local government which still exists in most of england , where local government functions are divided between county councils and district councils . until 1996 a similar system existed in scotland and wales but this has now been replaced by a fully unitary system . a unitary system has existed in northern ireland since 1973. some cities , large towns and groups of neighbouring towns are unitary authorities and independent from county councils and some english counties , such as rutland , herefordshire and the isle of wight , have so small populations that the entire county is a unitary authority .
