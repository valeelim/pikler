Mersenne prime     in mathematics , a mersenne number is a number that is one less than a `` power of two '' . a mersenne prime is a `` mersenne number '' that is a prime number . this however , is not sufficient . many mathematicians prefer the definition of a mersenne number where exponent `` n '' has to be a prime number . for example , `` 31 = 2 − 1 '' , and 5 is a prime number , so 31 is a mersenne number ; and 31 is also a mersenne prime because it is a prime number . but the mersenne number `` 2047 = 2 − 1 '' is not a prime because it is divisible by 89 and 23. and `` 2 − 1 = 15 '' can be shown to be composite because 4 is not prime . throughout modern times , the largest known prime number has very often been a mersenne prime . most sources restrict the term `` mersenne number '' to where `` n '' is prime , as all mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below . mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers , which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors . historically , the study of mersenne primes was motivated by this connection ; in the 4th century bc euclid demonstrated that if `` m '' is a mersenne prime then `` m '' ( `` m '' +1 ) /2 is a perfect number . in the 18th century , leonhard euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form . no odd perfect numbers are known , and it is suspected that none exist ( if it exist , it would have to be greater than 10 ) .
