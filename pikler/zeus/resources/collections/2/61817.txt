Hypothesis     a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for some event or problem . cardinal bellarmine gave a well known example of the older sense of the word in his warning to galileo in the early 17th century : that he must not treat the motion of the earth as a reality , but merely as a hypothesis . today , a hypothesis refers to an idea that needs to be tested . a hypothesis needs more work by the researcher in order to check it . a tested hypothesis that works , may become part of a theory or become a theory itself . the testing should be an attempt to prove the hypothesis is wrong . that is , there should be a way to falsify the hypothesis , at least in principle . people often call a hypothesis an `` educated guess '' . experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem . a 'working hypothesis ' is just a rough kind of hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research . the hope is that a theory will be produced , even if the hypothesis ultimately fails .
