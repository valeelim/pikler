Jurisprudence     jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law . scholars of jurisprudence , or legal philosophers , hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law , of legal reasoning , legal systems and of legal institutions . as jurisprudence has developed , there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages : - natural law is the idea that there are unchangeable laws of nature which govern us , and that our institutions ought to match this natural law - analytic jurisprudence asks questions like , `` what is law ? '' `` what are the criteria for legal validity ? '' or `` what is the relationship between law and morality ? '' are other questions that legal philosophers may engage with - normative jurisprudence asks what law should be like . it overlaps with moral and political philosophy , and includes questions of whether we should obey the law , on what grounds law-breakers might properly be punished , the proper uses and limits of regulation modern jurisprudence and philosophy of law is dominated today primarily by western academics . the ideas of the western legal tradition have become so pervasive throughout the world that it is tempting to see them as universal . historically , however , many philosophers from other traditions have discussed the same questions , from islamic scholars to the ancient greeks .
