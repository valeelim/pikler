Pulsar     pulsars are neutron stars which spin rapidly and produce huge electromagnetic radiation along a narrow beam . neutron stars are very dense , and have short , regular spins . this produces a very precise interval between pulses that range from roughly milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar . the pulse can only be seen if the earth is close enough to the direction of the beam , similar to how one can only see a lighthouse when the beam is shining in one 's direction . the pulses match the star 's turns . the spinning causes a lighthouse effect , as the radiation is only seen at short intervals . werner becker of the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics recently said , the first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by jocelyn bell burnell and antony hewish of the university of cambridge . the observed emission had pulses separated by 1.33 seconds , coming from the same place in the sky . the source kept to sidereal time . at first , they did not understand why pulsars have a regular change in the strength of radiation . the word `` pulsar '' is short for `` pulsating star '' .
