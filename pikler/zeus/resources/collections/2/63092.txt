First law of thermodynamics     the first law of thermodynamics states that energy ca n't be created or destroyed , but it can be changed . the law forms the basis of the principle of conservation of energy . this means that anything that uses energy is changing the energy from one kind of energy to another . for example , exercising changes energy from food into kinetic ( motion ) energy . energy can not be created and never goes away . energy just changes its form . people can use the changes to do work that is useful . examples of forms of energy in classical mechanics include heat , light , kinetic ( movement ) or potential energy . however in modern physics it is considered that there are only two types of energy - mass and kinetic energy , although this may not be helpful to those not familiar with more complex physics . the law means that the total energy of the universe is a constant . however , energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another . the most common wording of the first law of thermodynamics used by scientists is :
