War crime     a war crime is a crime that happens in context of or associated with war . there are international laws of war that say what people can do during wars and what they can not do . a war crime breaks these rules . today , these rules are international laws called the geneva conventions and the hague convention . to be a war crime , a crime must be part of a plan , or the crime has to be committed against many people . the idea of what a `` war crime '' is has changed over time . for example , during world war i , using poison gas in combat was not thought of as a war crime . now it is . in 2002 , the international criminal court ( icc ) was created . its goal is to look into and , if possible , punish people for war crimes . when the icc was created , it came up with a longer list of war crimes . for example , its list was the first one to include types of sexual abuse like forcing women into sexual slavery . here are some examples of crimes that the icc lists as war crimes . these are war crimes whether they are committed against enemy soldiers or civilians or neutral persons .
