Solubility     solubility is the ability of a substance ( the solute ) , to mix into a liquid ( the solvent ) . it measures the highest amount of substance mixed into a liquid solvent while they are both at equal amounts . when the two mix together it is called a saturated solution . certain substances can mix into any amount of a liquid solvent . an example of this is ethanol in water . this process is better described as `` miscible '' ( the ability to mix with one another ) . solubility does not depend on the size , in fact even the large particles will eventually all dissolve . a solute is a substance that is dissolving in a solvent and is the smaller part of the solution . a solvent is the bigger part of a solution and is the substance that the solute dissolves in . other websites . - alogps interactive calculation of aqueous solubility of compounds at virtual computational chemistry laboratory using several algorithms - quantum web based calculation of aqueous and dmso solubility of compounds quantum web based prediction of aqueous and dmso solubility of compounds
