File system     a file system ( or filesystem ) is a way of storing all data on a data storage device . the data is usually organized in computer files in directories . below the file system there is usually a physical device where the files are stored . this might be a hard disk , usb flash drive , compact disc , or dvd . the file system might also talk to a remote server over a network where the file is stored . the file system might also only use ram to store the files . the underlying storage mechanism usually has no concept of a file . a hard disk knows of disk blocks , which are numbered in a certain way . these disk blocks contain binary data ( usually : large numbers ) . the file system does the `` translation '' between the large numbers , and the view the users see , that is that of files , organized in a certain way . more recently , concepts from databases have been used to develop file systems . that way , there are two different kinds of data : - data that holds the files - data that is used to describe what state the files are in . this is called metadata .
