Plantation     a plantation is a large farm which is specialized on farming one type of crop . pantations grow cash crops , mostly for export , and less for local use . crops grown on plantations include banana , sugarcane , coffee , tea , cotton and tobacco . some of the problems with plantations come from the fact that they are monocultures , that is there is only one kind of crop that is grown there . this makes them vulnerable to pests , for example . among the earliest examples of plantations were the latifundia of the roman empire . they produced large quantities of wine and olive oil for export . plantation agriculture grew rapidly with the increase in international trade and the relative decline of subsistence farming . like every economic activity , it has changed over time . earlier forms of plantation agriculture were associated with large disparities of wealth and income , foreign ownership and political influence , and exploitative social systems such as indentured labor and slavery .
