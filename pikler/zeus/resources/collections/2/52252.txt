Valence (chemistry)    valence ( chemistry ) in chemistry , valence ( which is sometimes called valency ) is the number of chemical bonds the atoms of a certain element can form . for a long time , people thought that this number was a fixed property of the element in question . they thought that carbon always has four bonds , oxygen always has two , and hydrogen always has one . the problem was seen only later . for example , phosphorous sometimes behaves as if it had three bonds , a valence of three . at other times though , it seems to have five bonds . iupac saw this problem , and proposed oxidation numbers . this means there is one number per chemical element . the problem of this approach is that it leaves aside most chemical properties of the elements in question . related pages . - valence electron other websites . - `` valence '' from the iupac `` gold book '' ( pdf file )
