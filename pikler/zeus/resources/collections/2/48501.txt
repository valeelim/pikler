Chiffon cake     a chiffon cake is a type of sponge cake . it is a cake that is made using vegetable oil instead of butter . this gives the cake a foam-like texture . because there is no butter in the cakes , they are more healthy but have less flavor . chiffon cakes are usually served by soaking the cake layer in a cake syrup ( which is nothing more than 2 parts water to 1 part sugar ) to provide it with moisture since it 's dry in nature . the chiffon cake was invented in 1927 by harry baker , a california insurance salesman turned caterer . baker kept the recipe secret for 20 years until he sold it to general mills . at this point the name was changed to `` chiffon cake '' and a set of 14 recipes and variations was released to the public in a betty crocker pamphlet published in 1948 .
