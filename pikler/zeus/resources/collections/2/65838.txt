Metallic hydrogen     metallic hydrogen is an alkali metal made from hydrogen gas . this is formed when the hydrogen gas is under compression and results with the gas changing phase . it is an example of degenerate matter . the matter has a crystal structure of proton atoms , with spacing that is extremely small , smaller than a bohr radius ( which is 52.918 x 10 m ) . the electrons in the molecular orbital are unbounded and they behave like the conduction electrons in a metal . metallic hydrogen is unusual as the element itself is not an alkali metal , but a diatomic gas . metallic hydrogen is known to exist in the cores of jupiter and saturn . jupiter has the most metallic hydrogen .
