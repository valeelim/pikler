Polychaete     polychaetes , or `` bristle worms '' , are a class of annelid worms . they are generally found in a marine environment . there are more than 10,000 known species in this class . they are ancient animals , dating back to 518 million years ago . they are first found in the early cambrian fossil beds of sirius passet in greenland . each of their body segments has some fleshy protrusions that stand out . these 'parapodia ' have many bristles , which are made of chitin . this is different from the oligochaeta , which are similar in form , but only have a few bristles . common species are the lugworm , and the clam worm `` nereis '' ( which is sometimes also called a 'sandworm ' ) . polychaetes are segmented worms , generally less than in length , although ranging at the extremes from to . they are often brightly coloured , and may be iridescent or even luminescent . each segment bears a pair of paddle-like parapodia , which are used for movement . in many species , the parapodia , well supplied with blood vessels , act as the worm 's primary respiratory surfaces . bundles of bristles stick out from the parapodia .
