Cyclone     cyclone in meteorology refers to any low pressure area with winds spiraling inwards . cyclones rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere . cyclone is the general term for a variety of low pressure system types , such as tropical cyclones , extra tropical cyclones and tornadoes . the largest of the low-pressure systems are the extratropical cyclones and the cold-core polar cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale which in meteorology is a horizontal length of 1000 km or more . the warm-core cyclones are the tropical cyclones , mesocyclones , and the polar lows that lie within the smaller mesoscale . the subtropical cyclones are intermediate in size . cyclones have also been on other planets outside of the earth , such as mars and neptune . for example the great red spot of jupiter and the great black spot of neptune . cyclones are also referred to as hurricanes and typhoons . they consist of the eye , eyewall and rainbands . the process of cyclone formation and intensification is described as cyclogenesis . the formation of extratropical cyclones comes as waves in large regions of enhanced midlatitude temperature contrasts which are called baroclinic zones . these zones contract to form weather fronts as the circulation of the cyclone closes and gets more intense . later in their life cycle , cyclones form what is called an occluded front . the cyclone 's track is then guided over the course of an 2 to 6 day life cycle by its steering flow of the polar or subtropical jetstream .
