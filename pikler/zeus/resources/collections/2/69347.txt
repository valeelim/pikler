Weaving     weaving is the interlacing of two sets of threads at right angles to each other to form cloth . weaving is usually done on a loom . one set of threads is called the `` warp '' . these threads are held taut and in parallel order on the loom by `` harnesses '' creating a space called the `` shed '' . the `` weft '' thread is wound onto `` bobbins '' . the bobbins are held in a `` shuttle '' , which carries the weft thread through the shed . the warp threads are moved over and under the weft threads .
