Cracking (chemistry)    cracking ( chemistry ) in chemistry terms , cracking is a process by which complicated organic molecules ( such as kerogens or heavy hydrocarbons ) are broken down into simpler molecules ( e.g . light hydrocarbons ) by breaking their carbon-carbon bonds . how fast the cracking process is and how long it takes for the end products to form are very dependent on the temperature and any existing catalysts . cracking , also referred to as pyrolysis , is the breakdown of a large alkane into smaller , more useful alkanes and an alkene . cracking is used in petroleum to form `` light '' products such as lpg and gasoline . it usually produces a short chain alkane and a long chain alkene .
