Santorini     santorini is a greek island . the capital is thira . santorini is 63 miles from the island of crete . the total population is 13,600. santorini is considered an active volcano . human presences on the island seem to have existed since the middle of the 3rd millennium b.c . the excavations at akrotiri have confirmed that human activity on the island continued until the eruption of the volcano around 1500 b.c , which entirely buried the island beneath very thick layers of pozzuolona . at that point , all traces of human activity vanished from the island until the end of the 13th century b.c . according to herodotus , the island was initially called strongyle ( the round one ) . then later , because of its beauty , it was named kalliste ( the fairest one ) . the phoenicians settled in kalliste , and after the phoenicians , the lacedaemonians arrived and renamed the island after their leader , theras . in the 9th century b.c . thera , became an important stopping point of that era in the travel routes between the east and the west . the phoenician alphabet was adopted at this time for writing in the greek language . interestingly though , the conservative therans , did not follow the cultural development of their counterparts in the other cycladic islands . at about 630 b.c the therans reached the north coast of the african continent where they founded cyrene , the only theran colony . from as early on as the 6th century b.c . thera had its own coinage . during the classical period in greece [ 5th and 4th century b.c . ] thera did not play any significant role in the events of that hellenic time . during the peloponesian war thera sided with sparta , as expected . in hellenistic times the island 's strategic position made thera an important base for the war campaigns in the aegean of the successors to alexander the great .
