Polyethylene terephtalate     polyethylene terephthalate ( aka pet , pete or the obsolete petp or pet-p ) is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family . the chemical industry makes it . it is used in synthetic fibers ; beverage , food and other liquid containers ; thermoforming applications ; and engineering resins often in combination with glass fiber . it is one of the most important raw materials used in man-made fibers . it is also used as the dielectric in multi-purpose capacitors ( k73-16 series ) . depending on its processing and thermal history , it may exist both as an amorphous ( transparent ) and as a semi-crystalline ( opaque and white ) material . its monomer can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct or the transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate with methanol as a byproduct . polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers ( done immediately after esterification/transesterification ) with ethylene glycol as the byproduct ( the ethylene glycol is recycled in production ) .
