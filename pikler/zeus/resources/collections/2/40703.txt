Procaine     procaine is a analgesic drug . it is used primarily to reduce the pain of getting certain shots , and is also used by dentists . the drug is usually sold under the name novocaine , or novacaine . procaine was first made in 1905 , and was the first man-made pain-killer that could be taken as a shot . it was created by the german scientist alfred einhorn ( 1857-1917 ) who gave the chemical the name novacaine , from the latin word `` novus '' ( which means new ) and caine , as in `` cocaine . '' procaine is not often used today because other safer and better working pain-killing drugs now exist . prior to the discovery of procaine , cocaine was the most commonly used pain-killer . procaine ( like cocaine ) has the advantage of reducing bleeding , unlike other pain-killers and without the dangerous qualities of cocaine .
