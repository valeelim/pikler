Polar cyclone     polar cyclones ( also known as arctic cyclones ) are large areas of low pressure . they should not be confused with polar lows since people happen to use the same term for polar cyclones . polar cyclones are usually 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers wide in which the air is moving in a spiral counterclockwise fashion in the northern hemisphere . the reason for the rotation is the same as tropical cyclones , the coriolis effect . they also exist in places such as greenland , the eurasian arctic area , and northern canada , with about 15 cyclones per winter . polar cyclones can form in any time of the year , although summer polar cyclones are usually weaker than the ones that form in the winter . also , they are not closely studied and are rarely destructive since they happen in areas with little or no population . one center is near baffin island and the other over northeast siberia . in the southern hemisphere , it is usually near the edge of the ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude .
