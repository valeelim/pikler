Organelle     in cell biology , an organelle is a part of a cell that does a specific job . organelles typically have their own plasma membrane round them . most of the cell 's organelles are in the cytoplasm . the name `` organelle '' comes from the idea that these structures are to cells what an organ is to the body . there are many types of organelles in eukaryotic cells . prokaryotes were once thought not to have organelles , but some examples have now been found . they are not organised like eukaryote organelles , and are not bounded by plasma membranes . they are called bacterial microcompartments . the term is now widely used to refer to cellular structures surrounded by single or double plasma membranes . however , the older definition of a 'subcellular functional unit ' still coexists . that is , the term is sometimes used for structures which are not membrane-bound . the plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer with some proteins embedded in it . it keeps the ions and molecules of the organelle from merging with the surroundings .
