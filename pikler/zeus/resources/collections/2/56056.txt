Mothball     mothballs are small balls of chemical pesticide and deodorant.they are used when clothing and other articles susceptible to damage from mold or moth larvae are stored . older mothballs were made primarily of naphthalene . because naphthalene can catch fire easily , modern mothballs use 1,4-dichlorobenzene instead . both of these ingredients have a strong , pungent smell often associated strongly with mothballs . camphor , an insect repellent , can also be used in mothballs . their use when clothing is stored out-of-season led to the colloquial usage of the terms mothballed and put into mothballs to refer to anything which is put into storage or whose operation is suspended . some claim that the use of the word in this sense derives from naval usage . when warships were laid up , the open ends of their gun barrels and other openings were covered in white material to prevent the entry of water . these white circles suggested mothballs .
