Pompey     pompey , `` pompey the great '' , ( gnaeus pompeius magnus , 29 september 106 bcâ€“28 september 48 bc ) , was an important military and political leader of the late roman republic . coming from an italian provincial background , he got a place for himself in the ranks of roman nobility , and was given the nickname of `` the great '' by lucius cornelius sulla . pompey was a rival of marcus licinius crassus and an ally to gaius julius caesar . the three politicians would dominate the late roman republic through a political alliance called the first triumvirate . after the death of crassus , pompey and caesar disputed the leadership of the roman republic . pompey was decisively beaten by caesar at the battle of pharsalus . in the beginning , pompey said he could defeat caesar and raise armies merely by stamping his foot on the soil of italy , but in the spring of 49 bc , caesar crossed the rubicon and his legions swept down the peninsula . pompey abandoned rome , and took his legions south towards brundisium . pompey intended build up his army , and wage war against caesar in the east . neither pompey nor the senate thought of taking the vast treasury with them , probably thinking caesar would not dare take it for himself . it was left in the temple of saturn when caesar and his forces entered rome .
