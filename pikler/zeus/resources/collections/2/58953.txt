Elephants Dream     elephants dream is a short movie made using mostly open source software . blender was the main program used to make the movie . it began production in september 2005 and was released on march 24 , 2006. it was first developed under the name `` orange '' , then later changed to `` machina '' then finally to `` elephants dream '' since the people working on the movie could not decide how `` machina '' would be pronounced . the movie is 11 minutes long . the movie has a very random and abstract nature . despite the film 's title , `` elephants dream '' does not have any elephants or dreams . it instead has proog and emo in a extremely bizarre construction referred to only as `` the machine . '' proog tries to introduce emo to its nature , but emo is reluctant ( if a person is reluctant to do something , he/she does not want to do it . ) and argues about its purpose . bassam kurdali , director of elephants dream , explained the plot of the movie by saying : `` the story is very simple- i 'm not sure you can call it a complete story even- it is about how people create ideas/stories/fictions/social realities and communicate them or impose them on others . thus proog has created ( in his head ) the concept of a special place/machine , that he tries to `` show '' to emo . when emo does not accept his story , proog becomes desperate and hits him . it 's a parable of human relationships really- you can substitute many ideas ( money , religion , social institutions , property ) instead of proog 's machine - the story does not say that creating ideas is bad , just hints that it is better to share ideas than force them on others . there are lots of little clues/hints about this in the movie- many little things have a meaning- but we are not very `` tight '' with it , because we are hoping people will have their own ideas about the story , and make a new version of the movie . in this way ( and others ) we tie the story of the movie with the `` open movie '' idea .
