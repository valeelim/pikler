Bacteriophage     a bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria . the term is commonly shortened to phage . bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the biosphere . like viruses that infect eukaryotes ( plants , animals , and fungi ) there are many different phage structures and functions . phages are typically made of an outer protein hull that has genetic material inside it . the genetic material may be single-stranded ( ssrna or ssdna ) , or double-stranded ( dsrna or dsdna ) . it may be between 5 and 500 kilobase pairs long with either circular or linear arrangement . bacteriophages are usually between 20 and 200 nanometers in size . phage genomes may code for as few as four genes , and as many as hundreds of genes . phages inject their genome into the bacterium , and replicate inside the bacterium . phages are everywhere there are bacteria , such as soils or the intestines of animals . they are very common in sea water : up to 9Ã—10 virions per milliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface , and up to 70 % of marine bacteria may be infected by phages .
