Logical conjunction     logical conjunction ( very often called and ) is a logic operation . logical conjunction shows a true/false value ( `` output '' ) . whether it is true or false depends on two other true/false values ( `` inputs '' ) . if both of the inputs are `` true '' at the same time , then logical conjunction outputs `` true . '' if one of the inputs is false , or if both of the inputs are false , then logical conjunction outputs `` false . '' its logic gate equivalent is the and gate .
