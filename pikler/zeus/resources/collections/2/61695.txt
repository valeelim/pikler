Bolshoi Theatre     the bolshoi theatre ( russian : большой театр , bol'shoy teatr , large theater ) is a world-famous theatre and opera company in moscow , russia , which gives performances of ballet and opera . it is in the centre of moscow , near the kremlin . in 1776 the history of the bolshoi theatre began when empress catherina ii allowed prince pyotr urusov to run theatrical performances . that theatre burned down and a new one was built in 1825. that one burnt down too , but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1856. after that , no important repairs were made to the building for 150 years . by the beginning of the 21st century it was in a very bad state and in danger of falling down . major repairs were started in 2005 , and the work should be completed by the end of october 2011. when it is finished the theatre should look just as it did at the time of the tsars , with embroidered silk tapestry and the tsar 's sign replacing the communist hammers and sickles . the total cost of the rebuild will be around £400 million which is 16 times what they originally said it would cost .
