Nuclear energy     nuclear energy is the energy that holds together the nuclei of atoms . atoms are the most simple blocks that make up matter . every atom has in its center a very small nucleus . normally , nuclear energy is hidden inside the atoms . however , some atoms are radioactive and send off part of their nuclear energy as radiation . radiation is given off from the nucleus of unstable isotopes of radioactive substances . nuclear energy can also be freed in two other ways : nuclear fusion and nuclear fission . nuclear fusion is the combining of two atoms into one and nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom . both ways make big amounts of energy . they sometimes take place in nature . fusion is the source of heat in the sun . fission is also used in nuclear power plants to make electricity . both fusion and fission can be used in nuclear weapons . nuclear energy production and use has been a controversial topic over the years . this has always been dictated by the history of the nuclear energy and also on the current energy demands as well as environmental conservation demands . countries should venture into nuclear energy production to help meet the rising energy demand , to help conserve the environment by avoiding pollution , and also as a long lasting replacement for the depleting fossil fuels sources of energy . there have been mitigation measures put in place to ensure that nuclear energy accidents like those of chernobyl and fukushima do not have a repeat . countries should also cease from using the nuclear energy to make dangerous weapons of mass destruction .
