Gödel number     in formal number theory a gödel numbering is a function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a gödel number ( gn ) . the concept was first used by kurt gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorem . a gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation , and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function . a numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of gödel numbers ( also called effective numbers ) . rogers ' equivalence theorem states criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions are gödel numberings . given a countable set `` s '' , a gödel numbering is an injective function with both `` f '' and formula_2 ( the inverse of `` f '' ) being computable functions . one of the simplest gödel numbering schemes is used every day : the correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols . for example , the sequence 2 3 is understood , by a particular set of rules , to correspond to the number twenty-three . similarly , strings of symbols from some alphabet of `` n '' symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to `` n '' and reading the string as the base `` n '' +1 representation of an integer .
