Service (economics)    service ( economics ) in economics and marketing , a service is an economic activity ( e.g. , labor ) offered as a product . although a service ( i.e. , the activity ) is a non-material good , the result it produces may be a material good depending on the service . for example , a construction service may produce a material good , but a lawn mowing service may not . in most cases , the person or company buying the service does not obtain exclusive ownership of the service , but may take ownership of the material good , if one is produced . services can be described in terms of their main attributes . - ( `` can not be touched '' ) - they can not be seen , handled , smelled , etc . there is no need for storage . - perishability ( `` if someone does n't use it , it is lost . '' ) - if someone can not sell their services , their time is `` lost '' . it is a lost economic opportunity . for example a doctor that is booked for only two hours a day can not later work those hoursâ€“ she has lost her economic opportunity . other service examples are airplane seats ( once the plane departs , those empty seats can not be sold ) , and theatre seats ( sales end at a certain point ) .
