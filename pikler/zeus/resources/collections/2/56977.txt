Clockwise     a clockwise movement is one that moves in a circle `` like the clock 's hands '' : from the top to the right , then down , then to the left , and back to the top . the opposite of clockwise is counterclockwise or anticlockwise . the movement is from the top to the left , then down , then to the right , and finally back up to the top .
