Electrolysis     electrolysis is a scientific way of `` splitting '' substances . electrolysis means `` electric-splitting '' and involves the separation of substances through an electric current . metals above carbon in the reactivity series ( potassium , sodium , lithium , calcium , magnesium and aluminium ) are extracted by electrolysis . electrolysis is used in the mining industry to split reactive metals from their ores after they are taken from the ground . it is also used to plate ( cover ) things with metal because it costs less than using , for example , 100 % pure solid gold to make jewellery . many beauty shops use electrolysis or electrology to remove hair . this is done by `` electrocuting '' the hair so it splits along its root . electrolysis makes the anions ( negative ions ) go to the anode ( positive electrode ) and the cations ( positive ions ) go to the cathode ( negative electrode ) . so , for example , oxygen would go to the anode and iron would go to the cathode .
