Tanto     the tanto is a japanese short sword or dagger . the tanto 's traditional overall length was 11.93 in ( 1 shaku , about 30cm ) . the blade 's length was about 5in to 12in ( 12 1/2cm to 30cm ) . blades that were bigger ( 13 '' to 14 '' inches ) were called ko-wakizashi , or `` small short sword . '' the tantos which varied from the traditional size were called o-tanto or sunobi tanto . the tanto was a weapon with a single-edged blade and a curved shape . it was designed for soft targets and was thought to be a hidden weapon of the samurai . it was extremely effective in close fighting . the tanto appeared during the heian period ( 795-1192 a.d. ) and developed as a weapon during the kamakura period ( 1192-1333 a.d. ) . at that time the tanto was not just a weapon but also a work of art . it was richly decorated using the most spread styles : hira-tsukuri and uchi-sori . later , in the nambokucho period ( 1336-1392 a.d ) , tantos become longer than 15.75 inches ( 37cm ) . blades become thinner and broader and thus even more dangerous . different styles developed and the shape changed . during the muromachi period ( 1336â€“1573 a.d. ) the tanto becomes once more narrow-bladed .
