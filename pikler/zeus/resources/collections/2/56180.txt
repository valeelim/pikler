Tidal energy     tidal energy , sometimes called `` tidal power '' , is the power achieved by capturing the energy contained in moving water in tides and open ocean currents . there are two types of tidal energy systems that can be used to extract energy : kinetic energy , the moving water of rivers , tides and open ocean currents ; and potential energy from the difference in height ( or `` head '' ) between high and low tides . the first method - generating energy from tidal currents - is becoming more and more popular because people believe that it does not harm the environment as much as barrages or dams . many coastal sites worldwide are being examined for their suitability to produce tidal ( current ) energy . like other hydroelectricity , tidal power produces no pollution and is a renewable energy source , because tides are caused by events that happen in the solar system and so will not run out . the root source of the energy is the rotation of the earth . tidal power has great potential for future power and electricity generation because of the essentially inexhaustible amount of energy contained in these rotational systems . tidal power is reliably predictable ( unlike wind power and solar power ) . in europe , tide mills have been used for nearly 1,000 years , mainly for grinding grains . modern tide mills provide tidal stream power .
