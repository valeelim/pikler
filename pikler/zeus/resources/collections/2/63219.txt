Agavaceae     agavaceae is a family of plants . many of these plants grow in dry , hot climates . some grow in the desert . well-known plants of this family are the agave , yucca , and joshua tree . the family includes about 550-600 species in around 18 genera . it is widespread in the tropical , subtropical and warm temperate regions of the world . it is not quite clear how large the family really is . there are genera which some biologists leave out of the family . this includes for example `` cordyline '' and `` dracaena '' , which are sometimes separated off into a separate family , dracaenaceae . recent research has tended to incorporate these into a larger family ruscaceae , though . `` nolina '' , `` beaucarnea '' , and `` dasylirion '' are sometimes recognized as nolinaceae or placed in ruscaceae . conversely , data from molecular systematics now suggest that agavaceae should be broadened to include a number of genera previously classified elsewhere . among them are `` chlorogalum '' , `` camassia '' and the family anthericaceae . this would enlarge the family with anything up to 22 genera . the angiosperm phylogeny group 's apg ii classification places agavaceae , along with a number of other families ( including ruscaceae ) in an expanded family asparagaceae . however , apg ii allows the alternative of keeping some of these families , including agavaceae , separate . in this case , it recommends expanding the family to include the genera currently classified in anemarrhenaceae , anthericaceae ( with `` anthericum '' and `` paradisea '' ) , behniaceae and herreriaceae . most references have retained agavaceae ( in varying circumscriptions ) as a family distinct from asparagaceae . `` hesperocallis '' , sometimes placed in its own family , hesperocallideaceae , has recently been shown to be closely related and its inclusion in agavaceae has been recommended ( pires et al . 2004 ) .
