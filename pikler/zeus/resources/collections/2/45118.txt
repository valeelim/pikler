Central Europe     central europe is the region around the alps and carpathian mountains lying between the areas of eastern and western europe . in addition , northern , southern and southeastern europe mean different regions , but in some way they may overlap central europe as well as each other . the term has come back into fashion since the end of the cold war , which had divided europe politically into east and west , with the iron curtain splitting `` central europe '' in half . the understanding of the concept of `` central europe '' varies considerably from nation to nation , and also has from time to time . the region usually means : - austria - czech republic - germany - hungary - liechtenstein - poland - romania - slovakia - slovenia - switzerland the states of czech republic , hungary , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia are also often included in eastern europe . alternatively , romania and slovenia are often placed in southeast ( or southeastern ) europe . when using these definitions , the countries of austria , germany , liechtenstein and switzerland are considered western europe instead . some experts consider such definitions outdated , but many still use them . supranational organizations like the un and eu also make use of them .
