Oriental Orthodoxy     oriental orthodoxy means the group of eastern christian churches that accept only the first three ecumenical councils — the first council of nicaea , the first council of constantinople and the council of ephesus — and do not accept the dogmatic definitions of the council of chalcedon . these churches are also called old oriental churches . oriental orthodox churches are different from the churches that call themselves eastern orthodoxy . the coptic orthodox church of alexandria is the spiritual leader of the oriental orthodox churches . this is because the pope of alexandria is also patriarch of all africa on the holy see of st. mark the apostle . the spiritual leadership is not understood in the same sense as among the eastern orthodox churches to the church of constantinople . it is in the spirit of respect and honour for the apostolic throne of alexandria . it does not give any special rights to the church of alexandria . the schism ( division ) between `` great church orthodox and catholic '' and the `` oriental orthodox churches '' happened in the 5th century after the council of chalcedon .
