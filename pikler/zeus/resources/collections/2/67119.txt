Sustainable energy     sustainable energy involves both energy efficiency and renewable energy . both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions . efficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel burning . if energy use grows too fast , renewable energy development will chase a receding target . likewise , unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly , slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions ; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed . any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables .
