Zoospore     a zoospore is an asexual spore that uses a flagellum for moving around . it is also called a `` swarm spore '' . these spores are created by some algae and fungi to multiply themselves . there are two types of flagellated zoospores , `` whiplash '' and `` tinsel '' or `` decorated '' . - `` whiplash '' flagella are straight , to power the zoospore through its medium . there is also the 'default ' zoospore , which only has the propelling , 'whiplash ' flagellum . - `` tinsellated '' flagella have lateral filaments perpendicular to the main axis , which allow for more surface area , and disturbance of the medium , giving it the property of a rudder , which it uses for steering . both `` tinsel '' and `` whiplash '' flagella beat in a sinusoidal wave pattern , but when both are present , the tinsel will beat in the opposite direction of the whiplash , to give 2 axes of control of motility . - there can be many combinations for location of the flagella , such as posterior whiplash ; posterior whiplash , anterior tinsel ; and anterior whiplash .
