Klein bottle     the klein bottle is a geometrical object , named after the german mathematician felix klein . he described it in 1882 , and named it `` klein'sche fläche '' ( klein surface ) . like the möbius strip , it only has one surface . mathematicians call this a non-orientable surface . klein bottles only exist in four-dimensional space , but a model of a klein bottle can be made in 3d . this model is different from the original because at some point the shape touches itself . in 3d , part of the shape is `` inside '' the rest . this is not the case in 4d . some 3d models use different colors to show the 4th component . the part that lies `` inside '' then has a different color . because the surface is non-orientable , there is no `` inside '' or `` outside '' . this means that if a liquid were filled `` in the bottle '' , it would run down its surface . this may not be true for the 3d models of the bottle . the 2-dimensional version of a klein bottle is a möbius strip . join the arrows so that they face the same way , like so : other websites .
