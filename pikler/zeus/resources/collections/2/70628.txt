Sea surface temperature     sea surface temperature ( sst ) is the water temperature at the surface . in practical terms , the exact meaning of `` surface '' will vary according to the measurement method used . a satellite infrared radiometer indirectly measures the temperature of a very thin layer ( about 10 micrometres thick ) or skin of the ocean ( leading to the phrase skin temperature ) representing the top millimeter ; a thermometer attached to an already fastened or wandering buoy in the ocean would measure the temperature at a specific depth ( e.g . the top 1 meter below the sea surface ) ; the measurements regularly made from ships are often from the engine water intakes and may be at various depths in the upper 20 m of the ocean . note that the depth of measurement in this case will vary with the cargo aboard the vessel .
