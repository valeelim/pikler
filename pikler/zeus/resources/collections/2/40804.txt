Blood pressure     blood pressure is a measurement used in medicine . in the body , the arteries carry blood away from the heart . as blood travels through the arteries , it presses against the walls of the arteries . blood pressure measures how hard the blood is pushing against the walls of the arteries . usually , `` blood pressure '' measures the pressure in larger arteries delivering blood to body parts other than the lungs , like the brachial artery in the arm . blood pressure is usually measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmhg ) . there are two numbers in a blood pressure . the first is the systolic pressure . it measures how hard the blood pushes against the walls of the arteries when the heart is in systole ( beating and pushing out blood ) . this is when the pressure against the walls of the arteries is highest . the second number is the diastolic blood pressure . it measures how hard the blood pushes against the walls of the arteries when the heart is in diastole ( resting between beats and not pushing out any blood ) . for example , in the picture on this page , the pressure on the walls of the arteries is 122 mmhg when the heart is beating , and 65 mmhg when the heart is resting . this blood pressure would be written as `` 122/65 '' and read as `` 122 over 65 .
