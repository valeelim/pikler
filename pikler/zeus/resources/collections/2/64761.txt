Correlation     in statistics and probability theory , correlation means how closely related two sets of data are . correlation does not always mean that one causes the other . it is very possible that there is a third factor involved . correlation usually has one of two directions . these are positive or negative . if it is positive , then the two sets go up together . if it is negative , then one goes up while the other goes down . lots of different measurements of correlation are used for different situations . for example , on a scatter graph , people draw a line of best fit to show the direction of the correlation . `` strong '' and `` weak '' are words used to describe correlation . if there is strong correlation , then the points are all close together . if there is weak correlation , then the points are all spread apart . there are ways of making numbers show how strong the correlation is . these measurements are called correlation coefficients . the best known is the pearson product-moment correlation coefficient . you put in data into a formula and it gives you a number . if the number is 1 or âˆ’1 , then there is strong correlation . if the answer is 0 , then there is no correlation . another kind of correlation coefficient is spearman 's rank correlation coefficient .
