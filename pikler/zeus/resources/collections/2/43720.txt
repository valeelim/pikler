Quetzalcoatlus     quetzalcoatlus was a huge pterosaur , the largest animal ever to fly . it had a 10 to 12 meters wing-span ( 33/40 feet ) , but was light in construction ( ~200 pounds ) . `` quetzalcoatlus '' had an unusually long neck , and when it stood on the ground it was as tall as a giraffe . its fossil record is from the upper cretaceous of north america , 70–65.5 million years ago . `` quetzalcoatlus '' became extinct at the k/t extinction event . the first `` quetzalcoatlus '' fossil was found in big bend national park in texas by a college student from the university of texas in austin . his name was douglas lawson . when he was in the park , he saw a bone sticking out of a rock . since the bone looked very hollow , like the bone of a bird , he thought it was part of a flying creature – and he was right . with his professor 's help , he kept digging until lots of bones from an arm and wing were found . the rest of the animal 's body was missing . many others have looked for the rest of that huge pterosaur , but it has never been found . other fossils of `` quetzalcoatlus '' have been found , of course , but none were as big as the one lawson found .
