Categorical imperative     the categorical imperative is an idea that the philosopher immanuel kant had about ethics . kant said that an `` imperative '' is something that a person must do . for example : if a person wants to stop being thirsty , it is `` imperative '' that they have a drink . kant said an imperative is `` categorical , '' when it is true at all times , and in all situations . the example of a thirsty person kant named the hypothetical imperative . kant used the `` hypothetical '' imperative to explain his ideas about the ethics of a `` categorical `` imperative . for example , it is not usually a moral choice when a person decides to drink water , no matter why they are drinking the water . if a person is very thirsty , then it is a hypothetical imperative that they drink the water . instead of the hypothetical imperative , kant said that the moral choices are governed by a categorical imperative . the categorical imperative is something that a person must do , no matter what the circumstances . it is imperative to an ethical person that they make choices based on the categorical imperative . another way of saying that , is that an ethical person follows a `` universal law '' regardless of their situation .
