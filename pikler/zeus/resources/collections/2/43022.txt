Elementary particle     in physics , an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle that might not be made of other particles . an elementary particle can be a fermion or a boson . fermions are the building blocks of matter and have mass , while bosons behave as force carriers for fermion interactions and some of them have no mass . the standard model is the most accepted way to explain how particles behave , and the forces that affect them . according to this model , the elementary particles are further grouped into quarks , leptons , and gauge bosons , with the higgs boson having a special status . of the particles that make up an atom , only the electron is an elementary particle . protons and neutrons are made of quarks . there are three basic properties that describe an elementary particle : `` mass '' , `` charge '' , and `` spin '' . each property is assigned a number value . for mass and charge the number can be zero . for example , a photon has zero mass and a neutrino has zero charge . these properties always stay the same for an elementary particle .
