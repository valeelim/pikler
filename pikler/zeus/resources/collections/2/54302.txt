Rain shadow     a rain shadow is an area of land that lies behind a mountain which gets almost no rainfall . this side of a mountainous area is away from the wind . the mountains block the passage of rain-producing weather systems and cast a `` shadow '' of dryness behind them . as shown by the diagram to the right , the incoming warm and moist air is drawn by the prevailing winds towards the top of the mountains . as it does so , it cools , condenses and rain falls before it crosses the top . the air , without much moisture left , goes on over the mountains creating a dry side called the `` rain shadow '' .
