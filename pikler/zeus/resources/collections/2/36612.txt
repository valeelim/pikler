Gamal Abdel Nasser     gamal abdel nasser hussein ( 15 january 1918 â€“ 28 september 1970 ) was the second president of egypt from 1956 until his death . along with muhammad naguib , the first president , he led the egyptian revolution of 1952 which overthrew the monarchy of egypt and sudan , and brought in a new period of change in egypt . this change made egypt a more socialist and modern country , as well as pushing forward pan-arab nationalism through his policies , including a union with syria that did not last very long . nasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in modern arab history and politics . under his leadership , egypt nationalized the suez canal and a lot of other industries , and became important in stopping imperialism in the arab world and africa . he was also important in starting the non-aligned movement . nasser 's version of pan-arabism , which is often called `` nasserism '' , was very popular in the arab world during the 1950s and 1960s . even after the israeli victory over the arab armies in the six-day war damaged the way the public saw him , many arabs still view nasser as a symbol of arab dignity and freedom .
