Tarsier     the tarsiers are prosimian ( non-monkey ) primates . they got their name from the long bones in their feet . they are now placed in the suborder haplorhini , together with the simians ( monkeys ) . tarsiers have huge eyes and long feet , and catch the insects by jumping at them . during the night they wait quietly , listening for the sound of an insect moving nearby . they live in trees , and are entirely nocturnal . they are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous . they mainly eat insects , but some are also known to eat birds and snakes . tarsiers can catch prey like birds even if they are in motion as the tarsiers jump from tree to tree to catch their prey . tarsiers have an incredibly good hearing . they have large eyes . each is about 16 mm wide . and weighs as much as their entire brain . unlike many nocturnal animals , tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area ( tapetum lucidum ) of the eye . they also have a fovea , which is also not usual in nocturnal animals . the tarsier 's brain is different from other primates in one respect . the sequence of cell layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus getting information from both eyes is different from the set-up in lemurs , lorises , and monkeys . `` this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates , and reinforces the view that they arose in an early , independent line of primate evolution '' .
