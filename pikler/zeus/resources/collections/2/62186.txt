Oscilloscope     an oscilloscope ( sometimes abbreviated cro , for cathode ray oscilloscope , or commonly just scope or o-scope ) is a piece of electronic equipment that lets you see a changes in signal voltage . for example , if you want to see the signal a small electronic timer was producing , you could connect it to an oscilloscope and see . usually , it shows a two-dimensional graph of one or more electrical potential differences ( vertical axis ) . these graphs are plotted with time or of some other voltage along horizontal axis . a typical oscilloscope is usually box shaped with a display screen , numerous input connectors , control knobs and buttons on the front panel . to aid measurement , a grid called the `` graticule '' is drawn on the face of the screen . each square in the graticule is known as a `` division '' . other websites . - oscillograph 1911 encyclop√¶dia . - online oscilloscope simulation - oscilloscope tutorial - the cathode ray tube site - digital storage oscilloscope measurement basics - oscilloscope faq
