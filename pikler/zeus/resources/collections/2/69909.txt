Gulag     gulag describes a vast network of slave labor camps operated by the soviet union from the 1930s to the 1950s . ever since the soviet union was founded in 1917 , it imprisoned people who spoke out against it . this was in fact no different from what imperial russia did in previous decades , with its katorga camps . but the soviet union camp system eventually grew to be one of the biggest prison systems in existence . during the 1920s , the soviet union imprisoned more and more people that disagreed with it . its leaders believed it was better to put these people to work and make their labor and goods part of the national economy . in fact , two out of every hundred workers in the soviet union were gulag prisoners . the gulag system was officially created in 1930. during the 1930s there was a lot of fear of the soviet government . police officials were encouraged to round up and imprison many citizens for the most trivial offenses , even if they were innocent , and this caused the gulag system to swell . by 1936 , there were 5,000,000 prisoners in the gulags .
