Amber     amber is the common name for fossil resin . it occurs in different colours , and is widely used for making jewellery and other ornaments . although not mineralized , amber is sometimes considered as a gemstone . most of the world 's amber is in the range of 30â€“90 million years old . semi-fossilized resin or sub-fossil amber is called copal . baltic amber was called 'freya 's tears ' by the norse and the 'tears of the heliades ' by the ancient greeks . amber consists of several resinous bodies that can mostly dissolve in alcohol , ether and chloroform , associated with a bituminous substance that does not dissolve . amber is formed from sap coming out of certain trees . the sap soon becomes a sticky gum , and fossilises as amber . the amber can look different depending on its origin , and its later geological history . to end up as amber , the starting resin must resist decay . many trees produce resin , but usually it is broken down by physical and biological process . exposure to weather tends to disintegrate resin , assisted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi . for resin to survive long enough to become amber , it must resist such forces , or be produced under conditions that exclude them .
