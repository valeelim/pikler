Venturi effect     the venturi effect is a case where fluid flows through a tube that is narrow . the velocity of the fluid increases as it flows through the narrower tube while the pressure decreases , due to conservation of energy . the effect is an example of bernoulli 's principle . with the b.e . a simple flow of either a. fluids , or b. air , will cause pressure . within an amount of time , this will cause a decrease in pressure and have the potential of creating energy .
