Cardiopulmonary resuscitation     cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) is a set of actions that should be done if a person stops breathing , or if their heart stops . the goal of cpr is to force blood and oxygen to keep flowing through the body . every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive . cpr does not start a person 's heart again . however , it can keep pushing blood and oxygen around the body long enough that sometimes , it can keep the body from getting damaged by not having enough oxygen . there are different types of cpr . regular people , who are not medical professionals , can do these things : - realize that a person is not breathing or has suddenly collapsed - call 911 ( or whatever the emergency telephone number in their country is ) - do chest compressions ( press hard and fast in the middle of the chest , on the breastbone , until help comes ; this will force blood to keep flowing to the body ) many medical professionals can also do these things : - they can use a machine called a defibrillator to give an electric shock to the heart . this will not restart a heart that is not beating . however , if the heart is beating in a way that is not normal , the electric shock may make the heart go back into a normal rhythm .
