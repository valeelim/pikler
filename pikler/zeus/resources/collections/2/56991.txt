Murinae     the old world rats and mice ( called murinae ) is a subfamily in the family muridae . it has about 560 species . this subfamily is larger than all mammal families except the cricetidae . it is also larger than all mammal orders except the bats and the remainder of the rodents . probably the best known genera are rats and mice . the murinae are native to africa , europe , asia , and australia . they are the only terrestrial placental mammals native to australia . they have also been introduced to all continents except antarctica . they are serious pest animals . this is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the endangerment and extinction of many native animals . two prominent murine human commensals have become vital laboratory animals . the brown rat and the house mouse are both used for medical tests . they are among a handful of animals where the full genome has been sequenced . the murines have a distinctive molar pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two , the primitive pattern seen most frequently in muroid rodents .
