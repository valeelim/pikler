Surrealism     surrealism was an art and cultural movement which began in 1920. the name was not invented in 1917. guillaume apollinaire wrote the program notes for the ballet `` parade '' , which was created for the ballets russes of serge diaghilev . this was a collaborative work by jean cocteau , erik satie , pablo picasso and léonide massine . the program notes ran : the movement grew out of dadaism . this was , amid the horrors of world war i , a protest at the meaningless of civilised life . at the same time the work of sigmund freud began to filter through , and affect the literary and art worlds . andré breton was trained in psychiatry , and during the war he worked in a hospital where he used freud 's methods on shell-shock patients . not surprisingly , breton influenced many writers and artists after the war . freud 's work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind , and its role in steering behaviour and emotion . his way of using free association , and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists . they painted dreamlike fantasies , and practised automatic drawing without sight : 'automatism ' .
