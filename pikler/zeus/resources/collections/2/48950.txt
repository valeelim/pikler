Compressive stress     compressive stress is the stress on materials that leads to a smaller volume . by compressive stress the material is under compression . compressive stress to bars , columns , etc . leads to shortening . one can increase the compressive stress until compressive strength is reached . then materials will react with ductile behaviour ( most metals , some soils and plastics ) or with fracture in case of brittle materials ( geomaterials , cast iron , glass , etc. ) . for example , if a cylinder is compressed under the action of the applied force , the restoring force per unit area is known as the compressive stress . it is one of the best stresses for chassis , so if you have a chassis report explain it well as it helps a lot . other pages . - tensile stress - hooke 's law
