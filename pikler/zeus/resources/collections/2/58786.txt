Compact fluorescent lamp     a compact fluorescent lamp ( cfl ) , is a type of lamp ( or light bulb ) designed to fit into the same space and usually also the same socket as an incandescent bulb , but with the advantages of a fluorescent lamp . many cfls can directly replace an existing incandescent lamp . they were invented late in the 20th century and much used after the turn of the century ( after 2000 ) . the purchase price of a cfl is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output , and the light from cfls looks different to light from incandescent lamps . cfls have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness . a cfl can save over us $ 30 in electricity costs over the lamp â€™ s lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp . as in other fluorescent lamps , electrified mercury vapor emits ultraviolet ( uv ) light . a phosphor converts it to visible light . the ballast prevents too much electricity from flowing through the tube . it is usually in the plastic base of the bulb . if the ballast is in the bulb , the bulb is called a self-ballasted lamp . most are electronic ballasts .
