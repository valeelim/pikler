Frankenstein     frankenstein ; or , the modern prometheus is a novel written by mary shelley . it is about a creature produced by a strange scientific experiment . shelley started writing the story when she was nineteen . it was published when she was twenty-one . the first edition was published anonymously in london in 1818. shelley 's name appears on the second edition , published in france in 1823. shelley had travelled in the region of geneva , switzerland , where much of the story takes place . ideas about occultism were topics of conversation among her travelling companions , especially her future husband , percy bysshe shelley . mary , percy , lord byron , and his doctor john polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story . after thinking for weeks about what her possible storyline could be , shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by the result . she then wrote `` frankenstein '' . since publication of the novel , the name `` frankenstein '' is often used to refer to the monster itself . this usage is sometimes considered erroneous , but usage commentators regard the monster sense of `` frankenstein '' as well-established and an acceptable usage . in the novel , the monster however is called `` creature '' , `` monster '' , `` fiend '' , `` wretch '' , `` vile insect '' , `` daemon '' , `` being '' , and `` it '' . speaking to victor frankenstein , the monster refers to himself as `` the adam of your labors '' , and elsewhere as someone who `` would have '' been `` your adam '' , but is instead `` your fallen angel .
