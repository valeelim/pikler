Pygmy people     pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people . according to anthropologists , pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average . the best known pygmies are the aka , ef√© and mbuti of central africa . there are also pygmies in australia , thailand , malaysia , indonesia , the philippines , papua new guinea , and brazil . the negritos of southeast asia are also called pygmies . the word `` pygmy '' is sometimes thought to be pejorative ( an insult ) . it is , however , the only word that is used to call `` all '' african midgets . the name `` pygmy '' comes from the greek word ( `` pygmaios '' ) . this word was derived from ( came from ) the word which is the length between a person 's elbow and knuckles . the latin word ( pl . `` pygmaei '' ) came from this older greek word . the word was first used in greek mythology by the poet homer . he wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called `` pygmies '' who lived in india and ethiopia . there are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short . it has been proved that their height is hereditary , and is passed on from parents to children . it may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests , where many pygmies live . this would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin d in their skin . vitamin d helps the body absorb calcium , which is important for bones to grow . since the pygmies would get less calcium , they would have smaller bones and skeletons .
