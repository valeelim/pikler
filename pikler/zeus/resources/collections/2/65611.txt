Tropical Storm Zeta     tropical storm zeta was the twenty-eighth and last storm of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season . it formed very late during the year on december 30 , after the official end of the season , and was a very rare tropical cyclone to live during two calendar years . tropical storm zeta formed on december 30 in the central atlantic ocean , where it stayed far away from land during its whole lifetime . while every forecast given to the storm predicted it to dissipate quickly , zeta , like hurricane epsilon , denied those advisories . zeta reached to its maximum strength on january 2 until finally dissipating on january 8 , also bringing the close to the end of the 2005 season . late on december 29 , 2005 , a tropical depression developed in the east-central atlantic ocean from a frontal trough and strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day . as this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season , the national hurricane center did not actually classify the system until after it had already become a tropical storm . the new bound storm originally moved to the northwest but stopped for a few hous late on december 31 before moving west . as tropical storm zeta slowly gained strength , it had many characteristics similar to hurricane epsilon , like when the national hurricane center constantly forecasted that zeta would weaken because of the high wind shear ; but zeta still held onto its strength , like epsilon had done .
