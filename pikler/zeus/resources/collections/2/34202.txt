Cardiac arrest     cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating . this can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart 's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die . with cardiac arrest , normal circulation of blood stops , because of a failure of the heart to contract . this results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood , which causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation . cerebral hypoxia ( lack of oxygen to the brain ) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing , and this makes the heart stop completely . unless the person is in hypothermia , brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes . ( in some cases , the person is put into hypothermia on purpose , to help the person recover better with less damage . ) cardiac arrest is a medical emergency . if it is treated early enough , some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients . when cardiac arrest leads to a person 's death , this is called sudden cardiac death ( scd ) . first aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available .
