Voltage divider     in electronics , a voltage divider is an electrical circuit which creates an output voltage which is proportional to an input voltage . voltage dividers are also known as resistor divider and potential divider . it can be made of two resistors or it can be one potentiometer ( variable resistor ) . the output voltage is depends on component values , or on the setting of the potentiometer . when an electrical load gets power from the divider 's center point , the voltage may change .
