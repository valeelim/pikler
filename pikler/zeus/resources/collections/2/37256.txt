Viennese waltz     a viennese waltz ( valse in french , walzer in german ) is a music and dance which started in vienna in the late 18th century . it is a ballroom dance in 3/4 time . it is the most famous of all dance forms . it became extremely popular during the 19th century , and is still danced today . many famous composers wrote waltzes for piano or for orchestra . the rhythm of the waltz can be heard in lots of music , not just in pieces which are called a 'waltz ' . it is difficult to know exactly when the waltz started . the word comes from a german word “ walzen ” which means “ to turn ” . this is because the dancers turn around as they spin round the dance floor . there were german dances called ländler which were simpler than the minuet and popular amongst ordinary people . the waltz developed from these dances . schubert wrote many pieces called 'ländler ' . he also started to use the title 'waltz ' . beethoven wrote 30 variations on a waltz that had been composed by anton diabelli . many people thought that the new dance was bad . this was because the dancing couples stood very close to one another and held one another in their arms ( in the old minuet they held hands politely ) . some people thought that it was very immoral and wrote angry letters to the newspapers saying that it was the end of civilised society . however , the waltz continued to be popular , and many dance halls were opened where people could waltz .
