Crater Lake     crater lake is a caldera lake in the u.s. state of oregon . it is the main attraction of crater lake national park . it is famous for its blue color and clear water . the lake partly fills a nearly deep caldera . the volcanic crater was formed by the collapse of the volcano , mount mazama , about 7,500 years ago . there are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake . the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years . in 1853 , miner john wesley hillman made the first recorded visit to the lake . he named the lake `` deep blue lake '' . the lake was renamed at least three times , as blue lake , lake majesty , and finally crater lake . crater lake is known for its famous piece of driftwood , named the `` old man of the lake '' . it is a tree that has been moving up and down in the water for more than 100 years . the lake water is cold , so the tree is well preserved . originally , fish did not live in the lake . however , people stocked the lake with different kinds of fish between 1888 and 1941. several species of fish still live in the lake .
