Exploitation     exploitation means using things that are available in order to benefit from it . it is usually used in a bad sense , although it can be used in a good sense as well . if a person exploits a situation it means that they realize that they can use the situation to do something which will be good for them . very often this also means that it will be bad for other people . people , especially proletariat can be exploited through sweatshop . this means that someone else uses the people 's knowledge or skills in order to make them do something for them . socialists ( or communists ) often talked about the `` exploitation of the masses '' when they were saying that capitalism was bad . they meant that a few rich people were using all the working people to do hard work for them so that they themselves could become rich . exploiting people still goes on today .
