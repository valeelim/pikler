Basis (linear algebra)    basis ( linear algebra ) in linear algebra , a basis is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties : - one can get any vector in the vector space by multiplying each of the basis vectors by different numbers , and then adding them up . - if any vector is removed from the basis , the property above is no longer satisfied . the dimension of a given vector space is the number of elements of the basis . if formula_1 is the vector space then : bformula_2 { formula_3 } is a basis of formula_1 it 's easy to see that for any element of formula_1 it can be represented as a combination of the above basis . let formula_6 be any element of formula_1 , lets say formula_8 since formula_9 and formula_10 are elements of formula_11 then they can be written as formula_12 and so on . then the combination equals the element formula_6 this shows that the set b is a basis of formula_1
