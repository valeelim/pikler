Ocean surface wave     ocean surface waves are surface waves that occur in the upper layer of the ocean . they usually result from wind or geologic effects like earthquakes or vulcanicity and may travel thousands of miles before striking land . they range in size from small ripples to huge tsunamis . there is little actual forward motion of individual water particles in an unbroken wave , despite the large amount of energy and momentum it may carry forward . the great majority of large breakers one sees on an ocean beach result from distant winds . three factors influence the formation of `` wind waves '' : - wind speed - distance of open water that the wind has blown over - length of time the wind has blown over a given area . all of these factors work together to determine the size and shape of ocean waves . the greater each of the variables , the larger the waves . waves are measured by : - height ( from trough to crest ) - wavelength ( from crest to crest ) - period ( time interval between arrival of consecutive crests at a stationary point )
