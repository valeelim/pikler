Pancake     pancakes ( also called `` griddlecakes '' , `` hotcakes '' or `` flapjacks '' ) are a kind of bread made on a frying pan . they are baked in different ways , such as thin french `` crÃªpes '' or vermont-style multigrain pancakes . although it is mainly called `` pancake '' in the english speaking countries and it is thin dough , in mexico , it is called `` hotcake '' and it is often thick dough . most pancakes are quick breads that use baking powder , although some are also made using a yeast-raised or fermented batter . in many different places , pancakes are served as breakfast or dessert , and they are served with sweet sauces or toppings such as maple syrup , jam , or sugar . pancakes are also served with savory ( non-sweet ) fillings and toppings such as meat pie . some pancakes contain a raising agent ( something that makes the pancake rise while cooking ) , usually baking powder , eggs , flour , and milk , which makes a thick batter . this batter is either spooned or poured onto a hot surface which is coated in cooking oil or melted butter . the batter spreads to make a cake about 1/4 or 1/3 inch ( 1 cm ) thick . the raising agent makes bubbles rise to the uncooked side of the pancake , where now the pancake is ready to be flipped ( turned over ) .
