Complementarity (molecular biology)    complementarity ( molecular biology ) in molecular biology , complementarity is a property ( something that it can do ) of nucleic acids such as dna and rna . each nucleotide has a nitrogenous base , and each nitrogenous base can pair up with the nitrogenous base from another different nucleotide . one can say that the nitrogenous base is complementary to the other in that the base pairs between them are non-covalently bonded by hydrogen bonds . since there is only one complementary base for any of the bases found in dna and in rna , enzymes can make a complementary strand from any single strand . this is needed for dna replication . the bases which are complementary are - a with t - c with g for example , the complementary strand of the dna sequence is other pages . - base pair
