Brown dwarf     a brown dwarf is an object which has the same make-up as a star , but is not massive enough for hydrogen fusion ( the combining of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms ) . nuclear fusion is what makes stars glow . brown dwarfs are not massive enough to do this , so they are not regular stars . on the other hand , they are not regular giant planets , because they do glow . they are thought to be many but few have been found because their absolute magnitude is small . their mass is between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars , with an upper limit around 75 to 80 times the mass of jupiter ( `` m '' ) . brown dwarfs more massive than 13 `` m '' are thought to fuse deuterium and those above ~65 `` m '' , fuse lithium as well . despite their name , most brown dwarfs would appear magenta to the human eye . the nearest known brown dwarf is wise 1049-5319 about 6.5 light years away , a binary system of brown dwarves discovered in 2013. what became known as brown dwarfs were talked about in the 1960s . alternative names for brown dwarfs were proposed , including planetar and substar .
