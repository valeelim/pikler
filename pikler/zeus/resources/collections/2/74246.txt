Allegory     an allegory is a term for a figure of speech . it is a story or picture with a hidden meaning . the characters in allegories are symbols which represent particular ideas . the story has a figurative meaning , not just a literal one . allegory is an example of rhetoric , but an allegory does not have to be a story in language . it may be something to look at , such as a painting or sculpture . an allegory is like a long metaphor . people have to use their imagination to understand what it is trying to say . a fable or parable is a short allegory with one basic idea ( a moral ) . sometimes people say that stories have meanings which the author , in fact , did not intend . for instance , many people have suggested that `` the lord of the rings '' was an allegory for the world wars , but , in fact , it was written well before the outbreak of world war ii , and j.r.r . tolkien said that it was not an allegory . in this way people sometimes change the author â€™ s ideas . sometimes they do it for their own political reasons .
