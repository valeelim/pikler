Scherzo     a scherzo is a piece of music which is quite fast . in the 19th century romantic composers started to write scherzos in their symphonies and sonatas instead of the traditional minuets . they are similar to a minuet , always with three beats in a bar , but they are faster and less `` polite '' . some composers like chopin and brahms wrote scherzos as separate pieces for the piano .
