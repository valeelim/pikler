Parsifal     parsifal is an opera in three acts by richard wagner . wagner took most of the story from a medieval poem `` parzival '' by the german poet wolfram von eschenbach . it was the last opera that wagner completed . he started thinking about it in 1857 but did not do much work to it until after he had finished the cycle of four operas known as the ring cycle which was produced complete in 1876 in the special theatre ( festspielhaus ) he had built in bayreuth . wagner composed his opera `` parsifal '' so that it would suit the sound of this new theatre . it was first produced in 1882. the story is related to the arthurian legends . wagner did more than any other composer in the 19th century to change the way that people listened to opera . in the 18th century people went to the opera house and sat in their boxes to chat to other people and be seen . composers wrote operas with big arias which allowed the singers to show off their skills and make the audience applaud . wagner changed all this . he soon developed operas in which there is no difference between recitative ( where the story is told ) and arias ( big songs for the soloists ) . the music of his later operas , especially `` parsifal '' , is like a long , continuous line with rich , romantic harmony . the music develops logically , with leitmotifs ( musical ideas which represent particular people or ideas ) which help the music and the story to develop .
