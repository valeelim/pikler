Good (economics)    good ( economics ) a good in economics is any object or product ( factors of production ) that is useful . a commodity is one kind of good . a good that can not be used by consumers directly , such as an office building or capital equipment , can be called a good because it can be useful if it is sold . a 'good ' in economic usage does not necessarily mean that the object is good in a moral sense . if an object or service is sold for a positive price , then it is a good since the purchaser considers the utility of the object or service more valuable than the money . some things are useful but not scarce such as air and are referred to as `` free goods '' . in macroeconomics and accounting , a good is contrasted with a service . a good here is defined as a physical product that one can deliver to a buyer . the service is not an object , but an action that benefits someone . a more general term that preserves the distinction between goods and services is 'commodities ' . in microeconomics 'good ' is often used in this more inclusive sense of a commodity .
