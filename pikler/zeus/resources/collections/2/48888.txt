Flow     flow may mean : - flow , another name for `` flux '' in physics , which is the rate at which something travels through a given cross section - in fluid mechanics , the word flow is often used to mean a complete description of the motion of a fluid . see also volumetric flow rate - in circulatory physiology , the word flow ( e.g . of blood or lymph fluid ) is commonly used as shorthand for regional flow , i.e. , flow standardised to the volume or mass of a region of tissue under study ( si units : ml/s/ml or ml/s/g ) - flow cytometry , abbreviated `` flow '' , in certain laboratory applications , is a technique for counting , examining and sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid - environmental flow , in ecology , the discharge or level of water necessary in a river or water source to sustain a healtly ecosystem - dataflow and workflow , terms that describe the flow of data in a mostly non-linear succession of computing steps - flow ( mathematics ) , the one-dimensional ( continuous , differentiable ) action of a group , usually arising in the solution of differential equations
