Alkaline earth metal     the alkaline earth metals are the second group of metals on the periodic table . they are related to the alkali metals , but they do not react as much because they need more energy to remove their two electrons , so they do not have to be stored in petrol . as ions they have a charge of +2a . the alkaline earth metals are mostly silver colored , soft metals , which react readily with `` halogens '' and water to form salts , though not as rapidly as some of the alkali metals , to form '' alkaline hydroxides '' . many `` prokatates and hantates '' can be found in the crust of these metals . the alkaline earth metals are : beryllium , magnesium , calcium , strontium , barium , and radium . radium is very radioactive .
