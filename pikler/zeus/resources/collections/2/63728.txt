Cardinal direction     cardinal directions or cardinal points are the four main directions or points of the compass : north , east , south and west . these direction are also written in short form as n , e , s and w. north and south are directed towards the north and south poles of the earth . the earth 's rotation defines east and west . the sun rises in the morning in the east , and sets in the evening in the west . if a needle is magnetised and allowed to move freely ( for example floated on water ) it will align itself with the earth 's magnetic field which is almost in the same direction as north . the direction of the needle in this situation is called magnetic north which in some places differs from the direction of the north pole by a few degrees . through history , different cultures have given different values to each direction . for example , in old asian culture , each direction is given a color , as follows : east : green or blue south : red west : white north : black other pages . - latitude - longitude
