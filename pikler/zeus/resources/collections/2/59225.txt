Cubism     cubism was one of the most significant art movements of the 20th century . it began in france about 1907 , and flourished from 1910 through the 1920s . it was pioneered by georges braque and pablo picasso . pablo picasso 's 1907 painting `` les demoiselles d'avignon '' was an early cubist work . georges braque 's 1908 `` houses at l ’ estaque '' ( and related works ) prompted the critic louis vauxcelles to refer to `` bizarreries cubiques '' ( cubic oddities ) . the first organized group exhibition by cubists took place at the `` salon des indépendants '' in paris in the spring of 1911. it included works by jean metzinger , albert gleizes , fernand léger , robert delaunay and henri le fauconnier , but no works by picasso and braque were exhibited . according to one art historian , there were three phases of cubism . there was `` early cubism '' , ( from 1906 to 1908 ) when the movement was initially developed by picasso and braque . in the second phase , `` high cubism '' , ( from 1909 to 1914 ) , juan gris emerged as an important exponent after 1911. finally `` late cubism '' ( from 1914 to 1921 ) was the last phase of cubism as a radical avant-garde movement . douglas cooper 's emphasis on the work of braque , picasso , gris ( from 1911 ) and léger ( to a lesser extent ) was an intentional value judgement .
