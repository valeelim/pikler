Thermodynamic potential     in thermodynamics , thermodynamic potentials are parameters associated with a thermodynamic system and have the dimensions of energy . they are called `` potentials '' because in a sense , they describe the amount of potential energy in a thermodynamic system when it is subjected to certain constraints . the different potentials correspond to different constraints to which the system may be subjected . the four most common thermodynamic potentials are : where `` t '' = temperature , `` s '' = entropy , `` p '' = pressure , `` v '' = volume . the helmholtz free energy is often denoted by the symbol `` f '' , but the use of `` a '' is preferred by iupac ( see alberty , 2001 ) . formula_1 is the number of particles of type `` i '' in the system . for the sake of completeness , the set of all formula_1 are also included as natural variables , although they are sometimes ignored . thermodynamic potentials are very useful when calculating the equilibrium results of a chemical reaction , or when measuring the properties of materials in a chemical reaction . the chemical reactions usually take place under some simple constraints such as constant pressure and temperature , or constant entropy and volume , and when this is true , there is a corresponding thermodynamic potential which comes into play . just as in mechanics , the system will tend towards lower values of potential and at equilibrium , under these constraints , the potential will take on an unchanging minimum value . the thermodynamic potentials can also be used to estimate the total amount of energy available from a thermodynamic system under the appropriate constraint .
