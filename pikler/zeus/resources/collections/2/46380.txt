Canonization     canonisation is a statement by a church saying that someone is a saint . this process is used by some christian churches , most commonly in the roman catholic church . the person must be dead , because living people can not be canonised . the process of canonisation involves proving that the person lived in a way that justifies this decision . they must have loved others and loved god . in the catholic church , at least two miracles by the saint 's intercession must be proven . this means that , because the person is believed to be in heaven , someone must pray , or ask , for the saint to pray for them in heaven . if the prayer is answered and a miracle happens , then they know that the person is a saint . the miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with god , and able to ask god for prayers to be answered . these people then enter into the canon , or list , of saints . it is not correct to say that the church `` makes '' someone a saint . the catholic church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint . the canonisation process just finds out for sure , or without a doubt , that someone is a saint .
