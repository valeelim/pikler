Furlong     a furlong is a unit for measuring distance . it is part of the imperial and united states customary systems . it is equal to 660 feet or 201.168 metres . there are eight furlongs in a mile . the english first used the furlong in the 9th century or before . the word `` furlong '' comes from old english words `` furh '' ( `` furrow '' ) and `` lang '' ( `` long '' ) . originally it was the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed field . an acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain wide . for this reason , the furlong was once also called an `` acre 's length '' . around the year 1300 , england standardised the furlong as 40 rods or 660 feet . the length of the furlong was standardised between south africa , australia , united kingdom , canada , new zealand and the united states in the international pound and yard agreement . the furlong was abolished for official use in the uk in 1985. however , it is still uncommonly seen on road signs in villages , along with miles and chains . the same also applies in burma .
