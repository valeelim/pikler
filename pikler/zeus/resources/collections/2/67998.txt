Oiran     the oiran appeared in the edo period , ( 1600–1868 ) . in those years , some laws were created that made prostitution legal , but only in special neighborhoods that were closed to the outside . like many things in japanese culture , the world of courtesans became very complicated . different kinds of oiran appeared , depending on their beauty , skills in art , education and more . high-ranking oiran were called . only nobles could be with one . tayū had many servants , and when they went outside , their servants carried them and followed them , making a procession . they wore very rich , expensive clothes and jewelry . any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette . only the very rich and noblemen could do so . when the geisha appeared , the era of the oiran ended . geisha practiced common types of entertainment enjoyed by the people of that time . they became very popular , much more than oiran . the last known oiran was in 1761. the few women who still practice the arts of the oiran today ( without the sexual aspect ) do so to keep the cultural heritage , and not as a profession or occupation .
