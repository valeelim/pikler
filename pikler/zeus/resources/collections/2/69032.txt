Biellmann spin     the biellmann spin is a spin in figure skating . it is performed on one foot . the free leg ( the leg not on the ice ) is pulled up from behind and pulled above the head . the knee is bent slightly and the back is bent backwards into the spin . this forms a teardrop position with the body . in the classic version of the spin , both arms are used to hold up the leg . a slightly changed version has one hand on the skate and the other hand on the arm holding up the skate . a change can be made in that one hand can be dropped . if the hand holding up the spin is on the same side of the body as the leg , the spin is referred to as a `` one-hand biellmann spin '' , because the spin is being performed with one hand . if the hand holding up the spin is on the opposite side of the body as the leg , the spin is referred to as a `` cross-grab biellmann spin '' , because that hand has to `` cross '' the body to `` grab '' the skate . the spin has also been said to look like a `` tulip on a turntable '' . it is one of the most iconic figure skating moves . along with the layback spin , the biellmann is used in advertisements and icons representing figure skating . the position is also used in spiral sequences .
