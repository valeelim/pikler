Velocisaurus     velocisaurus was a theropod dinosaur related to `` ceratosaurus '' . its remains were found in patagonia , in strata from the cretaceous period . this animal is known only from its leg and feet bones . `` velocisaurus '' was probably around 1.2 meters long ( 4 ft ) . the foot is unique in that the middle ( third ) metatarsal ( foot bone ) was the main weight-bearing element . its upper end has thickened and the shafts of the adjoining second and fourth metatarsals have thinned considerably . such a condition is unknown for other theropods , including birds , but a similar set-up occurred in three-toed horses ( like `` mesohippus '' ) . jos√© bonaparte explained it as an adaptation for a cursorial ( running ) lifestyle . he suggested that `` velocisaurus '' was itself an omnivore , because the sole claw found , of the fourth toe , was not curved , but relatively straight .
