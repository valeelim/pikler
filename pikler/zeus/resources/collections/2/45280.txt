Athelstan     athelstan or æthelstan , ( 893/4–27 october 939 ) , called the glorious , was the first king of england . he reigned from 924 to 939. he was the son of king edward the elder . athelstan 's reign is sometimes overlooked but it was of great importance to political developments in the 10th century . athelstan was the son of edward the elder , and grandson of alfred the great . his father succeeded , after some difficulty , to the kingdom of the anglo-saxons formed by alfred . his father had also been the king of mercia . when edward died athelstan quickly became king of mercia but he was not immediately accepted as king of england . his brother , ælfweard , had more support in england but died soon after edward . this made it easier for athelstan to become king . for athelstan it was very important to have many allies . a year after his crowning he married one of his sisters to the viking king of northumbria , sithric . however , sithric died only a year later , and athelstan seized northumbria . this move made him king of more land than any other before him , roughly the same as modern england . historical records indicate that the other rulers in great britain accepted him as king at bamburgh around this time .
