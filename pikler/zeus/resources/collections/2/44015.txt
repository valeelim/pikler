Norns     the norns are female deities in norse mythology who govern fate . their names are urd ( what has been ) , verdandi ( what is ) and skuld ( what is to come ) . skuld is also the name of a valkyrie . the norns are at the base of the ash tree yggdrasil ( or , according to some versions , above the bifröst bridge ) . they spin threads and weave the tapestry of fates . each person 's life is a thread in their loom . the length of the thread is the length of the person 's life . even the gods have their threads and are therefore not immortal , though the norns hide the strings from the gods . so everything is set out beforehand . there is no luck , there is no randomness , everything is determined by destiny . the greeks called deities similar to the norns moirae , and the romans called them parcae . the three norns appear at the beginning of richard wagner 's opera götterdämmerung and foretell the downfall of the gods when a thread of fate breaks .
