Timeline of Christianity     this timeline is to show the history of christianity from the beginning to the present . question marks on dates mean that dates are not exact . western culture and christian churches use the gregorian calendar . the gregorian calendar has been in use since 1582 when it replaced the julian calendar . the julian calendar did not calculate ( work out by mathematics ) the length of the year accurately . the gregorian calendar added leap years to make this more correct . the gregorian calendar began in europe , in the reign of pope gregory xiii . the gregorian calendar is now used almost everywhere in the world ( except for calculating the holy days of other religions ) . the gregorian calendar dates years from before or after the birth of jesus . years that are before the birth of jesus have the initials bc ( before christ ) and years that are after ( traditionally ) have the initials ad ( anno domini â€“ `` in the year of our lord '' ) . nowadays these are often written bce ( `` before the common era '' ) and ce ( `` common era '' ) .
