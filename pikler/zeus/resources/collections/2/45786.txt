Identical twins     identical twins start out as genetically identical : they have the same alleles . they are formed by a fertilised egg dividing into two separate individuals . they are always of the same sex , and are monozygotic or mz twins ( mono = one ; zygote = fertilised egg ) . this contrasts with `` fraternal twins '' , who are formed by two separate eggs fertilised by two separate sperms , and who are not always the same sex ( dz = dizygotic ) . both types of twin are carried in the same uterus at the same time , so their birth environment is the same . research shows that the frequency of monozygotic twinning is one in 240 births . fraternal twins are twice as common . in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins . for ivf deliveries , there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000. identical twins are natural clones . because they start out with the same genes , they can be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people . this is the nature vs nurture question .
