Pedal point     a pedal point ( or pedal note ) is a note which keeps sounding for several bars , usually in the bass ( the lowest notes ) . they are often used towards the end of a piece of music to help to drive the music to a climax . they are called `` pedal '' notes because they are often heard in organ music where the player puts one of his feet on a pedal note and holds it there . pedal points are usually on either the tonic ( main key note ) ( tonic pedal ) or the dominant ( 5th note of the scale ) ( dominant pedal ) tones . a good example of a dominant pedal can be seen in the `` prelude in c major '' from book i of the `` well-tempered clavier '' by bach . an example of a tonic pedal can be seen in the third movement of brahms 's `` german requiem '' , where the double basses play continuous d 's in the last section . because this lasts for the whole section some people might prefer to call this a drone . a double pedal is two pedal tones played at the same time . an inverted pedal is a pedal that is not in the bass . it is often in the highest part .
