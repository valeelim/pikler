Quasar     quasars or quasi-stellar radio sources are the most energetic and distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . they are quite small in comparison with the energy they put out . quasars are not much larger than the solar system . the mechanism of brightness changes probably involves relativistic beaming of jets pointed nearly directly toward us . the highest redshift quasar known ( ) has a redshift of 7.085 , which means it is about 29 billion light-years from earth . this estimate is made using the concept of comoving distance . scientists now agree that a quasar is a compact region in the center of a massive galaxy surrounding a central supermassive black hole . its size is 10â€“10,000 times the schwarzschild radius of the black hole . the energy emitted by a quasar is gravitational energy , got from mass falling onto the accretion disc around the black hole . quasars are extremely luminous . they were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic radiation , including radio waves and visible light . the light ( and other energy ) appeared to be similar to stars , rather than large sources like galaxies . on the other hand , their spectra had very broad emission lines , unlike any known from stars , hence `` quasi-stellar '' . their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the milky way .
