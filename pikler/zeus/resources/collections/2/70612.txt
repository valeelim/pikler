Nostradamus     michel de nostredame ( 14 or 21 december 1503 â€“ 2 july 1566 ) , also known as nostradamus , was a french apothecary and allegedly a doctor . he was born in provence . he is famous as a 'seer ' who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous around the world . his best known book was called `` les propheties '' ( the prophecies ) and first appeared in 1555. since its first publication the book has rarely been out of print . over the years , many people have come to believe that nostradamus predicted a range of events in history . people often reached this conclusion by applying methods similar to the bible code - i.e . by twisting the texts in such a way as to suggest that they predicted the future . he died of edema in provence . most academics say that these associations between nostradamus ' quatrains and world events are the result of misinterpretations , or bad translations , that are so far-fetched that they are useless as a source of genuine prediction . what is more , no interpretation has yet managed to predict any event before it happened .
