Sonora     sonora is a mexian state , in the northwestern mexico region . sonora borders the states of chihuahua to the east , sinaloa to the south , and baja california to the northwest . to the north sonora accounts for a long stretch of the u.s.-mexico border adjacent to the u.s. states of arizona and new mexico ; to the west it borders the gulf of california ( sea of cortez ) . there are various explanations as to the origin of the word sonora . here , we will tell you some of the most widely accepted versions . one of these says that when the spaniards arrived in the lands occupied by the opata people , they built a chapel and painted an image of the virgin on a buffalo skin . over time , when the opatas began to worship the virgin , they used to call her senora instead of the spanish word señora ( our lady ) . finally , it would seem that this word became sonora as we know it today . another version has it that sonora is derived from the opata word , sonotl which means corn leaf . a legend speaks of an indigenous group that lived near the village of huépac , and who used corn leaves to cover the walls and roofs of their huts . yet another version insists that the word comes from the name of a tribe that lived on the banks of the sonora river ; these people were known as the sonora indians . this river crosses a large part of the state . it is also useful to understand that , just as mexico has its national emblems , so the state of sonora has its own coat-of-arms .
