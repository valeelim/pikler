Musica ficta     musica ficta is a term used in medieval and renaissance music . it means that when musicians play or sing music they put in accidentals ( sharps and flats ) which are not written in the music . in those days ( near the end of the 16th century ) music used modes instead of the modern system of major and minor keys . sometimes the music would not sound right unless a note was sharpened or flattened ( raised or lowered a semitone ) . for example , to go down from the note b to an f would have sounded bad , so the f would need to be an f sharp . the composer who wrote the music down might not bother to put the sign for f sharp . he would expect the performer to know that it should be an f sharp and not an f. this is what is called musica ficta . gradually it became more and more necessary for composers to write exactly what notes they wanted . the modern system of keys was developing . they developed the system of key signatures and accidentals ( sharps and flats which are not in the key signature , but written as and when they are needed ) . the practice of musica ficta gradually ended .
