Tengwar     tengwar is a constructed writing system , invented by j. r. r. tolkien . the tengwar is used in his fictional world middle-earth , for example the book `` the lord of the rings '' . in the quenya language , `` tengwar '' means `` letters '' , `` tengwa '' is the singular and means `` letter '' . the tengwar are used to write some of tolkien 's constructed languages , like for example the elven languages quenya and sindarin . but tolkien used the tengwar mostly for writing english . because the tengwar is an alphabet , it can be used to write almost any language , like english or other languages . in the late 1910s , j. r. r. tolkien developed the script `` sarati '' , which was already a bit similar to tengwar . the tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s . the first published sample of tengwar writing was 1937 in `` the hobbit '' , to so-called `` the lonely mountain jar inscription '' . the full explanation of the tengwar was published in 1955 in appendix e of `` the lord of the rings '' . the tengwar have a certain order , and are usually shown in a table/chart . they are sorted by how they look , which is also connected to how they sound . because it is an alphabet , every tengwa means a sound . the main tengwar letters are placed into four vertical series ( `` t√©mar '' ) and six horizontal rows ( `` tyeller '' ) .
