Photovoltaics     photovoltaics ( pvs ) are arrays of cells containing a solar photovoltaic material that converts solar radiation or energy from the sun into direct current electricity . due to the growing demand for renewable energy sources , the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years , and costs have dropped . solar photovoltaics are growing rapidly , from a small base , to a total global capacity of 130,000 mw at the end of 2013. more than 100 countries use solar pv . installations may be ground-mounted ( and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing ) or built into the roof or walls of a building . photovoltaic solar panels come in many different voltages . the most common are 12 volts , 24 volts , and 48 volts . like batteries , multiple solar panels can be connected together to produce higher voltages , for example , two 48 volt panels connected together would produce 96 volts . the inverter , batteries , and solar panels in a system are usually all of the same voltage . the advantage of a higher-voltage system is that thinner wire is used , which is less expensive and easier to pull through conduit . the disadvantage of a higher-voltage installation is that electric shock and arc flash become more of a hazard , so installations above 48 volts are usually only found in solar power plants or commercial buildings .
