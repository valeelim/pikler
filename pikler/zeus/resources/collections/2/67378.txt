Kinder Scout     kinder scout is a plateau about 600 metres above sea level . it is in derbyshire , england , roughly between the villages of hayfield to the west , edale to the southeast , and the town of glossop to the northwest . the gritstone rock under the plateau is covered by a thick layer of peat , cut by a dense network of streams which flow off it . one of the main streams is the kinder river , which drops off the western edge at kinder downfall . plants on the plateau are mainly heather , with some mosses and bilberry . bracken grows on the slopes around the plateau . the highest point is kinder low at . it can be approached from the southeast up a steep track called jacobs ladder . it is crossed by the pennine way long-distance footpath which starts in nearby edale . several sections of the path have been surfaced with large stone slabs in this area , to try to minimise environmental damage to the delicate moorland ecosystem by the large number of hikers it attracts all year round . in the 1930s , kinder scout was the scene of the first mass trespasses by ramblers ( sunday , 24 april 1932 ) protesting at the lack of public access to the open moorland in many parts of northern england , which were then kept for grouse shooting by the estates of a number of stately homes . public rights of way were established later , and the 2000 countryside and rights of way act set a new legal framework in which the bulk of kinder scout is now `` access land '' where the public has a right to roam freely .
