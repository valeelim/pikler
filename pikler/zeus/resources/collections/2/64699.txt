Infix notation     infix notation is the common arithmetic and logical formula notation , in which operators are written infix-style between the operands they act on ( e.g . 2 + 2 ) . it is not as simple to parse by computer as prefix notation ( e.g . + 2 2 ) or postfix notation ( e.g . 2 2 + ) , but many programming languages use it due to its familiarity . in infix notation , unlike in prefix or postfix notations , parentheses surrounding groups of operands and operators are necessary to indicate the intended order in which operations are to be performed . in the absence of parentheses , certain precedence rules determine the order of operations . these are explained in the order of operations article . other pages . - postfix notation , also called `` reverse polish notation '' - prefix notation , also called `` polish notation '' - shunting yard algorithm , used to convert infix notation to postfix notation or to a tree other websites . - `` rpn or dal ? a brief analysis of reverse polish notation against direct algebraic logic ''
