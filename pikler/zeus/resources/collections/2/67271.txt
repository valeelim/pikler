Order of the Thistle     the most ancient and most noble order of the thistle is an order of chivalry , associated with scotland . whilst it 's first date of being made is unknown , james vii ( also king of england as james ii ) created the modern order in 1687. the order is the sovereign and sixteen knights and ladies , as well as certain `` extra '' knights ( members of the british and foreign royal families ) . the sovereign decides who is to be a member . he or she is not advised by the government , as occurs with most other orders . the sixteen members are required to be scottish-born , but the `` extra '' knights and ladies are not . the order 's main emblems are the thistle , the national flower of scotland , and saint andrew holding a saltire ( x shaped cross ) . the motto is `` nemo me impune lacessit '' ( latin for `` no one provokes me with impunity '' ) ; the same motto is also on the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom for use in scotland and on some pound coins . st andrew is also the patron saint of the order .
