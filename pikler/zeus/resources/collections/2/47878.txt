Smoke     smoke is a cloud of very small , solid particles that is made when something is burned with a flame , such as wood or paper . smoke can be bad because if it goes into the lungs of a person , it can hurt their lungs or even kill them ( for example , in a house fire ) . most people think that they are always able to see smoke , but people can not see some types of smoke : they are invisible . when people smoke tobacco in cigars or cigarettes , they are burning the tobacco and inhaling the smoke . tobacco smoke can hurt the mouth , throat , and lungs . it can cause mouth , throat , or lung cancer . it can also cause emphysema and bronchitis ( trouble breathing ) . they continue doing it because the smoke also has a narcotic . factories and power plants produce large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere which pollutes the air . eventually the toxic chemicals in smoke fall to the ground , and then they pollute the soil and the water . when the air , soil and water are polluted with toxic chemicals , the chemicals also get absorbed by plants and animals ( including humans ) .
