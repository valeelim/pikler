American League     the american league ( or al ) is one of the two leagues that make up major league baseball ( mlb ) . the other is the national league ( or nl ) . the american league is made up of 15 teams . at the end of each season , five of these teams go to the `` post-season '' where one will win the american league championship . the champions of the american league plays against the champions of the national league in the world series . the team that wins the world series is the champion of major league baseball . teams in the american league usually play against other teams in the american league , except for a few games a year when they play national league teams . there are 3 divisions of the american league : al east , al central , and al west . the only big difference between the american league and the national league is that the al uses the `` designated hitter '' ( or dh ) . the designated hitter is a player who does not play in the field , but is used to bat for the worst hitter in his team 's `` lineup '' ( usually the pitcher ) . the nl does not use the designated hitter , and all players in the `` lineup '' must bat and field for themselves . if the dh plays a nl game in a nl park , he often plays first base if at all . if they play in an al park , the nl can use a dh .
