Ross Dependency     the ross dependency is an area of antarctica ( and other land masses in the southern ocean ) claimed by new zealand . the dependency takes its name from sir james clark ross , who discovered the ross sea . the dependency includes part of victoria land , and most of the ross ice shelf . ross island , balleny islands and the small scott island also form part of the dependency , as does the ice-covered roosevelt island . the scientific bases of scott base ( new zealand ) and mcmurdo station ( usa ) are the only permanently occupied human settlements in the area â€“ apart from the amundsen-scott south pole station at the very edge of the territory . the dependency has a snow runway at williams field , and depending on conditions and time of year , two ice runways . this guarantees accessibility by wheeled and ski equipped aircraft year round . the british government took possession of the territory in 1923 and entrusted it to the administration of new zealand . under the provisions of the antarctic treaty system , to which new zealand is a signatory , no nation may make efforts to enforce sovereignty or territorial claims over the antarctic continent proper . if one accepts the claim , the ross dependency comprises the bulk of the territory of new zealand , far larger than the north island and the south island combined . however , the actual amount of land mass claimed is not large ; most of the area defined as being in the ross dependency is either in the ross sea or the antarctic ocean . it is the smallest of the claims which were made prior to the implementation of the antarctic treaty system and the suspension of all territorial claims to antarctica proper .
