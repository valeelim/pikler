Dwarf planet     dwarf planet is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system . this definition was made on august 24 , 2006 by the international astronomical union ( iau ) , and can be described as ; `` a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the sun that is big enough to round itself by its own gravity , but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies '' . at the same meeting the iau also defined the term planet for the first time . some astronomers think that the term `` dwarf planet '' is too confusing and needs to be changed . the five dwarf planets , in order from the sun are - ceres ( in the asteroid belt ) - pluto ( pluto was named by an 11 year old girl ) - haumea - makemake - eris the dwarf planets , unlike the terrestrial and gas giant planets , are in more than one region of the solar system . ceres is in the asteroid belt . the high orbital eccentricity of pluto puts it mostly outside neptune 's orbit , but partly inside . the others are in the trans-neptune region . no space probes have visited any of the dwarf planets . this will change if nasa 's `` dawn '' and `` new horizons '' missions reach ceres and pluto , respectively , as planned in 2015 . `` dawn '' also orbited and observed another not sphere-like but still potential dwarf planet , vesta , in 2011 .
