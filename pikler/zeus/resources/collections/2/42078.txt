Biogeography     biogeography is the study of how species are distributed . it aims to show where organisms live , and why they are ( or are not ) found in a certain geographical area . the basic issue is that animals and plants are adapted to the places they live in , but similar places often have quite different animals and plants . one might expect to find , for example , that the animals in a tropical rain forest would be almost the same in amazonia , equatorial africa and southeast asia . but that is not the case . there must be reasons for this situation . those reasons are the subject of research in biogeography . at first , from about 1800â€“1855 , natural historians made lists of species in various regions of the world . these lists were published as tables in their books . a revolution started with charles darwin and alfred russel wallace , who published the idea of evolution by natural selection . they had travelled in tropical countries , and wrote about the life in those countries . they said that evolution was the key to understanding geographical distribution .
