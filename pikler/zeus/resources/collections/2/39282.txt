Meiosis     meiosis is a special type of cell division . unlike mitosis , the way normal body cells divide , meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes , one from each pair . for that reason , meiosis is often called `` reduction division '' . in the long run , meiosis increases genetic variation , in a way which will be explained later . sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an egg . the eggs and sperm are special cells called gametes , or sex cells . gametes are haploid ; they have only half the number of chromosomes as a normal body cell ( called a somatic cell ) . fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number . the basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the `` somatic number '' and is labelled `` 2n '' . in humans 2n = 46 : we have 46 chromosomes . in the sex cells the chromosome number is `` n '' ( humans : n = 23 ) . so , in normal diploid organisms , chromosomes are present in two copies , one from each parent ( 23x2=46 ) . the only exception are the sex chromosomes . in mammals , the female has two x chromosomes , and the male one x and one y chromosome .
