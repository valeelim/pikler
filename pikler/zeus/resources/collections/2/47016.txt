Firefly     fireflies are a family of beetles called the lampyridae . these beetles are special in that most of them have bioluminescence , the ability to produce light . they are sometimes called 'lightning bugs ' or 'forest stars ' . there are about 2000 different species , most of which are nocturnal . adults use flashes of light to attract mates . also , firefly larvae flash their lights to warn predators that they are not a tasty meal . many predators do not like the taste of firefly larvae . a firefly is an insect , so it has an exoskeleton and three body parts . much like an annual cicada , they are usually soft-bodied , often with the elytra ( front wings ) more leathery than in other beetles . a firefly may be brown or black with yellow and red marks . all fireflies glow as larvae . bioluminescence serves a different function in lampyrid larvae than it does in adults . it appears to be a warning signal to predators , since many firefly larvae contain chemicals that are distasteful or toxic . light in adult beetles was originally thought to be used for similar warning purposes , but its main purpose is now thought to be mate selection . fireflies are a classic example of an organism that uses bioluminescence for sexual selection . they have evolved a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships : steady glows , flashing , and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems .
