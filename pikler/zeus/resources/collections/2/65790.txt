Rhodesia     rhodesia was a republic in southern africa during the cold war . it was the region that is now called zimbabwe . the country replaced the british colony of southern rhodesia . the official name of the country under british law was `` southern rhodesia '' , but the government in salisbury used the name `` rhodesia '' instead . this situation dated back to october 1964 , when the colony of northern rhodesia changed its name to zambia following independence , so the colonial government felt that `` southern '' rhodesia should no longer be used because there was no `` northern '' rhodesia . however , britain believed that only their government could change the colony 's name and not the colony itself . the british government adopted a policy called `` no independence before majority rule '' , which dictated that colonies with a certain amount of white settlers would not become independent until they adopted a policy of majority rule . this had conflicted with the beliefs of the white minority rhodesian front , lead by ian smith , which believed that rhodesia should become an independent country anyway . this continued until relations between the colony and the british government broke down in 1965 .
