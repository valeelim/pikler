Morphology (linguistics)    morphology ( linguistics ) morphology is part of linguistics . it looks at the way words are put together using small pieces called morphemes . a morpheme is the smallest part of a word that has meaning . different languages have different morphemes and have different rules for how morphemes are combined . words are the smallest pieces of a sentence . some words only have one morpheme . for example the english words `` thank , '' `` dog , '' and `` slow '' are all words made up of only one morpheme . a morpheme that can stand alone as a word is called a `` free morpheme '' . words can also be made up of more than one morpheme . english speakers know that one can add the plural ( more than one ) morpheme , `` -s , '' to the end of `` dog , '' and create the word `` dogs '' . the new word combines the meanings of the two morphemes , so the meaning of the new word , `` dogs '' is `` more than one dog . '' `` dog '' is a free morpheme , but the plural morpheme `` -s '' is not . it must attach to a word ( no native english speaker would use `` -s '' as a stand alone word ) . morphemes which must be attached to a word are called `` bound morphemes '' . morphemes attached to the front of a word are called `` prefixes '' . those attached to the end are called `` suffixes '' . some morphemes can attach in the middle of a word and are called `` infixes '' .
