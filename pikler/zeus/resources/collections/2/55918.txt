Radiation     in physics , radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium . this includes : 1. electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves , visible light , and x-rays 1. particle radiation such as α , β , and neutron radiation 1. acoustic radiation such as ultrasound , sound 1. seismic waves . radiation may also refer to the energy , waves , or particles being radiated . many people are already familiar with different kinds of electromagnetic radiation/light . scientists categorize this type of radiation based on its wavelength and frequency . some kinds of electromagnetic radiation are : - ionizing radiation comes from radioactive materials and x-ray machines and non-ionizing radiation ( usually electromagnetic radiation ) comes from other sources . ionizing radiation carries more than 10 ev ( electronvolt ) , which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules , and break chemical bonds . this is important for its harmfulness to living organisms . non-ionizing radiation does not cause microscopic damage , but some types can cause chemical changes or make things hotter .
