Chairperson     a chairperson is a person who presides over meetings , such as a board of directors for a corporation , or any other meeting . the chairman of a corporation is not the chief executive officer , and only conducts the meetings in most companies . although `` chairman '' has been used for both men and women , some prefer to use the terms `` chairperson '' , `` madame chairman '' or `` chairwoman . '' the conduct of meetings is governed by the organization 's by-laws or charter , or , more formally , parliamentary procedure for government organizations or large meetings generally . rarely the chairperson is called the `` chair , '' though in educational institutions a `` chair '' indicates a specific endowed position on a faculty .
