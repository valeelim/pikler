Fuel oil     fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue at the oil refinery . broadly speaking , fuel oil is any liquid petroleum product that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power , except oils having a flash point of approximately +40 °c and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners . in this sense , diesel is a type of fuel oil . fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes and aromatics . the term `` fuel oil '' is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , heavier than gasoline and naphtha . fuel oil in the united states is classified into six classes , according to its boiling temperature , composition and purpose . the boiling point , ranging from 175 to 600 °c , and carbon chain length , 20 to 70 atoms , of the fuel increases with number . viscosity also increases with fuel oil number and the heaviest oil has to be heated to get it to flow . price usually decreases as the fuel number increases .
