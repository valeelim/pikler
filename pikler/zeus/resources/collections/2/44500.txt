Ununpentium     ununpentium is a chemical element . it is also named eka-bismuth . it has the symbol uup . it has the atomic number 115. it is a superheavy element . ununpentium does not exist in nature . it is a synthetic element , made from a fusion reaction between americium and calcium . ununpentium is in the center of the theoretical island of stability . no stable isotopes of ununpentium have yet been found . models predict that the stable isotope of ununpentium should have 184 neutrons . the stable isotope with 184 neutrons is uup . the isotope that has been made has only 173 neutrons ( uup ) . on february 2 2004 a report that ununpentium and ununtrium were made was written in a journal named physical review c. the report was written by a team of russian scientists at dubna university 's joint institute for nuclear research and american scientists at the lawrence livermore national laboratory . these people reported that they bombarded americium with calcium to make four atoms of ununpentium . scientists of japan also report that they have made ununpentium .
