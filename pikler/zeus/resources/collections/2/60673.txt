Cardiomyopathy     the word cardiomyopathy means `` heart muscle disease '' . cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases in which the function of the myocardium ( heart muscle ) is impaired for any reason . people with cardiomyopathy are often at risk of arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death . there are four main types of cardiomyopathy : - dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is the most common form . patients with this disease usually undergo heart transplantation . in dcm the heart ( especially the left ventricle ) is enlarged and the pumping function is impaired . - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( hcm or hocm ) is a genetic disorder in which the heart muscle is thickened , which can block blood flow and prevent the heart from functioning properly . - arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvc ) is caused by an electrical disturbance of the heart in which heart muscle is replaced by fibrous scar tissue . the right ventricle is generally most affected . - restrictive cardiomyopathy ( rcm ) is the least common cardiomyopathy . the walls of the ventricles are stiff , but may not be thickened , and resist the normal filling of the heart with blood .
