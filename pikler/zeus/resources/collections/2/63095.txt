Differences between butterflies and moths     the lepidoptera are the butterflies and moths . however , though the butterflies are a natural monophyletic group , moths are not . butterflies are often put in the suborder rhopalocera , which includes papilionoidea ( true butterflies ) , the hesperiidae ( skippers ) , and the hedylidae ( butterfly moths ) . in linnaean taxonomy , moths are usually put in the suborder heterocera . this tends to cover up the fact that they are not a true natural monophyletic group . however , moths do look and behave rather different from butterflies , which explains why people came to call them by a different name . other taxonomic schemes have been proposed , but none of them is perfect . both taxonomists and amateurs make use of the obvious differences between butterflies and moths . the most obvious difference is in the feelers , or antennae . most butterflies have thin slender filamentous antennae which are club shaped at the end . moths , on the other hand , often have comb-like or feathery antennae , or filamentous and unclubbed . this distinction is the basis for the earliest taxonomic divisions in the lepidoptera the rhopalocera ( `` clubbed horn '' , the butterflies ) and the heterocera ( `` varied horn '' , the moths ) .
