Small solar system body     a small solar system body ( sssb ) is a term defined in 2006 by the international astronomical union to describe solar system objects which are neither planets , nor dwarf planets : therefore it refers to these objects that can be further grouped based on their orbit or what they are made of : - all known minor planets that are not dwarf planets , `` i.e . `` : - all comets ; - it is not yet clear whether there will be a lower bound on the group of small solar system bodies , or if it will encompass all material down to the level of meteoroids . some of the larger `` small solar system bodies '' may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets , pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium ( nearly-round shape ) .
