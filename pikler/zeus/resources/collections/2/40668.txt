Potassium permanganate     potassium permanganate is an inorganic chemical compound . its chemical formula is kmno . it contains potassium and permanganate ions . the manganese is in the +7 oxidation state . it is also known as permanganate of potash and condy 's crystals . potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent , which means it has a tendency to take electrons from other chemicals . it dissolves in water to give purple solutions . if it is evaporated , it makes purple-black shiny crystals . it has a sweet taste and is odorless . in 1659 , a german chemist , johann rudolf glauber , melted a mixture of the mineral pyrolusite and potassium carbonate to obtain a material that made a green solution ( potassium manganate ) when dissolved in water . it slowly changed colour to violet ( potassium permanganate ) and then finally red . this report is the first description of the production of potassium permanganate . just under 200 years later a londoner named henry bollmann condy was a chemist . he had an interest in disinfectants and made some things like `` ozonised water '' . he found that when he melted pyrolusite with sodium hydroxide and dissolved it in water , it made a solution that had good disinfectant properties . he patented this solution , and sold it as `` condy 's fluid '' . the problem was that the solution was not very stable . this was fixed by using potassium hydroxide rather than sodium hydroxide . this gave a more stable material . it also was able to be dried to the just as good potassium permanganate powder . this powder was called `` condy ’ s crystals '' or `` condy ’ s powder '' . potassium permanganate was easy to make so condy tried to stop other people from making it and selling it themselves .
