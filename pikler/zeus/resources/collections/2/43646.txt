Mole (unit)    mole ( unit ) mole is the si unit of measurement used to measure the number of things , usually atoms or molecules . one mole of something is equal to avogadro 's number . the measurement of avogadro 's number was refined in 2011 to Â± . we use this number because it is the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 , which is the most common kind of carbon . we can measure anything in moles , but it is not very useful for most things because the numbers are so big . for example , one mole of grapefruits would be as big as the earth . the number does not lend itself to easy expression in words . the nearest `` casual '' number is one million-million-million-million , which is 10. because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass , one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else . atoms and molecule mass is measured in u. one u is equal to one gram per mole . this means that if an atom has a mass of one u , one mole of this atom weighs one gram . moles = mass ( g ) / relative mass ( grams per mole )
