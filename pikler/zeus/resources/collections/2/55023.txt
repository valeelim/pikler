Signal transduction     a signal transduction in biology is a cellular mechanism . it converts a stimulus into a response in the cell . there are two stages in this process : 1. a signalling molecule attaches to a receptor protein on the cell membrane . 1. a second messenger transmits the signal into the cell , and a change takes place in the cell . so , signal transduction starts with a signal to a cell receptor , and ends with a change in cell function . in either step , the signal can be amplified . thus , one signalling molecule can cause many responses . receptors are in the cell membrane , with part of the receptor outside and part inside the cell . the chemical signal binds to the outer portion of the receptor , changing its shape . this causes another signal inside the cell . some chemical messengers , such as testosterone , can pass through the cell membrane , and bind directly to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus . sometimes there is a cascade of signals within the cell . with each step of the cascade , the signal can be amplified , so a small signal can result in a large response . eventually , the signal creates a change in the cell , either in the expression of the dna in the nucleus or in the activity of enzymes in the cytoplasm .
