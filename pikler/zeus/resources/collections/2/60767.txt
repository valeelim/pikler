Simplified Chinese characters     simplified chinese characters is one of the two commonly used forms of chinese characters . as its name shows , it is made of characters that have in part been `` simplified '' from the original written form , which are called traditional chinese characters . when the people 's republic of china was formed in 1949 , the communist party of china under mao zedong wanted to help the chinese people read and write , most of which could not do so . the government hoped that by reducing the number of strokes needed to write characters , along with many other changes in the education system , the chinese language would become more like japanese , in which the empire of japan brought a lot of changes to the japanese writing system during the meiji restoration to make education more widely available to all japanese citizens . mao also hoped that the simplification of chinese characters would begin a shift away from the character system itself that would eventually lead chinese-speakers to using only a phonetic alphabet to write .
