Physical quantity     a physical quantity is a quantity in physics that can be measured , thus a physical property that can be quantified . examples of physical quantities are mass , amount of substance , length , time , temperature , electric current , light intensity , force , velocity , density , and many others . a physical quantity is always measured of natural non-living objects ( inanimate objects ) the foundation of physics rests upon physical quantities in term of which the laws of physics are expressed . therefore , these quantities have to be measured accurately . physical quantities are often divided into two categories ; base quantities and derived quantities . derived quantities are those quantities which are derived from other physical quantities . examples of derived quantities are force , velocity , acceleration etc .
