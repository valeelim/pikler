Symmetry     symmetry is a property of certain geometrical objects that appears the same when mirrored or reflected along an axis . this axis has to cross the shape through the middle of that object dividing into equal halves . the precise notions of symmetry have various measures and operational definitions . for example , symmetry may be observed - with respect to the passage of time ; - as a spatial relationship ; - through transformations such as rotation ; - through other kinds of transformations ; - as an aspect of scientific models , language , music and even knowledge itself . asymmetry is the absence of symmetry . it is best defined like that because symmetry is relatively rare , and all other objects are asymmetric .
