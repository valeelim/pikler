Amiri Baraka     amiri baraka ( october 7 , 1934 – january 9 , 2014 ) was an american writer . he has written poetry , drama , essays and music criticism . he is also the father of newark city mayor ras j. baraka . baraka 's writings have made controversy over the years , mostly because of his advocacy of rape and violence towards ( at many times ) women , gay people , white people , and jews . critics of his work have said such words are examples of racism , sexism , homophobia , and anti-semitism in his work . the following is from a 1965 essay : most american white men are trained to be fags . for this reason it is no wonder their faces are weak and blank . … the average ofay [ white person ] thinks of the black man as potentially raping every white lady in sight . which is true , in the sense that the black man should want to rob the white man of everything he has . but for most whites the guilt of the robbery is the guilt of rape . that is , they know in their deepest hearts that they should be robbed , and the white woman understands that only in the rape sequence is she likely to get cleanly , viciously popped .
