Nerve impulse     a nerve impulse is the way nerve cells ( neurons ) communicate with one another . nerve impulses are mostly electrical signals along the dendrites to produce a nerve impulse or action potential . the action potential is the result of ions moving in and out of the cell . specifically , it involves potassium ( k ) and sodium ( na ) ions . the ions are moved in and out of the cell by potassium channels , sodium channels and the sodium-potassium pump . faster electrical synapses are used in escape reflexes , the retina of vertebrates , and the heart . they are faster because they do not need the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic gap . therefore , electrical synapses are used whenever fast response and coordination of timing are crucial . these synapses connect the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells directly together . when an action potential reaches such a synapse , the ionic currents cross the two cell membranes and enter the postsynaptic cell through pores known as connexons . thus , presynaptic action potential directly stimulates the postsynaptic cell .
