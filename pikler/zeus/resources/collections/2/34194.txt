Zygote     a zygote is the fertilized cell that will grow into a new animal or plant . when a female 's ovum and a male 's sperm cell join , the cell that results is called the zygote . the zygote then multiplies , and grows into an embryo . so , a zygote is formed from the union of two gametes , and is the first stage in a organism 's development . zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid cells , the ovum and the sperm cells , which make a diploid cell . diploid cells have copies of both parents ' chromosomes and dna . some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby . the time between the forming of the zygote and the baby 's birth is called pregnancy . other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies , but lay an egg . the zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and a larva or baby animal hatches .
