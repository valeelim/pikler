Nuclear power     nuclear power is the controlled use of nuclear energy . nuclear energy is energy in uranium that can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor . this energy is made into electricity , which then can be used to power machines and heat homes . in 2007 , 14 % of the world 's electricity came from nuclear power . nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly . nucl–µar power plants produce less radioactive material than a coal fired power station . some serious nuclear accidents have occurred . a scale was made to measure how dangerous accidents are . it is called the international nuclear event scale . the scale has 8 levels ( 0-7 ) , and 7 is the worst . - chernobyl disaster , happened in 1986 ; classified at level 7 . - fukushima nuclear disaster , happened in 2011 , level 7 . - mayak accident ; happened in 1957. the amount of radiation released and the general danger was higher than that of chernobyl . the affected area was smaller though . for these reasons the accident is only classified as level 6 .
