Shift key     the shift key is a key on a computer keyboard . it is used to type capital letters ( like this : `` abc '' ) instead of lowercase ( `` abc '' ) . the shift key is also used to type with keys that have more than one symbol on them , such as the number keys and those for punctuation marks . in this case it is used to type the `` upper '' characters , that is , the symbol that appear above the other . the symbol below does not need the shift key to be pressed . on an english keyboard , these are some of the characters that need the shift key to be pressed down in order to type them : - the parentheses `` ( `` and `` ) '' are on the same keys as the numbers 9 and 0 - the question mark `` ? '' is on the same key as the slash `` / '' - the exclamation point `` ! '' is on the same key as the number 1 - the colon `` : '' is on the same key as the semicolon `` ; '' the way the shift key works is that it needs to be held down while the other key is pressed . because of this , there are usually two shift keys , on the left and right sides of the keyboard , and they are held down using one of the little fingers while the other finger presses the other key .
