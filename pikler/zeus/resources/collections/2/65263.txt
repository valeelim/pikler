Büchner flask     a büchner flask ( also called a vacuum flask , a filter flask , a side-arm flask or a kitasato flask ) is a flask made of glass . a büchner flask has thick walls so that a pressure change will not break it . it has a hole in the top where a büchner funnel can be put and a small tube in the side where a vacuum can be attached . the small tube has barbs on it so that the vacuum will not weaken . a büchner flask can be used with a büchner funnel for separating solids and liquids . water is poured into the büchner funnel and the liquid passes through filter paper and is sucked up by a vacuum attached to the side of the büchner flask , while the solid stays behind in the büchner funnel . the büchner flask can also be used as a vacuum trap in a vacuum line to ensure that no fluids are carried over from the aspirator or vacuum pump ( or other vacuum source ) to the evacuated apparatus , or vice versa . it is commonly thought to be named after the nobel laureate , eduard buchner , but it is actually named after the industrial chemist ernst büchner .
