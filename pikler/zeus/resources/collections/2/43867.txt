Ornithomimus     ornithomimus was a lightly built fast-running north american feathered dinosaur . `` ornithomimus '' had three toes on each foot , long arms and neck , but a small head . it also had claws on each hand and foot . it had no teeth and weak jaws , which might mean it was omnivorous . `` ornithomimus edmonticus '' was the largest species , 12 ft ( 3.5 meters ) long , 7 feet ( 2.10 meters ) high and weighed about 100-150 kg . it walked on two legs and looked slightly like an ostrich , except for its long tail . there has been trouble with naming . some speciments are put in other genera , like dromiceiomimus and `` struthiomimus '' . in 1995 , 2008 and 2009 , three `` o. edmontonicus '' specimens with evidence of feathers were found . two adults had quill knobs on the lower arm , indicating the former presence of bird-like feather shafts . a juvenile had impressions of long fluffy feathers in the form of hair-like filaments covering the rump , legs and neck . the feather imprints were found in sandstone , previously thought to not be able to support such impressions .
