Heuristic     a heuristic is a practical way to solve a problem . it is better than chance , but does not always work . a person develops a heuristic by using intelligence , experience , and common sense . trial and error is the simplest heuristic , but one of the weakest . rule of thumb and 'educated guesses ' are other names for simple heuristics . since a heuristic is not certain to get a result , there are always exceptions . sometimes heuristics are rather vague : 'look before you leap ' is a guide to behaviour , but 'think about the consequences ' is a bit clearer . sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages . when doctors examines a patient , they go through a whole set of tests and observations . they may not find out what is wrong , but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding . this is called a diagnosis . in computer science , a 'heuristic ' is a kind of algorithm . algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem . a heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions , but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct . the time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration .
