True bug     the true bugs are an order of insects . biologists call true bugs the hemiptera . there are around 80,000 species of true bugs . the word `` bug '' by itself can have other meanings . there are many different kinds of true bugs , some of which are aphids , cicadas , planthoppers , shield bugs , and others . all of these are true bugs . their size is from 1 mm to over 10 cm . all true bugs have similar mouthparts , which they use to suck up plant sap . bugs have piercing , sucking mouthparts : this defines the hemiptera . they pierce plants with their long , tube-like mouth , called a proboscis or a beak . they can not chew . the true bug pumps saliva through this mouth , to partly digest their food . it then sucks up the food , which is usually plant sap . the name `` hemiptera '' is from the greek : it means `` hemi '' ( half ) and `` pteron '' ( wing ) . most true bugs have half of their front wings hardened and have the other half soft . these wings are called `` hemelytra '' ( singular `` hemelytron '' ) , because they halfway look like the hard wings ( elytra ) of beetles . the hind wings are totally soft and are shorter than the front wings .
