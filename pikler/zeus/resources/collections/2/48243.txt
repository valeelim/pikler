Synthesizer     a musical synthesizer is an instrument that uses electricity to make musical sounds . very often synthesizers have a keyboard like that of a piano . when playing a piano keyboard , sounds are made by hitting soft hammers against strings pulled very tight . when playing a synthesizer keyboard , sounds are made by turning electrical oscillators on and off . since `` synthesizer '' is such a big word , the word is usually shortened to `` synth '' . an oscillator is something that `` vibrates '' , or repeats the same pattern . the pendulum of a clock , for example , is a very slow oscillator . a piano string `` oscillates '' when struck by a hammer . electric oscillators might be made using transistors . they turn electricity into electrical patterns , or signals , that repeat over and over . when different keys are pressed , different notes are heard . this is done by making the signal from the oscillator repeat at different rates . the signal can be boosted in strength and sent straight to a loudspeaker . but the sound of a simple signal can be boring after a while . sounds can be made more interesting in many ways .
