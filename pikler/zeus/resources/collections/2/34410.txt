Computer bus     a computer bus ( often simply called bus ) is part of most computers . its role is to transfer data , signals , or power between some of the components that make up a computer . the `` size '' or `` width '' of a bus is how many bits it carries in parallel . common bus sizes are : 4 bits , 8 bits , 12 bits , 16 bits , 24 bits , 32 bits , 64 bits , 80 bits , 96 bits , and 128 bits . such buses are in wide use , to - link between the cpu and on-board memory . - link between multiple cpus in a multi-cpu system - link the arithmetic logic unit to the rest of the cpu - connect hard drives , graphics cards , etc . to the main system . serial ata , atapi , usb and firewire connections are types of bus .
