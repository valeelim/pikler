Vibration     vibration or oscillation means quick moving back and forth ( or up and down ) about a point of equilibrium . the vibration may be periodic ( having a pattern ) or random . something that is vibrating may shake at the same time . if it vibrates in a regular way , it may produce a musical note because it can make the air to vibrate . this vibration will send sound waves to the ear and to the brain . in structural dynamics and , particularly , in earthquake engineering , vibrations may be , unfortunately , bad : they may cause the structure to fail . the time it takes a vibrating object to go back and forth completely is the period . the number of back-and-forth movements in one second is its frequency , measured in hertz ( hz ) . the farthest possible distance from the equilibrium point is the amplitude . free vibration occurs when vibration is set off with a push and allowed to vibrate freely . examples of this type of vibration are pulling a child back on a swing and then letting go or hitting a tuning fork and letting it ring . the mechanical system will then vibrate at a 'natural frequency ' and gradually wind down .
