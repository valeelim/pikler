Role     a role ( sometimes spelled r√¥le ) or a social role can be described as an expected behaviour of an individual . more precisely one could say it is a set of connected behaviours , rights and duties that a person has to follow in a social situation . it depends on social status . `` role confusion '' is a situation where an individual has trouble to decide which role he/she should play . for example , one could be a student who would attend a meeting of a particular recreational interest and find her teacher there . they would be in conflict between behaving as a student and as an enthusiast who shares the same interest as the teacher .
