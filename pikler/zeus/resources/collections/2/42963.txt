Chemical bond     chemical bonds are what joins atoms together . when two or more atoms are in a chemical bond they stay together unless the needed amount of energy , or more , is transferred to the bond . something different can then happen . chemical bonds can be explained using different theories . some of these theories try to explain chemical bonds in a simple way that can be used by chemists to imagine what could happen when they try to make molecules . some explain how the atoms are bonded together with more detail and are used by chemists and physicists . there are two types of bonds ; covalent and ionic . covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons . ionic bonding is the attraction between oppositely charged ions . chemical bonds are negatively charged electrons that are pulling protons into each other . a common way chemists describe chemical bonds is through the number of electrons each atom has on itself . each atom is drawn with the number of electrons as dots to form a maximum of eight . the number of dots changes if there are less or more electrons . if the electrons form a chemical bond then a line is drawn between the two electrons .
