Physical compression     physical compression means that a material under compressive stress reduces its volume . there are different uses of compression in physics and engineering . by compression it is possible to measure mechanical properties of materials such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity . scientists do this with press machines . compression is also used in engines , for example in the diesel engine as in any internal combustion engine and in the steam engine . other pages . - strength of materials - compression member - tension ( mechanics )
