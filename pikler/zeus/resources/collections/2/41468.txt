Valley     a valley is a type of landform . a valley is a lower part in the land , between two higher parts which might be hills or mountains . valleys often start as a downward fold between two upward folds in the surface of the earth , and sometimes as a rift valley . a valley is made deeper by a stream of water or a river as it flows from the high land to the lower land , and into a lake or sea . some valleys are made by glaciers which are slow-moving rivers of ice . when water or ice make a valley deeper or wider , this is called erosion . wind can also make valleys larger by erosion . a valley has a `` head '' where it begins in the mountains or hills , `` sides '' where it rises up on either side , a `` floor '' which is where the valley is most flat . some valleys have an `` entrance '' where the valley opening can be seen between two hills or mountains or cliffs . a place where a valley is very narrow and has high walls is sometimes called a `` gorge '' . ( this word `` gorge '' is sometimes used to mean the `` throat '' on a human body ) .
