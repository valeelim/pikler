Japanese sword-making     japanese schools of sword making can be divided into two categories : by the provinces where they were developed and by the masters who created a specific tradition of sword making . the late kamakura period is often referred to as the greatest period of sword making in japanese history . the soshu tradition was one of the dominant traditions . smiths like kunitsuna and sukezane combined their knowledge with methods from yamashiro and bizen traditions . finally , a group of famous sword smiths culminated with masamune ( 1264-1343 ad ) and his school . the rare swords were made out of five separate pieces and heat-treated at high temperatures . the swords of the masamune school were harder than any of the swords made before . masamune trained a group of at least ten followers . two of his students ( kanemitsu and nagayoshi ) were from the bizen province . in this way , during the early 14th century , the masamune school attracted many smiths from other schools . kanemitsu is believed to be the one who created the soden school , which combined bizen and soshu techniques .
