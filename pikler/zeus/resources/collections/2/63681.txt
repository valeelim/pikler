Dicotyledon     the dicotyledons , also known as dicots , were one of the two groups of flowering plants or angiosperms . the name refers to one of the characteristics of the group , namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons . there are around 200,000 species in this group . the other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots , with one cotyledon . historically , these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants . from the 1990s onwards , molecular phylogeny showed what botanists already suspected : dicotyledons are not a monophyletic group . they are a number of lineages , such as the magnoliids . groups now known as basal angiosperms diverged earlier than the monocots did . the traditional dicots are a paraphyletic group . the largest clade of the dicotyledons are known as the eudicots . they are definitely monophyletic . they are distinguished from all other flowering plants by the structure of their pollen . other dicotyledons and monocotyledons have an older type of pollen , whereas eudicots have derived pollen .
