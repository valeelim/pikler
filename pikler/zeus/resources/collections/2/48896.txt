Applied mechanics     applied mechanics , also known as theoretical and applied mechanics , is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics . applied mechanics examines the `` response of bodies ( solids and fluids ) to external forces '' . some examples of `` mechanical systems '' include the flow of a liquid under pressure , the fracture of a solid from an applied force , or the vibration of an ear in response to sound . a practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician . applied mechanics , as its name suggests , bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology .
