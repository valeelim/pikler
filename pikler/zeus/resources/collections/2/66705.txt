Apostolic Nunciature     an apostolic nunciature is the embassy of the holy see in a foreign country . the nunciature protects the affairs of the roman catholic church , not just the vatican city , and also liases between the holy see and the roman catholic church in that country . the head of nunciature is called a nuncio . the nuncio is the equivalent of an ambassador , or a high commissioner in commonwealth countries . some countries make the nuncio `` dean of the diplomatic corps '' ( head of the group of ambassadors to its country ) . this is allowed by the international agreement about diplomats . usually the dean of the diplomatic corps is the longest serving ambassador in a country . a pro-nuncio was the name used for a nuncio in countries which did not make a nuncio dean of the diplomatic corps automatically . the vatican stopped using the title in 1991. an apostolic delegate represented the holy see to the church , but not the government , in another country .
