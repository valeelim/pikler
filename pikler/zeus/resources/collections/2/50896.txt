Enabling Act     the enabling act ( `` erm√§chtigungsgesetz '' in german ) was passed by germany 's parliament ( the `` reichstag '' ) on march 23 , 1933. it was the second major step after the reichstag fire decree through which the nazis obtained dictatorial powers using largely legal means . the act enabled chancellor adolf hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the `` reichstag '' . the formal name of the enabling act was `` gesetz zur behebung der not von volk und reich '' ( `` law to remedy the distress of the people and the empire '' ) . as with most of the laws passed in the process of `` gleichschaltung '' , the enabling act is quite short , considering its consequences . it is therefore reproduced in full in german and english : the enabling act was passed by the reichstag on march 23 and proclaimed by the government the following day . following constitutional procedure for legislation , the law was countersigned by president von hindenburg , chancellor hitler , minister of interior frick , foreign minister von neurath , and minister of finance von krosigk .
