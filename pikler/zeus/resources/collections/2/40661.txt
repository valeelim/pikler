Gesture     a gesture is a form of nonverbal communication . unlike verbal communication , which uses words , gestures use movements of the body . gestures are `` deliberate acts with a purpose '' , not just any movements . they are handled in the human brain by the same centres which handle language . in the neocortex , broca 's and wernicke 's areas , are used by speech and sign language . other movements of the body have meaning , but are not gestures . they may be done by actors deliberately , but normally they are automatic , unconscious signals which express various feelings or states of mind . many animals communicate extensively using such behaviours . the dog , a companion to humans for a long time , is good at reading both gestures and behaviours . gestures have a cultural significance ( meaning ) . the same gesture can mean different things in different cultures and different parts of the world . examples . - high five – a greeting or sign of happiness - facepalm – showing frustration - sign of the cross – religious gesture
