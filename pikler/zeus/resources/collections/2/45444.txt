Binary     binary is a way to show any type of data ( such as numbers and text ) using only 1 and 0. computers work in binary . binary is a number system and is known as a base 2 system because it uses two characters – 0 and 1. decimal , the system most of the world uses for daily life , is a base 10 system – it uses 10 characters ( 0–9 ) . when binary numbers are written , a subscript `` ( 2 ) '' is added to distinguish them from the same number in base 10. when being introduced to binary numbers , it helps to go back and think about how base 10 or decimal numbers work . consider the number 1101 ( base 10 ) . we identify this number as one-thousand , one-hundred , one because it has a 1 in the thousands place , a 1 in the hundreds place , and a 1 in the ones place . these `` places '' represent increasing powers of 10. in binary , the places represent `` increasing powers of two '' . because 1101 only has the digits 0 and 1 , it could also be a binary number . this would be written as 1101. but since the places represent 8 , 4 , 2 , and 1 instead of 1000 , 100 , 10 , and 1 , the value in base 10 would be 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 .
