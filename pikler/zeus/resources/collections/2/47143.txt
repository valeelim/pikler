Boston Tea Party     the boston tea party was a violent protest by american colonists against king george iii 's rule in america . it happened on december 16 , 1773. the boston tea party was an act of protest against the british for the tea act . the americans had no one to speak for them in the british government . they were frustrated that they were being taxed by the government but had no part in how the government was run . they did not think it was right to pay taxes when they did not have a representative in the government ( `` no taxation without representation ! '' ) . also , merchants selling their goods would lose their profit because of the taxes . the americans began purchasing smuggled goods , which were much cheaper . to show how angry they were , samuel adams and a group of people named the sons of liberty dressed up as native americans and went onto ships in the boston harbour . they took boxes of tea and dumped them into the water . this made the british government enraged . the british government made even stricter laws for the people of the massachusetts colony . one of these laws was the intolerable acts , which closed boston harbour until the colonists paid for all the tea they dumped .
