Renewable energy commercialization     renewable energy commercialization involves many different technologies , including solar photovoltaics , solar thermal power plants , solar heating and cooling systems , wind power , hydroelectricity , geothermal power , biomass , and ocean energy systems . each is at a different stage of development , yet the market is growing for many renewables . renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013 , respectively . both , modern renewables , such as hydro , wind , solar and biofuels , as well as traditional biomass , contributed in about equal parts to the global energy supply . worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us $ 214 billion in 2013 , with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind , hydro , solar and biofuels . renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas , in contrast to other energy sources , which are concentrated in a limited number of countries . rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security , climate change mitigation , and economic benefits . in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power . at the national level , at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply . national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond .
