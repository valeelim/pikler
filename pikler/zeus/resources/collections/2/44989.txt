Sega Saturn     the sega saturn is a 32-bit video game console made by sega . it was released in japan on november 22 1994 , in the united states on may 11 1995 , and in europe on july 8 1995. games were released on cd-roms . it is followed by the dreamcast . the saturn was the first sega video game console which can display 3d graphics . accessories were available for the sega saturn , including a gun controller which was used to play `` virtua cop '' , and an analog controller . the console was called saturn because it was sega 's sixth games console , and saturn is the sixth planet of the solar system . the sega saturn was quite popular in japan and/or france , because of the commercial with segata sanshiro , a man who devoted his life to the sega saturn . the japanese sega saturn was black , and it was later changed to gray . in north america , the saturn was not nearly as popular as it was in japan and/or france . when it was first released , there were only a few games available , because the console 's strange technology made it difficult to program for . that caused the playstation to be more popular in europe . another problem was that sega released the saturn sooner than they intended to , but did not tell shops about the new release date , meaning that many of them did not sell the saturn at all out of anger . sega had also made other consoles to try and be the first to use new technology , such as the sega cd ( an early console with games that came on cds ) and the sega 32x ( with better graphics than sega 's previous consoles ) , leaving some gamers without enough money to buy all three systems or angry at sega for abandoning the 32x when the saturn was released .
