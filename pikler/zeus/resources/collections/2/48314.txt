Earl     an earl ( or jarl ) was a title for nobility used by anglo-saxons and scandinavians . it originally meant `` chieftain '' and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king 's stead . in scandinavia , it stopped being used in the middle ages , whereas , in britain , it became synonymous with the continental count . today , an earl is a member of the british peerage , and is below a marquess , but above a viscount . a british earl is the same as a continental count . since there is no feminine form of earl , the wife of an earl has the rank of countess ( the continental equivalent ) .
