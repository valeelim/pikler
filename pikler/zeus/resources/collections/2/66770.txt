Incubation period     an incubation period is the time it takes between the day a person is infected with a pathogen ( something that causes a disease , like a virus ) , and the day that the person starts having symptoms of the disease . for example , if a person is infected with the common cold , it usually takes about one to three days for the person to start having cold symptoms . this means that the common cold 's incubation period is one to three days . with some diseases , like human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv , the virus that causes aids ) , a person can still give other people hiv during the incubation period . even though the person with hiv has no symptoms , the virus is making copies of itself during the incubation period . many different things affect the incubation period for a disease . these things include : - how much of the pathogen a person got - whether the person was vaccinated against this pathogen , and if they were , which vaccine was used - how fast the pathogen makes copies of itself once it is in the body
