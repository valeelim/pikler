Fustat     fustat was the first arab capital in egypt . it was founded in 641 ad , after the arabs conquered alexandria . the arabs did not want their capital to be so far away as alexandria , which is why they made fustat , which was closer , and was on their side of the nile river . fustat became a beautiful and powerful city for over 500 years , but then it was destroyed during a war , when its vizier shawar told his army to burn the city . shawar did not want anyone else to capture the city , so he burned it instead . today there is not much left of fustat , but some buildings can be seen in old cairo .
