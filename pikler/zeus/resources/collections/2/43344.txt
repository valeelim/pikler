Compsognathus     compsognathus was a small carnivorous theropod dinosaur , from the end of the jurassic period , 144 million years ago . it was about a metre long , and ran on two legs , using its long tail to keep its balance . `` compsognathus '' is known from two nearly complete specimens , one from germany ( 89 cm 35 in long ) , and another from france ( 125 cm 49 in long ) . the german specimen was found in the solnhofen limestone in bavaria , over 150 years ago . the larger french specimen ( mnhn cnj 79 ) was discovered in 1972 in the portland limestone , near nice in southeastern france . although originally described as a separate species called `` compsognathus corallestris '' , others have since renamed it as another example of `` compsognathus longipes '' . it is one of the few dinosaurs whose diet is known with certainty : the remains of small , agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens . thomas henry huxley ( `` darwin 's bulldog '' ) , who was a comparative anatomist , made a study of it nearly 150 years ago . he compared the first fossil bird , `` archaeopteryx '' , with `` compsognathus '' . these two fossils were found in the same rocks : solnhofen limestone in bavaria , germany . the strata come from the end of the jurassic , about 144 million years ago . huxley showed that the two were almost identical , except for the front limbs and feathers of `` archaeopteryx '' . he showed the basic affinity of birds and reptiles , which he united them under the title of `` sauropsida '' . huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs .
