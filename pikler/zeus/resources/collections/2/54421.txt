Requiem     a requiem ( or requiem mass ) is a eucharist service in the roman catholic church to remember someone who has died . there are special words for a requiem mass . they are in latin . the best-known part of the requiem mass starts with the words “ requiem aeternam dona eis , domine ” ( “ give them eternal rest , o lord ” ) . this is why it is called a “ requiem ” . many composers throughout the centuries have composed music to these words . the word “ requiem ” can mean a piece of music which sets the words of the requiem mass . celebration of the eucharist in honour of people who have died goes back at least as far as the 2nd century . in the middle ages the words of the requiem mass were sung to gregorian chant . in the renaissance church music was generally polyphonic . this sort of music , which has several voices weaving in and out of one another , is the kind of music used at the time for requiems . the composer johannes ockeghem is an example of a composer who wrote such music . polyphonic settings of the requiem continued during the baroque period ( 17th and early 18th centuries ) , even although other musical forms ( e.g . opera ) had developed a much more modern style .
