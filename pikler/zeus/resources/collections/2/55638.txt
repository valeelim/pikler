Ecclesia (Church)    ecclesia ( church ) ecclesia ( or ekklesia ) in christian theology means both : a particular body of faithful people , and the whole body of the faithful . latin `` ecclesia '' , from greek `` ekklesia '' had an original meaning of `` assembly , congregation , council '' , literally `` convocation '' . if one speaks of the whole body of christian faithful , then there are included not only the members of the church who are alive on earth but all who were members of the church before . some churches therefore describe the church as being composed of the `` church militant '' ( christians on earth ) and the `` church triumphant '' ( christians in heaven ) . in catholic theology , there is also the `` church suffering '' ( christians still in purgatory ) . the christian family , the most basic unit of church life , is sometimes called the domestic church finally , 'the church ' may sometimes be used , especially in catholic theology , to speak of those who exercise the office of teaching and ruling the faithful , the `` ecclesia docens '' , or again ( more rarely ) the governed as distinguished from their pastors , the `` ecclesia discens '' .
