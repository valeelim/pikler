Psittacosaurus     psittacosaurus was a small ceratopsian dinosaur from the lower cretaceous of what is now asia , about 130 to 100 million years ago . it was more basal than other members of the ceratopsia : it was bipedal , and had no horns or frill on its head . what made it a ceratopsian was its beak . it is notable for being the most species-rich dinosaur genus , but there is no general agreement on these species . nine to eleven species are named for fossils found in different regions of china , mongolia and russia , with a possible additional species from thailand . all species of `` psittacosaurus '' were gazelle-sized bipedal herbivores with a high , powerful beak on the upper jaw . at least one species had long , quill-like structures on its tail and lower back , possibly with a display function . psittacosaurs were early ceratopsians . they developed adaptations of their own , but they also shared features with later ceratopsians , such as `` protoceratops '' and the elephant-sized `` triceratops '' .
