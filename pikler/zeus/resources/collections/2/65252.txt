Büchner funnel     a büchner funnel is a piece of laboratory equipment which is used to filter or separate a liquid from a solid . it is named after an industrial chemist called ernst büchner . a büchner funnel can be made out of porcelain , glass or plastic . on the top there is a container with a hole in the bottom . this container is put on top of a büchner flask with a hole in the top and a hole in the side . in between the container and the büchner flask there is a piece of filter paper which lets through liquids but not any solids . attached to the hole in the side there is a vacuum which sucks the air out of the büchner flask . this means that when any mixture is poured into the top , the liquid is sucked through the filter paper and the solid is left stuck in the filter paper . a büchner flask is used in chemistry to take unwanted solids out of any liquids . the advantages of using a büchner flask over just a piece of filter paper held over a beaker is that the solid is dried as more and more liquid is sucked off of it by the vacuum . most of the time it needs to be dried again in an oven , but sometimes no further drying is needed .
