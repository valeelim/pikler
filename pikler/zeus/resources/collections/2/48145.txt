Wars of the Roses     the wars of the roses ( 1455â€“1487 ) was a series of civil wars , fought over the throne of england , between supporters of the house of lancaster and supporters of the house of york . both houses were branches of the plantagenet royal house , tracing their descent from king edward iii . the main reason for the war was that king edward iii had many sons , as shown in the family tree below . his oldest son , who was known by the nickname , `` the black prince '' , died first , and the throne passed to the black prince 's son , richard , who became king richard ii of england in 1377 at the age of only ten . he grew up to be a weak and unpopular king , and one of his actions was to send his cousin henry into exile . henry later returned , while richard was away in ireland , and took over the country . when richard returned , henry tricked him into giving himself up . richard was put in prison , where he died , and henry became king henry iv of england . although henry iv reigned until his death , and was followed by his son , king henry v , the next king in line , king henry vi was only a baby . king henry vi then took over from henry v , and was crowned in 1422. henry vi ruled for many years , but was considered a bad king by some of his people , and was overthrown by edward , a distant relative , with help from the duke of warwick . edward was in the house of york and henry was in the house of lancaster , so the war was fought between these groups .
