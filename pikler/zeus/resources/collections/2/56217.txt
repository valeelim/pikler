Statesman     a statesman or stateswoman is respected , skilled and experienced political leader or figure . in most respects a statesman is the opposite of a politician . politicians are thought of as people who will say or do anything to get elected or to gain power . a statesman is someone who does everything for the common good of the people he or she represents . to call a person a statesman is a mark of high regard for that person 's integrity . to call someone a politician usually implies the person is worthy of very little esteem . for example , george washington is almost always called a statesman . an elder statesman is a term often defined as an older politician or advisor who is thought to be above normal politics . in 51 bc , cicero published his work `` de re publica '' ( `` on the republic '' ) . the dialog was about what made a true statesman . it was about the virtues and ideals such a leader must have . cicero wrote that a great statesman did not have to descend from aristocrats . but he must have `` virtus ( virtue ) '' , `` iustitia '' ( a sense of justice ) and wisdom . he must also have `` dignitas '' ( roughly translated as dignity ) , temperance and must show generosity and be magnanimous .
