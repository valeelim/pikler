Daddy long-legs spider     the daddy-long-legs spider ( `` pholcus phalangioides '' ) is a spider of the family pholcidae . its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body . it is often confused with the `` daddy long-legs '' , a member of the opiliones , which are not true ( real ) spiders . `` p. phalangioides '' has the habit of shaking the web violently when disturbed . this is probably to blur the vision of a predator . because it is often found on the ceilings of rooms , caves or cellars , it is also called cellar spider . they can easily catch and eat hairy house spiders , mosquitoes , and other insects . when food is scarce , they will prey on their own kind . because they originally came from the tropics , these spiders do not seem to be aware of seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year . the female holds 20 to 30 eggs in her jaws . spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they grow . females have a body length of about 9mm , males are slightly smaller .
