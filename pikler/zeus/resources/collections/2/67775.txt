Wind speed     wind speed is the speed of the weather related air movement from one place to the next . wind speeds usually mean the movement of air in an outside environment , but the speed of movement of air inside is also important in many cases , including weather forecasting , aircraft and maritime operations , construction and civil engineering . high wind speeds can cause unpleasant side effects , and strong winds often have special names , including gales , hurricanes , and typhoons . the highest wind speed ever measured on earth , 231 miles per hour , was recorded on mount washington ( new hampshire ) . the most simple method of measuring wind speed is to estimate the speed from the observed event against the beaufort scale . obviously , this method is not the most accurate available , so each value on the scale represents a range of values , three on the scale , for example , covers the wind speeds between seven and ten knots .
