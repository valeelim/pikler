Linear search     linear search or sequential search is an algorithm to find an item in a list . it 's a search algorithm . start out with a list , l which may have the item in question . 1. if the list , l is empty , then the list has nothing . the list does not have the item in question . stop here . 1. otherwise , we look at all the elements in the list , l. 1. for each element : 1. if the element equals the item in question , the list has the item in question . stop here . 1. otherwise , go onto next element . 1. the list does not have the item in question . in the programming language java , linear search looks like this . this method has two parameters : an array of integers and the item we are looking for ( also an integer ) . it says the location in the array if it finds the item . if it does not find it , it says -1 .
