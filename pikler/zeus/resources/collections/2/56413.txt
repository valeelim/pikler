Remo Four     the remo four were a rock band from liverpool , england , from the late 1950s and early 1960s , at the same time the beatles were starting their musical careers . while the beatles gained experience performing in hamburg , germany , the remo four played at american air force bases in france . members of the two bands were friends , and often played at the same places back in liverpool , or would go to watch each other perform . after the beatles became famous under brian epstein 's management , epstein signed up the remo four also . he worked hard to promote the band , but they never achieved massive success as the beatles had . epstein paired the remo four with a singer he also managed , called tommy quickly . they made a series of singles together , but none became hits . quickly retired from music , and the remo four went on to work with other singers , including billy j. kramer . they also released an album , titled `` smile '' , on a german record label . george harrison was invited to record a movie late in 1967. instead of working with the beatles , he invited the remo four to work with him . the movie , `` wonderwall '' , got little exposure , but the soundtrack album , `` wonderwall music '' , became a minor hit the next year .
