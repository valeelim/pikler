Annelid     annelids are a phylum of invertebrate worms . they are the segmented worms , with over 17,000 known species . well known species are earthworms and leeches . annelids can be found in most wet environments . some of these species are parasitic or mutualistic . this means they live together with ( or inside ) another organism . a mutualistic relationship is beneficial to both organisms . their size varies from under a millimetre to about 3 metres . the largest known species is the seep tube worm ( `` lamellibrachia lymnesi '' ) , which is related to the giant tube worm . annelids are made of one or more body segments . each segment has one or more rings . these rings are called `` annuli '' ( singular : 'annulus ' = 'little ring ' ) . annelids reproduce sexually by hermaphroditic cross-fertilization . they can regenerate cut off pieces of their body . unlike sponges , which can come back together if ripped apart . they have a hydrostatic skeleton , a one-way digestion system , and bilateral symmetry . annelid worms have a nervous system . the brain forms a ring round the pharynx ( throat ) , consisting of a pair of ganglia ( local control centers ) above and in front of the pharynx , linked by nerve cords either side of the pharynx to another pair of ganglia just below and behind it . in some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex , with visible hindbrain , midbrain and forebrain sections .
