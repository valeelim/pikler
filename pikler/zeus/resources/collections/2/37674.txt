Sega Dreamcast     sega dreamcast ( japanese : ドリームキャスト ; originally called `` dural , '' and `` katana '' ) is the fourth and last home console made by sega that can play video games . it was sold before the playstation 2 , gamecube , or xbox came out . however , not many people bought it after the playstation 2 was released , so in the end sega decided to stop making them . when it was time to make another video game machine after the sega saturn was released , shoichiro irimajiri asked tatsuo yamamoto from ibm austin and his group to create it . however hideki sato 's old group that made video game machines did not like this . because of this , the two groups were in a competition to make the best machine . hideki sato 's group used hitachi sh4 and powervr to make a video game machine called `` white belt '' . the name was later changed to `` guppy '' and then `` katana '' . tatsuo yamamoto 's ibm/motorola powerpc 603e and 3dfx voodoo 2 to make a video game machine called `` blackbelt '' and then renamed to `` shark '' in united states . in japan , the machine was first called `` dural '' and then renamed to `` katana ''
