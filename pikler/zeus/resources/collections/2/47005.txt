Quadratic equation     a quadratic equation is an equation in the form of , where `` a '' is not equal to 0. it makes a parabola ( a `` u '' shape ) when graphed on a coordinate plane . the quadratic formula is a formula used to find the points where the graphed equation crosses the x-axis , or the horizontal axis . these points are called the `` zeroes '' of a function . the formula is : where the letters are the corresponding numbers of the original equation , . also , `` a '' can not be 0 for the formula to work properly . the factored form of this equation is , where `` s '' and `` t '' are the zeros , `` a '' is a constant , and `` y '' and the two `` x '' s are ordered pairs which satisfy the equation . the quadratic formula is proved by `` completing the square '' , divide the quadratic equation by `` a '' : move : use the method of `` completing the square '' add formula_8 to both sides of the equation : which gives : the left side is now a perfect square ; it is the square of the right side can be a single fraction , with a common denominator . find the square root of both sides .
