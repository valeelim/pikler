Probability theory     probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena . the central objects of probability theory are random variables , stochastic processes , and events : mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or happen over time in an apparently random fashion . as a mathematical foundation for statistics , probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data . methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state , as in statistical mechanics . a great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales , described in quantum mechanics . the mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyse games of chance by gerolamo cardano in the sixteenth century , and by pierre de fermat and blaise pascal in the seventeenth century ( for example the `` problem of points '' ) . although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event , if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns , which can be studied and predicted . two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem .
