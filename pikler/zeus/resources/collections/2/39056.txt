Extratropical cyclone     an extratropical cyclone ( also called a mid-latitude cyclone ) is a type of cyclone . it is a large low-pressure weather area with clouds , rain and heavy wind . they occur in areas that are between latitudes 30° – 60° from the equator . they are not the same as tropical cyclones or low-pressure weather areas from polar zones . they are actually many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain , heavy wind , and sometimes tornadoes and even hail . an extratropical cyclone turns anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere . the shape is circular or oval . the usual size in diameter is about 1000 km . these cyclones are usually connected with fronts . a front is a system of changes in weather . it is caused by a very cold air mass meeting a very hot air mass . in the cyclone , there is a system of warm front and cold front . the center of a cyclone is cloudier . there is also a very high chance of precipitation . the wind is strong and changes its direction , as the warm front passes . the weather is stable and fog is usual . as the cold front passes , there is a change of wind , the temperature decreases and rain is also common .
