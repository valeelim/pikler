Edda     edda or the plural eddas or eddur , including `` poetic edda '' ( or older edda ) and `` prose edda '' ( or younger edda ) , are two collections of stories about viking deities . they were made in around 9th to 13th century by icelandic christian historians . although the eddur are the most important written records remaining today about norse mythology , they are not very reliable because christians hated pagan religions , and they changed the original tales to make the norse gods and goddesses look silly , lusty , and barbaric . the term `` edda '' most likely refers to oddi , a place where both saemund sigfusson ( a cleric who is rumoured author of older edda ) , and snorri sturluson ( a christian politician , author of younger edda ) lived .
