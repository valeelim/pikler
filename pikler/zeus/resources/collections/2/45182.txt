Deconstruction     deconstruction is a way of understanding how something was created , usually things like art , books , poems and other writing . deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts . deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object . the smaller parts are usually ideas . sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean . it says that because words are not precise , we can never know what an author meant . sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made assumptions . one thing it pays attention to is how opposites work . ( it calls them `` binary oppositions . '' ) it says that two opposites like `` good '' and `` bad '' are not really different things . `` good '' only makes sense when someone compares it to `` bad , '' and `` bad '' only makes sense when someone compares it to `` good . '' and so even when someone talks about `` good , '' they are still talking about `` bad . '' but this is just one thing it does . because of things like this , deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first . other meanings are always there too , and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together . the closer we look at the writing , the more we find about how it works , and how meaning works for all things . if we deconstructed everything , we might never be able to talk or write at all . but that does not mean deconstruction is useless . if we deconstruct some things , we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work .
