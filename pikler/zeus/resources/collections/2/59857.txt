Electrical circuit     an electric circuit is a path in which electrons from a voltage or current source flow . the point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the `` source '' of electrons . the point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the `` return '' or `` earth ground '' . the exit point is called the `` return '' because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit . the part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons ' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit 's `` load '' . the load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power home appliances like refrigerators , televisions , or lamps or more complicated , such as the load on the output of a hydroelectric power generating station.. circuits use two forms of electrical power : alternating current ( ac ) and direct current ( dc ) . ac often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by power stations . dc powers battery operated vehicles and other machines and electronics . converters can change ac to dc and vice versa . high-voltage direct current transmission uses big converters .
