Guru Nanak Dev     guru nanak dev was the founder of sikhism , and the first of the ten sikh gurus . there are ten gurus who are important to sikhs . the last guru said that there would be no more gurus after him and sikhs would be taught by the sikh holy book , which is called guru granth sahib . the word guru means religious teacher . beside followers of sikhism , guru nanak dev is considered holy by punjabi hindus and sahajdhari sindhis across the indian subcontinent . because of his close connection with hazrat sheikh farid-ud-din ganj shakar , the punjabi sufi saint , nanak dev is also considered by many muslims to be a sufi , or adherent of sufic tenets . his main teaching to the world was written down to be `` devotion of thought and having good actions as the first of our jobs '' . guru nanak was born in nankana sahib , in punjab . this is now part of pakistan . when guru nanak was a child he refused the `` upanayana '' ( holy thread ) to initiate him into the hindu religion . later in his life he married mata sulakhani with whom he had two sons . they were called sri chand and lakshmi das . according to the sikh religion , one day he was bathing in the river and god took him up to heaven . his family members were very worried as they had thought he died . after three days he returned with the message of god . he gave up his job to spread the message on how to be a good person .
