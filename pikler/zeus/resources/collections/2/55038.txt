Thrust     thrust is a force or a push . when a system pushes or accelerates mass in one direction , there is a thrust ( force ) just as large in the opposite direction . in math and physics , this is described by isaac newton ’ s second and third laws . thrust is used to describe how strongly an engine pushes . it can be used for many kinds of vehicles and engines such as rocket engines , plane ( propeller ) engines , and jet engines . thrust is measured in “ pounds of thrust ” in the u.s. and in newtons in the metric system . 4.45 newtons of thrust equals 1 pound of thrust . a pound of thrust is how much thrust it would take to keep a one pound object unmoving against the force of gravity on earth . a very common question is how to compare the thrust number of an airplane engine with the mechanical power of a piston engine ( the kind of engine in cars and in many airplanes with propellers ) . it is hard to compare these two . this is because they are not measuring the same exact thing . a piston engine does not move the plane . it just turns the propeller , which moves the plane . because of this , piston engines are rated by how much power they give to the propeller .
