Aqua regia     aqua regia ( `` royal water '' in latin ) is a very strong acid . it is made by mixing one part concentrated nitric acid and three parts concentrated hydrochloric acid . the acid was named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum . tantalum , iridium and a few other metals are not dissolved by it . aqua regia was discovered around 1300 ad , by the european alchemist pseudo-geber , when he mixed common salt with vitriol ( sulphuric acid ) . in the middle ages it was one of the ways that alchemists tried to find the philosopher 's stone . when germany invaded denmark in world war ii , the hungarian chemist took the nobel prize medals of max von laue and james franck to keep them safe . de hevesy dissolved the medals , which were made of gold , into aqua regia . he did this so the nazis would not steal them . he placed the jar that held the solution of aqua regia and gold on a shelf in his laboratory at the niels bohr institute . the jar looked the same as hundreds of other jars in the laboratory , so the nazis thought that all the jars had normal chemicals in them . after the war , de hevesy returned to the lab , found the jar with the solution , and removed the gold from it . he returned the gold to the royal swedish academy of sciences , and the nobel foundation used the gold to make new medals for laue and franck .
