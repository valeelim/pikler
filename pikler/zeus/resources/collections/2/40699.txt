Mulberry     mulberry ( `` morus '' ) is a genus of 10â€“16 species of trees . they are native to warm regions of asia , africa and the americas , with most of the species native to asia . mulberries are fast-growing when young , but soon become slow-growing and rarely grow over 10-15 meters tall . the leaves are simple , often lobed , and ridged . the fruit grows in bunches , 2-3 centimeters long , is red to dark purple in color , edible , and sweet with a good flavor in several species . the fruit is used in pies , tarts , and wines . the fruit of the black mulberry , native to southwest asia , and the red mulberry , native to eastern north america , have the strongest flavor . the fruit of the white mulberry , an east asian species , has a very weak flavor . mulberries can be grown from seeds , and this is the best idea as seedling-grown trees are generally healthier . however , they are most often planted from large pieces cut from other mulberry trees , which easily take root . mulberry leaves , particularly those of the white mulberry , `` morus alba '' , are important as food of the silkworm , the cocoon of which is used to make silk . `` morus alba '' is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen , which is launched at over half the speed of sound . `` this is the fastest motion yet observed in biology , and approaches the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants .
