Video CD     a video cd or vcd is a cd that contains a movie instead of music or a computer program . it is the `` little brother '' of the dvd . since a dvd can store ten times as much information as a vcd , the quality of a vcd is not as high as that of a dvd , but it is ten times cheaper to make . the quality of the picture is about as good as an analog television with a simple antenna , or a vhs tape . vcd 's were invented by philips and sony just like the cd , but then never became very popular in the western world , which switched from vhs tapes directly to the dvd . however , in asia and in other developing countries the vcd is popular , since a dvd player is also much more expensive than a vcd player . a vcd movie is stored in the popular mpeg ( .mpg ) format , that is also often used to download movies from the internet . but if a vcd disk is put in a computer , there is a file with a .mpg after the name , and many other files . this is because the movie is actually in a file ( or files ) that has .dat after the name . this file can be played with windows media player ( or any other player that can play a .mpg movie ) , one does not need special software because the file is actually just a .mpg movie with a .dat end of the name instead of .mpg . there are also many programs that can play a vcd on a pc .
