Indirect democracy     indirect democracy , or representative democracy , is when citizens elect representatives to make laws on their behalf . this is what most modern countries have today . in many representative democracies ( canada , the usa , india , etc . ) representatives are chosen in elections . elections may be won by plurality or majority or some other way . in theory other methods , such as allotment ( selection by a lottery ) could be used instead . also , representatives sometimes hold the power to select other representatives , presidents , or other officers of government ( indirect representation ) . direct democracy is where citizens themselves vote for or against specific proposals or laws . some city states in ancient greece had this system . with the large populations in modern countries it is possible only occasionally to do this . it happens in a plebiscite or referendum . in a democracy the ultimate power to decide significant electoral system reforms lies with the people . the key question that democrats will tend to ask of any proposed change in electoral law or the voting mechanism is : “ will it actually increase the capacity of the electorate to get rid of unsatisfactory rulers and replace them with others ? ” democrats regard that basic capacity as the best protection against bad government and the abuse of power .
