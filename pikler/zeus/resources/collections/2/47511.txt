Anglo-Saxons     the anglo-saxons were the dominant people living in england from the mid-5th century ad until the norman conquest in 1066. they spoke germanic languages and are identified by bede as the descendants of three powerful tribes . these were the angles , saxons , and jutes . their language , `` anglo-saxon '' or old english , came from west germanic dialects . it changed into middle english from about the 11th century . old english was divided into four main dialects : west saxon , mercian , northumbrian and kentish . the anglo-saxons partially displaced the celtic tribes who had lived in the british isles before they came . they never conquered wales but anglo-saxon kings did claim overlordship from time to time . originally anglo-saxons came to britain as warriors , but others came peacefully to become farmers . it is not known how many anglo-saxons actually came to britain between the 4th and 6th century ad . many sources say large numbers of anglo-saxon settlers arrived . the effect of this is not clear . some britons would have moved west , towards wales . others might have moved onto continental europe . the language of the anglo-saxons , old english , became the language of the english kingdoms . a few celtic words were also part of the anglo-saxon language .
