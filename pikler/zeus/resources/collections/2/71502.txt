Interpreter (computing)    interpreter ( computing ) in computer science , an interpreter is a computer program that performs commands written in a computer programming language . interpreters are one of the two most important ways a program can be run , the other being compilation . the interpreter is a language processor which converts a hll ( high-level programming language ) program into machine language by `` converting and executing it line-by-line . '' if there is any error in any line , it reports it at the same time and program execution can not resume until the error is rectified . interpreter must always be present in the memory every time the program is executed as every time the program is run , it is first interpreted and then executed . for error debugging , interpreter is very much useful as it reports the error ( s ) at the same time . but once errors are removed , unnecessary usage of memory takes place as it has to be present in the memory always .
