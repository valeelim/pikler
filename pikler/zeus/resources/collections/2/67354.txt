Report of 1800     the report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by james madison . it argued for the sovereignty of the individual states under the united states constitution and against the alien and sedition acts . the virginia general assembly adopted the report in january 1800. the document primarily subtly amends arguments from the 1798 virginia resolutions . the main reason for making the report was to answer criticisms that had been leveled at the resolutions . the report was the last important explication of the constitution produced before the 1817 bonus bill veto message . the arguments made in the resolutions and the report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832 , when south carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state . madison , however , rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice . whether madison 's theory of republicanism really supported the nullification movement , and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period , are the main questions surrounding the report in the modern literature .
