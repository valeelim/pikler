Axle     an axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear . in some cases the axle may be fixed in position with a bearing or bushing sitting inside the hole in the wheel or gear to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle . in other cases the wheel or gear may be fixed to the axle , with bearings or bushings provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported . sometimes , especially on bicycles , the latter type is referred to as a spindle . axles are an important structural component of a wheeled vehicle . the axles maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body . since for most vehicles the wheels are the only part touching the ground , the axles must bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo .
