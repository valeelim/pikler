Binary fission     binary fission ( `` division in half '' ) is a kind of asexual reproduction . it is the most common form of reproduction in prokaryotes and occurs in some single-celled eukaryotes like amoeba and paramecium . in binary fission , the fully grown parent cell splits into two halves , producing two new cells . after replicating its genetic material , the cell divides into two nearly equal sized daughter cells . the genetic material is also equally split . the daughter cells are genetically identical ( unless a mutation occurs during replication ) . during binary fission , the dna molecule divides and forms two dna molecules . each molecule moves towards the opposite side of the bacterium . at the same time , the cell membrane divides to form 2 daughter cells . in the process of cell division ( in eukaryotes ) , first the division of nucleus takes place after which the division of cytoplasm ( cytokinesis ) takes place . after division , the new cells will grow and the process repeats itself again and again .
