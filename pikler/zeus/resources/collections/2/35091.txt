Kara Sea     the kara sea ( russian : ка́рское мо́ре ) is part of the arctic ocean . it lies north of siberia . the kara sea is separated from the barents sea to the west by the kara strait and novaya zemlya , and the laptev sea to the east by the severnaya zemlya . it is roughly 1,450 kilometres long and 970 kilometres wide . it has an area of around 880,000 km² and a average depth of 110 m. the kara receives a large amount of fresh water from the ob , yenisei , pyasina , and taimyra rivers , so its salinity is very variable . its main ports are novy port and dikson and it is important as a fishing ground although the sea is ice-bound for all but two months of the year . significant discoveries of petroleum and natural gas , an extension of the west siberian oil basin , have been made but have not yet been developed . there is concern about the levels of nuclear waste the former soviet union dumped in the sea which included six nuclear submarine reactors and ten nuclear reactors , and the effect this will have on the marine environment . an international atomic energy agency appraisal showed that releases are low and localised .
