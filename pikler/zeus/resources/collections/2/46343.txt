Trotskyism     trotskyism is the form of communism that is based on the ideas of leon trotsky . trotsky described himself as an `` orthodox marxist '' . this is a different way of seeing the ideas of karl marx than the way other communists like mao zedong and josif stalin saw them . the biggest difference is in trotsky 's idea that there needs to be an international `` permanent revolution '' . a permanent revolution is the idea that proletarian revolution needed to spread in countries worldwide , even where capitalism was not as advanced as only the proletarian revolution could carry out the tasks of the unfinished bourgeois revolutions in these countries . this is different to the stalinist idea of trying to preserve a single nation 's revolution from within . trotsky also supported a less authoritarian government and more democracy the largest trotskyist organizations today are the reunified fourth international , international socialist tendency , the international communist league , and the committee for a workers ' international .
