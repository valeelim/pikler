Anvil     an anvil is a hard piece of metal which is used as a workbench when making things out of iron or steel . an anvil is used by a blacksmith when he needs to hammer hot iron to bend it into the shape he wants . a blacksmith can make new shoes for horses . anvils were known in the bronze age and possibly earlier . they were used in ancient greece and ancient egypt . they are still in use today , although not nearly as much as 100 years ago when there were many more horses . anvils are extremely heavy . they are made in different sizes . the 17th century writer john bunyan was a tinker ( someone who mends pots and pans ) . he walked around the villages of bedfordshire with a small anvil and a few tools on his back . his anvil was wedge-shaped , so that he could knock it into the ground when he needed to do a repair . his anvil is now in the john bunyan museum in bedford . the anvil has sometimes been used as a percussion instrument because it makes a very loud sound when hit by the hammer . usually musicians use a metal bar mounted on a sound-box . this sounds just as good as a real anvil ( which would be very heavy to carry around ) .
