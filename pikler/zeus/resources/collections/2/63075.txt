Heat pump     a heat pump is a machine that moves heat from a cold place to a hot place . a refrigerator is a heat pump . it moves heat from the inside to the outside . this keeps the food inside cold , so it will not spoil . an air conditioner is a heat pump . it moves heat from the inside of a building to the outside . a peltier device is a heat pump . it moves heat from one side to the other by means of an electric current . some buildings are heated with heat pumps , also . in the winter , the heat pump moves heat from the outside to the inside . sometimes this works better than heating with a radiator . usually , heat flows from a hot place to a cold place , according to the second law of thermodynamics . heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself . because of this , a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat . this is sort of like pumping water uphill . most heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy . some heat pumps use heat energy , supplied by a flame or an electric heater .
