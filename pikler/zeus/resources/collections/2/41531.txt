Mosquito     a mosquito is a type of fly . it is the common name of a family of flies in the order diptera . the females are ectoparasites : they land on warm-blooded animals , pierce a capillary , and inject saliva to stop the blood coagulating . then they suck up and eat the blood . deadly microscopic parasites often live in the saliva . the males are nectar-feeders , and so are the females . however , in preparation for egg-laying the females turn to blood for its protein . usually both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar and plant juices . in many species the mouthparts of the females are adapted for piercing the skin of animal hosts and sucking their blood as ectoparasites . in many species , the female needs to get proteins from a blood meal before she can produce eggs . in many other species , she can produce more eggs after a blood meal . they lay their eggs in pools of water . the larvae move around near the surface of the water , breathing through air tubes that stick out of the water . they get their food from the water , usually eating algae and other tiny creatures . they like to wiggle around near the surface , which is why some people call them `` wigglers '' . the larvae usually enter the pupa stage within a few days or weeks of hatching , depending on the water temperature and the species .
