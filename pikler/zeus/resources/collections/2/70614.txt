QuikSCAT     the quikscat ( quick scatterometer ) is an earth-observing satellite that provides wind speed and direction information over oceans to noaa . it is a `` quick recovery '' mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the nasa scatterometer ( nscat ) that was lost in june 1997. it is in a sun-synchronous low-earth orbit . because of the 2003 failure of the adeos ii satellite that was meant to succeed the nscat , quickscat is currently the only us-owned instrument in orbit that measures surface winds over the oceans . the european space agency has its own scatterometers in orbit , such as envisat . however , because it is now running on a backup transmitter and having other problems , this satellite could fail at any moment , putting risk at weather forecasts for possibly dangerous tropical cyclones . in early june 2007 , bill proenza , director of the national hurricane center in florida , came under fire for criticizing his noaa superiors for not creating a back-up plan for replacing the capabilities provided by this satellite .
