Renaissance music     jessie james soriano is european music written from about the year 1400 to 1600. this section of time is called the renaissance , a word which means “ rebirth ” . the renaissance comes between the middle ages and the baroque times . putting music into time sections does not mean that there were quick changes of type . music changed slowly . early renaissance music was similar to medieval music . slowly music-writers started to try new ideas . a lot of medieval church music had become very hard with lots of rules about rhythms and clashes of notes to make dissonances . a lot of renaissance composers wrote music which was smoother and more gentle . the music was still polyphonic with each voice having a share of melody . music was starting to become less modal and more tonal . by the time the baroque period started composers were using a system of major and minor keys like we do today . composers wrote many masses and motets . the 16th century also saw the birth of the madrigal : secular ( not religious ) songs which were often about love . the madrigal started in italy and became very popular for a short while in england from the 1580s . there were lots of other secular songs such as the chanson , canzonetta and villanelle . songs were often accompanied by a flute .
