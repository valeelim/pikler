Cartilage     cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in many parts of the body . it can bend a bit , but resists stretching . its main function is to connect bones together . it is also found in the joints , the rib cage , the ear , the nose , the throat and between the bones of the back . another function of cartilage is to create a place on which bones can form when they are first developed . it also helps to protect the places where bones work against each other : the joints . in some fish like sharks ( chondrichthyes ) , cartilage forms the whole of the skeleton . unlike other connective tissues , cartilage does not contain blood vessels . the cells are supplied by diffusion . so , compared to other connective tissues , cartilage grows and repairs more slowly . cartilage also does not contain nerves , making the hard tissue painless if damage is caused . however , the breaking of a cartilage often results in damage to tendons and muscles , which certainly does cause pain . there are many diseases caused by defects in cartilage . one of the most common is osteoarthritis , where the cartilage wears so thin that bone rubs against bone . cartilage acts as a barrier , preventing the entry of lymphocytes or diffusion of immunoglobulins . this allows surgeons to transplant of cartilage from one person to another without fear of tissue rejection .
