Rotation     `rotation is the movement of an object in a circular motion . a two-dimensional object rotates around a `` center '' ( or `` point '' ) `` of rotation '' . a three-dimensional object rotates around a line called an `` axis '' . if the axis of rotation is within the body , the body is said to rotate upon itself , or `` spin '' â€“ which implies relative speed and perhaps free-movement with angular momentum . a circular motion about an external point ( for example the earth around the sun ) is called an `` orbit '' or more properly `` orbital revolution . '' rotation around a point in one plane can be in a clockwise direction or an anticlockwise direction . in flight dynamics , the principal rotations are known as `` pitch '' , `` roll '' and `` yaw '' . the term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch of an aircraft , particularly when starting the major climb for takeoff . the same terms are used for fish moving through water . many amusement rides provide rotation . a ferris wheel and observation wheel have a horizontal central axis , and parallel axes for each gondola , where the rotation is opposite , by gravity or mechanically .
