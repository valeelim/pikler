Fidelio     fidelio is an opera in two acts by ludwig van beethoven . it is beethoven 's only opera . the german libretto is by joseph sonnleithner based on a french story . the opera tells how leonore , disguised as a prison guard called `` fidelio '' , rescues her husband florestan from death in a political prison . `` fidelio '' is an example of a “ rescue opera ” , a type of opera which was popular at the time . the hero ( or heroine ) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover . it was written at the time of the french revolution . at this time , ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone , and this led to wars all over europe . the famous prisoners ’ chorus is a song for freedom , just like the last movement of his ninth symphony . beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it . the first time it was performed ( in 1805 ) it was a three-act opera called `` leonore '' . there were a lot of french military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised . in 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture ( now known as `` overture : leonore no . 3 '' ) . but arguments between beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances . eight years later beethoven revised his opera again . this time it was called `` fidelio '' , and it was a great success . it has remained a famous opera ever since .
