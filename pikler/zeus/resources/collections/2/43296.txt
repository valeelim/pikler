Hypsilophodon     hypsilophodon was a small , fast-running , plant-eating dinosaur . it lived 125 million years ago , was 2.3 metres long ( 7/8 feet ) , including tail , and weighed about the same as a man . it was originally thought to be a young `` iguanodon '' which could climb trees . later it was realised to be a different species , and to be a running dinosaur , not adapted for climbing . like most small dinosaurs , `` hypsilophodon '' was bipedal and ran on two legs . its entire body was built for running ; a light-weight , low , aerodynamic posture , long legs and stiff tail for balance . all this would have allowed it to travel remarkably fast for its size . `` hypsilophodon '' fed on low-growing vegetation , most likely preferring young shoots and roots in the manner of modern deer . the structure of its skull , with the teeth set far back into the jaw , strongly suggests that it had cheeks , an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food . there were twenty-eight to thirty ridged teeth in the animal 's jaw which , due to their alternate arrangement , appear to have been self-sharpening . as in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the ornithischians , the teeth were continuously replaced .
