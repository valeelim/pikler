Oyster     oysters are a family of bivalves with rough , thick shells , the ostreidae , plus some other types which are called 'oyster ' . many species are edible , and are usually served raw . they are also good when cooked . in history , they were an important food source , especially in france and britain . they used to grow in huge oyster beds , but were `` overfished '' in the 19th century . nowadays they are more expensive , so eaten less often . some of the unrelated 'oysters ' are the pearl oyster , `` pinctada '' , which is a clam , and a few mussels which look a bit like oysters when they are taken out of their shells .
