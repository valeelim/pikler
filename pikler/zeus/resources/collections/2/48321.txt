Lobster     lobsters are large crustaceans that live in the sea . they form the family of nephropidae , which is sometimes also called homaridae . lobsters are an economically important type of seafood . several different groups of crustaceans are known as lobsters . when people talk about lobsters , most of the time they mean `` clawed lobsters '' , for example the genus `` homarus '' . clawed lobsters are not closely related to squat lobsters , spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters , which have no claws ( `` chelae '' ) . the closest relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobster `` enoplometopus '' and the three groups of freshwater crayfish . smaller kinds of lobsters are sometimes called `` lobsterettes '' . lobsters are invertebrates . they have a hard exoskeleton ( outer skeleton ) , which protects them . similar to most arthropods , lobsters must shed ( or lose ) this skeleton before they can grow . this process of shedding is called `` moulting '' . when lobsters `` moult '' , they are weak and easy to attack . some lobster species ' colors change when they are moulting .
