Nicene Creed     the nicene creed , niceno-constantinopolitan creed or icon/symbol of the faith , is the most widespread or ecumenical christian statement of faith . since its original formulation it continues to be used in the roman catholic , syrian orthodox ( jacobite ) , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , assyrian , anglican , lutheran , and most other protestant churches . the following table displays side by side the earlier ( 325 ) and later ( 381 ) forms of this creed in the english translation given in schaff 's creeds of christendom , which indicates by brackets the portions of the 325 text that were omitted or moved in 381 , but uses no typographical mark to indicate what phrases , absent in the 325 text , were added in 381. the following table presents in the same way the texts of the two councils , as given in the original greek language on the web site symbolum nicaeno-constantinopolitanum - greek : there were certain problems with the nicene creed . in 529 , the so-called filioque clause was added to the creed . this clause is one of the main differences between the roman catholic church and the eastern orthodox church . the catholic church has this clause , the eastern orthodox church does not . the clause is about how godly the father is , compared to the son . where the original nicene creed reads `` we believe in the holy spirit ... who proceeds from the father '' , the altered , roman catholic version reads `` we believe in the holy spirit ... who proceeds from the father `` and the son '' '' . roman catholic christians accept this change , but eastern orthodox christians reject it . many eastern catholic churches ( eastern in liturgy but in full communion with the pope ) do not use the clause in their creed . they do think the doctrine it represents is true , though , as this is a dogma of the roman catholic faith . many protestant churches who take a position in this matter , usually accept the `` filioque '' .
