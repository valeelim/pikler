Investment     investment or investing means that an asset is bought , or that money is put into a bank to get a future interest from it . investment is total amount of money spent by a shareholder in buying shares of a company . in economic management sciences , investments means longer-term savings . it is a term used in business management , finance and economics , related to saving or deferring consumption . literally , the word means the `` action of putting something in to somewhere else '' ( perhaps originally related to a person 's garment or 'vestment ' ) . the major difference in the use of the term investment between the economics field and the finance field is that economists refer to a real investment ( such as a machine or a house ) , while financial economists refer to a financial asset , such as money that is put into a bank or the market , which may then be used to buy a real asset . advisors , who tell people how to manage their investments , might say that even when an investment is losing money because of bad times , not to give up and withdraw it . instead , wait for the situation to improve . this is a risk for each person to decide .
