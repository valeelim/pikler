Interest     interest is the cost for borrowing money or the payment for lending money . usually , this is fixed as a percentage of the amount of money borrowed ( which is called `` interest rate '' ) . if the interest charged on $ 100 is 1 percent per year then every year the borrower must pay $ 1 . if the $ 1 is not added to the amount owed then the borrower is paying simple interest . if simple interest of 1 percent is paid each year at the end of 100 years the borrower would have paid $ 100 in interest , $ 1 each year , and would still owe $ 100 . if the $ 1 is added to the $ 100 the amount owed will increase to $ 101 . 1 percent interest on $ 101 will be more than $ 1 . this is called compound interest . compound interest will cause the amount to grow each year . as the amount grows larger more is paid as interest each year and added to the total . if compound interest of 1 percent is paid on a loan of $ 100 each year the amount of interest paid will slightly increase and after 70 years the amount owed will have grown to $ 200 and the interest payment will have increased to $ 2 .
