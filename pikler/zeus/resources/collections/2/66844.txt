Finite set     in mathematics , a finite set is a set that is not infinite . a finite set has a certain number of elements . the elements of the set can be numbered like { 1 , 2 , ... , `` n '' } and `` n '' must either be a natural number or zero . an infinite set is a set with an unlimited number of elements . another definition is to say a set is finite if its cardinality ( the number of its elements ) is a natural number . a set with `` n '' elements is called an `` n '' -set . a definition that is harder to understand , but which is often used by mathematicians , is to say that a set is finite if there is no strict subset that can be put in 1-to-1 correspondence with the set itself . ( a strict subset of a set is one that is not equal to the set itself ) . for example , the set of even numbers can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers ( 2 '' n '' corresponds to `` n '' ) , but the set of even numbers is also a strict subset of the natural numbers ( there are many numbers which are not in the set of even numbers , but which are natural numbers , for example the number 1 ) . this means that the set of natural numbers is infinite .
