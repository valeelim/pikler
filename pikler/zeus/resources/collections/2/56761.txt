Green manure     typically , a green manure crop is grown for a specific period , and then plowed under and incorporated into the soil . green manures usually perform several functions , that include soil improvement and soil protection : - leguminous green manures such as clover contain nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria in root nodules that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use . - green manures increase the percentage of organic matter ( biomass ) in the soil , thereby improving water retention , aeration , and other soil characteristics . - the root systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops . - common cover crop functions of weed suppression and prevention of soil erosion and compaction are often also taken into account when selecting and using green manures . - some green manure crops , when allowed to flower , provide forage for pollinating insects . historically , the practice of green manuring can be traced back to the fallow cycle of crop rotation , which was used to allow soils to recover .
