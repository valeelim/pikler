Giuseppe Verdi     giuseppe verdi ( b. roncole near busseto , 9 or 10 october 1813 ; died milan 27 january 1901 ) was an italian composer of operas . verdi and richard wagner were the greatest composers of opera in the 19th century although they were completely different from one another . when verdi was a young man the most famous opera composers in italy were gaetano donizetti and vincenzo bellini who wrote in the bel canto tradition . this meant that their operas had beautiful tunes which were written for singers to show off their voices , even if what they sang did not suit the story . during his long life verdi changed opera so that it did not have to obey old-fashioned rules . he made the drama the most important thing and the music is there to help the drama ; that said , verdi is most remembered for the power of his music . the small village where verdi was born lies in the valley of the river po in the north of italy . it was a poor district . his father was an innkeeper who had a small farm . the young boy must have been very talented . he was given a spinet which he kept all his life . at the age of 9 he often played the organ for church services in the village when the organist was away .
