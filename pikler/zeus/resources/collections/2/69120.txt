Inequality     inequality is when one object is : - smaller than the other ( formula_1 means that `` a '' is bigger than `` b '' ) - not smaller than the other ( formula_2 means that `` a '' is not smaller than `` b '' , that is , it is either bigger , or equal to `` b '' ) - not bigger than the other ( formula_3 means that `` a '' is not bigger than `` b '' , or it is smaller or equal to `` b '' ) inequality is sometimes used to name a statement that one expression is smaller , greater , not smaller or not greater than the other . inequality in math is when two solutions or answers are compared by greater than or less than . it is when the two or yet many solutions are being compared is not of equal amount . solving an inequality means finding its solutions . when you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is true , then it is a solution . when you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is not true then , the number is not a solution to the statement . inequality is finding a solution to a given variable . it is finding a relative order of a set . inequality have many solutions but you need to find the real solutions . inequality is solving real numbers . the proper way to read inequality is from left to right , just like the other equations , but the only difference is they have different rules for every equation .
