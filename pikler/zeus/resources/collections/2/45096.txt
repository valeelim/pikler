Multi-core processor     a multi-core cpu is a computer processor which has two or more sections . each section of the chip executes instructions as if it was a separate computer . the actual processors are still on one chip . on this chip every core looks mostly like the other . they are several mostly independent cores which work together in parallel . a dual-core processor is a multi-core processor with two independent microprocessors . a quad-core processor is a multi-core processor with four independent microprocessors . as you might be able to tell from the prefix , the name of the processor is based on the number of the microprocessors on the chip . until 2005 single-core processors outnumbered multi-core processors . in the years before there were only multi-core solutions used in individual cases . in the majority of cases they enhanced the frequency . but at a frequency about 4 ghz the cpu would get too hot and take a lot of electricity . this was the point when multi-core processors became more important . therefore the demand for multi-core processors increased . in the second half of 2006 the best processors were dual-core processors . since 2006 the development has gone on , so that the new processors get four or more independent microprocessors . today , single-core processors are not used in new personal computers , but they remain popular in embedded systems .
