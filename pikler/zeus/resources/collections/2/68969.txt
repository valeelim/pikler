Cantilever     a cantilever is a figure skating move . it is considered a `` field move '' because it is not a jump , a spin , or a spiral . a cantilever is performed by a skater traveling on a deep lean across the ice , either in a spread eagle or a besti squat position . the skater then bends backwards , so their back is parallel to the ice , while remaining on the deep lean . the hands can be draped across the ice or not . this is a very dramatic move on the ice . it was invented by werner groebli , better known as `` mr. frick '' , a long-time show skater with ice follies . it was brought back and popularized by ilia klimkin of russia , who performed it a lot in competition over many years . references . - figure skating glossary
