Ground squirrel     ground squirrels are marmots . these are small rodents , squirrels which live on and in the ground . most of them live in the mountains , like the sierra nevada , or the alps . marmots make holes in the ground . they live in burrows , underground . they hibernate , that is they sleep through the winter . marmots are very social animals . they group together easily . they also like to communicate with each other , with whistles , especially when they sense danger . they vary in size and habits . most are able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for long periods . this way they watch for predators . they tend to live together more than other squirrels , and many live in colonies with complex social structures . most marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels . the alpine marmot ( `` marmota marmota '' ) is the largest living member of the sciuridae , at 53–73 cm in length and weighing 5–8 kg . many historians suggest that marmots , rather than rats , were the carriers of bubonic plague epidemics in the middle ages .
