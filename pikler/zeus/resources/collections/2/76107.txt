IEEE 802.11     ieee 802.11 is the name for a series of protocols for wireless networking . often . these are referred to as wireless lan , `` wlan '' , or wi-fi . such a protocol allows computers that have the needed radio parts to communicate with each other , without a cable . the first wi-fi standard was made in 1997. it is called ieee 802.11. it allows communication with 1-2 mbit per second . today it is outdated , and rare . later standards add a letter to the name . they are labelled ieee 802.11a to ieee 802.11g . there are plans for ones labeled h , i , j , n , p and s. they are all compatible with each other . newer standards have a bandwidth of 54 mbit/s . about 40-50 % of this is usable in real-life situations . as of 2007 , the standards most widely used are ieee 802.11g , and ieee 802.11b . data communication is either done in the 2.4 ghz band or in the 5 ghz band . the 2.4 ghz band is a general use band . microwave ovens and bluetooth are examples of other things that emit radio waves in this band . the 2.4 ghz band has the problem that there are only only very few channels that can be used at the same time , without the signals interfering . there are three usable channels there . when more than three networks operate in the same place , interference slows them . the 5 ghz band can solve some of these problems , but it introduces others . that band has 19 usable channels . overall the band is less used . however there are more regulations . most devices need to be able to choose their channel to minimize interference . some channels require that those participating can do transmitter power control . this means they adapt the strength of the signal to what is actually needed . this helps reduce the amount of interference between different networks .
