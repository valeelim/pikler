Deformation     in engineering mechanics , deformation is a change in shape that is result of a force that influences the object . it can be a result of tensile ( pulling ) forces , compressive ( pushing ) forces , shear , bending or torsion ( twisting ) . depending on the type of material , size and shape of the object , and the forces used , various types of deformation may result . this type of deformation is reversible . once the forces are no longer applied , the object returns to its original shape . as the name implies , elastic ( rubber ) has a rather large elastic deformation range . the thermoplastics and metals have moderate elastic deformation ranges while ceramics , crystals , and hard thermosetting polymers undergo almost no elastic deformation . malleable materials do not undergo elastic deformation . a phenomenon only discovered in modern times is metal fatigue , which occurs primarily in ductile metals . it was originally thought that a material deformed only within the elastic range returned completely to its original state once the forces were removed . however , faults are introduced at the molecular level with each deformation . after many deformations , cracks will begin to appear , followed soon after by a fracture , with no apparent plastic deformation in between . depending on the material , shape , and how close to the elastic limit it is deformed , failure may require thousands , millions , billions , or trillions of deformations .
