Liquid crystal display     a liquid crystal display is a special thin flat panel that can let light go through it , or can block the light . ( unlike an led it does not produce its own light ) . the panel is made up of several blocks , and each block can be in any shape . each block is filled with liquid crystals that can be made clear or solid , by changing the electric current to that block . liquid crystal displays are often abbreviated lcds . liquid crystal displays are often used in battery-powered devices , such as digital watches , because they use very little electricity . they are also used for flat screen tv 's . many lcds work well by themselves when there is other light around ( like in a lit room , or outside in daylight ) . for smartphones , computer monitor , tv 's and some other purposes , a back-light is built into the product . this is an led or cold cathode fluorescent light ( ccfl ) . the lcd uses technology called electro-optical modulation . this means it uses electricity to change how much light passes through it .
