Vacuole     a vacuole is a membrane-bound organelle . they are a kind of vesicle . vacuoles are closed sacs , made of membranes with inorganic or organic molecules inside , such as enzymes . they have no set shape or size , and the cell can change them as it wants . they are in most eukaryotic cells and do many things . they can store waste . vacuoles and their contents are considered to be distinct from the cytoplasm , and are classified as ergastic according to some people . the solution that fills the vacuole is called cell sap . what a vacuole does and how important it is depends on what kind of cell they are in . they are much more important in plant and fungus cells than in animal cells . some common jobs of a vacuole are : - keeping bad things separate from the rest of the cell - holding waste products - holding water in plant cells - keeping the internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor steady in a cell - keeping an acidic ph on the inside of a cell - holding small molecules - getting rid of things the cell does not want
