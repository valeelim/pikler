Iwasawa theory     in number theory , iwasawa theory is a galois module theory of ideal class groups , started by kenkichi iwasawa , in the 1950s , as part of the theory of cyclotomic fields . in the early 1970s , barry mazur thought about generalizations of iwasawa theory to abelian varieties . later , in the early 90s , ralph greenberg has suggested an iwasawa theory for motives . the first thing iwasawa noticed was that there are towers of fields in algebraic number theory , having galois group isomorphic with the additive group of p-adic integers . that group , usually written γ in the theory and with multiplicative notation , can be found as a subgroup of galois groups of infinite field extensions ( which are by their nature pro-finite groups ) . the group formula_1 is the inverse limit of the additive groups formula_2 , where `` p '' is the fixed prime number and formula_3 . we can express this by pontryagin duality in another way : γ is dual to the discrete group of all formula_4-power roots of unity in the complex numbers .
