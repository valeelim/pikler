Australian Antarctic Territory     the australian antarctic territory ( aat ) is the part of antarctica claimed by australia and is the largest part of antarctica claimed by any nation . the area is about 6.119.818 km² . only the staff of research stations live in the territory . victoria land was first claimed for britain on 9 january 1841 and britain claimed enderby land in 1930. in 1933 , a british imperial order transferred territory south of 60° s and between meridians 160 e and 45 e to australia . on 13 february 1954 , mawson station was set up . it was the first australian station on the continent proper . australia 's claim to sovereignty over the australian antarctic territory is recognised by the united kingdom , new zealand , france and norway . as australia is part of the antarctic treaty system , which accommodates differences of opinions over the status of antarctic territorial claims which pre-dated the 1959 antarctic treaty - effectively placing claims in abeyance - australia only exercises its sovereignty in ways that in its view are consistent with good relations under the antarctic treaty .
