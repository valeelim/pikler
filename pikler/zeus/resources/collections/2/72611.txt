Hittites     the hittites were an ancient people from anatolia who spoke an indo-european language . they established a kingdom centered at hattusa in north-central anatolia from the 18th century bc . at its peak , the hittite empire covered most of modern turkey and syria . this was under the reigns of suppiluliuma i ( ~1350–1322 ) and mursili ii ( ~1321–1295 bc ) . they had up-and-down relationships with ancient egypt to the south , and the assyrian empire in mesopotamia . they were a party to the first known peace treaty , which was made with ramesses ii of egypt by hattusili iii in 1258 bc . after 1180 bc , the empire disintegrated into several independent `` neo-hittite '' city-states , some surviving until as late as the 8th century bc . the hittite kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of suppiluliuma i ( ~1350–1322 ) . the kingdom of mitanni , wracked by civil war , was unable to withstand the hittite onslaught . suppiluliuma swiftly attacked the mitanni heartland , capturing and plundering the mitanni capital of washshuganni . he then turned west , recrossed the euphrates and captured all the syrian kingdoms which were vassals to the mitanni , including aleppo , mukish , niya , qatna , upi ( upina ) , and kadesh . other kingdoms such as ugarit and amurru ( an egyptian vassal ) voluntarily became vassal states of the hittites .
