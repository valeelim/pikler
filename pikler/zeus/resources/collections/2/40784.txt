Nucleic acid     nucleic acids are large molecules where genetic information is stored . there are two types of nucleic acids : deoxyribonucleic acid , better known as dna and ribonucleic acid , better known as rna . the nucleic acids are made of nucleotides . a nucleotide is made of a nitrogenous base , sugar with five carbon atoms and a phosphate group . nucleic acids allow organisms to transfer genetic information from one generation to the next . when a cell divides , its dna is copied and passed from one cell generation to the next generation . dna is organized into chromosomes and found within the nucleus of our cells . its function in any cell is to carry the sequence of bases which will be transcribed into rna . the function of rna is much more difficult to explain . one well-known function is for messenger rna to be translated into proteins , mainly enzymes . but there are other types of rna , and these are called non-coding rnas .
