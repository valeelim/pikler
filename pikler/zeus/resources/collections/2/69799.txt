Postmodernism     postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture , philosophy , art and many other things . the term has been used in many different ways at different times , but there are some things in common . postmodernism says that there is no real truth . it says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered . because knowledge is made by people , a person can not know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are 'believed ' instead of 'known ' . people believe that they know what the truth is , but they will think that the truth is something different later . this is the opposite of 'objectivity ' , which says that the one truth is always there and people have to discover it . since postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent , people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right . postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes , because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong . postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also , it means that they are just trying to gain power over them .
