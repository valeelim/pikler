Standard deviation     standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average ( mean ) , or expected value . a low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average . a high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out . the reported margin of error is usually two times the standard deviation and gives the range for the true poll number . the previous sentence is confusing because the reported margin of error and the true poll number lack context . scientists commonly report the standard deviation of numbers from the average number in experiments . they often decide that only differences bigger than two or three times the standard deviation are important . standard deviation is also useful in money , where the standard deviation on interest earned shows how different one person â€™ s interest earned might be from the average . many times , only a sample , or part of a group can be measured . then a number close to the standard deviation for the whole group can be found by a slightly different equation called the sample standard deviation , explained below .
