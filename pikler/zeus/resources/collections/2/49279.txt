Morality     morality is the concept of doing the right thing . morals are basic guidelines for living . many people have written about ways of choosing what the right thing is . some believe that there is an objective ( true even if you do not agree with it ) morality , often thinking it was set out by god or another similar being ; others think that morality is subjective ( that what is good or bad is a community choice ) . people can learn morals from religion , parents , friends , school , books , or from ethical traditions . people that teach or follow morals are called moralists . it can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story . it is usually one line at the end of the story ( `` the moral of this story is ... '' ) . fables are stories with a moral . the opposite of `` moral '' is `` immoral '' , meaning the wrong thing to do . `` amoral '' means something that is not related to morality , or has no morally good or bad aspect to it . it is the same as `` morally neutral '' .
