Transmission (mechanics)    transmission ( mechanics ) in mechanics , a transmission or gearbox means gears working together . the most common transmission is the transmission in a car . in a car , the engine makes the crankshaft spin . the crankshaft makes the transmission 's gears spin , which spin some more parts , which make the wheels spin . but the wheels do not spin as fast as the engine makes the crankshaft spin . that is because the gears are made to slow down the spinning . the gears also give the spinning more force ( or to be more scientifically exact , more torque ) , so the wheels can make the entire car move . most transmissions have a breather vent to let hot air escape . a transmission has some gears that change the torque more than other gears . that is why a transmission has a first gear , second gear , third gear , and sometimes more gears . there is also a reverse gear and neutral . an automatic transmission shifts between gears by itself ( except reverse gear , and a parking gear ) . a manual transmission needs the driver to decide when to shift gears . manual transmission is also called standard transmission . this is confusing because almost all cars in the u.s. have automatic transmission . in other words , `` standard '' transmission is unusual in the u.s. , not standard .
