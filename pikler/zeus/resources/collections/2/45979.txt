Logarithm     logarithms or logs are a part of mathematics . they are related to exponential functions , and are useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers . logarithms were first used in india in the 2nd century bc . the first to use logarithms in modern times was the german mathematician michael stifel ( around 1487-1567 ) . in 1544 , he wrote down the following equations : formula_1 and formula_2 this is the basis for understanding logarithms . for stifel , formula_3 and formula_4 had to be whole numbers . john napier ( 1550â€“1617 ) did not want this restriction , and wanted a range for the exponents . according to napier , logarithms express ratios : formula_5 has the same ratio to formula_6 , as formula_7 to formula_8 if the difference of their logarithms matches . mathematically : formula_9 . at first , base e was used ( even though the number had not been named yet ) . henry briggs proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms , such logarithms are very useful in astronomy . a logarithm tells what exponent ( or power ) is needed to make a certain number , so logarithms are the inverse ( opposite ) of exponentiation
