Knitting     knitting creates flexible fabric by looping thread or yarn together using two or more knitting needles or a knitting machine . flat knitting , which is usually done on two straight needles , produces a length of cloth and is used to create things like blankets , scarves , and the backs and fronts of sweaters . circular knitting , which is done on circular or double-pointed needles , produces a seamless tube and is used to create things like hats , socks , mittens , and sleeves . patterns called `` cables '' are typically used on sweaters , particularly on aran sweaters from ireland . different kinds of stitches create different patterns in knitting . for example , the stretchy ends of knitted sleeves are called `` ribbing '' . yarn for knitting can be made from any number of natural or synthetic ( man made ) fibers such as wool , cotton , silk , or acrylic . some yarns are made from a blend of several kinds of fibers . yarns come in many thicknesses or `` weights '' from fine to thick : lace , fingering , sock , sport , double-knit ( or dk ) , worsted , aran , bulky , and super-bulky . thinner yarns are generally used with smaller knitting needles , and thicker yarns are used with larger knitting needles .
