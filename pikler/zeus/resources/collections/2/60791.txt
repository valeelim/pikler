Lithosphere     the lithosphere is the solid shell of the planet `` earth '' . that means the crust , plus the part of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on long time scales . under the lithospere is the asthenosphere , the weaker , hotter , and deeper part of the upper mantle . this part can flow . the lithosphere provides a conductive lid atop the convecting mantle : it reduces heat transport through the earth . there are two types of lithosphere : 1. oceanic lithosphere , which is associated with oceanic crust and exists in the ocean basins . oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50â€“100 km thick 1. continental lithosphere , which is associated with continental crust . continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40 km to perhaps 200 km , of which about 40 km is crust . the lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates , which move gradually relative to one another . oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge . this thickening occurs by conductive cooling , which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle , and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age . oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years , but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere .
