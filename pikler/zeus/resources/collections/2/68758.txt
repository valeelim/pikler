Fluorescent lamp     a fluorescent lamp , is a type of electric light ( lamp ) that uses ultraviolet emitted by mercury vapor to excite a phosphor , which emits visible light . there are two general types , traditional fluorescent and compact fluorescent . this article is about traditional fluorescent lamps . the purchase price of a fluorescent lamp is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output , and the light from fluorescent lamps looks different to light from incandescent lamps . fluorescent lamps have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness . a fluorescent lamp can save over us $ 30 in electricity costs over the lamp â€™ s lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp . an electric current is applied to mercury vapor inside the tube , causing it to emit ultraviolet ( uv ) light . a phosphor on the walls of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light . this causes an electron to jump up to an orbital with a higher energy . when the electron drops back down to its normal orbital , the phosphor re-emits its energy as visible light .
