Binomial distribution     a binomial distribution is a method that can be used to solve a certain type of problem related to probability . in order to use the binomial distribution , the following must be true about the problem : 1. the outcomes are mutually exclusive , that is there are 2 possible outcomes which can not occur simultaneously ( example : flipping a coin , there 2 possible outcomes : heads or tails . it is always one or the other , never both or a mix of outcomes . ) 1. the probability of a success ( p ) is consistent throughout the problem . ( example : a basketball player makes 85 % of his free throws . each time the player attempts a free throw , 85 % is assumed to be the likelihood of a made shot . ) 1. the trials are independent of each other . ( example : on your second flip of a coin , the first outcome does n't impact the chances of the next toss . you still have a 50/50 chance of tossing a heads ( or tails ) . ) the binomial distribution is a probability distribution . it has discrete values . it counts the number of successes in yes/no-type experiments . there are two parameters , the number of times an experiment is done ( `` n '' ) and the probability of a success ( `` p '' ) .
