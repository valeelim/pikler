Earth's crust    earth 's crust earth 's crust is earth 's hard outer layer . it is less than 1 % of earth 's volume . the crust is made up of different types of rocks : igneous , metamorphic , and sedimentary rocks.below the crust is the mantle . the upper part of the mantle is made up of peridotite , a rock denser than rocks common in the crust . the crust and the upper mantle make up the lithosphere . the lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates that can move.the crust is of two different types . one is the continental crust ( under the land ) and the other is oceanic crust ( under the ocean ) . the continental crust is thicker , and the oceanic crust is thinner . the thickness of the crust varies from 5 to 70 kilometers . the temperature of the crust increases with depth because of geothermal energy . where the crust meets the mantle the temperatures can be between 200 째c ( 392 째f ) to 400 째c ( 752 째f ) . the crust is the coldest layer because it is exposed to the atmosphere . a single family of silicates , the feldspars , account for about half of the material in the crust ( 60 % by weight ) , and quartz is a sizeable proportion of the rest . other common minerals are mica and hornblende .
