Blessing     a blessing is way to wish good luck for a person . sometimes , in religious rituals , it is said the god blesses those who are good , or people can bless god . in judaism , they bless god over wine . the priests can also bless religious objects in order to make them become holy . the saying `` bless you '' is commonly used when someone sneezes . this is done because there is a tradition carried by the superstition that a person 's soul will come out of their mouth and nose if they sneeze . people believed that saying `` god bless you , '' or `` bless you '' for short , would make the soul go back inside . they are wishing the person good luck so that their soul is able to come back . people also think that if unusual good luck or a miracle comes to them , it is a blessing . for example , if some people wanted a child badly but are having difficulty conceiving , it could be considered a blessing from god if they end up having a child . to `` give your blessing '' to someone is to give permission to them . for example , a man can ask his girlfriend 's parents ' for their blessing before he asks her to marry him .
