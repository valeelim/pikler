Melody     a melody in music is a group of notes of various pitches ( how high or low a note sounds ) which are played one after another . together they make a tune in the same way that a group of words make a sentence . some people like to sing melodies . melodies have rhythm ( the length of the notes ) . in music , 'melody ' contrasts with 'harmony ' . harmony means notes which are played at the same time , like chords . composers often think of a melody and then add harmony to it . some music has more than one melody happening at the same time . when this happens throughout the whole piece , it is called polyphonic music . rounds and fugues are types of polyphonic music . if the other melody only happens sometimes , then the second melody is called a `` countermelody '' . the adjective of melody is `` melodic '' . there is also the adjective `` melodious '' which means : 'a sweet-sounding melody ' . music that does not have an obvious melody may be hard to understand ( unless it is focused on rhythm , such as a drum solo ) .
