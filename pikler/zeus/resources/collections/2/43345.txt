Micropachycephalosaurus     micropachycephalosaurus ( meaning 'tiny thick headed lizard ' ) is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the upper cretaceous . it was a herbivore , and lived in what is now shandong , china . it was one of the smallest dinosaur ever discovered , just over a meter long , but with the longest name . before it was discovered `` compsognathus '' was the smallest known dinosaur . the lack of the skull roof means the fossil can not be placed at family level . it might or might not be a pachycephalosaur . butler and zhao therefore classified it as an indeterminate member of the cerapoda . in 2011 , cladistic analysis showed that `` micropachycephalosaurus '' is a basal member of the ceratopsia . in this context , basal does not mean 'ancestral ' ; the fossil is far too late for that . it means simply 'unspecialized ' , or lacking derived traits . related pages . - `` wannanosaurus ''
