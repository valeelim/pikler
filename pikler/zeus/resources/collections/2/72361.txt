Etruscan origins     an etruscan origin from the near east is one of the theories scholars are considering . the other possibility is that they developed right where they are now . the known etruscan vocabulary is very limited , because we have no continuous prose , just engravings on gravestones . we do know it was different from the neighbouring italic and celtic peoples , who spoke indo-european languages . some scholars see , in urartean art , architecture , language and culture , traces of kinship to the etruscans of the italian peninsula . one or two experts have suggested the etruscan was an armenian dialect . according to isaac taylor , etruscan words have been shown from the resources of the armenian , albanian and the rhaeto-romansch indo-european languages , but that is because these languages had contact with the etruscan languages and were influenced by it . however , only the rhaeto-romansch languages were actually spoken near the etruscans , and contact between albanians and armenians and the etrscuans has n't actually been shown .
