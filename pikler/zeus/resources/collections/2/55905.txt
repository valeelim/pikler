Water turbine     a water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water . water turbines were developed in the nineteenth century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids . now they are mostly used for electric power generation . they harness a clean and renewable energy source . water wheels have been used for thousands of years for industrial power . their main shortcoming is size , which limits the flow rate and head that can be used . the migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years . development occurred during the industrial revolution , using scientific principles and methods . they also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time . the word turbine was coined by the french engineer claude bourdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the latin word for `` whirling '' or a `` vortex '' . the main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor . this additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power . they could process more water by spinning faster and could use much greater heads . ( later , impulse turbines were developed which did not use swirl ) .
