Septuagint     the septuagint ( often referred to `` lxx '' ) is a translation of the hebrew bible and other books into the greek language . it was done between the 3rd and 1st century bc in alexandria . it is the oldest of several translations of the hebrew bible into greek . the septuagint has all of the books of the old testament , and it also has books that catholics and orthodox christians call the deuterocanon . these books are called apocrypha by protestants because they do not think these books are sacred . an ancient tradition says that 70 jewish scholars were in a different room when they translated the torah from hebrew into greek , yet they all wrote down exactly the same text people thought this was a miracle . the latin language word for `` 70 '' is `` septuaginta '' , and the word `` septuagint '' comes from that . another way to write `` 70 '' is `` lxx '' which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for septuagint . the septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the bible .
