Merovingian dynasty     the merovingians were a dynasty of frankish kings who ruled in the region of ancient gaul ( more or less modern france ) , from the fifth to the eighth century . they were sometimes referred to as the `` long-haired kings '' ( latin `` reges criniti '' ) by people of the time , for their symbolically uncut hair ( traditionally the tribal leader of the franks wore his hair long , while the warriors trimmed theirs short ) . the term is drawn directly from germanic , akin to their dynasty 's old english name `` merewÄ«owing '' . the merovingian dynasty owes its name to the semi-legendary merovech ( or merowig , sometimes latinised as `` meroveus '' or `` merovius '' ) , leader of the salian franks from c.447 to 457. clovis i went on to unite most of gaul north of the loire under his control around 486 , when he defeated syagrius , the roman ruler in those parts . references . - beyerle , f and r. buchner : `` lex ribuaria '' in `` mgh '' , hannover 1954 . - eugen ewig : `` die merowinger und das frankenreich '' . stuttgart : kohlhammer , 2001 .
