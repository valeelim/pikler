Therapsid     therapsids , previously known as the mammal-like reptiles , are an order of synapsids . the clade includes the mammals , which are descended from the cynodont therapsids . the jaws of therapsids had frontal incisors for nipping , large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing , and molars for shearing and tearing , and molars for shearing and chopping food . therapsid legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of sauropsids and pelycosaurs . the therapsids were seriously affected by the p/tr extinction event . the successful gorgonopsians died out , and the remaining groups were much reduced . the dicynodonts , now represented by a single family of large stocky herbivores , the kannemeyeridae , and the medium-sized cynodonts ( including both carnivorous and herbivorous forms ) , flourished worldwide , throughout the early to middle triassic . they died out across much of pangea before the end of the upper triassic , although they continued for some time longer in the wet equatorial band and the south .
