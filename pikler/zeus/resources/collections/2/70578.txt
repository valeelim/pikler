Alkane     alkanes are chemical compounds , made of carbon and hydrogen . the simplest alkane is methane , which is made of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms . larger alkanes have two or more carbon atoms connected or bonded together in a chain . the carbon atoms of alkanes are joined together by single bonds , which is what makes them different from `` alkenes '' . the alkane 's general formula is ch . these are some alkanes : - methane ( ch ) - ethane ( ch ) - propane ( ch ) - butane ( ch ) - pentane ( ch ) - hexane ( ch ) - heptane ( ch ) - octane ( ch ) - nonane ( ch ) - decane ( ch ) - undecane ( ch ) - dodecane ( ch ) - tridecane ( ch ) - tetradecane ( ch ) - pentadecane ( ch ) - hexadecane ( ch ) - heptadecane ( ch ) - octadecane ( ch ) - nonadecane ( ch ) - icosane ( ch ) alkanes come from crude oil . crude oil is a natural resource , a thick black fluid found by drilling underground . crude oil is a mixture of alkanes of different chain length - composed of different numbers of carbon atoms . fractional distillation is the method used to separate the different hydrocarbons in crude oil , used to get a purer or more distilled , sample of a single alkane .
