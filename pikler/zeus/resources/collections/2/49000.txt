Compressive strength     compressive strength measures the pushing force that one needs to break a material . when the limit of compressive strength is reached , materials are crushed . concrete can be made to have high compressive strength e.g . many concrete floors have compressive strength of 3000 p.s.i.. related pages . - tensile strength - compression - compressive stress - deformation - strength of materials
