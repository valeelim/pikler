Apsis     in astronomy , an apsis , plural `` apsides '' ( ipa : // ) is the point of greatest or least distance of the elliptical orbit of an astronomical object from its center of attraction , which is generally the center of mass of the system . the point of closest approach is called the periapsis or pericentre and the point of farthest excursion is called the apoapsis ( greek από , `` from '' , which becomes απ before a vowel , and αφ before rough breathing ) , apocentre or apapsis ( the latter term , although etymologically more correct , is much less used ) . a straight line drawn through the periapsis and apoapsis is the `` line of apsides '' . this is the major axis of the ellipse , the line through the longest part of the ellipse . similar words are used to identify the body being orbited . the most common are perigee and apogee , referring to orbits around the earth , and perihelion and aphelion , referring to orbits around the sun ( greek ‘ ήλιος `` hēlios '' sun ) . during the apollo program , the terms pericynthion and apocynthion were used when referring to the moon .
