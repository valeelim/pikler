Human Be-In     the 'human be-in ' was an event during the afternoon and evening of january 14 , 1967. it was held in san francisco 's golden gate park . the human be-in caused the summer of love , which introduced hippie life and the word psychedelic to everyday americans , and made the haight-ashbury area of san francisco famous because it was the center of an american counterculture . the hippie movement had two main sources . one source was college students who were not happy about the way the country was headed . they did not like the way african americans were being treated in the south or the way young men were being drafted to fight in the vietnam war . the other source of the hippie movement was the 'beat generation ' ( poets and jazz hipsters ) . throughout the early 1960s , college students who were against the policies of segregation in southern united states would travel to the south . they would take part in sit-ins , register african americans to vote , demonstrate , march , and other activism . more and more people were unhappy about the vietnam war and the riots . during this time , san francisco was becoming a center for younger people who liked to experiment with drugs , and it was also a center for the music scene . from the idea of the 'sit-in ' , they got the idea to have a 'human be-in ' in early january to get people 's minds off politics and the war .
