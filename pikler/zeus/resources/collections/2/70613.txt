Trough (meteorology)    trough ( meteorology ) a trough is an elongated area of comparatively low atmospheric pressure , usually in association with weather fronts . convective cells may form in the surrounding area of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone . some tropical or subtropical areas , such as the philippines or south china are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough . in the mid-latitude westerlies , troughs and ridges often exchange with each other , especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern . for a trough in the westerlies , the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast , divergent winds and low pressure . tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents , a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds .
