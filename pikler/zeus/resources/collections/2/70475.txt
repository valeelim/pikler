Queer     the term queer is an umbrella term that describes a person who does not fit into what is considered normal by society when talking about their gender and/or sexuality . it is a word which has been reappropriated by social and political lgbt activists , and has been the word which a lot of academic studies have used to describe non-heterosexual identities . it is also used as a word which talks about someone 's sexuality or gender in a deliberately non-specific way . it is a term which is mostly used by younger lgbt people to describe themselves and is usually described as a `` fluid '' label , and many like the term in the lgbt community as it focuses on what that community has in common and not its differences . but many older lgbt people may find the term `` queer '' to be offensive due to its use as a homophobic insult . the term `` queer '' entered english in the 16th century , meaning `` strange '' or a word describing someone who is sick . the word was used a lot in the 20th century to refer to gay men , as it still does a lot today .
