Local government in England     for the purposes of local government , england is divided into as many as four levels of administrative divisions . at some levels , various legislation has created alternative types of administrative division . at the top level , england is divided into nine regions . each one containing one or more county-level areas . the regions were created in 1994 and since the 1999 euro-elections have been used as england 's european parliament constituencies . all have the same status . however london is the only region with any devolved power in the form of an elected mayor and the greater london authority . the regions also vary greatly in their areas and their populations . england is divided by the lieutenancies act 1997 into areas for the appointment of lord lieutenants , who are historically the crown 's representative in a county . although not actually defined as such , these areas have become known as ceremonial counties . these counties are sometimes used by people when describing where they live in england . however , many are not used as local government areas themselves , as many are too large or include large urban areas . they are taken into consideration though when drawing up parliamentary constituency boundaries for example .
