Cell growth     cell growth ( or interphase ) is shorthand for the idea of `` growth in cell populations '' by means of cell reproduction . it is the stage which cells are preparing for the next division , biochemical activities and reactions are taking place , however no obvious changes can be seen at this stage . until cell division , a parent cell divides to form two or more new daughter cells . phase . - first growth phase ( g1 ) - in this phase , new organelles like mitochondria or chloroplasts are made . these organelles help store and provide energy . it also has mechanism to ensure everything is ready for dna synthesis . - synthesis phase ( s ) - dna molecules are replicated . - second growth phase ( g2 ) - the cell continues to grow until to its maximum size , therefore energy stores can be increased at the same time . cell populations go through a type of exponential growth called doubling . thus , each generation of cells should be twice as numerous as the previous generation . but not all cells survive in each generation , as written by richard dawkins in 1997 .
