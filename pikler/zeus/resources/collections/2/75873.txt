Agnatha     the agnatha ( greek = 'no jaws ' ) are a superclass of vertebrates . they are jawless fish . the agnatha as a whole may be paraphyletic . this means it is a convenient holdall term , which does not follow the rules of cladistics . for example , most extinct agnathans belong to the stem group ( ancestral group ) of gnathostomes . but according to the rules , one sister group should not contain ancestors of another sister group , the living agnatha ( lampreys and hagfish ) are known as cyclostomes . recent molecular data from rrna , and from mtdna , show that these living agnathans are monophyletic . there are about 100 species . hagfish are vertebrates but do not have vertebrae . it is believed that they lost their vertebrae during their lifestyle adaptations . the lifestyle of the lamprey ( an ectoparasite on other fish ) and hagfish ( a scavenger ) means that they are not typical of the fossil groups , which were free-swimming and often armoured . classification . - agnatha : the jawless fish . cambrian to present day .
