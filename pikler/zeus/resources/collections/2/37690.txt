Space Shuttle     the space shuttle was a spacecraft which was used by the american national aeronautics and space administration , or nasa . space shuttles were used to carry astronauts and cargo into space . cargo such as satellites , parts of the international space station or scientific instruments were taken up into space by the space shuttle . it was a unique spacecraft because it could be used again and again . the space shuttle was made up of 3 parts . these were the orbiter , the external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters . the orbiter was shaped like a large airplane with wings and a tail . this allowed the space shuttle to glide and land on a runway . this allowed the reusable part of the shuttle to be very large . many spacecraft which came before the space shuttle , like the apollo used parachutes when landing , and landed on the ocean . people have said that the shuttle was very much like a pickup truck because of its usefulness . the shuttle was launched out of earth 's gravity and into space by 3 rocket engines on the back of the orbiter along with help from 2 long white solid rocket boosters ( also called srbs ) fuel for the shuttle was stored in the large , usually orange , external fuel tank ( also called et ) . before the shuttle reached orbit , the srbs were released and fell into the atlantic ocean where they were towed back to shore for reuse . the et was also released but broke up and fell into the indian ocean and was not reused .
