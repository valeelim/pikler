Part (music)    part ( music ) in music , a part is a line of music which is played by one player or group of players ( or sung by one or more singers ) . this is the usual meaning of the word “ part ” when talking about musical compositions . when a group of instruments are all playing the same notes together - like the first violins in an orchestra , they are all playing the same part . the second violins are playing another part , the violas are playing yet another part , etc . in a string quartet each of the four instruments plays a different part . a group of singers who are all singing the tune together are singing in `` unison '' . if they divide into soprano , alto , tenor and bass , they are singing in four parts . the sopranos may be singing the tune and the altos , tenors and basses are providing the harmony underneath . this is called “ 4 part harmony ” . if each of the four parts has its own share of the melody ( or its own melody ) it is polyphonic music . polyphonic music is always in several parts . sometimes music for the piano or organ may be written in a strict number of parts , e.g . a 5 part fugue for the piano could also be performed on five different instruments because there are always exactly five different lines of music ( although sometimes a part will have a rest , but this is always shown by rests in the music ) . although written on two staves for the pianist ( or three staves for an organist ) it could be written on five staves : one stave for each part .
