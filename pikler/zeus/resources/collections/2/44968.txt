Icon     an icon ( from the greek language : , `` eikon '' , `` image '' ) is an image , picture , or representation which has a religious meaning . it is a sign or a likeness that stands for a real object or person . although the word `` icon '' can be used for images of other religions , it is most often used to describe a painting on a wooden panel that has been done in the orthodox christian tradition , and may also be used for carved ivory panels and panels of silver or gold . these icons show a holy being such as jesus , mary , a saint or an angel . they also show scenes from the bible such as the crucifixion and scenes from lives of the saints . in orthodox christianity an icon is thought of as a window through which a person can get a view of god 's truth . the traditional way of making an icon was used in egypt in early christian times to make portraits of dead people to use for their funerals . like icons , these funeral portraits were done on a wooden panel and the paint was mixed with yolk of egg . from the time that christianity was made legal by constantine the great in the early 300s , artists began to use the same method for painting holy pictures .
