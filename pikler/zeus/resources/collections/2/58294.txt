Bes     bes was the ancient egyptian god of protection of pregnant women , newborn babies and the family . he was a dwarf wearing a lion 's skin . bes does not look like he is egyptian . he is like gods found in other parts of africa . to scare away demons during birth , bes would dance around the room , shaking his rattle and yelling to scare away demons that might put a curse on the child . after the child was born , bes would stay by him/her . when a baby laughed or smiled for no reason , egyptians believed that bes was somewhere in the room making funny faces . his name appears to be connected to a nubian word for `` cat '' , `` besa '' , which literally means `` protector '' . egyptians kept cats in order to attack snakes , and creatures that might ruin crop stores , such as mice , and so bes was naturally singled out as worthy of worship in egypt . images of the god were kept in homes to protect from evil and so he was shown quite differently from the other gods . normally gods were shown in profile , but instead bes appeared in portrait , and sometimes in a soldier 's tunic , so as to appear ready to launch an attack on any approaching evil .
