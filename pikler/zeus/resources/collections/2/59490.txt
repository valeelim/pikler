Soba     because noodles made out of pure buckwheat can easily fall apart when boiled , the buckwheat flour is usually mixed with binders - often wheat flour . under the japan agricultural standards regulations , the noodles must contain at least 30 % buckwheat in order to be called `` soba '' but noodles with a high buckwheat content are seen as more desirable . the raw noodles are made by making a dough out of buckwheat flour and binder . the dough is then spread out flat . after that , strands of noodles are sliced off with a special knife . the quality of noodles is highly dependent on the skill of the maker , especially for soba noodles with high buckwheat content . the raw noodles are boiled before being served hot or cold . in japan , soba noodles are served in a variety of situations . they are a popular inexpensive fast food at train stations throughout japan , they are served by exclusive and expensive specialty restaurants , and they are also made at home . markets sell dried noodles and `` men-tsuyu '' , or instant noodle broth , to make home preparation easy .
