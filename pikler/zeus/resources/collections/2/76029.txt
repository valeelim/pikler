Pelycosaur     pelycosaurs ( meaning `` basin lizards '' ) were the earliest synapsids . they were not dinosaurs or reptiles . they are an informal group , meaning all synapsids except the therapsids and their descendants . these tetrapods appeared during the pennsylvanian and went extinct at the end of the permian period . they were the dominant land animals for some 40 million years , and were almost wiped out by the p/tr extinction event . a few survived until the lower triassic to form the therapsids , a group which led to the mammals . because the term does not include their descendants , it is not used much now . pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in europe and north america , although some small , late-surviving forms are known from russia and south africa . at least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail , consisting of elongated vertebral spines : the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids . in life , this would have been covered by skin , and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device and/or a mating display .
