Aquifer     an aquifer is an underground layer where the material contains water . that can be less solid material like sand , gravel , clay or silt , but it can be rock as well as long as the rock allows water to get in ( that means that it is water-bearing ) . from such layers or groundwater can be usefully extracted using a well . the study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology . groundwater may exist in underground rivers ( e.g. , caves where water flows freely underground ) . this may occur in eroded limestone areas known as karst topography , which make up only a small percentage of earth 's area . more usual is that the pore spaces of rocks in the subsurface are simply saturated with water — like a kitchen sponge — which can be pumped out for agricultural , industrial , or municipal uses . if a rock unit of low porosity is highly fractured , it can make a good aquifer ( via fissure flow ) , if the water can get though it . porosity is important , but , `` alone '' , it does make an aquifer . the deccan traps ( a flood basaltic lava ) in west central india are good examples of rock with high porosity but low permeability , so they are poor aquifers . the ( upper cretaceous ) chalk of south east england has a reasonably high porosity , but low grain-to-grain permeability . much of its good water-yielding characteristics being due to micro-fracturing and fissuring .
