Elevation     when talking about geography the elevation of a certain point is how high it is compared to some reference point . very often , the reference point is mean sea level , the level of the ocean midway between high and low tide on an average day . most land has a positive elevation , which means it is above sea level . a few desert places are below sea level , thus have negative elevation . sometimes elevation is measured against the center of the earth . the problem there is that the earth does not really look like a ball , it is slightly squashed ( an oblate spheroid ) . this means , that while still at mean sea level ( at the equator ) , some points are father away from the center of the earth than others . that way the peak of chimborazo , a volcano in ecuador is farther away from the center of the earth than the peak of mount everest . yet , mount everest is higher above sea level . related pages . - altitude
