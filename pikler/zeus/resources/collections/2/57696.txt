Single transferable vote     single transferable vote ( stv for short ) is a type of voting system . it is used to elect more than one person . write a number `` 1 '' next to your favourite candidate , a number `` 2 '' next to your second favourite , a number `` 3 '' next to your third favourite and so on . each candidate needs a certain number of votes to be elected . this number depends on how many people are voting and on how many people are to be elected . then the number `` 1 '' votes for each candidate are counted . but it can happen that one candidate or several candidates have more than the needed number of votes . these candidates are elected . but since they have more votes than they needed , they pass on the votes which they do not need to other candidates . which candidate or candidates get those `` surplus '' votes depends on the voters ' number of `` 2 '' votes given on the ballots papers of the candidates that have already been elected . if those number `` 2 '' votes make another candidate win and give them too many votes , this new `` surplus '' is passed on again , using number `` 3 '' votes , and so on .
