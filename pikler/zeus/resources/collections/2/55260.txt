Equality (mathematics)    equality ( mathematics ) in mathematics , two things are equal if and only if they are exactly the same in every way . that is , they have the same ( mathematical ) value , and the same mathematical properties . mathematicians use the equals sign ( = ) to say this . this defines a binary relation , equality . the statement `` '' x '' = `` y '' '' means that `` x '' and `` y '' are equal . equivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an equivalence relation between two sets , that is , the two sets have exactly the same elements . the sets do not need to be finite to be equal . a statement that two expressions denote equal quantities is an equation . equations are equal . inequalities are unequal . since a predicate is a way of describing something that is true , another way to say this is that if you can find something that is true about one variable but not true about the other variable , then they are not `` equal '' , as far as mathematical logic is concerned . here is a simple way of saying that : if two things are equal , anything that is true about one of them has to be true about the other one .
