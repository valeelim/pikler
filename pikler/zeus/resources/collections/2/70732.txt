Cor anglais     the cor anglais , or english horn , is a double reed instrument in the woodwind family . it is very similar to an oboe , but as it is longer than an oboe it plays lower notes . the lowest note of an oboe is b flat ( just below middle c ) . the lowest note of a cor anglais is an e natural , a diminshed fifth ( five notes of a scale , minus a semitone ) lower than the oboe 's lowest note . the cor anglais is a transposing instrument pitched in f. this means that the music sounds a fifth lower than written . this has the advantage that the cor anglais player uses fingering as if he were playing an oboe , but it will sound a fifth lower . the bell ( the bit at the end of the instrument ) is shaped like a pear . this gives it a less nasal sound ( the sound of the cor anglais is less as if played through the nose ) . the reed is not fixed to a piece of cork like the oboe reed but it is put straight onto the short piece of metal ( called a `` bocal '' ) at the top of the instrument . the word `` cor anglais '' is a french word which literally means `` english horn '' , but the cor anglais is neither english nor a horn . no one is sure how it got its name , but many people think it is because the bocal at the top is curved ( the french word for curved , `` angl√© '' is pronounced like the word for english `` anglais '' ) .
