Sound card     a sound card ( audio card ) is the part of the computer hardware that controls the input and output of the sound signals . a sound card is what is known as an expansion card . this means that the card can be added to the motherboard . nowadays , most of the audio cards are integrated with the motherboard . that means they are built into a mainboard and can not be removed . in other words it is not an expansion card anymore . they only offer line-in , speaker , and microphone connections . for most users this is enough . when thinking of computer architecture , the integrated circuit sound cards occupy less space and thus became very popular and practical , especially for laptop computers . for more features like midi ports for connection of musical instruments and low latency requirements ( so that the sound does not come distorted under heavy system usage ) sound cards as expansion cards can be used . modern expansion sound cards use the pci computer bus standard . earlier sound cards used the isa computer bus , which was half-duplex , so the sound cards could not record and play simultaneously .
