Political correctness     political correctness ( or pc for short ) means using words or behavior which will not offend any group of people . most people think it is important for everyone to be treated equally , fairly and with dignity . some words that are unkind to some people have been used for a long time . some of these words have now been replaced by other words that are not offensive . these new words are described as politically correct . the term is often used in a mocking sense when attempts at avoiding offense are seen to go too far . this term has been used since the early 1970s . it started being used in the modern negative sense in the late 80s in america . politically correct words or terms are used to show differences between people or groups in a non-offensive way . this difference may be because of race , gender , beliefs , religion , sexual orientation , or because they have a mental or physical disability , or any difference from what is considered the norm . throughout the 20th century women fought to have the same rights as men . in pc language this is seen in changes to job titles such as `` lineman '' , `` postman '' , and `` chairman '' which now commonly go by the gender-neutral titles `` lineworker '' , `` letter carrier '' and `` chairperson '' or `` chair '' as well as with terms having broader application , such as `` humankind '' replacing `` mankind '' .
