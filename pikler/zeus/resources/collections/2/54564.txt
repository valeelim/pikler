Protozoa     protozoa are small ( but not simple ) organisms . they are single-celled heterotrophic eukaryotes , which eat bacteria and other food sources . it is an old term , and the wider term protist is generally preferred today . however , 'protozoa ' is often used for convenience , especially in junior education . it is a rather convenient hold-all term , but actually 'protozoa ' are classified in a number of different phyla . the term is problematic because modern biochemical and genetic techniques show that it includes several quite different kinds of cells . they are found only in moist or aquatic habitats . many protozoan species are symbionts , some are parasites , and some are predators of soil bacteria and algae . there are about 30,000 protozoan species . related pages . - protist - eukaryote - `` amoeba '' - `` paramecium ''
