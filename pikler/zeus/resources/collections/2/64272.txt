Mathematical notation     mathematical notation is a field of mathematics . in mathematics and other exact sciences like physics or computer science , problems often need to be presented in some way . in such representations , different symbols have different meanings : - there are numbers , like `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' , or variables that stand for such numbers ( like `` x '' and `` y '' ) - there are functions that act on numbers and variables . such function take a predetermined number of elements , and do something with them . an example is `` + '' , which adds two numbers - there are concepts of advanced mathematics such as limits and derivatives some mathematical notations use diagrams , or small drawings to show the underlying concepts . one example is the penrose graphical notation which is used to show tensors . another examples are coxeterâ€“dynkin diagram which are used for certain problems of geometry . there are different ways to write down an `` equation '' like `` two and three '' - infix notation : the functions and the symbols they act on , are mixed , this gives `` 2 + 3 ''
