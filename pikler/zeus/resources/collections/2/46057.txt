Shanty town     shanty towns are slums on the outskirts of many cities – especially in third world countries . normally there are not many shanty towns in more economically developed countries . often of low cost , with houses badly built with plywood , corrugated metal , sheets of plastic , cardboard or any available material . often irregular structures good enough to keep the rain away or to protect from the summer sun . pets and animals are often left to roam for food and water . lack of clean water , sanitation and toilets often make people , especially children , more exposed to illnesses such as hepatitis and cholera . many are built on land without a permit and often have no roads , numbered street , electricity or telephone lines . some homes in shanty towns have some services but they are unkept and pose health and fire hazards . sometimes shanty towns can take up whole parts of a city and may include millions of dwellers – such as in the cities of brazil- see favelas . many shanty town settlements are built on the banks of rivers and as a result the residents suffer the effect of floods or from industrial toxins in the water . some are built close to rubbish dumps .
