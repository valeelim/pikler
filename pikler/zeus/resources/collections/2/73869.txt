Devolution     devolution is when a central government transfers powers to a local government . it is sometimes called `` home rule '' . in the united kingdom devolution has happened in wales , scotland and northern ireland . each of these three countries now has an elected legislature which can pass some laws and a government to administer those laws and propose new ones . these bodies are called - the national assembly for wales , and the welsh government ; - the northern ireland assembly , and the northern ireland executive ; and - the scottish parliament , and the scottish government england does not currently have its own parliament , but there have been increasing calls today for one . devolved assemblies depend on the parent body . the british government could change its mind and abolish the devolved assemblies . this happened in 1972 to the government and parliament of northern ireland . it had been set up in 1920 , with the parliament of southern ireland . this is different from a federal country . in a federal country like germany the states , and their powers , exist because of the constitution , not because of the national parliament .
