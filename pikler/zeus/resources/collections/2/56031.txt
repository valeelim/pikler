Napalm     napalm is the name for a number of flammable liquids that have been used in warfare . often it is jellied gasoline . napalm is actually the thickener in such liquids . when it is mixed with gasoline , the thickener makes a sticky incendiary gel . it was developed by the u.s. in world war ii by a team of harvard chemists . the team leader was louis fieser . the name `` napalm '' has comes from the ingredients that were first used to make it : coprecipitated aluminum salts of naphthenic and palmitic acids . these were added to the flammable substance to cause it to gel . one of the major problems of early incendiary fluids ( such as those used in flamethrowers ) was that they splashed and drained too easily . the u.s. found that flamethrowers that use a gasoline gel are able to shoot farther and are more useful . gasoline gel was difficult to manufacture because it used natural rubber , which was in high demand and expensive . napalm provided a far cheaper alternative . it solved the problems involved with rubber-based incendiaries .
