Mailing list     some people or organizations have many addresses of different people . they use these addresses to send the mail . in the postal system , using regular mail , such mailing lists are used to distribute these mails , which may be wanted ( like newspapers ) or unwanted ( advertising ) . in the electronic form , these differences also exist . bulk mail ( spam ) is distributed using mailing lists . on the other hand there are echo mailing lists people subscribe to . when a subscriber sends a mail to the mailing list , this mail is distributed ( echoed ) to all people who are on the list . the software which manages such a mailing list sometimes offers options to the people who subscribe . instead of getting each mail directly , they might want only one mail ( per day ) . this mail then contains all the mails of that day . this is called a `` digest '' . mails that come from people on the list might be handled differently from mails from people who are not subscribed to the mailing list . mailing lists are a way to reach selected groups of people - by specific parameters ( or markets ) - through the post office . the population may be broken into sections organized buy their unique qualities such as `` catalog purchasers '' or `` business owners , '' or by geographic area such as businesses or residents in a particular city or zip code , or buy select statistical parameters such as businesses with over 20 employees , or heads of household with income of over $ 80,000 . direct mail lists are then sold to direct marketing companies wishing to make an offer to this specific segment of the population . by tightly specifying the parameters of the mailing list , direct mail is a very effective way to market to a precisely selected group with little wasted advertising expense .
