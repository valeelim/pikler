Stem (music)    stem ( music ) stems can refer to two things in music , relating to music notation and production . stems are the lines which extend from the notehead . stems may point up or down . different-facing stems indicate the voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff . for single-note melodies , the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher , and up for those below . if the stem points up from a notehead , the stem starts at the right-hand side of the note , but if it points down , it starts from the left . the exception to this rule is when a chord contains a second , in which case the stem runs between the two notes , the higher being placed on the left of the stem and the lower on the right . the length of a stem is usually that of an octave on the staff , going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead , depending on which way the stem is pointing . stems are the individual parts of a mix , separately saved ( usually to disc ) for the purposes of use in a remix .
