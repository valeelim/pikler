Juliusz Słowacki     juliusz slowacki ( september 3 , 1809 - april 3 , 1849 ) was a polish poet . he was born on august 23 , 1809 , according to the old calendar . september 4 is often given as his birthday but the calculation between days was wrong by one day . slowacki is thought of as being as good a poet as most of the famous polish writers . these include mickiewicz , norwid , reymont ( author of `` chlopi '' ) , wybicki , krasinski and sienkiewicz . he is buried in wawel cathedral in krakow . this is the same crypt as mickiewicz . his work included romantic poems , plays and sonnets included `` balladyna '' , `` my testament '' , `` king ghost '' , `` fantazy '' , `` kordian '' , `` beniowski '' , `` agamemnon ’ s tomb '' , `` silver dream of salomea '' , `` hymn '' , `` lilia weneda '' and `` anhelli '' . slowacki was first buried on april 5 1849 in paris 's famous montmartre cemetery . because he was not popular at the time , only about 30 people went to his funeral . in 1927 , general joseph pilsudski ordered his body be dug up . it was taken back to poland and honorably reburied on june 28 1927 in krakow in the famous wawel crypt for polish nobles . he was buried with full military honors as polish hero . pilsudski said : `` time to forget slowacki is over , as long as there is polish language , slowacki will live on forever !
