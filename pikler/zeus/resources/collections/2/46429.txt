Lord     a lord ( laird in some scottish contexts ) is a person who has power and authority . women will usually ( but not universally ) take the title 'lady ' instead of laird or lord , but there is an example of a female lord : `` lord of mann '' , the ruler of the isle of man . the territory belonging to a lord is often called a lordship . lords as a group are a peerage . the word actually comes from the old english forms for `` loaf '' ( bread ) and `` ward '' ( used to mean `` protector '' , although today it means `` one who is protected '' ) . so a `` lord '' or `` loaf ward '' was originally `` the one who protected the loaf '' . a mesne lord was a lord in the feudal system who had vassals who held land from him , but who was himself the vassal of a higher lord . the one who ruled over mesne lords was sometimes called an overlord . this higher lord was sometimes the king . in a religious context , the lord means god , mainly by the abrahamic religions ( judaism , islam , and christianity ) .
