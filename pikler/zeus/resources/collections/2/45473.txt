Punt (boat)    punt ( boat ) a punt is a flat boat with a broad front , designed for use in small rivers or other shallow water . punting means boating in a punt . the punter pushes a pole against the river bed and this gives the punt a way to move . punts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms , for shooting at birds and fishing , but in modern times they are mostly used for pleasure trips on the rivers in the university towns of oxford and cambridge in england , and are raced at summer regattas on the thames . poles for pleasure punts are normally made of spruce , or aluminium . a normal pole is about 12–16 feet ( 4–5 m ) long and weighs about 10 lb ( 5 kg ) . in oxford and cambridge 16 ft long poles are sometimes used . the bottom of the pole is fitted with a metal `` shoe '' , a rounded lump of metal to protect the end — the shoe is sometimes made in the shape of a swallow tail . other websites . clubs . - thames valley skiff club , retrieved august 2005 - sunbury regatta , retrieved july 2005 - wraysbury skiff and punting club , retrieved july 2005
