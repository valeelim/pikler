Amusement arcade     an amusement arcade or video arcade is a place where people play arcade games such as video games , pinball machines , and slot machines . the earliest amusement arcades were called `` penny arcades '' , and were opened in the nineteenth century . penny arcades had game machines called `` bagatelles '' , which were like billiards and pinball . penny arcades were once popular at amusement parks and fairs , but by the 1950s , such coin-operated amusements were generally replaced by more modern games of chance and skill such as shooting galleries . videos were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s and were most popular during the early 1980s . arcades became popular with young people . many video arcades began closing in the late 1990s , as the technology of home video game consoles began to rival and eventually exceed that of arcade games . however , video arcades remained popular in japan , where they are called game centers .
