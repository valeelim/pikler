Polyhedron     a polyhedron ( one polyhedron , many `` polyhedra '' , or `` polyhedrons '' ) is a geometrical shape . it has flat faces , and straight edges . usually it is defined by the number of faces , or edges . mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron . they do agree that there are five platonic solids . usually , polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have . the first polyhedra are the tetrahedron , which is made of four triangles , pentahedron ( five faces , can look like a four-sided pyramid ) , hexahedron ( six faces , a cube if it is regular ) , and heptahedron ( seven faces , can look like a prism based on a pentagon , or a pyramid based on a hexagon amongst others ) . other websites . - making polyhedra - polyhedra pages - stella : polyhedron navigator – software for exploring polyhedra and printing nets for their physical construction . includes uniform polyhedra , stellations , compounds , johnson solids , etc . - the uniform polyhedra - virtual reality polyhedra – the encyclopedia of polyhedra
