Minor scale     a minor scale in music theory is any scale that has at least three scale degrees : the tonic , the minor third above the tonic , and the perfect fifth above the tonic . together they make the minor triad . this includes many scales and modes such as dorian mode and the phrygian mode . in simple terms , a minor scale is a series of notes with a sad , somber character ( exaggerated when heard back-to-back with a major scale ) . a minor scale begins on the sixth note of its relative major scale , and is built with the following pattern of half steps and whole steps : i_whole_iiÂ°_half_iii_whole_iv_whole_v_half_vi_whole_vii_whole _i ( next octave ) usually , when people talk about minor scales , they mean natural minor , harmonic minor , or melodic minor scales , which are the most common in western music . the natural minor scale is the same as the 6th mode ( or aeolian mode ) of the major scale . for example , the white notes of a keyboard from one c to the next c up makes a c major scale . if the white notes are played starting from the sixth step of that c scale , ( from any a to the next a ) , then an a natural minor scale ( the `` relative minor '' of c ) is produced .
