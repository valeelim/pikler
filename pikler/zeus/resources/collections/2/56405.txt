Direct current     direct current ( dc or `` '' continuous current '' '' ) is the flow of electricity in a single direction , from the positive to the negative terminals ( potential , poles ) . the direct current always flow in the same direction , distinguishing it from the alternating current ( ac ) . direct current used to be called `` galvanic current '' . batteries are some of the main sources of direct current ( dc ) , but many other sources also exist such as bridge rectifiers in power supply , solar panels , etc . typically , the current goes through a conductor and other things that can carry dc . dc is also sent through a vacuum as in electron beams or ion beams . the first commercial electric power transmission was developed by thomas edison in the late nineteenth century using direct current . today nearly all electric power distribution uses alternating current because of the advantages with transformers and transmission . high-voltage direct current is often used for transporting electricity to places far away .
