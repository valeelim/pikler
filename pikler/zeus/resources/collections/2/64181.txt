Prion disease     a prion disease ( also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ) is a disease which is caused by prions . prions are structurally altered versions of small proteins that are normally expressed in cells . unlike diseases that are caused by a mutation of the gene resulting in the expression of a mutant protein , prions are able to replicate and transmit diseases through physical contact with the normal proteins resulting in a structural change from the normal state to the prion state . unlike bacteria , prions are not considered to be alive because they do not have their own metabolism , they do not possess genes and can not naturally reproduce outside a host cell . prion diseases are very rare , and no treatment is available for most of them . almost all of the known prion diseases are neurologic diseases . there are two common signs which are seen in typical prion diseases : - ataxia or disequilibrium , is when a patient can not stand or walk well because he can not maintain his equilibrium . this is usually because of a disease in the cerebellum .
