Electromagnetic spectrum     the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation . electromagnetic radiation can be divided into octaves — as sound waves are — adding up to eighty-one octaves . physicists have studied electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from thousands of kilometres down to fractions of the size of an atom . it is commonly said that em waves beyond these limits are uncommon , although this is not known to be true . the short wavelength limit is likely to be the planck length , and the long wavelength limit is the size of the universe itself , though in principle the spectrum is infinite . radiation of shorter wavelength than about 30 μm is commonly detected by its ability to exceed the ionization energy of atoms . radiation of longer than 3mm is commonly detected by its ability to induce electrical currents . radiation between these limits was little used until the 21st century because of the difficulty of detecting it . nearly all objects in the universe emit , reflect or transmit some light . ( black holes do not . ) the distribution of this light along the electromagnetic spectrum ( called the `` spectrum '' of the object ) is determined by the object 's composition . several types of spectra can be distinguished depending upon the nature of the radiation coming from an object .
