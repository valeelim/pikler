Sight     sight ( also called eyesight or vision ) is one of the senses . having sight means to be able to see . seeing gives animals knowledge of the world . some simple animals can only tell light from dark , but with vertebrates , the visual system is able to form images . the ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes is called visual perception . sight is the resulting perception . the components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system . light enters the animal 's eyes , and a part of the eye called the lens sends information from the light to the back part of the eye called the retina . the retina is composed of light-sensitive cells which fire a signal down the optic nerve when light hits the cell . the optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres from all over the retina . when the information from the light leaves the retina , it goes to the brain . it travels along the optic chiasma until it reaches the optic cortex at the rear of the brain . the information is then processed to find out the shapes and colours of objects . from that and from memory , it can tell of what kind the object is . for example , it can somehow tell a tree from a house . the path on which this kind of information flows is called `` ventral stream '' .
