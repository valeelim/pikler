Pie chart     a pie chart is a type of chart with the shape of a pie or circle . it presents the relationship of different parts of the data . one would easily see the biggest or smallest share of the total data , by simply looking at the pie chart . the earliest known pie charts were in william playfair 's `` statistical breviary '' of 1801 , in which two are used . this invention was not widely used at first . the french engineer charles joseph minard was one of the first to use it . in 1858 he used them in maps to add information in a third dimension . some have said that florence nightingale invented it , but they were ignorant of playfair 's creation . nightingale was one of the first to use graphics to get important statistics to the reading public . the polar area diagram is similar to a usual pie chart , except sectors are equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle . the polar area diagram is used to plot cyclic phenomena ( e.g. , count of deaths by month ) .
