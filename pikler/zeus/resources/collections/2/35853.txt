Imaginary unit     in math , imaginary units , or formula_1 , are numbers that can be represented by equations but refer to values that could not physically exist in real life . the mathematical definition of an imaginary unit is formula_2 , which has the property formula_3 . the reason formula_1 was created was to answer a polynomial equation , formula_5 , which normally has no solution as the value of x^2 would have to equal -1. though the problem is solvable , the square root of -1 could not be represented by a physical quantity of any objects in real life . it is sometimes assumed that one must create another number to show the square root of formula_1 , but that is not needed . the square root of formula_1 can be written as : formula_8 . this can be shown as : the powers of formula_1 follow a predictable pattern : this can be shown with the following pattern where `` n '' is any integer : related pages . - complex number - imaginary number - real number - euler 's identity
