Franks     the franks or the frankish peoples were one of several west germanic federations of tribes . it was formed out of germanic tribes : salians , sicambri , chamavi , tencteri , chattuarii , bructeri , usipetes , ampsivarii , chatti . most of them lived at the northern borders of the rhine . they entered the late roman empire from the north and east river bank of the rhine into modern northern belgium and southern netherlands . later invasions conquered and established a lasting kingdom in an area which eventually covered most of modern-day france , belgium , the netherlands , and the western regions of germany . when the pagan frankish king clovis became christian in the late 5th century that was an important event in the history of europe . modern scholars of the period of the migrations are in agreement that the frankish confederacy emerged at the beginning of the third century . a region in the northeast of the modern-day netherlands – north of the erstwhile roman border – still bears the name salland , and may have received that name from the salians , who formed the core of the frankish sea raiders .
