Truth value     in logic , the truth value of a logical statement says how much it is true . usually , the truth value can only be `` true '' or `` false '' . for example , `` the car is red '' is true when the car is red and false when it is not . in multi-valued logics , the truth value can be other values as well . for example , one could use a value between 0 and 1 to say how much it is true . zero would mean that it is completely false and one would mean that is completely true . when the car is orange ( and we define orange as half red , half yellow ) , the truth value could be 0.5 because the statement is half true and half false . it is also used in critical thinking .
