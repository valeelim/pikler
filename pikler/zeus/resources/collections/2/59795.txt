Question mark     the question mark is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a sentence when asking a question . the symbol is thought to come from the latin qu√¶stio , meaning `` question '' , which was shortened to qo . the uppercase q was written above the lowercase o , and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today . another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century , when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted . some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark . this is thought to come from a french practice and is called french spacing . in french a space is always put before question marks , exclamation marks , colons , and semicolons . in english , however , using this space is thought of as bad form . the `` oxford english dictionary '' does not encourage it . some english books do have these spaces , but are often a very thin space , which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read .
