Fanta     fanta is an orange soda drink . it was introduced in germany in 1940. fanta was created during world war ii in nazi germany by the german coca cola ( gmbh ) bottling company . because of the war , there was no shipping between nazi germany and the united states . therefore , the german bottling plant could no longer get coca cola syrup . the ceo of the plant , max keith , needed to do something to keep the plant going . he came up with a fruit flavored drink made from whatever he could find . using apple fiber left over from cider presses and whey , a byproduct from cheese manufacture , fanta was created and became quite popular . the original german fanta had a yellow color and a different flavor from that of fanta orange ; the exact flavor varied throughout the war , depending on what ingredients were available . the name 'fanta ' came during an employee contest to name the new beverage . keith told them to let their fantasie ( german for imagination ) run wild . on hearing that , salesman joe knipp spontaneously arrived upon the name `` fanta '' .
