Ornithischia     ornithischia is an order of beaked , herbivorous dinosaurs . they are known as the 'bird-hipped ' dinosaurs because of their hip structure . however , birds actually descended from the 'lizard-hipped ' dinosaurs , the saurischia . an alternative name for the order is the predentata , because all of them are beaked herbivorous dinosaurs . the beak is in front of the jaw-bone , the dentary , so it is a 'predentary ' . the upper half of the beak is the 'premaxilla ' on the end of the upper jaw . the beak is a key adaptation for cropping plants for their food . their original ( basal ) form of locomotion was bipedal . however , from early in their evolutionary history , they were capable of both bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion . several groups became entirely quadrupedal . the ornithischia has two sub-orders : - thyreophora : the armoured dinosaurs : ankylosaurs and stegosaurs . - cerapoda : the duck-billed and horned dinosaurs . related pages . - saurischia - fabrosauridae - heterodontosaur
