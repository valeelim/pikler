Diatom     diatoms ( greek : `` dia '' = through + `` temnein '' = to cut : `` cut through '' ) are a big group of eukaryotic algae . they are one of the most common types of phytoplankton . most diatoms are unicellular , although some form chains or simple colonies . diatom cells are encased within a unique cell wall made of silica ( sio ) . these walls , called frustules , take many forms , some quite beautiful and ornate . they usually consist of two asymmetrical sides with a split between them , which gives the group its name . diatom chloroplasts were probably derived from those of red algae . the fossil record of diatoms starts in strata of the lower jurassic , ~185 million years ago . molecular clock evidence suggests an earlier date for their origin . the entire genomes of two species of diatom have been analysed . the analysis reveals that hundreds of genes in both species came from bacteria . diatoms have some practical uses . diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions , past and present . they are commonly used in studies of water quality . they are also of interest to nanotechnology .
