Fingering     fingering means : choosing which finger to use for each note when playing a piece on a musical instrument . when learning to play a piece it is important to try to find a good fingering . once a good fingering has been found it should always be used so that the piece is always played in the same way and the fingers learn “ where to go ” . sometimes printed music has some fingering printed above the notes . this can be helpful to the player , but it is not always necessary to use the printed fingering . people ’ s hands are different and a fingering that is good for one player may not be good for another . when playing keyboard instruments the fingers are numbered from 1 to 5 on each hand : the thumb is 1 , the index finger is 2 , the middle finger is 3 , the ring finger is 4 and the little finger is 5. the fingers were not always numbered like that . in britain in the 19th century the thumb was shown by a cross ( + ) and the fingers were numbered from 1 to 4. this was known as “ english fingering ” while the other way ( from 1 to 5 ) was known as “ continental fingering ” . however , from the beginning of the 20th century the british used the normal 1 to 5 ( continental ) fingering .
