Energy efficiency     energy efficiency is using less energy to provide the same level of energy service . an example would be insulating a home to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve the same temperature . another example would be installing fluorescent lights and/or skylights instead of incandescent bulbs to attain the same level of illumination . so efficient energy use is achieved primarily by means of a more efficient technology rather than by changes in individual behaviour . energy conservation is using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service , and usually involves a change in behavior . examples would be heating a room less in winter , or driving less , or working in a less brightly lit room . as with other definitions , the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy , but both are important in environmental and economic terms . this is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels .
