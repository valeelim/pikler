Degree (angle)    degree ( angle ) in mathematics , a degree is 1/360 part of a circle . imagine a round pie . cut it through the middle in two parts . now cut the halves in two equal parts . each of the four parts has a right angle where the middle of the pie was . if each of these parts was in 90 equal slices they will all have an angle of one degree . 180 degrees would be half of the pie . 270 degrees would be three-quarters of the pie . ninety is easier to make calculations with mentally . ninety can be split into equal pieces in many different ways . one hundred can only be split in less ways : in times when people made calculations in their head a lot , they liked the numbers 360 , 90 , and 12 better than 10 and 100 for this reason . that is also why there are 24 hours in a day ( twice twelve ) , and why a troy pound is 12 ounces .
