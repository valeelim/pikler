Baltic paganism     when we say baltic paganism we actually mean many different religions and mythologies that people had in baltic countries before christianity and that some people still have . all of those religions have their own features but also between these religions many things are similar . baltic pagans just like scandinavian and finnish pagans believes that greatest god is a male god of sky and thunder . he has a hammer or axe that makes lightning . this belief is very old . we think that in stone age corded ware culture already had this kind of a god and that his weapon was a boat shaped stone axe . corded ware culture lived in a large area and many features of nordic and baltic people are derived from it .
