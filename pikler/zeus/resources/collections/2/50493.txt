Social engineering     social engineering ( also known as „social manipulation “ ) is a way to influence people with the goal to illegally obtain sensitive data ( i.e . passwords , credit card information ) . social engineers observe the personal environment of their victims and use fake identities to gain secret information or free services . in most cases social engineering is used to infiltrate third party computer systems to spy on sensitive data ; in that case social engineering is also called social hacking . an early way of social engineering first occurred in the 1980 's and was named phreaking . phreakers called phone companies and claimed to be system administrators and asked for passwords which they used to connect illegally and free of charge to the internet . a more modern form of social engineering is called phishing ( phishing is derived from “ fishing ” ) , which is an attempt to get access to internet user 's data via faked www-addresses . the most common way of phishing is fraud mailing also known as scam mailing , where the victim is being sent a fake e-mail i.e . of a bank . in most scam mails the letter includes a link that is redirecting to a fake website which is logging the login id and the appropriate password of the victim . the hackers are often using dns-spoofing to fake the sender 's e-mail address .
