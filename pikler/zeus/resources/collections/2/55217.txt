Power series     in mathematics , a power series ( in one variable ) is an infinite series of the form where `` a '' represents the coefficient of the nth term , `` c '' is a constant , and `` x '' varies around `` c '' ( for this reason one sometimes speaks of the series as being `` centered '' at `` c '' ) . this series usually appears as the taylor series of some known function ; the taylor series article contains many examples . in many situations `` c '' is equal to zero , for example when considering a maclaurin series . in those cases , the power series takes the simpler form these power series appear primarily in analysis , but also appear in combinatorics ( under the name of generating functions ) and in electrical engineering ( under the name of the z-transform ) . the familiar decimal notation for integers can also be viewed as an example of a power series , but with the argument `` x '' fixed at 10. in number theory , the concept of p-adic numbers is also closely related to that of a power series .
