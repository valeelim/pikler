Armens     armens ( armenian : արմեններ , առամեններ ) , were armenian tribes , the people are called arman , armenic or armanen . they correspond with the hayasa-azzi tribes . the armans united with the tribes of hayasi . recent linguistic studies present strong evidence that the indo-european language group originates in anatolia . according to most accounts , the armens were generally tall , blond-haired , and blue-eyed in appearance , in contrast to their urartian cousins who tended to be slighter with black hair and black eyes . the urartian state , which existed there prior to the coming of the indo-european-speaking `` armen '' tribes from the west , was a federation of many peoples . at the end of the second millennium bc , another indo-european ethnic group , closely related to thracians and phrygians and referred to by the greeks as armens , migrated to the armenian highland from northern balkans . one theory suggests that the armens were of thracian origin , and related to the phrygians . the armens were near the head waters of the halys , to the west of the euphrates . the armens seemed to have mixed blood with another asiatic element whose patronymic hai , became in time their national designation . the country where the armens settled were a mountainous region , traversed by deep valleys and smiling plains .
