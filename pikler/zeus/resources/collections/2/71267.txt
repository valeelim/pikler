Electron cloud     electron cloud is an informal term in physics . it is used to describe where electrons are when they go around the nucleus of an atom . the electron cloud model is different from the older bohr atomic model by niels bohr . bohr talked about electrons orbiting the nucleus . explaining the behavior of these electron `` orbits '' was a key issue in the development of quantum mechanics . the electron cloud model says that we can not know exactly where an electron is at any given time , but the electrons are more likely to be in specific areas . it is theoretically possible , for an electron to be a nearly infinite distance away from the atomic nucleus it is orbiting , although the probability of an electron decreases dramatically the further away from the nucleus you search . this is the most modern and accepted way to describe the situation . in the bohr model , electrons were assigned to different shells . these shells explained the repeating patterns of chemical properties in the periodic table . using quantum mechanics , chemists can use the electron cloud model to assign electrons to different atomic orbitals . these atomic orbitals are not all spheres . atomic orbitals also explain the patterns in the periodic table .
