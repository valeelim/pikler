Gradient     in vector calculus , the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field , and whose magnitude is the greatest rate of change . a generalization of the gradient , for functions which have vectorial values , is the jacobian . consider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field formula_1 , so at each point formula_2 the temperature is formula_3 . we will assume that the temperature does not change in time . then , at each point in the room , the gradient at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly . the magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction . consider a hill whose height above sea level at a point formula_4 is formula_5 . the gradient of formula_6 at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point . the steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector .
