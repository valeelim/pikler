Sine wave     a sine wave is a curve with this shape : this is a picture of a sine wave . all waves can be made by adding up sine waves . the sine wave has a pattern that repeats . the length of this repeating piece of the sine wave is called the wavelength . the wavelength can be found by measuring the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave and the next peak . the wavelength can be found in many other ways too . waves are found everywhere in the natural world . examples of waves : - sound - light - water waves - earthquake waves all of these waves are sums of signals . sine waves have a `` length '' called a wavelength . there are other properties of waves and sine waves , such as their frequency , amplitude , phase , and speed . the frequency of a sine wave is the number of oscillations a wave has in a certain period of time , for example one second .
