Schrödinger's cat    schrödinger 's cat schrödinger 's cat is a thought experiment about quantum physics . erwin schrödinger suggested it in 1935 , in reaction to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics . schrödinger wrote : in simple terms , schrödinger stated that if you place a cat and something that could kill the cat ( a radioactive atom ) in a box and sealed it , you would not know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box , so that until the box was opened , the cat was ( in a sense ) `` both '' `` dead and alive '' . this is used to represent how scientific theory works . no one knows if any scientific theory is right or wrong until said theory can be tested and proved . physics can be divided into two types ; classic physics and quantum mechanics . classic physics explains most physical interactions , like why a ball bounces when it drops . it can also be used to predict physical interactions , like what will happen when you drop a ball . however , there are some physical interactions which it does not explain ; for instance , how light can be turned into electricity . quantum mechanics provides a way for physicists to explain why these things happen .
