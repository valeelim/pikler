Viol     the viol ( rhymes with `` mile '' ) is a string instrument that is played with a bow . the viol was a popular instrument from the 15th to the 18th century . small viols are held on the lap , and the larger ones are held between the knees , which gave them the name of `` viol da gamba '' , meaning a leg viol . the bow is held with the palm of the hand facing upwards : the other way round from today 's bowhold for violins , violas or cellos . the viol is a gentle-sounding instrument . when the violin family became popular in the 17th century and people started to go to concerts in large concert halls , and to operas , the viols became less important . they were never used in orchestras . viols are made of wood , and are similar to the violin family . most viols have six strings , although this number did vary during the centuries . the strings were made of gut , and are not as tight as on a violin . the fingerboard has frets like a guitar , except that they were also made of gut . they were tied around the fingerboard , and could be moved for tuning . these frets help the player to find the exact place to put their fingers . sometimes the top of the scrolls on the fingerboard were beautifully decorated . the instruments have sloped shoulders and a flat back . the viol , like the vihuela , from which it developed , has a bridge that is flatter than the bridge of a modern violin . this makes it easier to play chords . the bow was convex in shape , where a violin bow is concave .
