Thermodynamic cycle     a thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes which returns a system to its initial state . properties depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle . variables such as heat and work are not zero over a cycle , but rather depend on the process . the first law of thermodynamics dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over any cycle . the repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation , making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics . if the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop , then it represents a heat engine , and w will be positive . if it moves counterclockwise then it represents a heat pump , and w will be negative . two primary classes of thermodynamic cycles are power cycles and heat pump cycles . power cycles are cycles which convert some heat input into a mechanical work output , while heat pump cycles transfer heat from low to high temperatures using mechanical work input .
