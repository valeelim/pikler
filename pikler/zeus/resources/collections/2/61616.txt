Frieza     frieza ( フリーザ , `` furīza '' ) is a fictional character and first major villain in the `` dragon ball '' manga and `` dragon ball z '' . frieza is one of the strongest aliens in `` dragon ball z '' . he enjoys invading other planets . frieza is a very mean person who thinks he is very strong . he has destroyed planets , without mercy . he will even kill his own servants if he wishes to . frieza is always trying to get more power . because of this , he ends up fighting the heroes of `` dragon ball z '' so he can get the dragon balls . the dragon balls are magical balls that can grant wishes to whoever collects all 7. frieza is what the creator , akira toriyama , thought monsters looked like in his childhood . frieza 's name is a pun on all things relating to the cold , with family members introduced later following his example . as his name ends in a short `` a '' vowel ( rather than the long `` ā '' which usually signifies `` er '' in kana spellings on english words ) , the character 's name is typically spelled with an `` a '' at the end ( as opposed to `` freezer '' ) . however , during funimation 's dubbing of `` dragon ball z '' , the english writers went with the spelling of `` frieza '' . this has led to some conjecture over it : u.s. released video games and the english dub use `` frieza '' , while the japanese language subtitles on funimation 's dvds and the viz translation of the manga uses `` freeza .
