( `` schutzstaffel '' means `` protection squadron '' in german . ) from 1929 to 1945 , heinrich himmler led the ss . during that time , the ss grew from a small paramilitary unit to one of the largest and most powerful organizations in nazi germany . the nazis saw the ss as a special unit , like the praetorian guard ( which used to guard roman emperors ) . to be chosen for the ss , a person had to be racially `` pure . '' this meant they had to prove that all their ancestors were `` aryan . '' they also had to be completely loyal to the nazi party . they could never ask questions or disagree with anything the ss did .
