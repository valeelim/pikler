Military engineering     a military engineer uses his skills in construction to build many different structures for warfare . these different structures can be made for either offense or defense . other jobs include building and taking apart minefields and bridges . in some cases an engineer may have to destroy something that he has built before . this may be to stop the enemy soldiers following them across the river for example . in many armies the military engineers are also called pioneers or sappers . today a military engineer that operates during battle is called a combat engineer . perhaps the first people who had a special force of military engineering specialists were the romans . roman military engineering was very good in its time . so they were able to build a double-wall of fortifications that was thirty miles long in total ( both walls together ) in just six weeks , when they wanted to a besieged city in gaul . the design , construction , and destroying of the works shown would be the task of a military engineer .
