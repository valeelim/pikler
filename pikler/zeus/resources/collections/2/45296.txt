Internet protocol suite     when computers connect and transmit data between each other on the internet , they follow a set of rules to do so . these rules are universal ; all computers throughout the internet must follow them . otherwise , the internet would not function as computers would not be able to transmit data in a meaningful and useful way . these rules are called protocols . there are many different protocols , each for different purposes , and they all together are called the internet protocol suite . the two most important protocols are the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) and the internet protocol ( ip ) , which ensure data is delivered at the right place , and without errors , and is what computers use when they access servers ( computers that have the data that is accessed on the internet ) on the world wide web , as well as for email , and the like . other protocols include the network time protocol , which ensures clock synchronisation in computers , and there are many others . the tcp/ip model and other related protocols are maintained by the internet engineering task force , whose parent organisation is the internet society , and which also cooperates closely with other standards bodies such as the w3c ( world wide web consortium ) and iso/iec .
