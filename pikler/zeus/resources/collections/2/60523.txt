Emulator     an emulator is a computer program or hardware that makes one kind of computer behave like a different one , so that it can use the same programs or do the same things as the other one . they are best for using old software and games on newer computers . they can be hardware that you add to the computer , or software that you use on it . some types of emulators require newer computers that have the right system requirements . for example , you need a processor that is fast enough to meet the demands of the emulator . memory ( both ram and hard drive space ) may be another factor to help it run smoothly and more accurately . with the more advanced emulators , if your computer is too old , the emulator or even the operating system may crash . the simplest type of emulator is called an interpreter , and it runs the foreign program one step at a time . this is the slowest type of emulator but it is easy to debug and port to new platforms . another type is called the dynamic recompiler , and it takes foreign code a block at a time and recompiles ( converts ) it into native code . foreign code that has already been converted is kept , so if the foreign program uses that code again , the emulator does not have to recompile it again . this type of emulator is much faster than the interpreter . another type is the virtualizer , which only makes slight modifications to the foreign code , and runs it directly on the host processor . the virtualizer requires that the guest ( foreign ) and host systems use the same type of cpu .
