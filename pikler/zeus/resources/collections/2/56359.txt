Power transmission     power transmission is the movement of energy from its place of generation to a place where it can be used for work . power is defined formally as units of energy per unit time . in si units : 1 watt = 1 joule/s = 1 newton * metre/second ( 1w=1j/s=1nÂ·m/s ) . since the development of technology , transmission and storage systems have been of immense interest to technologists and technology users . with widespread establishment of power grids , power transmission has came to be associated most often with electric power transmission . electrical power transmission has replaced mechanical power transmission in all but the very shortest distances . from the start of the industrial revolution until the end of the 19th century mechanical power transmission was the norm . factories were fitted with overhead driveshafts providing rotary power . drivebelts would provide power to individual machines on the shop floor . mechanical power may be transmitted directly using a solid structure such as a driveshaft ; transmission gears can adjust the amount of torque or force vs. speed in much the same way an electrical transformer adjusts voltage vs current .
