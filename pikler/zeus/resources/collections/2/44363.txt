Refraction     refraction is the change in direction of a wave , caused by the change in the wave 's speed . examples of waves include sound waves and light waves . refraction is seen most often when a wave passes from one medium to a different medium . different types of medium include air and water . when a wave passes from one medium to another medium , the wave will change its speed and its direction . for example , when a light wave travels through air and then passes through water , the wave will slow and change direction . as light travels through the refractive device , it will 'bend ' toward the normal . when it leaves the refractive device to air ( with a lower refractive index ) it will return along the same angle as when it entered the device . an example of how refraction works is placing a straw in a cup of water , with part of the straw in the water . when looking at a certain angle , the straw appears to bend at the water 's surface . this is because of the bending of light rays as they move between the air and the water .
