Cargo cult     cargo cult is a name given to several religions . there are many cargo cults in melanesia and new guinea . these religions are started when tribal societies come into contact with western civilisation . when the first contact happened , the tribespeople saw western manufactured goods , like radios . these things are called `` cargo '' . the tribespeople did not know how the manufactured goods worked nor how they were made . they made imitations of such goods , which of course did not work . they imitate the behaviour they saw the westerners do , in the hope that some spirits will send them more cargo . in other cases , such as on the island of tanna in vanuatu , cult members worship americans who brought the cargo . during the age of colonialism , the colonial powers came in contact with many simpler societies . the first cargo cults were documented in new guinea , and other countries of micronesia , melanesia and the west pacific ocean . the people who are part of the cargo cults think that the cargo was created by their deities and ancestors . they think that the cargo was made for the members of the cargo cult , but the foreigners have it . for this reason , the efforts and rituals of cargo cults are done so that the foreigners should get less of these goods and the cult members more of them .
