Hepatitis B     hepatitis b is a disease of the liver . it is caused by a virus . the virus is not spread by food or casual contact . it can be spread by blood or body fluids from an infected person . a baby can get it from its mother during childbirth . it can also be spread by sexual contact , reuse of needles , and transfusions of blood with the virus in it . infection with hepatitis b can be prevented by vaccination , where an injection is given which makes the body immune to the virus . it is recommended that all people are given a series of three vaccines over a few months when they are babies to ensure good protection against this virus . however , vaccination only provides 90 % protection , it does not completely remove the risk of infection . some people who are infected are able to beat the virus quickly . many people are infected for life . usually they have few or no symptoms . sometimes the liver is damaged severely , causing liver failure . a common symptom of liver failure is jaundice , where the person 's skin and eyes turn yellow due to a build-up of body products which would normally be filtered by the liver . another problem with hepatitis b is that it can cause cancer of the liver .
