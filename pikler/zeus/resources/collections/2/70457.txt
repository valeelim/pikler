Manatee     manatees are large , fully-aquatic marine mammals of the order sirenia . they are sometimes known as sea cows . the manatees form the genus trichechus . there are three manatee species . the name comes from the spanish `` manat√≠ '' , which itself comes from a carib word meaning `` breast '' . christopher columbus , who thought mermaids were real , went to the waters around haiti , and wrote in his logbook that he had seen three mermaids . he said that they were not as beautiful as everybody said they were . nowadays , people believe christopher columbus had actually seen three manatees . it is possible he saw them kissing one another , which is something they do when the meet each other in the water . manatees have thick pads around their lips and stiff bristles that help them grab food and move it towards the mouth . a manatee eats sea grass and all kinds of sea vegetables . all its teeth are shaped like a human 's molars . the eight hours of chewing each day wears down on their teeth . in fact , its first two pairs of teeth get so worn out that they simply fall out sometimes . however , manatees can grow new teeth . new teeth are always growing in the back . when front teeth fall out , the back teeth move forward to take their place . in mammals , only elephants and ( quite independently ) kangaroos have this kind of system .
