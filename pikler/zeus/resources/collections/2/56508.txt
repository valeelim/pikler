Anaerobic organism     an anaerobic organism is any living thing that does not need oxygen for growth . - obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen . - facultative anaerobes can use oxygen when it is present . - aerotolerant organisms can survive in the presence of oxygen , but they are anaerobic because they do not use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor . microaerophiles are organisms that may use oxygen , but only at low concentrations ( low micromolar range ) ; their growth is inhibited by normal oxygen concentrations ( approximately 200 micromolar ) . nanaerobes are organisms that can not grow in the presence of micromolar concentrations of oxygen , but can grow with and benefit from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen . obligate anaerobes may use fermentation or anaerobic respiration . in the presence of oxygen , facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration ; without oxygen some of them ferment , some use anaerobic respiration . aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative . microaerophiles carry out aerobic respiration , and some of them can also do anaerobic respiration .
