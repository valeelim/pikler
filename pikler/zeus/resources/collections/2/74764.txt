Birdwatching     birdwatching or birding means going outside to enjoy watching birds . it is a popular hobby . someone who does this is called a birdwatcher or birder . these two words mean the same thing , but people who spend a lot of their time watching birds , taking their hobby seriously , are more likely to call themselves “ birders ” , while “ birdwatchers ” may just be people who like watching birds when they happen to go for a walk . both birdwatchers and birders are usually amateurs . the scientific study of birds is called ornithology . people who study birds as a profession are called ornithologists . birdwatching ( or birding ) is very popular in countries such as britain and the united states . it can be especially awarding in spring when a lot of birds are singing and building nests to raise their young . in spring and autumn many birds can be seen as they migrate . in winter some other kinds of birds may be visiting from colder areas such as the arctic where there is no food in the winter . it is useful to have a good pair of binoculars to help to see birds that are far away more clearly . scopes or telescopes can also be used . these give much greater magnification than binoculars ( making the birds look much bigger ) , but they need to put on a tripod because they can not be held steady by hand . they are useful for looking at birds that stay in one place for some time such as ducks swimming on a lake , but no use for birds flying in the air or hopping quickly from one tree to another . some birders like to take photographs of birds . this is difficult to do well unless one has good , expensive cameras and long lenses . telescopes can be attached to cameras . this is called digiscoping .
