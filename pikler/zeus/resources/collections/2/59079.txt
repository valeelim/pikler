Logic gate     a logic gate is an electronic component that can be used to conduct electricity based on a rule . the output of the gate is the result of applying this rule to one or more `` sources '' . these sources may be two wires or the output of other logic gates . logic gates are digital components . they normally work at only two levels of voltage , a positive level and a zero level . commonly they work based on two states : `` on '' and `` off '' . in the on state , voltage is present . in the off state , the voltage is at zero . the on state usually uses a voltage in the range of 3.5 to 5 volts . this range can be lower for some uses . logic gates compare the state at their inputs to decide what the state at their output should be . a logic gate is `` on '' or active when its rules are correctly met . at this time , electricity is flowing through the gate and the voltage at its output is at the level of its on state . logic gates are electronic versions of boolean logic . truth tables will tell you what the output will be , depending on the inputs .
