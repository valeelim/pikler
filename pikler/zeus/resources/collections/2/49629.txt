Flywheel     a flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel that is attached to a rotating shaft . flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy . the momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotational speed easily . because of this , flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed . this helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often . uneven torque can change the speed of rotation . because the flywheel resists changes in speed , it decreases the effects of uneven torque . engines which use pistons to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem . it takes energy to get a wheel ( any wheel ) to rotate . if there is little friction ( good bearings ) then it will keep rotating a long time . when energy is needed , it can be taken from the wheel again . so it is a simple mechanical means of storing energy . the amount of energy stored is a function of the weight and the speed of rotation - making a heavier wheel rotate faster takes more energy . another factor is the radius ( size ) because the farther from the axis a part of the wheel is , the more energy it takes to make is rotate . these three factor can be represented by m ( mass ) , formula_1 ( angular velocity ) and r ( radius ) . combining the two equations below gives formula_1mr/4 . a fly-wheel is not just any wheel , but specifically designed to store energy . so it should be heavy and/or rotate fast . for example , some buses have a fly-wheel that is used for stopping and starting . when the bus stops ( e.g . for a traffic light ) , the fly-wheel is connected to the wheels , so the rotational energy is transferred to it , so the bus will slow down while the fly-wheel speeds up . then , when the bus has to start driving again , it is connected again and the energy is transferred back . of course , you would n't want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus , so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation .
