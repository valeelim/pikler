Shetland     shetland ( or the shetland islands ) is an archipelago , the furthest out part of scotland . the islands are between the faroe islands and the orkney islands . they are about 50 miles to the northeast of the orkney islands . they are about 100 islands in the group . people live on 16 of them . the islands form part of the boundary between the atlantic ocean to the west , and the north sea to the east . the largest islands of the group are mainland , yell , unst , fetlar , whalsay , and bressay . in general , the climate of the group is subarctic , and rather bleak . they used to be called hjaltland or zetland . today , the islands are part of scotland . the administrative centre is lerwick . the economy of the islands is largely based on agriculture . the sheep are known for their fine wool . other well-known exports are the shetland ponies and shetland sheepdog . in 1969 crude oil was discovered near the islands , leading to an alternative source of income for them . by the end of the 9th century the norsemen shifted from plundering to invasion , mainly due to the overpopulation of scandinavia in comparison to resources and arable land available there .
