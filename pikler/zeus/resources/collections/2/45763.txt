Software versioning     software versioning is a way to tell the different states , or versions , of computer software apart . a computer software has different states in its life-cycle process from development through deployment into production and sustainment . each state in the process is given a unique version and version number . versions are most often a sequence of one to four numbers ( for example , 12.2.3 ) to represent major.minor.maintenance actions , but can also use names , dates , or other sequencing mechanisms . in some practices , the numbers are used with variations like the 3rd digit being replaced by a letter ( for example , 4.1a ) . the changes are all revisions in that something is being changed and the version number tells people how complex the change is to the software . many times , after a program has been made , things called `` patches '' can be downloaded from the program 's website . the patches usually make small updates or fixes to the main program , such as fixing bugs or updating information or program functions . when a patch is used , the program is advanced to the next version , advancing the version number by the appropriate level .
