Circle of fifths     in music theory the circle of fifths shows how the different keys are related to one another . it is usually shown as a circle with the names of keys around it . if you take any key in the circle , its fifth is the one to its right . it can be easily understood together with a piano keyboard . on a piano there are white and black notes ( confusingly these are also called “ keys ” ) . the white notes are named by the letters a to g of the alphabet . after g comes another a and so on . the black notes go in threes and twos . this makes it easy to see the pattern of white notes . where there are two black notes together , for example , the white note between them is d. the black notes do not have names of their own . they are named after the white notes next to them . the black note just above ( i.e . to the right ) of a g is a g sharp . the black note just below ( i.e . to the left ) of the g is g flat . this means that each black note has two possible names ( e.g . g flat or f sharp ) . playing each note in turn , whether a white or a black note , will give a chromatic scale ( e.g . c , c sharp , d , e flat , e , f , f sharp , g , a flat , a , b flat , b , c ) . each step is called a “ semitone ” or “ half tone ” . a “ tone ” or “ whole tone ” therefore is a jump of two semitones ( c to d , or c sharp to e flat , or e to f sharp ) .
