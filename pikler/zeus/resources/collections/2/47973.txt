Kalabhra dynasty     the kalabhra dynasty ruled over entire tamil country in south indian between the 3rd and the 6th century c.e.. they won over the ancient chola , pandya and chera dynasties and replaced them . there is little information about their origin and details about their reign . they did not leave any monuments . the only source of information on them are to be found in buddhist and jain literature . they were displaced around the 7th century by the revival of pallava and pandya power . hindu scholars and authors who wrote in the 7th and 8th century c.e . when pandya and pallava had taken over again have written very little about the kalabhra in their texts . perhaps therefore the period of their rule is known as a ‘ dark age ’ – an interregnum .
