Array data structure     in programming languages , an array is a way of storing several items ( such as integers ) . these items must have the same type ( only integers , only strings , ... ) because an array can not store different kinds of items . every item in an array has a number so the programmer can get the item by using that number . this number is called the `` index '' . in some programming languages , the first item has index 0 , the second item has index 1 and so on . but in other languages , the first item has index 1 ( and then 2 , 3 , ... ) . when the programmer creates an array , they must give the size of the array . this is the number of items that can be stored in the array . if the programmer wants to store more items , then they must create a new array . this is because the size of an array can not be changed . in the programming language c , arrays can be created like this : this creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers . the programmer can now store integers in the array by doing : the programmer can use a value in the array like this :
