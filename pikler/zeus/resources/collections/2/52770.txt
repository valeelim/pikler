Electrophysiology     electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues . it involves measurements of voltage change or electrical current flow on a wide variety of scales from single ion channel proteins , to whole tissues like the heart . in neuroscience , it includes measurements of the electrical activity of neurons , and particularly action potential activity . classical electrophysiology involves placing electrodes into various preparations of biologic tissue . the principle types of electrodes are : 1 ) simple solid conductors , such as discs and needles ( singles or arrays ) , 2 ) tracings on a printed circuit boards , and 3 ) hollow tubes filled with an electrolyte , such as glass pippettes . the principal preparations include 1 ) living organisms , 2 ) excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , 3 ) dissociated cells from excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , 4 ) artificially grown cells or tissues , or 5 ) hybrids of the above . if an electrode is small enough in diameter ( on the order of microns ) , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell .
