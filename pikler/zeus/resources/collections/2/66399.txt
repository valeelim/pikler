British overseas territories     a british overseas territory is one of fourteen territories which the united kingdom considers to be under its sovereignty , but not as part of the united kingdom itself . before 1981 the territories were known as colonies or `` crown colonies '' . the british overseas territories are also referred to as overseas territories of the united kingdom , uk overseas territories , or when the context is clear , simply the overseas territories . the territories of jersey , guernsey and the isle of man , though also under the sovereignty of the british crown , have a slightly different constitutional relationship with the united kingdom , and are consequently classed as crown dependencies rather than overseas territories . territories and dependencies are distinct from the commonwealth of nations , a voluntary association of former british colonies . in a historical context , colonies should be distinguished from protectorates and protected states , which though under british control , were nominally independent states , whereas colonies were part of the british state . they should also not be confused with dominions , which , known collectively as the `` commonwealth '' , were independent states , held to be equal in sovereign status to the united kingdom within the empire and commonwealth after the statute of westminster in 1931. crown colonies , such as hong kong , were differentiated from other colonies in being administered directly by the crown , without the degree of local autonomy found in self-governed colonies such as bermuda .
