Trans-Siberian railway     the trans-siberian railway or trans-siberian railroad is a set of railways that goes from moscow and european russia to the russian far east provinces , mongolia , china and the sea of japan . because russia is such a big country , travel from one end and the other is an important problem . in the 1890s , the russians began building the longest railway in the world to connect moscow to the pacific ocean . before the railway was built , the trip took about a year along very rough roads . one reason for building the `` trans-sib '' was military : to transport troops to the east in order to protect the country against japan and china . another reason was to transport food from the farming areas of south-western siberia to the people in the european part of russia . many cities and industries are built up along the route of the trans-siberian railway .
