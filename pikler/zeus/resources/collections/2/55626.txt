Full communion     full communion is a term used in christian ecclesiology to describe relations between two distinct christian communities or churches that recognise that each other shares the same communion and the same essential doctrines . that does not mean that there would be no differences at all between them . the meaning of full communion is different in , on the one hand , catholic and eastern orthodox christian theology , and , on the other hand , in the theology of other western christians . - the roman catholic church ( which follows the so-called latin rite ) is in full communion with the chaldean catholic church , for example . the chaldean catholic church follows the east syrian tradition . in other words : both churches celebrate mass differently , but they agree completely on all ideas . - the roman catholic church is in partial communion with the protestant churches . there are many things both churches agree on ; but in some things they are different ; as an example : a catholic priest can forgive sins ; a protestant priest can not .
