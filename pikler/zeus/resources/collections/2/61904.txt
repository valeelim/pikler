Caldera     a caldera is a volcanic feature formed by the collapse of land surface after a gigantic volcanic eruption . in such an eruption the volcano 's magma chamber is empty enough for the ground above it to drop . a caldera may look like a volcanic crater except that a crater is made by blasting outward , not by collapsing inward . the word `` caldera '' comes from the portuguese language , meaning `` cauldron '' . when yellowstone caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago , it released about 1,000 km of material , covering much of north america in debris up to two metres thick . by comparison , when mount st. helens erupted in 1980 , it released 1000 times less material . the ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the lake toba eruption in indonesia . about 75,000 years ago , this indonesian volcano released about 2,800 < /sup > km of ejecta . this was the largest known eruption within the quaternary period ( last 1.8 million years ) , and the largest known explosive eruption within the last 25 million years . in the late 1990s , anthropologist stanley ambrose suggested that a volcanic winter induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about 2,000 20,000 , resulting in a population bottleneck . others suggested that the human race was reduced to about five to ten thousand people .
