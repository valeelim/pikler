Ion thruster     an ion thruster is a kind of spacecraft engine . it works by using static electricity or magnetism to push ions ( electrically charged atoms ) out the back of the spacecraft . it takes a very long time to speed up , but its fuel lasts much longer than a rocket engine . it has to be carried into outer space by a regular rocket , because the ions do n't push hard enough for it to escape the earth 's gravity , but after it gets to outer space it can travel a very long way . an ion thruster needs electricity to run , so the spacecraft has to also carry solar panels or a nuclear reactor . the nasa space probe called dawn used an ion thruster to get to the asteroid vesta , and is now using it to go to the dwarf planet ceres .
