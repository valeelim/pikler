Flurbereinigung     flurbereinigung ( pronounce : flooer-be-rye-nee-gung ) is a word used in germany to refer to the rearranging of fields in agriculture . during the second half of the 20th century , flurbereinigung led to major changes in the landscape in the german countryside . many german farmers used to have several small fields which were not together but were in different places , some of them maybe two or three miles away from where they lived . this was particularly a problem in the area to the left of the rhine which had been ruled by napoleon , because in the 19th century , when a farmer and his wife had died , their land was shared between all their children , so it got divided into smaller pieces . in other parts of germany only the eldest son inherited the land . since the 1960s , people understood that it would be much easier for a farmer to have all his fields together so that he did not have to keep making journeys between lots of small fields . larger fields are easier to manage and more economical . the german government encouraged farmers to swap some of their fields among themselves so that each farmer had his land all in one place .
