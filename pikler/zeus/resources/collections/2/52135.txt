Intergenerational contract     an intergenerational contract is an agreement between different generations . it assumes that future generations will honor the contract and provide a service to a generation that has done the same service for an older generation . the most common use of the term is in social security and refers to the consensus to provide pensions for the retired generations through payments made by the working generations . the use of the word `` contract '' is not entirely accurate as the next generation enters the agreement without consent .
