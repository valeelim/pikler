Exclusive disjunction     exclusive disjunction ( also called exclusive or , xor ) is a logic operation on two values . it will be true , if exactly one of the two values is true . otherwise it will be false . this also means that the result of 'xor ' will be true only if both the values are different . same values will result in a false . the best way to remember a xor operation is : `` one or the other , but not both '' . this is different from inclusive disjunction . the truth table of formula_1 ( also written as formula_2 , or formula_3 ) is as follows :
