Touchscreen     a touchscreen or touch screen is a computer screen that can be used by touching it with a finger or a stylus pen , instead of using a mouse and keyboard . touchscreens are used in personal digital assistants ( pdas ) , tablet computers , smartphones and other devices . some touchscreens are capable of pressure-sensitive input , in which thicker lines are made on the screen when the user pushes harder down on the . interactive whiteboards , which can be found in many schools , use a simple form of touch technology . in 1965 , e.a johnson of england â€™ s royal radar establishment , invented the first touchscreen that was used in the u.k for air traffic control up until around 1995. the first resistive touch screen was invented by g. samuel hurst in 1975 , and produced in 1982. back in 1970 , hurst and nine friends discovered that a touchscreen on a computer monitor made for an excellent method of interaction . pressure on the cover sheet allowed voltage to flow between the x wires and the y wires , which could be measured to indicate coordinates . this discovery helped found what we today refer to as resistive touch technology ( because it responds purely to pressure rather than electrical conductivity , working with both a stylus and a finger ) .
