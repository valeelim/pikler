Ecozone     an ecozone or biogeographic realm is the largest scale biogeographic division of the earth 's surface . these divisions are based on the historic and evolutionary distribution of plants and animals . ecozones represent large areas of the earth 's surface where plants and animals developed in relative isolation over long periods of time , and are separated from one another by geologic features , such as oceans , broad deserts , or high mountain ranges , that formed barriers to plant and animal migration . ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of mammal zoology . ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the plants and animals they contain . as such , they are distinct from biomes , also known as major habitat types , which are divisions of the earth 's surface based on `` life form '' , or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic , soil , and other conditions . biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation , regardless of the evolutionary lineage of the specific plants and animals . each ecozone may include a number of different biomes . a tropical forest in central america , for example , may be similar to one in new guinea in its vegetation type , but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories .
