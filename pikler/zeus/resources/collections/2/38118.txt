Pollination     pollination is part of sexual reproduction in plants . it describes how the pollen grains get to the female parts of a plant . pollen grains , which contain the male gametes , need to get to where the female gamete ( s ) are . what happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals . each pollen grain is haploid : it has half of the dna ( genetic information ) that is needed to make a new plant . during fertilization this combines with the dna that is in the egg of the female part and a zygote is formed . in seed plants a seed is started . in flowering plants , pollen has to get from one flower to another . there are two main ways that this can happen : by non-living things like wind or water , or by living things such as insects or birds . - maize and the wind maize ( called corn in some parts of the world ) is pollinated by wind . the male anthers let go of their pollen and it blows over to a nearby female flower on another corn plant . most of the flowers are either male or female on a corn plant ( monoecious ) , rather than both sexes in one flower ( hermaphrodite ) .
