Silicate     in chemistry , a silicate is a chemical compound consisting of one or more central silicon atoms that are surrounded by electronegative anions . the most common silicate species consist of silicon with oxygen as the anion . silicate anions , with a negative net electrical charge , must have that charge balanced by other cations to make an electrically neutral compound . in geology and planetary science , the term silicate is used to denote types of rock that consist predominantly of silicate minerals . on earth , a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that form and re-work the crust . these processes include partial melting , crystallization , fractionation , metamorphism , weathering and diagenesis . living things also contribute to the silicate cycle near the earth 's surface . a type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons , known as tests , from silica . the tests of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment
