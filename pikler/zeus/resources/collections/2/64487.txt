Muslim occasions     muslim occasions mainly celebrate events of the life of the muslim prophet , muhammad . eid ul-fitr begins the day after ramadan is over and lasts three days . as soon as the sun sets from the last day of ramadan , eid ul-fitr starts and the muslims feast . muslims also say a special prayer called the eid prayer and food and drink are passed around in mosques . eid al-adha means `` the feast of sacrifice '' and is to celebrate when a prophet called abraham had to sacrifice his son to show that he was loyal to god . at the last moment , god said to abraham that this was simply a test , and he did not have to sacrifice his son to him . muslims in this holiday sacrifice a goat or cow in his honour to show their gratitude for god saving abraham 's son 's life . the meat of the sacrificed animal is split up into three portions . one for the man who sacrificed the animal , one for the man 's poor relatives and one for poor people in general , whatever their race or religion is . muslims believe that on any friday , at the end of the week , a good deed is worth more than if you did that same good deed on a different day . muslims go to the mosque to pray on that day , for they believe that it was on this day that adam was created . they reject the idea that god rested after creating the world ( `` and on the seventh day , god rested '' , genesis 2:2 ) and so this day should not be related to a sabbath .
