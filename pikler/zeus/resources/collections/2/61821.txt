Observation     observation is an activity of an intelligent living being ( e.g . human ) , which senses and assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon in its framework of previous knowledge and ideas . observation is more than the bare act of observing : to perform observation , a being must observe and seek to add to its knowledge . observations that come from self-defining instruments are often unreliable . such observations are hard to reproduce because they may vary even with respect to the same stimuli . thus they are not of much use in exact sciences like physics which require instruments which do not define themselves . it is thus often necessary to use various engineered instruments like : spectrometers , oscilloscopes , cameras , telescopes , interferometers , tape recorders , thermometers etc . and tools like clocks , scale that help in improving the , quality and utility of the information obtained from an observation . the accuracy and tremendous success of science is primarily attributed to the accuracy and objectivity ( i.e . repeatability ) of observation of the reality that science explores .
