Lady beetle     lady beetles are the coccinellidae , a family of beetles . all species are protected by noxious fluids based on cyanide , and most have warning colouration , such as red with black spots . they are often called 'lady bugs ' or 'ladybirds ' , but biologists prefer the term 'coccinellid ' or 'lady beetle ' . coccinellids are found worldwide , with over 5,000 species . most species are insectvorous , feeding mainly on the `` true bugs '' , the hemiptera . these are insects which feed on plants , such as aphids ( greenfly ) or scale insects . ladybeetle larvae are also voracious ( greedy ) eaters of greenfly . `` harmonia axyridis '' ( or harlequin ladybug ) was introduced into north america from asia in 1988 to control aphids . it is now the most common species there , out-competing many of the native species . it has since spread to much of western europe , reaching the uk in 2004. coccinellids are often brightly coloured to warn potential predators . this phenomenon is called aposematism . it works because predators learn by experience to associate certain prey phenotypes ( appearance ) with a bad taste ( or worse ) .
