Data mining     data mining is a term from computer science . sometimes it is also called knowledge discovery in databases ( kdd ) . data mining is about finding new information in a lot of data . the information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful . in many cases , data is stored so it can be used later . the data is saved with a goal . for example , a store wants to save what has been bought . they want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves , to have enough to sell later . saving this information , makes a lot of data . the data is usually saved in a database . the reason why data is saved is called the first use . later , the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use . the store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store . ( many people who buy pasta also buy mushrooms for example . ) that kind of information is in the data , and is useful , but was not the reason why the data was saved . this information is new and can be useful . it is a second use for the same data .
