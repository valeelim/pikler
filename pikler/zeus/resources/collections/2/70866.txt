Triton (moon)    triton ( moon ) triton , or neptune i , is the largest moon of the planet neptune . it is the seventh largest moon in the solar system . triton is slightly smaller than earth 's moon . triton has a complicated geological history and it is thought to have a comparatively young surface compared to the age of the solar system itself . it was discovered by the british astronomer william lassell on 10 october 1846 , just 17 days after neptune itself was discovered by the german astronomer johann gottfried galle and heinrich louis d'arrest . triton is believed to be a captured kuiper belt object , and is the coldest known body in the solar system . the surface temperature of triton was recorded by voyager 2 as -235 °c ( -391 °f ) . triton has its own magnetic field and has a faint trace of an atmosphere . drag and tidal interaction cause triton to fall into a lower orbit . this process is immensely slow . 3.6 billion years from now , triton will pass within neptune 's roche limit . it will either collide with neptune 's atmosphere or break up , forming a ring system similar to that found around saturn .
