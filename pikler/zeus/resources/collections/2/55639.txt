Communion (Christian)    communion ( christian ) the term communion comes from latin `` communio '' ( sharing in common ) . the corresponding term in greek is κοινωνία , which is often translated as `` fellowship '' . in christianity , the basic meaning of the term `` communion '' is an especially close relationship of christians , as individuals or as a church , with god and with other christians . but the term is also used of a group of christian churches that have this close relationship of communion with each other . an example is the anglican communion . if the relationship between the churches is complete , involving fulness of `` those bonds of communion - faith , sacraments and pastoral governance - that permit the faithful to receive the life of grace within the church '' , it is called full communion . but the term `` full communion '' is often used as well in that sense that these christian churches are not united , but have only an arrangement where members of each church have certain rights within the other . if a church recognizes that another church , with which it lacks bonds of pastoral governance , shares with it some of the beliefs and essential practices of christianity , it may speak of `` partial communion '' between it and the other church .
