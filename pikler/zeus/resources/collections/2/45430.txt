Flux Of Pink Indians     flux of pink indians was political punk band . it was formed in hertfordshire , england in 1980. flux of pink indians was made up of colin latter ( vocals ) , derek birkett ( bass ) , kevin hunter ( guitar ) and martin wilson ( drums ) . the band was originally called the epileptics and later changed their name to epi-x after complaints from the british epilepsy association . in 1981 , the group signed on with the crass label . they took on the organization 's dedication to anarchist politics and punk abrasion . they issued their debut album `` neu smell '' soon after signing . with that album they got an indie hit with `` johnny kidd '' . upon creating their own label , spiderleg , flux of pink indians resurfaced in 1982 with the album `` strive to survive causing least suffering possible '' . not surprisingly , their 1983 follow-up `` the fucking cunts treat us like pricks '' was banned by many british retailers . one manchester indie record store which did carry the record was charged for displaying `` obscene articles for publication for gain . '' a long time off followed before the group - now known as flux - returned in 1986 with the largely instrumental `` uncarved block '' . they disbanded in 1987 ; derek birkett later the one little indian label .
