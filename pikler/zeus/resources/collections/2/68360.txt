Electrical generator     a generator usually means a machine that makes electrical energy . it has a generator head with wires , spinning inside a magnetic field . the resulting electromagnetic induction makes electricity flow through the wires . hybrid electric vehicles carry a generator powerful enough to make them go . the biggest generators do n't go anywhere ; they stay in power stations . different things can be used to make the generator head spin . some small ones are cranked by someone 's arms or legs . bigger ones are connected to an engine . the biggest ones use a steam turbine or hydroelectric water power . some use wind power . whatever makes it turn , the generator converts this energy into electrical energy . some portable generators have an internal combustion engine . they are harmful when used indoors because they make carbon monoxide . simple generators have : - a rotor , which is the moving part of the generator - an axle - a magnet - brushes some kinds have : - a commutator , which is a switch that reverses the current
