Bowing     bowing means : taking a bow . a bow is when a person bends their body forward from the waist in order to greet someone or show respect for them . a bow is sometimes not much more than a quick nod of the head , but it can be a very deep bow from the waist . the exact way to bow and the situations in which people bow vary enormously between different cultures . bowing was originally a gesture ( a movement of the body ) which showed deep respect for someone . in european cultures bowing to someone is now only done in very formal situations , e.g . when meeting the queen or someone very high and important . in european history bowing was common at royal courts . men were expected to `` bow and scrape '' . this meant bowing and at the same time drawing back the right leg so that it scraped the floor . the man would hold his left hand over his waist while doing this . this is why we still talk about `` bowing and scraping '' meaning that someone is trying very hard and hypocritically to be unnecessarily polite . this kind of deep bow , which is never used nowadays , is sometimes called a “ reverence ” ( a word meaning : “ deep respect ” ) .
