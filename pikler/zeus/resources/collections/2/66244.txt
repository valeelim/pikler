Provinces of the Netherlands     the modern day european netherlands are divided into twelve provinces ( `` provincies '' in dutch ) . the caribbean netherlands and other countries within the kingdom of the netherlands are completely separate . the twelve provinces are listed below with their capital city : a dutch province is the administrative layer in between the national government and the local municipalities . it has the responsibility for matters of regional importance . the government of each province is made of three major parts : the `` provinciale staten '' which is the provincial parliament elected every four years . elected from its members are the `` gedeputeerde staten '' , a college charged with most executive tasks . this college is presided by the `` commissaris van de koningin '' or royal commissioner , appointed by the crown . almost all dutch provinces came from a medieval state , like a county or duchy . this is the same with the regions of belgium . their status changed once they came under the influence of a ruler . this single ruler then centralised their administration . they then became provinces of a larger state . in total there are 17 provinces today . from these unified netherlands , seven northern provinces formed the republic of the seven united provinces in the 16th century . these were holland , zeeland , gelderland , utrecht , friesland , overijssel and groningen . the republic 's lands also included drenthe ( one of the 17 , but without the autonomous status of the others ) , and parts of brabant , limburg and flanders , which were considered to be `` conquered lands '' and were governed directly by the `` staten-generaal '' , the parliament . from this came their name generality lands . they were called `` staats-brabant '' , `` staats-limburg '' and `` staats-vlaanderen '' , meaning `` of the state '' . each of these `` netherlands '' had a high degree of autonomy . they co-operated with each other mainly on defense and on the international level in general . they kept to their own affairs elsewhere .
