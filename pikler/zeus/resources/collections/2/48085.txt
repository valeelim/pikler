Mutton     the terms lamb , mutton or hoggett are used to describe the meat of a domestic sheep . the meat of a sheep a year old or younger is generally known as `` lamb '' , whereas the meat of an older sheep is either `` hoggett '' or `` mutton '' depending on its age and characteristics . in some countries all such meat is referred to as `` lamb '' . all of these are known as sheepmeats . the meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old , with a weight of between 5.5 and 30 kilograms . this meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and is often eaten more often in some western countries , most often on easter . hoggett and mutton can taste more flavorful than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids ; many therefore prefer the stronger flavour of older animals .
