ß     the letter ß ( also known as sharp s , german : `` esszett '' or `` scharfes s '' ) is a letter in the german alphabet . it is the only german letter that is not part of the basic latin alphabet . the letter is pronounced ( like the `` s '' in `` see '' ) . the ß character is not used in any other languages . the letter `` ß '' in today 's form was created around 1900. it has two origins , one in blackletter and one in roman type . the letter came from the long s ( ſ ) and the normal 's ' which when handwritten , over time , joined together to form a single glyph . the `` ß '' is only used in the german language . it appears only in the middle or at the end of german words . there is no uppercase `` ß '' . instead of lowercase `` ß '' one can also write `` ss '' . in uppercase it is replaced with `` ss '' . however , not every `` ss '' can be written as `` ß '' . the german language often puts two or more words together to make a longer word . if the new word has two s 's together they can not be written as ß. for example , voßstraße is two words joined together ( voß and straße ) . it can also be written as vossstraße but never as vosßtraße because `` sstraße '' ( or ßtraße ) is not a word , and the ß is in the word `` voss '' ( voß ) .
