Bladder     the bladder is an organ in the human body . it is the part of our urination . all the liquids that are drunk go through the bladder . the bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work . the bladder works with the kidneys . the kidneys clean the liquid we drink . this goes on util the bladder is too full to hold any more . at this point , it is roughly the size of a softball . the bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied . once this message is received to the brain , the muscles around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract . at the same time the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass .
