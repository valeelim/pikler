Doughnut     a doughnut ( spelled donut in american english ) is a type of deep fried dessert food made out of dough or batter . ring doughnuts are made by joining the ends of a long , thin piece of dough into a ring or by using a doughnut cutter , which perfectly cuts the outside and inside shape , leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole from dough removed from the center . this smaller piece of dough can be cooked or re-added to the batch to make more doughnuts . a disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and molded into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole . or , a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough ( batter ) into the deep fryer . doughnuts can be made from a yeast-based dough for more puffy doughnuts or a special type of cake batter . yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25 % oil by weight , whereas cake doughnuts ' oil content is around 20 % , but they have extra fat in the batter before frying . cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at about 190 째c to 198 째c , turning once . yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry , about 150 seconds , at 182 째c to 190 째c . cake doughnuts normally weigh between 24 g and 28 g , whereas yeast-raised doughnuts normally are 38 g and are mostly larger when finished . some types of cake doughnuts are also baked , as opposed to fried , which greatly reduces the fat content .
