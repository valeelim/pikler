Thermal efficiency     the thermal efficiency ( formula_1 ) is a dimensionless performance measure of a thermal device such as an internal combustion engine , a boiler , or a furnace , for example . the input , formula_2 , to the device is heat , or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed . the desired output is mechanical work , formula_3 , or heat , formula_4 , or possibly both . because the input heat normally has a real financial cost , a memorable , generic definition of thermal efficiency is formula_5 from the first and second law of thermodynamics , the output can not exceed what is input , so formula_6 when expressed as a percentage , the thermal efficiency must be between 0 % and 100 % . due to inefficiencies such as friction , heat loss , and other factors , thermal efficiencies are typically much less than 100 % . for example , a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 % thermal efficiency , and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 36 % . in a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60 % .
