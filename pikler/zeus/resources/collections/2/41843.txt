Life cycle     life cycle means the stages a living thing goes through during its life . in some cases the process is slow , and the changes are gradual . humans have various steps during their lives , such as zygote , embryo , child and adult . the change from child to adult is slow and continuous . in many societies it is marked by ceremonies at puberty . in most insects the transition is sharp and well-defined : egg > larva > pupa > imago ( adult ) . in some animals , the parent generation looks different from the child . the most common case is that there are two different forms . one form will have sexual reproduction , the others might not reproduce , or might reproduce asexually . parasites are organisms that benefit from harming other organisms . the organism they profit from is usually called host . many parasites have complex life cycles , where they need different hosts for different stages of their development . as an example , the cycle egg > snail host > mammal host is common for parasites of herbivorous mammals . malaria is caused by single-celled parasites . these parasites go through two stages in their development . one stage is in the blood of mosquitoes , the other in the blood of humans .
