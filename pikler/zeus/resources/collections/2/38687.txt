Four Noble Truths     the four noble truths are a buddhist teaching . they show buddhists why they should follow the middle way . the first noble truth is called `` dukkha '' , which means `` suffering '' . it says that life is full of suffering . to say it a different way , in life , there is sickness , poverty ( being poor ) , old age , and death . people can not keep what they want . people can not avoid what they do not want . if that is all a person learns , they suffer . the second noble truth is `` samudaya '' , which says that there is a reason for the suffering in the world . it says that the reason there is suffering is that people want things . it also says that the reason there is suffering is that people change what they think is real . they do this because they are ignorant . people do wrong actions because they want things and because they do not see what is real . those evil actions lead to suffering . the third noble truth is `` nirodha '' . it says that people can be free from suffering when they no longer want things .
