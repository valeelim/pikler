Transparency     in optics , transparency is the property of allowing light to pass through something . an object that is transparent can be seen through . that is , what is on the other side of the object can be seen through it . the image you can see through a transparent object is similar to the image you can see without it . it may be changed if the transparent object behaves like a lens . this could change the size or shape of the image . the opposite of transparency is opacity . if some light can be seen through an object but some of the detail of the image is lost , it is a translucent material . light passes through a translucent object , but you can not see objects behind it . the light passes through but the material scatters the light , so you can not see the object , only its shadow . examples of translucent materials are frosted glass , paper , and some types of amber .
