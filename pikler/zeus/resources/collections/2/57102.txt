Oath     an oath ( from anglo-saxon `` ฤรฐ '' ) is a promise . an oath is spoken out loud in front of other people who can see and hear what is done and said . they are witnesses to the oath . a person who can not speak can make a sign that they are `` taking an oath '' . another way of saying that a person is `` taking an oath '' is to say that they are `` swearing an oath '' . a person can say `` i promise that i will do this ... '' or `` i swear that i will do this ... '' when a person swears an oath they often show that the oath is very important to them by calling god to see and remember the promise , and to show that the promise is true , and can not be taken back later . when a person takes an oath they sometimes raise their right hand , or put their hand on their heart , on the bible or on another holy book . oaths are used in many situations when a person needs to be true to what they say : - a person often swears an oath when they get married that they will love , care for and be true to their partner . - a person is often asked to take an `` oath '' that they will tell the truth in court .
