Trans-Asian Railway     the trans-asian railway ( tar ) is a project to build a freight railway across europe and asia . the tar is a project of the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific ( unescap ) . the project was started in the 1950s . the idea then was to have 8750 miles ( 14,000km ) of rail link between singapore and istanbul , turkey . further connections to europe and africa were also considered . at that time , there was not as much shipping and air travel as today , and the project promised to make shipping times faster and lower costs between europe and asia . progress in developing the tar was slowed by political and economic problems during the 1960s , 1970s and early 1980s . by the 1990s , the end of the cold war , and normal relations between some countries , made it seem more possible to create a rail network across the asian continent . the tar was seen as a way to handle the huge increases in international trade between eurasian nations . it was also supposed to make more movement of goods between countries easier . it was seen as a way to improve the economies of landlocked countries like laos , afghanistan , mongolia , and the central asian republics , and make them easier to reach .
