Law of large numbers     the law of large numbers ( lln ) is a theorem from statistics . consider some process in which random outcomes occur . for example , a random variable is repeatedly observed . then the average of the observed values will be stable , in the long run . this means that in the long run , the average of the observed values will get ever closer to the expected value . when rolling dice , the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 are possible outcomes . they are all equally likely . the population mean ( or `` expected value '' ) of the outcomes is : the following graph shows the results of an experiment of rolls of a die . in this experiment it can be seen that the average of die rolls varies wildly at first . as predicted by the lln , the average stabilizes around the expected value of 3.5 as the number of observations become large . jakob bernoulli first described the lln . he says it was so simple that even the stupidest man instinctively knows it is true . despite this , it took him over 20 years to develop a good mathematical proof . once he had found it , he published the proof in `` ars conjectandi '' ( the art of conjecturing ) in 1713. he named this his `` golden theorem '' . it became generally known as `` bernoulli 's theorem '' ( not to be confused with the law in physics with the same name . ) in 1835 , s.d . poisson further described it under the name `` la loi des grands nombres '' ( the law of large numbers ) . thereafter , it was known under both names , but the `` law of large numbers '' is most frequently used .
