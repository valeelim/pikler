Metallic bond     metallic bonding is the force of attraction between valence electrons and the metal atoms . it is the sharing of many detached electrons between many positive ions , where the electrons act as a `` glue '' giving the substance a definite structure . it is unlike covalent or ionic bonding . the electrons and the positive ions in the metal have a strong attractive force between them . therefore , metals often have high melting or boiling points . the principle is similar to that of ionic bonds . the metallic bond causes many of the traits of metals , such as strength , malleability , ductility , luster , conduction of heat and electricity . because the electrons move freely , the metal has some electrical conductivity . it allows the energy to pass quickly through the electrons , generating an electric current . metals conduct heat for the same reason : the free electrons can transfer the energy at a faster rate than other substances with electrons that are fixed into position . there also are few non-metals which conduct electricity : graphite ( because , like metals , it has free electrons ) , and ionic compounds that are molten or dissolved in water , which have free moving ions .
