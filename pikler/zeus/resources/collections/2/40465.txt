Modest Mussorgsky     modest petrovitch mussorgsky ( born karevo , pskov district , 21 march 1839 ; died st petersburg , 28 march 1881 ) was a russian composer . mussorgsky is famous for his operas and songs . he discovered new ways of writing for the voice which were very tuneful but which also suited the russian language . his most famous opera is `` boris godunov '' . he wrote an overture called `` night on a bare mountain '' . another very famous piece is called `` pictures at an exhibition '' . he wrote it for the piano , but many years after his death another composer called maurice ravel orchestrated it and this is the version people usually hear today . some of his works were re-orchestrated and `` improved '' by the composer nikolai rimsky-korsakov . in recent years people have started to think that what mussorgsky wrote originally was better . mussorgsky was born in toropets , 250 miles south of saint petersburg . his family were very rich and owned a lot of land and servants ( known as “ serfs ” in russia ) . he probably got to know the serfs well . later , in his operas , we can see that he had a lot of sympathy for the ordinary , poor people . when mussorgsky was six he started to have piano lessons from his mother . he learned very quickly , and when he was nine he performed a concerto by john field and works by franz liszt for the family . when he was 10 he and his brother went to a private school : st peter ’ s school . when he was 12 he composed a polka . his father paid for it to be published .
