Pan (mythology)    pan ( mythology ) pan was the ancient greek god of pastures , flocks , the mountain wilds and rustic music . in rome , he was called faunus . had the body of a satyr ( legs of a goat and body of a human ) . he was also known to produce an earsplitting sound called a `` panic '' that caused extreme pain to any who heard it , this sound is actually the origin of the english word panic . he was the lord of the wild and as such , all forest dwelling creatures answer to him , including ( but not exclusively ) satyrs , nymphs , and forest creatures . pan was commonly believed to be dead , as a passing sailor heard a call as he passed an island proclaiming `` tell them the great lord pan is dead . '' the sailor spread the news , leading to the belief that he is dead , however some still believe that he lives on today , slowly dying as the wilds of the world are destroyed . other websites . - the story of pan and daphnis - original resources on faunus/phaunos - original resources on pan - pan mythology
