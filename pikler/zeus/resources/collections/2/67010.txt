Plant stem     a stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant . the stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes , the nodes hold leaves , flowers , cones , axillary buds , or other stems etc . the other main structural axis of plants is the root . in most plants , stems are above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems called stolons or rhizomes . stems have four main functions which are : - support for leaves , flowers and fruits . the stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits . - transport of fluids between the roots and the upper parts in the xylem and phloem . - storage of nutrients . - the production of new living tissue . stems have tissue called the meristem which contains dividing cells . this produces new living tissue . the normal life span of plant cells is one to three years . much of the longer-lasting tissue in trees consists of cells which are no longer living . bark and xylem vessels are examples of this .
