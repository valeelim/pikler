Australian time zones     mainland australia has three official time zones . the full names of the time zones are usually shortened by dropping the `` australian '' . most australian external territories are in different time zones . many parts of australia have daylight saving time . the three official standard time zones were set up in february 1895. originally south australia was nine hours ahead of greenwich mean time ( gmt ) but in may 1899 they added another thirty minutes to that . some people have disliked having this non-whole number of hours difference . in 1986 and 1994 they tried to take the thirty minutes away again or add another thirty minutes but they failed . when the australian capital territory separated from new south wales they kept using eastern standard time . when the northern territory separated from south australia they kept using central standard time . there have been some other changes . - broken hill in far-western new south wales uses central standard time . - lord howe island sets its clocks 10:30 ahead of gmt .
