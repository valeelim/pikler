Snowmobile     a snowmobile is a motorized vehicle used for travelling over snow . it is like a car , only instead of wheels , it has treads . some snowmobiles have skis in the front for steering . adding snowmobile studs to the tread decreases the time and distance it takes to stop a snowmobile . once you make a decision to stop a snowmobile , the distance it will take to stop will be a combination of the speed of the machine , weight of the machine and the available friction and or the mechanical damping ( which will equal the effective drag factor ) between the snowmobile and the surface on which it is trying to stop . if the surface is icy or hard-packed , the mechanical damping portion of the effective drag factor is decreased , leaving you with only the friction provided by the tread to stop . snowmobile studs made from steel or stainless steel with carbide tips are installed in the tread . the studs are designed for specific terrains in varying lengths , shapes and materials . the studs control acceleration , deceleration and maneuverability . the correct amount and type of stud installed in an effective pattern will produce the best traction results .
