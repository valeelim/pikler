Sodium hydroxide     sodium hydroxide is an alkali which is also known as caustic soda . caustic means `` burning '' and caustic soda takes its name from the way it can burn the skin . it has the chemical formula of naoh . it is a base , meaning it has a high ph . it is the most common thing used to raise the ph of solutions ; for example , to neutralize an acid . as a solid , the alkali is deliquescent and readily absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide from the air . it dissolves easily in water , and makes the water warm when this happens . sodium hydroxide is used as a solution called lye to make soap . lye is also used to unclog drains . its dissolving properties and its ability to easily break surface tension are fundamental for its uses . it works in two ways . first , it combines with grease to make soap . second , it dissolves hair ( which is soluble in any basic solution ) . sodium hydroxide can be made ( with chlorine and hydrogen ) using the chloralkali process . a solution of sodium chloride is electrolyzed and sodium hydroxide is made around the cathode , where water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ion . the hydrogen is released and the hydroxide bonds with the sodium to make sodium hydroxide . special care is required to prepare a solution of sodium hydroxide or naoh in water because considerable heat is liberated by the exothermic reaction . the solution may splatter or boil .
