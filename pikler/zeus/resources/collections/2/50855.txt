Ecosystem valuation     ecosystem valuation is a widely used tool to find out the impact of human activities on an environmental system . it is done by giving an economic value to an ecosystem or its ecosystem services . the simplest form of ecosystem valuation is that one looks at an ecosystem as if its ecological yield had the same value as it would be on commodity markets . that means one looks at the value of water , wood , fish or game , that is produced in that ecosystem . thus , a price can be put on the natural capital of an ecosystem based on the price of natural resources it yields each year . more complex arguments in ecosystem valuation regard nature 's services and the assignment of values in a service economy to all that nature does `` for humans '' . studies compiled by robert costanza in the 1990s argued strongly that even just considering the most basic seventeen of these services , the combined value of the ecosystems of the earth was worth more ( us $ 33t ) each year than the whole human exchange economy ( us $ 25t ) at that time ( 1995 ) . other studies have focused on the marginal value of ecosystem changes , which can be used in cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies .
