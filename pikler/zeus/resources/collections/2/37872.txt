Boron     boron is a chemical element . it has the chemical symbol b. it has the atomic number 5. it is a metalloid ( it has properties of a metal and a non-metal ) . much boron is found in chemical compounds in its ore borax . boron is never found free in nature . two types of boron are found ( allotropes ) . amorphous boron is a brown powder and metallic ( crystalline ) boron is black and hard and a weak conductor at room temperature . pure boron is used as a dopant ( a substance added to semiconductors to change how it behaves with electricity ) in the semiconductor industry . chemical compounds of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much , as nontoxic insecticides and preservatives , and for chemical synthesis . plants need boron in them to live . very small amounts of boron are needed in animal 's bodies so that they are very healthy . how it keeps animals healthy is not known in a lot of detail . boron was discovered by sir humphry davy , an english chemist , in 1808. boron melts at 2075 째c ( 3767 째f ) , and boils at 4000 째c ( 7232 째f ) .
