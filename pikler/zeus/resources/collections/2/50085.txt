Coprime     in mathematics , two integers ( `` a '' and `` b '' ) are co-prime ( or relatively prime ) if they share no common factors . in other words , there is no number , other than 1 , that divides both a and b evenly . the highest common factor ( hcf ) of these numbers should be 1 as an example , 6 and 35 are coprime , because the factors of 6 , 2 and 3 , do not divide 35 evenly . 6 and 27 are not coprime , because 3 divides both 6 and 27. another example is 4 and 5 : 4 = 2*2*1 ; 5 = 5*1 ( prime ) . the only common factor is 1 , so they are co-prime . likewise 10 and 5 : 10 = 5*2 properties of co-prime . 1. prime numbers are always co-prime to each other . 1. any two consecutive integers are always co-prime . 1. sum of any two coprime numbers is always coprime to their product . 1 . 1 is trivially coprime with all numbers . 1. if out of two numbers , any one number is a prime number while other number is not a multiple of first one , then both are coprime . 1. this is not applicable to negative numbers if the hcf of 2 numbers is 1 then they are co prime .
