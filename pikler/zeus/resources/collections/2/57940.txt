Clovis I     clovis i ( variously spelled chlodowech or chlodwig , giving modern french `` louis '' and modern german `` ludwig '' ) ( c. 466 â€“ november 27 511 ) was the first king of the franks who united that nation . he succeeded his father childeric i in 481 as king of the salian franks , one of two main groups of frankish tribes , they were occupying the area west of the lower rhine at that time , with their centre around tournai and cambrai along the modern frontier between france and belgium . clovis conquered the neighbouring frankish tribes and established himself as sole king before his death . clovis converted to catholicism , as opposed to the arian christianity that was common among germanic peoples , because his wife , the burgundian clotilde , was a catholic . he was baptized in the cathedral of reims . this act was very important in the following history of france and western europe in general , because he expanded his reign over almost all of the old roman province of gaul ( roughly modern france ) . he is considered to be the founder both of france ( which his state closely resembled geographically at his death ) and the merovingian dynasty , which ruled the franks for the next two centuries .
