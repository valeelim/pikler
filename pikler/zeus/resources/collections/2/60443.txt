Archetype     in psychology , an archetype is a model of a person , personality , or behavior . in the analysis of personality , the term `` archetype '' is often broadly used to refer to 1. a stereotype—personality type observed multiple times , especially an oversimplification of such a type ; or 1. an epitome—personality type exemplified , especially the `` greatest '' such example . but in a strict linguistic sense , an archetype is merely a defining `` example '' of a personality type . in this sense `` mother figure '' can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities . archetypes have been present in mythology and literature for hundreds of years . the use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by carl jung early in the 20th century . the value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype , and thus the motivations , behind the character 's behavior .
