Mechanics     mechanics is a branch of physics which looks at objects that are moved by forces ( including other bodies , or forces of nature ) . the discipline has its roots in ancient greece where aristotle studied the way bodies behaved when they were thrown through the air ( e.g . a stone ) . however it was galileo , kepler and especially newton who laid the foundations for much of the so-called `` newtonian mechanics '' we know today . a person working in the discipline is known as a mechanician . mechanics is the original discipline of physics , dealing with the macroscopic world that humans perceive . it is therefore a huge body of knowledge about the natural world . mechanics encompasses the movement of all matter in the universe under the four forces : gravity , the strong and weak interactions , and the electromagnetic interaction . mechanics also constitutes a central part of technology . some aspects of classical mechanics . - astrodynamics , spacecraft navigation , orbital eccentricity , etc . - solid mechanics , elasticity , the properties of ( semi- ) rigid bodies
