Escopetarra     an escopetarra is a guitar made from a rifle ; it is used as a symbol of peace . the name is a combination of the spanish words `` escopeta '' ( meaning shotgun/rifle ) and `` guitarra '' ( meaning guitar ) . `` escopetarras '' were invented in 2003 by a colombian peace activist named césar lópez . at a gathering after the el nogal club bombing in bogotá , he noticed a soldier holding a gun like a guitar and got the idea for it . the first `` escopetarra '' in 2003 was made from a winchester rifle and a stratocaster electric guitar . lópez made five `` escopetarras '' , four of which were given to colombian musician juanes , argentine musician fito páez , the united nations development program , and the city government of bogotá , while one was kept for himself . juanes later sold his `` escopetarra '' for us $ 17,000 at a beverly hills fundraiser held to help victims of anti-personnel mines , while the `` escopetarra '' given to the un was exhibited at the june 2006 of the un conference on disarmament . in 2006 , lópez got 12 more decommissioned ak-47s from colombia 's peace commissioner 's office . after they are turned into guitars , he plans to give them to popular musicians such as shakira , carlos santana , and paul mccartney , as well as political figures such as the dalai lama . however , a member of the dalai lama 's staff rejected lópez ' offer , saying it is not appropriate to give a weapon as a gift ; lópez has said he will try to explain his purpose more clearly .
