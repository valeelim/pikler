Weber-Fechner law     the weberâ€“fechner law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel . in one of his classic experiments , weber gradually increased the weight that a blindfolded man was holding and asked him to respond when he first felt the increase . weber found that the response was proportional to a relative increase in the weight . that is to say , if the weight is 1 kg , an increase of a few grams will not be noticed . rather , when the mass is increased by a certain factor , an increase in weight is perceived . if the mass is doubled , the threshold is also doubled . the relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic . this logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression ( i.e . multiplied by a fixed factor ) , the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression ( i.e . in additive constant amounts ) . for example , if a stimulus is tripled in strength ( i.e. , 3 x 1 ) , the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value ( i.e. , 1 + 1 ) . if the stimulus is again tripled in strength ( i.e. , 3 x 3 x 1 ) , the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value ( i.e. , 1 + 1 + 1 ) . hence , for multiplications in stimulus strength , the strength of perception only adds .
