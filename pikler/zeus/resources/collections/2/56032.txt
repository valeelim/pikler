Midwestern United States     the midwestern united states ( or midwest ) is a name for the north-central states of the united states of america . the states that are part of the midwest are : illinois , indiana , iowa , kansas , michigan , minnesota , missouri , nebraska , north dakota , ohio , south dakota , and wisconsin . the word `` midwest '' has been in common use since the late 19th century . other names for the area are no longer used . these names include the `` northwest '' or `` old northwest '' , `` mid-america , '' or `` the heartland '' . since 1929 , sociologists have often used the midwest as `` typical '' of the entire nation . the land in the midwest is generally thought of as being flat . many places are indeed flat , but others are not flat . for example , the eastern midwest near the appalachian mountains , the great lakes basin , and northern parts of wisconsin , u.p . of michigan and minnesota are not flat . the far northern part of the upper mississippi valley is known as the driftless region , a region of very rugged hills centered primarily western wisconsin , though the region includes small parts of northeast iowa , southeast minnesota , and northwest illinois . the ocooch mountains of wisconsin contain the highest peaks in driftless region . also , the northern part of the ozark mountain range is in southern missouri . prairies cover most of the states west of the mississippi river . less rain falls in the western midwest than in the eastern part . this causes different types of prairies . most of the midwest can now be called either `` urban areas '' or `` agricultural areas '' . areas in northern minnesota , michigan and wisconsin , and the ohio river valley are not very developed .
