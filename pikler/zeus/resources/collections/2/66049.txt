Flag of convenience     flag of convenience is a word from shipping . every ship needs to be registered in a port . the laws of the port are valid for the ship 's crew . in some countries the rules are not as strict as in others , or they are cheaper to use . many owners of ships from other countries register their ships in one of those easy or cheap countries . the ship might never even come anywhere near that country , but it must fly the flag of the country where it was registered . this is then called a flag of convenience . among the most popular flags are panama , marshall islands and liberia .
