Unidentified flying object     a ufo ( unidentified flying object ) is any object flying in the sky which can not be identified by the person who sees it . sometimes the object is investigated . if people can still not figure out what the object is after an investigation , it is called a ufo . if they figure out what the object is , it can no longer be called a ufo because it has been identified . even though ufos can be anything , people often use the word `` ufo '' when they are talking about alien spacecraft . flying saucer is another word that is often used to describe an unidentified flying object . studies estimate that 50-90 % of all reported ufo sightings are identified later . usually 10-20 % are never identified . studies also show that very few ufo sightings are hoaxes ( people trying to trick other people ) . most ufos are actually natural or man-made objects that looked strange . 80-90 % of ifos are identified as one of three different things : 1. astronomical causes ( for example : planets , stars , or meteors )
