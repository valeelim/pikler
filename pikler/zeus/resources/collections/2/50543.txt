Opera house     an opera house is a building where operas and ballets are performed . it is similar to a theatre . the first opera houses were built in the 1630s in italy , about thirty years after the first operas were written . traditionally they have a stage where the action takes place and a proscenium archway with a curtain that can be drawn back when the performance begins . in front of the stage is an orchestra pit which is a little lower than the stage so that the audience can still see the stage . the audience sit in the auditorium which is often horse-shoe shaped . the downstairs seats are called “ stalls ” . round the stalls there are two or three tiers ( storeys ) of boxes . each box can seat a small number of people . at the top towards the back there is a balcony and often a gallery along the sides as well . some seats in the gallery may have restricted view ( it is not possible to see all of the stage ) . some of the most famous opera houses in the world are teatro alla scala ( or “ la scala ” ) in milan , the royal opera house in covent garden , london , the metropolitan opera house in new york , the war memorial opera house in san francisco , the bolshoi theatre in moscow and the sydney opera house in sydney which is a very modern building .
