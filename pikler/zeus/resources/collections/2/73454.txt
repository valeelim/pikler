Opéra-comique     opéra comique is a french opera tradition . many french operas from the early 18th century to the early 20th century are opéras comiques . in this french tradition there is spoken dialogue as well as songs and dances . it developed from the popular vaudevilles . in paris there is a theatre called the opéra-comique where these operas were performed . although “ opéra comique ” means “ comic opera ” it is not necessarily comedy . bizet ’ s opera `` carmen '' is probably the most famous opéra comique , and it is a tragedy . by the late 19th century the opéra-comique usually had no spoken dialogue . there was music all the way through ( as there is in `` carmen '' ) .
