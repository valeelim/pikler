Ring (mathematics)    ring ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with two operations : addition ( + ) and multiplication ( â€¢ ) . these two operations must follow special rules to work together in a ring . mathematicians use the word `` ring '' this way because a mathematician named david hilbert used the german word `` zahlring '' to describe something he was writing about . the integers , the rational numbers , the real numbers and the complex numbers are all famous examples of rings . there are other , more unusual examples of rings , however they all obey the special rules below . the operations are used to combine two elements to form a third element . there are a few rules the set and the operations must obey to qualify as a ring . these are called ring axioms : - `` closure '' : it is required to check if the suggested operations are actually operations on the set . if an operation is used on any elements in the ring , the element that is formed will also be part of the ring . - for all a , b in r , the result of the operation a + b is also in r .
