Clubmoss     clubmosses are a group of plants in the lycopodiophyta , which are the most ancient group of land plants . the clubmosses are an order lycopodiales , ( or a subclass lycopodiopsida ) . clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants , with small , scale-like leaves , homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves , branching stems ( usually dichotomous ) , and generally simple form . a powder known simply as `` lycopodium '' , consisting of dried spores of the common clubmoss , was used in victorian theater to produce flame-effects . a blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly , but with little heat . it was considered safe by the standards of the time . the group is now split into two families : - lycopodiaceae : the typical clubmosses . their spores are on a club-like structure . their typical chromosome count is n=34 . - huperziaceae : the firmosses . their spore-bearing structures are in the axils of unmodified leaves . the family has a basal chromosome count of n=67 .
