Transpiration     transpiration is the evaporation of water from plants , especially leaves . it is a type of translocation and part of the water cycle . the amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size , the light intensity , temperature , humidity , wind speed , and soil water supply . leaf surfaces are dotted with openings called stomata , which act rather like pores . in most plants there are more on the undersides of the leaves than on the top . the stomata are bordered by guard cells that open and close the pore . transpiration happens because the plant opens its stomata . when it does , oxygen and water vapour flow out , and carbon dioxide flows in . the carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis , and the oxygen is produced by photosynthesis . transpiration also pulls water through the plant . this brings with it the mineral nutrients from roots to shoots . water moves out of the leaves into the atmosphere . this exerts a pull on the water column , which brings the water up against gravity . water gets into the plant at the roots by osmosis , and it transports dissolved mineral nutrients to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem . a fully grown tree may lose several hundred gallons of water through its leaves on a hot , dry day . about 90 % of the water that enters a plant 's roots is used for this process .
