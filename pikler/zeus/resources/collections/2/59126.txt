Transduction (physiology)    transduction ( physiology ) in physiology , transduction is the change of a stimulus from one form to another . transduction in the nervous system typically means synaptic events where an electrical signal is converted into a chemical one by the release of neurotransmitters . in sensory transduction a chemical or physical stimulus is transduced by sensory receptors into an electrical signal . for example , in the visual system , sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina change the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain . the light causes a change in a protein called rhodopsin . in mammalian examples , more light hitting the receptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses . in invertebrates , however , more rhodopsin activation results in increased frequency of neuron firing . related pages . - signal transduction
