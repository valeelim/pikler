Graphical user interfaces and consoles     computers can display information and let the user give commands to it using two methods : a command line interface ( cli ) or a graphical user interface ( gui ) . in a command line interface , the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action . for example , the more command available in most operating systems will display the contents of a file . sometimes people call cli “ console ” , but consoles can be gui , too . in a graphical user interface , the user can use the computer mouse to click on buttons . for example , your web browser probably has a print icon to print this page . graphical user interfaces are generally thought more easy to use than command lines . command lines are faster than graphical user interfaces and can be used to give special commands to the computer . list of operating systems with graphical user interfaces and command-line interfaces : - microsoft windows - mac os - linux
