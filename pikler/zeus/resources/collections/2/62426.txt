51st state     51st state refers to a place or territory that is not one of the 50 states of the united states , but people think about making it the 51st state . it is sometimes a joke term in american politics , and sometimes a realistic one . it is usually said about the possibility of puerto rico or other u.s. territories becoming part of the united states . when used to refer to other countries , it is a joke , usually about canada . there have been attempts by people in the united states to get canada to join them ( like in the articles of confederation ) , but canada has never taken up these offers . it is also sometimes used to refer to countries that seem to be controlled by the united states . before the year 1959 when alaska and hawaii became states , the sentence `` the 49th state '' was used . the term is used in canada and other countries to show that they think there is a bad u.s. influence on the world . places in the united states that are not states right now that might become the 51st state are puerto rico , guam , the us virgin islands , or the northern marianas . the most serious proposals for forming a 51st or even 52nd state are those for dividing the most-populous state ( and third-largest state , geographically ) of california into two or even three states , giving that area either four or six seats in the u.s. senate , rather than just two as is the present situation , plus more-efficient local administrations .
