Prototype     a prototype is an original type , form , or instance of some thing . it serves as a typical example or standard for things of the same category . some prototypes are used to find defects or to test an idea . prototypes are built for different reasons : - proof of principle prototype ( or model ) : shows that something can be done . these kinds of prototypes are built to test a part of the design . these prototypes do not look like the finished product , in most cases . such prototypes are used to show that certain design choices will work or will not work . - form-study prototype ( model ) : this tries to show what the finished design will look like , but without the function . such prototypes allow to take decisions about the exact shape , size , or ergonomic properties . this lets a designer see if things fit together , and will feel right . - visual prototype : these will look like the actual product , and are used for market research . they do not have any of the functionality of the final product . an example is a `` concept '' car at a car show . it may look like a new car but may not even have an engine .
