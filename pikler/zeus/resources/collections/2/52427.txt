International Phonetic Alphabet     the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) is a system for writing down sounds . it was created by the international phonetic association in 1886 , so that people could write down sounds of languages in a standard way . linguists , language teachers , and translators use this system to show the pronunciation for words . wikipedia also uses the ipa to show how certain words are meant to be spoken . most symbols are letters in the latin alphabet , or variations of it . for example , the `` palatal approximant '' ( the `` y '' in yesterday ) is written with [ ] . in ipa symbols can be written between slashes ( broad transcription , e.g . `` little '' can be written as /lɪtl/ ) or in square brackets ( narrow transcription , e.g . `` little '' can be written [ lɪɾɫ ] ) . narrow translation is more precise than broad . the ipa has symbols only for sounds that are used normally in spoken languages . the extended ipa is used to write down other sounds . the ipa is sometimes changed , and symbols are added or taken away . right now there are 107 different letters in the ipa . there are also 52 marks which are added to letters to change their sound . these marks are called `` diacritics .
