Meristem     a meristem is a tissue in plants made of dividing cells . they are in parts of the plant where growth can take place . plant cells which are differentiated generally can not divide or produce cells of a different type . therefore , cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells . this allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant . meristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals . they are incompletely or not at all differentiated , and are capable of continued cell division . the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely . the vacuoles are extremely small . the cytoplasm does not contain plastids ( such as chloroplasts , but they are there in rudimentary form ( 'proplastids ' ) . meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities . the cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall . the apical meristem , or growing tip , is found in the buds and growing tips of roots in plants . it begins growth of new cells in young seedlings at the tips of roots and shoots ( forming buds , among other things ) . specifically , an active apical meristem lays down a growing root or shoot behind itself , pushing itself forward . apical meristems are very small , compared to the cylinder-shaped lateral meristems .
