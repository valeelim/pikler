Pilot fish     pilot fish ( `` naucrates ductor '' ) are fish that live in many places of the world . they live in warm water . they eat parasites on larger fish . pilot fish usually gather around sharks ( also rays and sea turtles ) . they eat parasites on their host , and small pieces of food that their host does not eat ( leftovers ) . when pilot fish are young , they gather around jellyfish and drifting seaweeds . pilot fish follow sharks because other animals which might eat them will not come near a shark . in return , sharks do not eat pilot fish because pilot fish eat their parasites . this is called a `` mutualist '' relationship . small pilot fish are often seen swimming into the mouth of a shark to eat small pieces of food from the shark 's teeth . sailors even said that sharks and pilot fish act like close friends . when a ship would capture the shark the pilot fish followed , some people reported that the pilot fish would follow the ship for up to six weeks . they will follow ships in other circumstances , sometimes for very long distances . many pilot fish have been seen on the shores of england , which is a long way from where they usually live .
