Deomyinae     the subfamily deomyinae consists of four genera of mouse-like rodents . these were placed in the subfamilies murinae and dendromurinae until very recently . they are sometimes called acomyinae , particularly in references that predate the discovery that the link rat , `` deomys ferugineus '' , is part of the clade . deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name . deomyines share no morphological characteristics that can be used to separate them from other muroids . subtle aspects of the third upper molar have been suggested , though . this subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations . these conclusions have demonstrated good statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial dna , as well as dna-dna hybridization . because of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group , it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized could grow bigger . many of the genera currently placed in murinae or dendromurinae have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis . there are potential surprises awaiting when they are .
