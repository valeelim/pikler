Ina Bauer     an ina bauer is a figure skating element . it is named after a figure skater from germany named ina bauer , who invented the position . the ina bauer is performed by placing the feet in the fourth position in ballet . the front leg is bent forwards at the knee and the back leg is extended behind the skater . the front leg can be either on an inside edge or an outside edge . an outside edge ina bauer is harder to do . while the skater skates in a curve across the ice ( necessary because of the skate positions ) , the back can be bent backwards . this is not mandatory , but it does add to the element . the ina bauer is a famous move in japan because it was performed by shizuka arakawa during her long program at the 2006 winter olympics , which she won . because she bends back so far during the move , the term in japanese has come to mean anything having to do with bending backwards . other websites . - see `` ina bauer '' element ( mpg ) - read more about `` ina bauer ''
