Power (physics)    power ( physics ) in physics , power ( symbol : `` p '' ) is how fast work is done or energy is given from one thing to another . in the si system of measurement , power is measured in watts ( symbol : w ) . it may take a certain amount of work to make a change in the world , such as lifting a heavy weight to a higher level . it makes no difference if the weight is lifted slowly or quickly . the same amount of work will have been performed . the difference between a slow lift and a quick lift is that a quick lift requires more power . this means the work can be done in a shorter time if there is more power available . as a rate of change of work done or the energy of a subsystem , power is : where power is also equal to force times velocity ( or speed ) . in optics , or radiometry , the term `` power '' sometimes refers to radiant flux . this is the average rate of energy transport by electromagnetic radiation , measured in watts . but the term `` power '' is also used to express the ability of a lens or other optical device to focus light . it is measured in dioptres ( inverse metres ) , and is equal to one over the focal length of the optical device .
