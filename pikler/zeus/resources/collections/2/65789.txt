House of Habsburg     habsburg was a family of dukes , kings , and monarchs . they were very important in european history . they ruled austria , later austria-hungary for more than 600 years . they also sometimes owned spain , the netherlands , and the holy roman empire from about 1280 to 1806. a treaty was made in vienna in 1515 between the king of poland and duke of lithuania from the jagiellon dynasty and the duke of austria from the habsburg family . it said that if the kings of bohemia and hungary , ( jagiellons ) , were to die without male heirs the duke of austria would take over their territory . they also ruled over the kingdom of sardinia . the house of habsburg became extinct in the 18th century . the senior branch ended upon the death of charles ii of spain in 1700 and was replaced by the house of bourbon . the mental and physical handicaps of charles ii were probably caused by inbreeding between relatives in the royal houses of continental europe . marriages of close relatives occurred for five generations before him . he was the son of philip iv , who married his sister 's daughter .
