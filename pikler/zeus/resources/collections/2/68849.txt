Age of Enlightenment     the age of enlightenment was an 18th century cultural movement in europe . it was most popular in france , where its leaders included philosophers like voltaire and denis diderot . diderot helped spread the enlightenment 's ideas by writing the `` encyclopédie '' , the first big encyclopedia that was available to everyone . the enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of rené descartes . the enlightenment 's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves . because of this , people should not automatically believe what an authority says . people do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say . this was a very new idea at the time . another important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it . even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in . the nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more .
