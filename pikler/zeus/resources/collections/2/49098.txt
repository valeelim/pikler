Third Servile War     the third servile war , also called the gladiator war and the war of spartacus by plutarch , was the last of several slave rebellions against the roman republic . these are called the servile wars . the third servile war was the only which was dangerous for italia itself and was doubly alarming to the roman people because the slaves won several battles against the roman army between 73 and 71 bc . the rebellion was defeated at last in 71 bc by marcus licinius crassus . the rebellion had indirect effects on roman politics for many years . in 71 bc , a band of slaves escaped . at first a small group of about 78 gladiators escaped . the band grew to over 120,000. men , women and children wandered throughout italy , and raided with relative impunity . their leaders included the famous gladiator-general spartacus . the able-bodied adults of this band were a surprisingly effective armed force . they showed they could withstand the roman military , from the local campanian patrols , to the roman militia , and to trained roman legions under consular command . plutarch described the actions of the slaves as an attempt by roman slaves to escape their masters and flee through cisalpine gaul , while appian and florus depicted the revolt as a civil war in which the slaves waged a campaign to capture the city of rome itself .
