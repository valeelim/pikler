Motor neurone disease     motor neurone disease ( sometimes called lou gehrig â€™ s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) is a chronic , progressive , almost always fatal neurological disease . these are the nerve cells which move muscles when we speak , walk , swallow , and move our body . these diseases get worse with time . they cause increasing disability and , eventually , death . there is no known cure . it is marked by slow but steady death of the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement . that is , people can no longer move , but their heart still beats . amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) is the most common of the five types of motor neuron disease . about 5 to 10 % of cases are directly inherited from a person 's parents . the disorder causes muscle weakness and muscle shrinking ( atrophy ) throughout the body . both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons die , making them stop sending messages to the muscles . unable to function , the muscles gradually weaken and waste away ( atrophy ) . eventually , the ability of the brain to start and control voluntary movement is lost . however , even patients in later stages of the disease may still have the same intelligence , memory , and personality they had before it started .
