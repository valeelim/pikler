London County Council     london county council ( lcc ) was the principal local government body for the county of london , during its whole existence ( 1889-1965 ) , and the first london-wide general municipal authority that was directly elected . it covered the area today known as inner london and was replaced by the greater london council . the lcc was the largest , most significant and ambitious municipal authority of its day . the creation of the lcc in 1889 , as part of the local government act 1888 , was forced by a succession of scandals involving the metropolitan board of works ( mbw ) , its predecessor , which had not been directly elected . while the conservative government of the day would have preferred not to create a single body covering the whole of london , their election promise to the liberal unionists led them to this policy . a later government created the 28 metropolitan boroughs as lower tier authorities to replace the various local authorities in 1899 ; they assumed some powers of the lcc and shared others .
