Hydroxide     hydroxide in chemistry is a name given to the diatomic anion oh , made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms . most chemical compounds that contain hydroxides are bases . an arrhenius base is a substance that when dissolved in an aqueous solution , it produces hydroxide ions . therefore , hydroxide ions are heavily involved in acid-base reactions . many useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions . sodium hydroxide is used in industry as a strong base , potassium hydroxide is used in agriculture , and iron hydroxide minerals such as goethite and limonite have been used as iron ore. the aluminium ore bauxite is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides . most inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water . many useful chemicals and chemical processes involve hydroxides or hydroxide ions . sodium hydroxide is used in factories as an alkali , potassium hydroxide is used in farming , and iron hydroxide have been used as low grade brown iron ore. list of hydroxides . - sodium hydroxide ( naoh )
