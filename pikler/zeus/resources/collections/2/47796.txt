Domesday Book     the domesday book is the record of the great survey of much of england , and parts of wales , completed in 1086 , done for william i of england , or william the conqueror . the domesday book ( also known as `` domesday '' , or `` book of winchester '' ) was a record of all taxable land in england , together with such information as would indicate its worth . as the scribes went round england , they were protected by william 's armed men . each group was led by a royal commissioner , who took a list of standard questions . a 'jury ' of local nobility and citizens answered the questions . all answers were written down in latin . information was collected from the start of 1086 , and working up into the complete volume started later that year . william died in 1087 before the writing-up work was completed . william the conqueror wished to know the details of the land he had conquered , england . he let his knights and barons have big areas of land , and wanted rent money from them . the domesday book was a record of every farm , village and house so that he knew how much rent he should get . only some small villages in the countryside are not in the book . major cities like london and winchester are also not in the domesday book , perhaps because of their size , or because ( not owning land ) , the people could not be taxed .
