Musical tuning     in music tuning an instrument means getting it ready so that when it is played it will sound at the correct pitch : not too high or too low . when two or more instruments play together it is particularly important that they are in tune with one another . this means that when they play the same note it is indeed exactly the same note . if the two instruments are not in tune with one another it will sound unpleasant because two notes which are very slightly different in pitch will produce a “ beat ” . instruments such as the piano or organ have to be tuned by people who are specialists in tuning . for most instruments , however , the players themselves need to tune their instruments before they play . players of string instruments can turn the pegs at the top of their instruments to change the tension ( tightness ) of the string . players of wind instruments can make their instruments very slightly longer or shorter by pushing out or pulling in one of the joints . timpanists turn the taps which are around the top of their instruments to change the tension of the drum head .
