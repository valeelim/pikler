Combustion     combustion ( burning ) is a chemical process in which fuel reacts with an oxidant to give out heat . the release of heat can produce light in the form of flame . a car engine and a rocket engine both work by combustion . combustion in a car motor is different from combustion in a rocket engine . car combustion is gas catching on fire and exploding in cylinders again and again to push them up and down , making the car move . rocket combustion is made by rocket fuel exploding out of the back of the rocket moving it up . the burning of most substances is bad for the environment and the ozone layer because it can let off greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide . hydrogen burns cleanly and gives off a lot of heat , but it does not produce much power , and is hard to find . fuel reacts with oxygen and release energy . complete combustion happens in a plentiful supply of air . incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air is limited . complete combustion releases more energy than incomplete combustion . incomplete combustion also creates carbon monoxide , and more soot . several factors must be considered when choosing the best fuel for a particular purpose . fuels are substances that react with oxygen to release useful energy . most of the energy is released as heat , but light energy is also released . about 21 per cent of the air is oxygen . when a fuel burns in plenty of air , it receives enough oxygen for complete combustion . complete combustion needs a plentiful supply of air so that the elements in the fuel react fully with oxygen . fuels such as natural gas and petrol contain hydrocarbons . these are compounds of hydrogen and carbon only . combustion is a high-temperature reduction/oxidation reaction .
