LaTeX     latex is a computer program used for making articles , books and mathematical formulas more aesthetically pleasing . lattex is well-suited for expressing mathematical formulas on electronic devices in a more human readable format by allowing them to be shown in a format similar to how they would be written in many textbooks or by hand . latex is used for making mathematical formulas for some articles on wikipedia in addition to being used within academic circles . the writer types his article into a plain text document . a plain text document can not have styled text , like bold or italic . when the writer wants to write styled text , they use computer commands . for example , the command for bold text is \textbf { this text is bold } . after the writer is finished writing the article , they tell latex to read the document . after latex is done , latex makes a file that can be printed . the command \textbf { this text is bold } would print as this text is bold . latex was first made in the early 1980s by leslie lamport at sri international . the current version is latex2e ( styled ) .
