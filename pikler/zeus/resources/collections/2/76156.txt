Radiation pressure     radiation pressure is the pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation . if absorbed , the pressure is the energy flux density divided by the speed of light . if the radiation is totally reflected , the radiation pressure is doubled . this happens because the waves that make up electromagnetic radiation carry momentum with them and pass that momentum on when they reach a surface . for example , the radiation of the sun at the earth has an energy flux density of 1370 w/m , so the radiation pressure is 4.6 Âµpa ( absorbed ) . - demir , dilek , '' a table-top demonstration of radiation pressure '' ,2011 , diplomathesis , e-theses univie ( http : //othes.univie.ac.at/16381/ )
