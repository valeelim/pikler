Umlaut     the umlaut is the name of the two small dots above the letters a , o , and u in german . without umlauts those three letters are said [ a ] , [ o ] , and [ u ] , but when the umlauts are put over them , ä , ö , and ü the sounds change to be said like [ ɛ ] , [ œ ] / [ ø ] and [ y ] / [ ʏ ] . when a word that has letters with an umlaut is changed into english , the letters are usually written as ae , oe , or ue instead of ä , ö , or ü. related pages . - diaeresis
