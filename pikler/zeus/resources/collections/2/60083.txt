Piano duet     a piano duet is a piece of music written for two people to play at one piano . it is often called piano 4 hands . to play piano duets the two players sit with one person on the right ( playing the high notes ) and the other person on the left ( playing the low notes ) . the person on the right is called “ primo ” ( “ first ” ) and the person on the left is called “ secondo ” ( “ second ” ) . piano duet music is usually printed with the secondo part on the left-hand page and the primo part on the right-hand page . occasionally it is printed with the two parts underneath one another . playing piano duets is great fun and an excellent way to become a better musician . like all group music making , each player has to learn to listen and adapt to what is going on in the other part . sometimes one player will have to take away his or her hand quickly so that the other player can play the same note immediately afterwards . sometimes the players have to cross their hands ( secondo ’ s right hand crosses with primo ’ s left hand ) .
