Scordatura     scordatura in music is a technique in which players of string instruments tune their strings to different notes from a normal tuning . the word “ scordatura ” is an italian word which means “ mistuning ” . it was used for lutes , guitars , viols and instruments of the violin family . using a scordatura tuning made the instrument sound different . for example : a string tuned to a slightly higher note will sound louder and brighter because it is tighter . care has to be taken not to tune it too high otherwise it will break . scordatura also made it possible to play unusual chords or combinations of notes in string-crossing ( when the bow moves quickly from one string to another ) . when a composer writes for an instrument using scordatura tuning he shows at the beginning of the music what notes the strings must be tuned to . the music is then written , not as it sounds , but so that the player can read it as if the instrument were being played normally , e.g . if a g string is tuned up to g # and the composer wants a g # he simply writes a g , but it will sound g # .
