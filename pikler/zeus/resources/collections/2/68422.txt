Ama-no-Uzume     ame-no-uzume-no-mikoto ( 天宇受売命 ) is the kami of dawn , happiness and joy in the shinto religion of japan . she is famous for her role in the tale of the sun goddess , amaterasu . amaterasu 's brother , the storm god susano'o ( 須佐之男命 ) , had vandalised her sacred buildings and killed her maidens because she refused to trust him . amaterasu became so scared of his wrath that she went to hide into a cave , ame-no-iwato ( 天の岩戸 ) . the world , without the light of the sun , became dark . the oni ( devils of japanese mythology ) came out to the dark world , and the gods could not make amaterasu come out of the cave . the intelligent uzume took a small boat , turned it upside down near the cave entrance , and began a dance on it , tearing off her clothing in front of the other kami . they thought this was so funny that they laughed happily . amaterasu heard them , and looked out to see why the gods were laughing . when she opened the cave , she saw her wonderful reflection in a mirror uzume had put on a tree , and slowly came out of the cave .
