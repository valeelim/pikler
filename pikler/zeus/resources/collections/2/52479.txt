History of Armenia     the history of armenia and armenians is very ancient and can go back at least 2000 bc . archaeologists say the shulaveri-shomu culture of the central transcaucasus region , and armenia today , as the earliest known prehistoric culture in the area , carbon-dated to around 6000 - 4000 bc . but , a newer discovered tomb has been dated to 9000 bc . another early culture in the armenian highlands and surrounding areasâ€”the kura-araxes culture is in the period of ca . 4000 - 2200 bc , and is believed to have to go into the trialeti culture ( ca . 2200 - 1500 bc ) , and meaning armenians are one of the oldest indo-european subgroups . urartu was an ancient kingdom in the armenian highlands . some experts say that the armenians started as a mixture of the different peoples to move through the area in history : the hurrians , urarteans , luvians and mushki . this last group , also knowns as phrygians may have brought their indo-european language to armenia . the armenian language today is indo-european , but shows a lot of influence from the earlier languages , especially urartean .
