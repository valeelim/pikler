Stuntman     a stuntman is a man or a woman who performs dangerous acts usually within the television or movie production industry . in this line of work the stuntman ( or woman ) is paid to do those actions that are deemed too dangerous for the regular actor to perform , these include jumping from a height , falling down , being in a car crash , or pretending to fight with weapons such as swords or knives . these stunts are usually presented as a small feature within a larger production . action movies , war movies , martial arts movies , and crime television shows use many stuntmen to do the dangerous actions depicted in the movies or shows . jackie chan and the blue angels are examples of stuntmen who perform this kind of work . there are , however , other stuntmen that present dangerous stunts to a live audience as entertainment in their own right rather than as part of a larger story . sometimes these are as standalone effects and sometimes as a feature within a larger stunt show . escape artists , sword swallowers and other circus and sideshow acts are an example of this .
