Brain stem     the brainstem is the rear part of the brain . it has two sections : the hindbrain , which includes the pons and medula , and the midbrain . though the brainstem is small , it is extremely important . the motor ( movement ) and sensory connections from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brain stem . also , from the brainstem come the main motor and sensory nerves to the face and neck . these nerves are called the cranial nerves . the brainstem controls many bodily functions of which we are not normally aware , such as breathing , heart beat , and sweating . the brainstem controls functions which are unconscious , but necessary for life . the hindbrain consists of the pons , and the medulla oblongata ; which is an extension of the spinal cord . it connects the other parts of the brain ( the cerebrum and cerebellum ) to the spinal cord . its neurons are the control centre of bodily functions , such as breathing and blood pressure . functions of the brainstem . - conduction : all information going between the body and the cerebellum and the cerebrum must go through the brainstem .
