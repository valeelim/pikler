Head (hydraulic)    head ( hydraulic ) hydraulic head is a specific measurement of water pressure or total energy per unit weight above a datum . it is usually measured as a water surface elevation , expressed in units of length , but represents the energy at the entrance ( or bottom ) of a piezometer . in an aquifer , it can be calculated from the depth to water in a piezometric well ( a specialized water well ) , and given information of the piezometer 's elevation and screen depth . even though it is conventional to use gauge pressure in the calculation of hydraulic head , it is more correct to use total pressure ( gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure ) , since this is truly what drives groundwater flow . often detailed observations of barometric pressure are not available at each well through time , so this is often disregarded ( contributing to large errors at locations where hydraulic gradients are low or the angle between wells is acute . ) hydraulic head is a measure of energy , and has many analogs in physics and chemistry , where the same mathematical principles and rules apply :
