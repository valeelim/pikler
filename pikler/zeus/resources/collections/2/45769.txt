Sympathy     sympathy exists when the feelings or emotions of one person lead to similar feelings in another person so that they share feeling . mostly sympathy means the sharing of unhappiness or suffering , but it can also mean sharing other ( positive ) emotions . in a broader sense , it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments , such as in the phrase `` a communist sympathiser '' . the psychological state of sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy , but is not identical to it . empathy is understanding and feeling another person 's emotions as they feel them , but makes no statement as to how they are viewed . sympathy , by contrast , implies a degree of equal feeling , that is , the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does . it thus implies concern , or care or a wish to reduce negative feelings others are experiencing . related pages . - empathy - pity - liking
