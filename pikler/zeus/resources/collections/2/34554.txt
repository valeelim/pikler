Iceberg     an iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the sea . they are generally found in cold water near the north or south pole . icebergs are especially common during spring , when ice has begun to melt . about 90 % of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above . just by looking at the part you can see , it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks , and how close you can get before crashing into it . icebergs break off from larger structures made of ice , like glaciers or ice shelves . these are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer . the snow builds up and compacts into ice . this is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea . the ice then falls off and makes icebergs . the icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely . the first person to give a correct scientific explanation of this phenomenon was mikhail lomonosov , around 1750. the density of ice is about 0.92 kg per liter , that of sea water is about 1.025 kg per liter . for this reason , 920 parts of the 1025 , or about 90 percent , of the iceberg 's volume need to be below the water line . lomonosov grew up on the shore of the white sea in the european part of russia . he studied in marburg , and is credited with introducing the word `` iceberg '' into the russian language .
