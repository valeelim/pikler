Raoult's law    raoult 's law raoult 's law states that the vapor pressure of a binary solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly related to the mole fraction of solvent ( i.e . volatile ) in the solution . also , it states that the vapour pressure of each component in a binary solution containing volatile components is directly related to its respective mole fraction in the solution . relative going-down of vapour pressure is equal to mole fraction of non volatile and non-electrolytic solute . this is known as raoult 's law . p-p ( initial ) /p ( initial ) =n ( solute ) /n ( solvent )
