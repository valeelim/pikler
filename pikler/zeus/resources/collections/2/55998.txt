Work (physics)    work ( physics ) in physics , a force does work when it acts on a body and there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force . the `` work done '' by a force acting on a body is the force along the direction of the displacement multiplied by the displacement of the point of application . it is the force that does the work , not the agent that created the force . motion is a requirement of work . like energy , it is a scalar quantity , with si units of joules . heat conduction is not considered to be a form of work , since there is no macroscopically measurable force , only microscopic forces occurring in atomic collisions . the term `` work '' was created in the 1830s by the french mathematician gaspard-gustave coriolis . according to the work-energy theorem if an external force acts upon a rigid object , causing its kinetic energy to change from `` e '' to `` e '' , then the mechanical work ( `` w '' ) is given by : where `` m '' is the mass of the object and `` v '' is the object 's velocity . if a constant force `` f '' acts on an object while the object is displaced a distance `` d '' , and the force and displacement are parallel to each other , the work done on the object is the product of `` f '' and `` d '' :
