Histology     histology is the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of plants and animals , particularly the tissues . it is a part of cytology , and an essential tool of biology and medicine . histology is usually done by looking at cells and tissues under a light microscope or electron microscope . the tissue has to be specially prepared beforehand . the stages below are only described in outline . laboratories which do histology work from schedules which are much more detailed . chemical fixatives are used to preserve tissue from decay . this preserves the structure of the cell and of sub-cellular components such as cell organelles ( e.g. , nucleus , endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria ) . the most common fixative for light microscopy is formalin ( 4 % formaldehyde in saline ) . after fixing , the block of tissue is embedded in paraffin wax . this holds and preserves the tissue as a block . the section is cut into a series of wafer-thin slices , each of which is put on a glass microscope slide . the machine which cuts the block is a mechanical guillotine which can be set to cut at a suitable depth for the tissue in question .
