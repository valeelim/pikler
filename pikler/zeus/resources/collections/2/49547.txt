Crassus     marcus licinius crassus ( c. 115 bc â€“ 53 bc ) was a roman general and politician . he commanded the left wing of sulla 's army at the battle of the colline gate . it was he who finally suppressed the slave revolt led by spartacus . the third servile war began with three defeats of roman armies against spartacus and his followers . the revolt was finally destroyed by the concentrated military effort of a single commander , marcus licinius crassus . the last stage of his career was as a `` triumvir '' , one of the first triumvirate , with gnaeus pompeius magnus and gaius julius caesar . one of the richest men of the era , he was killed after a defeat at the battle of carrhae . his death led to the civil wars between julius caesar and pompey , the other two triumvirs . when crassus formed his army , in addition to six new legions , he was given other legions which had been beaten by spartacus . he decimated them . this was the brutal method of executing `` one man in ten '' to encourage the others to fight harder . each group of ten men drew lots to decide who would die . this punishment had not been used since the early days of rome .
