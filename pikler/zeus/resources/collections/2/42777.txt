Explosion     an explosion is a fast increase in volume and increase in energy made available . it normally makes high temperatures and makes gases . many natural events can make explosions , such as lightning , volcanic eruptions , meteors , and supernovas . people make explosions mostly by using chemical explosive materials . a chemical explosion starts pressure waves in the medium where it happens . explosions are categorized as deflagrations if the pressure waves are subsonic and detonations if they are supersonic . when a detonation happens , the resulting pressure waves are named shock waves . unintentional explosions can be caused when chemicals are mixed together , or when pressurized containers or flammable materials are heated or exposed to flames . to cause an explosion , pressure does not have to be present but is always a result of an explosion . several safety measures are used to prevent unintentional explosions . many countries require that chemicals , fuels , and pressurized containers that may explode be labelled with warning labels . as well , many countries have regulations restricting the possession and use of potentially explosive materials so they will only go to appropriate industrial and research uses . transportation regulations require potentially explosive chemicals , fuels , and pressurized containers to be transported safely .
