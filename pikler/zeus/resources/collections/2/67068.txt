Fern     ferns are a group of about 20,000 species of plants ( of which about 10,000 are living ) in the division pteridophyta . unlike bryophytes , ferns have xylem and phloem , which makes them vascular plants . most ferns belong to the class leptosporangiata ( or pteridopsida ) . this includes most of those you see in gardens and woods . the horsetails belong to another class , the equisetopsida , which was extremely important in the carboniferous period . only one genus survives . the other classes of fern are also quite small today . ferns do not have waxes or special cells on their surface that keep water from evaporating . they have roots , stems , leaves . their stems may form runners , called stolons above the ground , or rhizomes below ground . the leaves are green an large , and may bear spores on the underside . some ferns can grow large in moist places . they can survive in more places than moss , but not so many as flowering plants . during the carboniferous period – from 350 million years ago – ferns lived everywhere on land . horsetails grew up to 30 metres . there were huge forests of ferns and mosses , full of giant insects . today , there are not so many large ferns .
