Cardinality     in mathematics , the cardinality of a set means the number of its elements . for example , the set a = { 2 , 4 , 6 } contains 3 elements , and therefore a has a cardinality of 3. two sets have the `` same '' ( or `` equal '' ) cardinality if they have the same number of elements . they have the same number of elements if and only if there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the sets . the cardinality of the set `` a '' is `` less than or equal to '' cardinality ( or `` fewer than or equal '' members ) set `` b '' if and only if there is an injective function from `` a '' to `` b '' . the cardinality of the set `` b '' is `` greater than or equal to '' ( or `` more than or equal '' members ) set `` b '' if and only if there is an injective function from `` a '' to `` b '' . the `` cardinality '' of a set is only one way of giving a number to the `` size '' of a set . measure is different . the cardinality of a finite set is a natural number . the smallest cardinality is 0. the empty set has cardinality 0. if the cardinality of the set `` a '' is `` n '' , then there is a `` next larger '' set with cardinality `` n '' +1 . ( for example , the set formula_1 . if formula_2 then either formula_3 or formula_4 . ) there is no largest finite cardinality .
