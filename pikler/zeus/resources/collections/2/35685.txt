Mutation     in biology , a mutation is a change in the genetic material . this means changes to the dna or to the chromosomes which carry the dna . these changes are heritable ( can be passed on to the next generation ) unless they have lethal effects . mutations can happen for several reasons . it can happen because of errors when `` meiosis '' produces the gametes ( eggs & sperms ) . damage by radiation , or by certain chemicals may cause mutations . mutations occur at random . also , by derivation , an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a `` mutation '' . so is the trait ( character ) most obviously affected by the mutation . when dna is copied mistakes are sometimes made â€“ these are called mutations . there are four main types of mutations : - `` deletion '' , where one or more dna bases are left out . - `` insertion '' , where one or more extra base is put in . - `` substitution '' , where one or more bases are substituted for another base in the sequence . - `` duplication '' , where whole genes are duplicated .
