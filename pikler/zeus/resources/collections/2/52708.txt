Nastika     astika ( sanskrit : : `` orthodox '' ) and nastika : ( `` heterodox '' ) are technical terms in hinduism used to classify philosophical schools and persons , according to whether they accept the authority of the vedas as supreme revealed scriptures , or not . by this definition , nyaya , vaisheshika , samkhya , yoga , purva mimamsa and vedanta are classified as `` astika '' schools ; while charvaka , jainism and buddhism are considered `` nastika '' schools . in non-technical usage , the term `` astika '' is sometimes loosely translated as `` theist '' while `` nastika '' is translated as `` atheist '' . however this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in hindu philosophy . notably even among the `` astika '' schools , `` samkhya '' and the early `` mimamsa '' school do not accept a god ( see atheism in hinduism ) while accepting the authority of the vedas ; they thus are `` atheistic `` astika '' schools '' . the three main heterodox schools of indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on vedic authority : - buddhism - jainism - carvaka
