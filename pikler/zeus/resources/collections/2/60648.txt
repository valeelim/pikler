Njord     njord is a god in norse mythology . he is the father of the twins freyr and freyja . his wife was skadi , a goddess/giantess ( freyr and freyja 's stepmother ) . skadi 's father caught loki , and forced him to lure out the goddess idun . the gods later killed him and freed idun . skadi came to fight the gods , but they did not want to fight her . they allowed her to choose her husband among the gods , but only by looking at their feet . she wanted to choose baldur , who is the handsomest , but the gorgeous feet she picked belonged to njord . because njord is the god of the sea , waves wash his feet clean and pretty . when skadi moved to her new husband 's home near the sea , she missed her mountain home . so she only spends half her time with her husband . when skadi is away , njord is sad , causing storms at the sea . njord 's realm is noatun . freyr and freyja are said to be born by his own sister . this goddess is maybe nerthus .
