Möbius strip     the möbius strip or möbius band is a surface with only one side and only one edge . it can be made using a strip of paper by gluing the two ends together with a half-twist . the twisting is possible in two directions ; so there are two different ( mirror-image ) möbius strips . the mobius strip is known for its unusual properties . a bug crawling along the center line of the loop would go around twice before coming back to its starting point . cutting along the center line of the loop creates one longer band , not two . cutting one third of the way in from the edge ( and parallel to it ) produces another amusing result . the möbius strip was discovered independently by the german mathematicians august ferdinand möbius and johann benedict listing in 1858. one way to represent the möbius strip as a subset of formula_1 can be done using the parametrization : where 0 ≤ `` u '' < 2π and −1 ≤ `` v '' ≤ 1. this creates a möbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1 , lies in the `` xy '' plane and is centered at the parameter `` u '' runs around the strip while `` v '' moves from one edge to the other .
