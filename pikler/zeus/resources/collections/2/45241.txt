Deinonychus     deinonychus was a medium-sized theropod dinosaur of the dromeosaur family . it was a larger relative of the famous `` velociraptor '' . this 3.4 meter ( 11 ft ) long dinosaur lived during the lower cretaceous , about 115-108 million years ago . fossils have been recovered from the u.s. states of montana , wyoming , and oklahoma . `` deinonychus '' has been described as the single most important discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid 20th century . paleontologist john ostrom 's study of `` deinonychus '' in the late 1960s started the debate on whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded . it is now accepted that all or most smaller theropods had feathers whose function was temperature regulation . ostrom noted the small body , sleek , horizontal , posture , and—especially—the enlarged claws on the feet , which suggested an active , agile predator . before this , the popular idea of dinosaurs had been one of plodding , reptilian giants . 'deinonychus ' means 'terrible claw ' . this refers to the large , sickle-shaped claw bone on the second toe of each hind foot . in life , archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone which extends the length . ostrom reconstructed the claw as over long .
