Nasal hair     nasal hair are small hair-like cells in the nose . most of them can be found near the nostrils . the purpose of these hairs is to act as a filter , keeping dust and dirt out of the nasal passages . they also draw liquid mucus up from the epithelium by capillary action . in that way , they help to maintain humidity in the air passages and stop them from drying out . the hairs trap moisture as air is breathed out . the evaporation of trapped moisture on the hairs increases the humidity of air as it is breathed in . note that nasal hair is different from the cilia found in the nose , which are part of the olfactory system . some cultures consider nose hair coming out from the nostrils to be ugly . the increased growth of nasal cilia with age ( particularly for men ) is often a source of anxiety and embarrassment . a number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair , including small rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers . however , given the role of nasal cilia , many doctors recommend trimming them lightly , if at all . there is evidence that the movement in the ciliar slows down with age . this may be the reason that old people have more respiratory infections .
