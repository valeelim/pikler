Gene expression     gene expression is the process by which the heritable information in a gene , the sequence of dna base pairs , is made into a functional gene product , such as protein or rna . the basic idea is that dna is transcribed into rna , which is then translated into proteins . proteins make many of the structures and all the enzymes in a cell or organism . several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated ( tuned ) . this includes both the transcription and translation stages , and the final folded state of a protein . gene regulation switches genes on and off , and so controls cell differentiation , and morphogenesis . gene regulation may also serve as a basis for evolutionary change : control of the timing , location , and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the development of the organism . the expression of a gene may vary a lot in different tissues . this is called pleiotropism , a widespread phenomenon in genetics . in biology , epigenetics is the study of inherited changes in phenotype ( appearance ) or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying dna sequence .
