Mouthpiece (brass)    mouthpiece ( brass ) a brass mouthpiece is the part of a brass instrument that a player blows into to make a sound . the purpose of a mouthpiece is to send vibrations down the instrument to make a musical note . larger mouthpieces are used on larger instruments , and smaller ones are used on smaller instruments . this is because a larger mouthpiece makes a lower sound , and a smaller mouthpiece makes a higher sound , and bigger instruments make lower sounds and smaller instruments make higher sounds . a mouthpiece has many different parts , and all its parts have different names . - rim - the `` rim '' of a trumpet mouthpiece is the part that makes a circle at the top of the mouthpiece , and is the part that is in physical contact with you when playing . - cup - the `` cup '' of a mouthpiece is the part inbetween the rim and the back bore . this is where the air coming from the players mouth enters the mouthpiece and due to the concave shape forces the air into the backbore . - throat , backbore , and shank - the backbore is where the air escapes through into the throat and shank , the shank is the long piece of hollow metal coming from the cup of the mouthpiece , it should be the only part of the mouthpiece in contact with the instrument .
