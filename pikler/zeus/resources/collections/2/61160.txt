Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale     the saffir–simpson hurricane scale is a scale that is used to sort tropical cyclones in the western hemisphere . it is only used for storms that are stronger than `` tropical storms '' , and become actual hurricanes . the categories into which the scale separates hurricanes are noted by the strength of their maximum sustained wind speeds . the classifications are used mainly to predict the possible wind damage a hurricane will create when it makes landfall . it does not measure rainfall or storm surge or how wide the storm is . the scale is also used to classify subtropical cyclones after a change in the rules made by the national hurricane center in 2002. the saffir-simpson hurricane scale is used only to describe hurricanes that form in the atlantic ocean and northern pacific ocean , to the east of the international date line . other areas call their tropical storms by other names , and use their own classification scales .
