Frequency distribution     in statistics , a frequency distribution is a list of the values that a variable takes in a sample . it is usually a list , ordered by quantity . it will show the number of times each value appears . for example , if 100 people rate a five-point likert scale assessing their agreement with a statement on a scale on which 1 denotes strong agreement and 5 strong disagreement , the frequency distribution of their responses might look like : this simple table has two drawbacks . when a variable can take continuous values instead of discrete values or when the number of possible values is too large , the table construction is difficult , if it is not impossible . a slightly different scheme based on the range of values is used in such cases . for example , if we consider the heights of the students in a class , the frequency table might look like below . managing and operating on frequency tabulated data is much simpler than operation on raw data . there are simple algorithms to calculate median , mean ( statistics ) , standard deviation etc . from these tables .
