Deutsche Reichspartei     the deutsche reichspartei ( drp ) ( `` german reich party '' , `` german imperial party '' or `` german empire party '' ) was a nationalist political party in west germany . it was a merger of the german conservative party - deutsche right party ( dkp-drp ) and the old hessian nationaldemokratischen partei ( ndp ) . some of the drp 's founders were : alexander andrae , oskar lutz , hans bernd von grünberg , wilhelm meinberg , otto heß , hans schikora , heinrich kunstmann , adolf von thadden . in 1949 the sozialistische reichspartei ( srp ) split from the drp . this was because the empire party was not neo-nazi , and did not want to be associated with adolf hitler . instead the party preferred to say how good the second german empire ( 1870-1919 ) was . the deutsche reichspartei did become more national socialist after 1952. this is when the sozialistische reichspartei was banned by the federal constitutional court of germany and a lot of its members re-joined the empire party . the party was not very successful in the 1950s , but seemed to be getting more popular after the state elections of 1959. but the success did not last , and the party held its final conference in 1964 when it was dissolved . it was quickly replaced by the new nationaldemokratische partei deutschlands .
