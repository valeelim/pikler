Herd     a herd is a large group of animals . the term is used for mammals , particularly hoofed animals . herding is a good example of collective animal behavior . other terms are used for similar types of behavior in other types of animal . for example , a large group of birds is usually called a `` flock '' ( this may also refer to certain mammals as well ) and a large group of carnivores is usually called a `` pack '' . in addition , special collective nouns may be used for particular cases : for example a flock of geese , if not in flight , is sometimes called a gaggle . however , in theoretical discussions in behavioural ecology , the term `` herd '' is used for all these kinds of assemblage . a herd may also refer to one that tends and cares for such groups ( e.i . shepherds tend to sheep , and goatherds tend to goats , etc. ) . when an association of animals ( or , by extension , people ) is described as a `` herd '' , that means that the group tends to act together ( for example , all moving in the same direction at a given time ) , but that this does not occur as a result of planning or co-ordination . rather , each individual is choosing behaviour that corresponds to that of the majority of other members , possibly through imitation or possibly because all are responding to the same external circumstances . a herd can be contrasted with a co-ordinated group where individuals have distinct roles . many human groupings , such as an army detachments or sports teams , show such co-ordination and differentiation of roles , but so do some animal groupings such as those of eusocial insects , which are co-ordinated through pheromones and other forms of animal communication . conversely , some human groupings may behave more like herds .
