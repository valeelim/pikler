Digestion     digestion is the way that an organism changes a substance into nutrients . this happens in the gastrointestinal system . humans start digesting food in the mouth . food is chewed by the teeth . food is swallowed , which means it goes through the esophagus . it goes into the stomach , where it is mixed with acid . digestion occurs in three phases . mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can be got at by digestive enzymes . in chemical digestion , enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use . finally , the nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream . once in the blood stream the nutrients are taken to the liver , which is a kind of chemical factory for the body . after we swallow food , it travels down a muscular tube to the stomach . there , it is mashed into a mixture like soup . the mixture passes into the small intestine , where tiny bits of food pass into the bloodstream . the food that is still left goes into the large intestine . finally , waste products leave the body . digestion usually takes about 18 hours . food stays in the stomach for about three hours . if uncoiled , the small intestine would be about six meters ( 20 feet ) long . many digestive tracts are about as long as a bus .
