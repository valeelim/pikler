Electron shell     an electron shell is the outside part of an atom around the atomic nucleus . it is a group of atomic orbitals with the same value of the principal quantum number `` n '' . electron shells have one or more electron subshells , or sublevels . these sublevels have two or more orbitals with the same angular momentum quantum number `` l '' . electron shells make up the electron configuration of an atom . the number of electrons that can be in a shell is equal to formula_1 . the name for electron shells comes from the bohr model , in which groups of electrons were believed to go around the nucleus at certain distances , so that their orbits formed `` shells '' . the valence shell is the outermost shell of an atom in its uncombined state , which contains the electrons most likely to account for the nature of any reactions involving the atom and of the bonding interactions it has with other atoms . care must be taken to note that the outermost shell of an ion is not commonly termed valence shell . electrons in the valence shell are referred to as valence electrons .
