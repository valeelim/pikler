Copyright infringement of software     copyright infringement of software ( also called software piracy ) refers to the illegal copying of software , music or films or the spread of these things on the internet . copying movies is also called bootlegging . some countries have laws about this . the problem is considered to be bigger in certain countries than in others . those who hold the copyright get less money because of copyright infringement . as a result of this , some copyright holders publish “ anti-piracy ” campaigns to tell people about the effects of infringement . very often , the people making the laws have to make a trade-off between allowing people to copy and use the content , and the copyright holders charging for the content . at the same time , even not allowed distribution makes the content more popular . because of these two reasons , infringement of copyright for proprietary software and content can be bad also for free software and content . in 2010 to 2012 , the entertainment industry advocated changes to united states law to make it easier to end piracy websites , called stop online piracy act and protect ip act . some websites including the english wikipedia protested these proposals on january 18 , 2012. the next day , the united states department of justice seized the megaupload website which is claimed to be one of the largest piracy websites .
