Order of the British Empire     the most excellent order of the british empire is one of the british orders of chivalry . it is the newest order , created on 4 june 1917 , by king george v. the order is cut into two parts , civil and military . both parts have five classes or ranks . in order , from top to bottom , these are : - `` knight '' or `` dame grand cross '' ( gbe ) - `` knight '' or `` dame commander '' ( kbe or dbe ) - `` commander '' ( cbe ) - `` officer '' ( obe ) - `` member '' ( mbe ) only the two highest ranks are knighthoods , and allow the holder to call themselves 'sir ' ( male ) or 'dame ' ( female ) . if the person is not a citizen of a country where the queen is head of state , the award is called honorary , and the holder can not use the title before their name . for example terry wogan became a british citizen and was therefore called sir terry wogan , but bob geldof is still irish , and is not `` sir bob '' . the british empire medal ( bem ) is not given in the united kingdom anymore , but is still used by the cook islands and by some other commonwealth nations .
