Elasticity (economics)    elasticity ( economics ) in economics , people talk about elasticity of an economic variable , usually supply or demand , in relation to another economic variable such as income or price . the elasticity of a variable is a measure of how much the variable changes in response to a change in a second variable . if the price for a good with a price-elastic demand goes up , the demand for it will go down . for example , people will buy fewer dvds if dvds get more expensive âˆ’ dvds have a price-elastic demand . if a good has a completely price-inelastic demand , the demand for it will not be affected by the price of it . for example , if the price of salt increases , people will not buy less of it . they need their daily salt intake . the demand of salt is therefore price-inelastic . elasticity is often measured in percents . if a 2 % increase in price causes people to buy 1 % fewer of a product , it has a price elasticity of demand of -0.5. other pages . - price elasticity of demand - income elasticity of demand
