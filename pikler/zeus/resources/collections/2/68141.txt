Kippah     a yarmulke ( yiddish ) or kippah ( hebrew ) is a small cloth cap worn by jews . traditionally it was worn only by men , but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of judaism has led some women to wear yarmulkes . some jews only wear yarmulkes while praying ; others wear yarmulkes the entire day , making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering ( especially outside ) . the basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the talmud ( tractate shabbat ) . often , the color and fabric of the `` yarmulke '' can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement . the israeli national religious community is often referred to by the name `` kipot srugot '' כיפות סרוגות , literally `` woven yarmulkes '' . similarly , some haredi sects are referred to by the name `` kipot shkhorot '' כיפות שחורות , literally `` black yarmulkes '' . the etymology of `` yarmulke '' is unclear . linguists ( e.g . max vasmer ) maintain that the yiddish word is derived ( via russian or polish ) from the turkic `` '' , meaning 'raincoat ' .
