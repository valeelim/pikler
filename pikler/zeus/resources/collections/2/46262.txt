Coral     corals are formed by small animals , the polyps of the phylum cnidaria . they are marine , either on continental shelves or round oceanic islands . they live in colonies . all the polyps in a colony are zooids : they are all clones , genetically identical . inside the colony they breed by asexual reproduction . they also reproduce sexually . colonies of the same species release gametes together , over one , two or three nights around a full moon . each coral animal is like a small bag . the opening on top is the mouth . tentacles ( little arms ) around the mouth carry stinging nematocysts , which paralyse the small animals eaten by the coral polyps . coral usually grows in tropical oceans . a few corals grow in cold water , like the oceans around the british isles and norway . most corals get energy and nutrients from symbiosis with photosynthetic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae . such corals need sunlight and grow in clear , shallow water , typically at depths less than 60 metres ( 200 ft ) . many corals ( and some other cnidaria ) live with zooxanthellae of the genus `` symbiodinium '' , which are dinoflagellates . usually , each polyp harbours one species of algae . by photosynthesis , these provide energy for the coral , and help calcification .
