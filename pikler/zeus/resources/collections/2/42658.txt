CD-RW     a cd-rw ( which stands for compact disc rewritable ) is a compact disc that can be recorded and erased multiple times . it can hold data or music . most of the time it will hold data , since many cd players can not play cd-rws . during its development , the format was known as cd-e , which stands for compact disc erasable . the standard was introduced in 1997. it replaced the less successful cd-mo . the disk used for this is an optical disc . phase change technology is used to write to the disk . a laser beam is used to heat a certain point of the disk . once this point is hot , the information stored there can be changed . according to what the manufacturers of these disks say , it is possible to record and erase such a disk up to 1000 times . they behave very much like cd-rs , otherwise . entire sessions can be written . as long as there is space on the disc , new sessions can be appended . to be readable in an ordinary cd drive , all sessions must be closed though . cd-rws never gained the popularity of cd-rs . this is because they are more expensive to make and to buy . also , not all cd drives can read them . reading and writing speeds are also lower than those of pre-made cds and cd-rs .
