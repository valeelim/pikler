Rojava     rojava , or western kurdistan , or syrian kurdistan , is a part of divided kurdistan in the middle east . it consists of three areas called 'cantons ' in northern syria but the syrian government is not in control there . instead , since a revolution which happened early on in the syrian civil war , it has had its own independent government , although it does not claim to be a new independent country , calling itself a 'federal autonomous region ' inside of syria instead . many people in rojava are kurds , but there are also many different ethnic groups living there , such as arabs , syriacs , assyrians , and yezidis . kurds are the largest ethnic minority group in syria . before the civil war , many human rights organizations such as amnesty international said that the syrian government treated the kurds very poorly . kurds in syria are not allowed to officially use the kurdish language , and also not allowed to register children with kurdish names , start businesses that do not have arabic names , build kurdish private schools , or publish any books or other materials written in kurdish . but this is no longer enforced due to the civil war .
