Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany     the basic law of the federal republic of germany is the name of germany 's constitution . it was written in 1949 when germany was split into the countries of east germany and west germany . many parts of the constitution are very different from the constitution of the weimar republic . the writers decided not to call it the constitution because they hoped it would only be a temporary law for west germany and that the two germanys would soon be made into one . it was more than 40 years before east germany and west germany became one country again , but the old name of basic law has been kept . the federal constiutional court ( german : bundesverfassungsgericht ) protects the constitution by banning laws which break the constitution . there are some `` eternal clauses '' in the constitution which the court will protect even by banning `` constitutional amendments '' ( laws to change them ) . article 1 , about human life , and article 20 's basic principles are protected from change . this is to make sure nothing like the nazi period happens again . the nazis were able to pass an act which allowed hitler to rule by decree .
