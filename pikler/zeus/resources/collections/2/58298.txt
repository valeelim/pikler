Hornet     hornets are the largest of the social wasps . they can reach up to 55mm ( 5.5 cm , 2.2in ) in length . the `` true hornets '' make up the genus vespa . true hornets can be distinguished from other vespines by the form of their head . hornets live in europe , asia , africa , and the americas . they live in warm and wet forests , and in desert climates . they do not occur in climates where it is cold all year round . in spring , a queen will found a new `` nest '' ( or `` hive '' ) . the queen will start building a basic nest . in the built space she will lay eggs . these hatch , and become larvae . the queen will feed the first larvae , until they make a cocoon . after transforming , they will become the first `` workers '' . these will do most of the work . the workers will build a hierarchy amongst themselves . if the space where the nest is built becomes too small , the colony will move to another spot . in autumn young queens will hatch . young males will hatch from unfertilized eggs . these males are called drones . the young queens will build a cocoon to spend the winter , once they have been fertilized . all the other animals will die with the first frost .
