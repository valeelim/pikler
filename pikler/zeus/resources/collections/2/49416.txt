Felt     felt is a type of cloth that is made by matting wool fibers , either with water and soap , or by poking the fibers with barbed needles . felt can be made by hand , or by machine . people have been making felt longer than any other kind of fabric . felt can be of any color , and made into any shape or size . felt is used to make many things like clothing , hats , and rugs . nomadic people in many countries live in tents made of felt . felt is used for many different things . today people use felt for hat-making , insulating ( making warm ) , sound-proofing , and cushioning . the difference between felt and most fabrics , like denim , is that most fabrics have a regular criss-cross , in-and-out weaving pattern , but felt is a messy of threads . most fabrics are woven for strength and smoothness : they need carding to straighten the fibers , spinning to turn fibers into long threads and weaving to make fabric . felt only needs a carding comb . because of this , felt was often used by nomadic people .
