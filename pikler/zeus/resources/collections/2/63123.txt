Cash     in bookkeeping and finance , `` cash '' can also refer to checks , money orders , cashier 's checks , bank drafts , or traveler 's checks . in all these forms , the term indicates the most liquid form of assets , which have a fixed value and can be easily converted to currency : `` ready money '' . for example , wages or salaries paid as `` cash '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , stock options ) would in most countries normally be paid with checks or direct bank deposits , which are trivially convertible to currency .
