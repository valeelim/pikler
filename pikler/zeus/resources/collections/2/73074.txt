Intermolecular force     in physics , chemistry , and biology , intermolecular forces are forces that act between stable molecules or between functional groups of macromolecules . these forces are generally much weaker than the chemical bonding forces . their bonding energies are less than a few kcal/mol . but they are responsible for many different physical , chemical , and biological phenomena . in general one distinguishes short and long range intermolecular forces . hydrogen bonding is an intermolecular interaction with a hydrogen atom being present in the intermolecular bond . related pages . - chemical bond other websites . software for calculation of intermolecular forces . - quantum 3.2 - sapt : an ab initio quantumchemical package .
