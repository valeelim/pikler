European Union budget     the european union ( eu ) has an independent parliament and civil service which is distinct from those of the 27 member states . it has to pay for on common policies throughout the eu . therefore , the eu has an agreed budget of €862 billion for the period 2007-2013. by comparison , the uk expenditure for 2004 alone was estimated at about €759 billion . the eu has three elements to its government : the council of ministers , the european commission and the european parliament . all three take a part in setting the annual budget . the eu obtains most of its revenue indirectly by payments from treasuries of member states . revenue is divided into three categories . traditional own resources are taxes raised on behalf of the eu as a whole , principally import duties on goods brought into the eu . these are collected by the state where import occurs and passed on to the eu . states are allowed to keep a proportion of the revenue to cover administration . vat based own resources are taxes on eu citizens as a proportion of value added tax in each member country . vat rates and exemptions vary in different countries , so a formula is used to create the 'harmonised tax base ' . the starting point for calculations is the total vat raised in a country .
