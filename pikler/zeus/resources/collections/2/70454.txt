Drag (physics)    drag ( physics ) in fluid dynamics , drag ( sometimes called resistance ) is a force which tends to slow the movement of an object through a liquid or gas . as a moving object pushes the liquid or gas out of its way , the fluid pushes back on the object . this drag force is always opposite to the object 's motion , and unlike friction between solid surfaces , the drag force increases as the object moves faster . air resistance , also known as drag , is a force that is caused by air , the force acts in the opposite direction to an object moving through the air . it is where air particles hit the front of the object slowing it down . the more surface area , the more air particles hit it and the greater the resistance . for example , a truck with a flat front will experience high air resistance while a sports car with a streamlined shape will experience lower air resistance , allowing the car to go faster . this is why airplanes and other fast machines are streamlined . a snowflake falls more slowly than does a drop of water of the same weight .
