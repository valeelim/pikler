Symphony No. 9 &quot;Choral&quot; (Beethoven)    symphony no . 9 & quot ; choral & quot ; ( beethoven ) symphony no . 9 in d minor op 125 ( choral symphony ) by ludwig van beethoven is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written . a symphony is a piece of music for orchestra . beethoven wrote nine symphonies . this one , the last one he wrote , is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it : there are four soloists ( soprano , alto , tenor and bass ) and a choir . this is why it is known as the “ choral ” symphony ( “ choral ” means : “ for choir ” ) . it is a very long work , lasting more than an hour . this , too , was unusual . this symphony has four movements . the first movement is in sonata form . the second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order : the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement . it is a theme and variations . the last movement sets the words of a poem by friedrich schiller , a famous poet who had only recently died . the poem was called `` ode an die freude '' ( in english : `` ode to joy '' ) . the poem has a strong message to all mankind : it is about living in peace and harmony together . it was written at the time of the french revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in europe .
