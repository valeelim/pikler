The Apostles (Elgar)    the apostles ( elgar ) the apostles , op . 49 , is an oratorio for soloists , chorus and orchestra composed by edward elgar . it was first performed on october 14 , 1903. elgar had been thinking for many years about writing a musical work about jesus 's twelve apostles . he was already 42 when his orchestral work `` enigma variations '' was first performed in 1899. he was then asked by the birmingham triennial music festival to compose a big work for the following year . at first he thought of writing `` the apostles '' , but then he realized he would need more than a year to write it , so he composed an oratorio called `` the dream of gerontius '' . when it was first performed it was not a success . this was because the orchestra and choir had only had two weeks to learn it and also because the conductor did not like elgar 's music anyway . then it was performed in d√ºsseldorf in germany and shortly afterwards in westminster cathedral , london . both these performances were greeted with lots of applause . elgar was given a doctorate ( title of dr ) by the university of cambridge and he was becoming famous . he started to work on `` the apostles '' , and it was performed in birmingham in 1903 .
