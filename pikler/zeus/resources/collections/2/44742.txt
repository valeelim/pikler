Artificial neural network     a neural network ( also called an ann or an artificial neural network ) is a sort of computer software inspired by the human brain . neural networks are studied in a field of machine learning named deep learning . the brain solves problems with large clusters of biological neurons connected by axons . similarly , a neural network is made up of interconnected cells that work together to produce a result . this is one of the possible ways artificial intelligence may work . most neural networks can still operate if one or more of the processing cells fail . neural networks learn to do things based on examples . traditional software can only do what it is specifically written to do . neural networks are so complex that they often need millions or billions of examples to do well . there are two ways to think of a neural network . first is like a human brain . second is like a mathematical equation . a network starts with an input , somewhat like a sensory organ . information then flows through layers of neurons , where each neuron is connected to many other neurons . if a particular neurons receives enough stimuli , then it sends a message to any other neuron is it connected to through its axon . similarly , an artificial neural network has an input layer of data , one or more hidden layers of classifiers , and an output layer . each node in each hidden layer is connected to a node in the next layer . when a node receives information , it sends along some amount of it to the nodes it is connected to . the amount is determined by a mathematical function called an activation function , such as sigmoid or tanh .
