Edgar the Atheling     edgar the atheling ( or edgar the ætheling , c. 1057 – c. 1125 ) was a claimant to the throne of england in 1066 after edward the confessor died . edgar was a popular choice among the english , because he was english and a grandson of edmund ironside . he was born in hungary because his father was in exile there . when edgar was five , his father , edward the exile returned to england from hungary ( he had been exiled from england during the viking reign ) . soon after returning , edgar ’ s father died under mysterious circumstances . edward the confessor , who had no children , had promised the throne to his nephew edward the exile , his nearest living relative . in 1057 , the king 's messengers found edward the exile , his wife agatha , their two daughters and son edgar living in hungary . edward agreed to return to england and brought his family . but a few days after their arrival edward was killed . at the time edgar was only five years old . when edward the confessor died edgar was still young ( 15 years old ) and had no experience , money or soldiers . the leaders in england expected attacks from norway and normandy . under these conditions , edgar was not a good choice as king . royal succession in anglo-saxon england was determined by the witenagemot ( witan ) , a council of wise men .
