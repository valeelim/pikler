Dark matter     dark matter is a type of matter thought to be responsible for much of the mass in the universe . the idea arose when astronomers found that the mass of large astronomical objects , figured out from their gravitational effects , was much greater than the mass figured out from the `` luminous matter '' they contain : stars , gas , and dust . dark matter was first proposed by jan oort in 1932 as a reason for the spinning speeds of stars in the milky way . fritz zwicky in 1933 used dark matter to explain `` missing mass '' in the spinning speeds of galaxies in clusters . later , many other observations have suggested that there is dark matter in the universe . the spinning speeds of galaxies , gravitational lensing of background objects , the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies : these are some of the examples that make scientists believe in dark matter . according to the planck mission team , and based on the standard model of cosmology , the total massâ€“energy of the known universe contains 4.9 % ordinary matter , 26.8 % dark matter and 68.3 % dark energy . thus , dark matter is estimated to make up 84.5 % of the total matter in the universe , while dark energy plus dark matter make up 95.1 % of the total `` stuff '' in the universe .
