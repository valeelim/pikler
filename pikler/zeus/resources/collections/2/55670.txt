Eubie Blake     eubie blake ( february 7 , 1883 or 1887 - february 12 , 1983 ) was an american pianist and composer . there is some confusion about his birth date . during the latter part of his life he had said that he was born in 1883. however , recently released documents - the 1900 united states census , his world war 1 draft card , his social security registration and his passport registration - all say that he was born in 1887. people saying they were born earlier than they actually were ( `` back dating '' ) was common with musicians from that time . jelly roll morton is another well known example of this . blake also said that he composed his `` charleston rag '' in 1899. if this was true , he would have been 12 years old at the time . there is no evidence he was composing at that age or at that time . people who study ragtime believe this may be another case of `` backdating '' . blake was born in baltimore , maryland .
