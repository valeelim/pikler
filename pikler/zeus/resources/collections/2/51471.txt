Cowry     cowry shells ( or cowrie ) , are marine snails of the family cypraeidae . they are found chiefly in tropical regions . there are about 200 different species of cowry . the shell itself is almost always very smooth and shiny . they have with a long , narrow , slit-like opening . all varieties have a porcelain-like shine and many have colorful patterns . in life the shell is covered by the slippery mantle . shell sizes range from 5 mm ( 1/5 '' ) for some tropical species to 15 cm ( 6 '' ) for the tiger cowry , `` cypraea tigris '' . the slippery shell is very difficult for most animals to grip . the very narrow toothed aperture of the cowry shell makes it difficult for predators to reach into . however cowries are still vulnerable to predation : - some tropical crustaceans can break the dorsum of a cowry shell . - some mollusc-eating cones like `` conus textile '' can inject venom into the cowry 's flesh . the cone then extends its stomach into the shell , through the slit , to completely ingest the flesh . - some octopuses can gouge a small hole ( using a special barb/tooth and an acidic secretion ) through the shell to inject a venom that kills the animal within .
