Great Plague of London     during the great plague of london ( 1665-1666 ) , the disease called the bubonic plague killed about 100,000 people in london , england . in seven months , almost one quarter of london 's population ( one out of every four londoners ) died from the plague . at its worst , in september of 1665 , the plague killed 7,165 people in one week . after this , the number of people dying from the plague began to slow down . around september of 1666 , the great outbreak ended . the great fire of london , which happened on 2-3 september 1666 , may have helped end the outbreak by killing many of the rats and fleas who were spreading the plague . though most of the people who died during the great plague lived in london , the plague also killed people in other areas of england . by the time the great plague ended , about 2.5 % of england 's population had died from the plague . to compare , about 2 % of the entire united kingdom 's population ( including soldiers and civilians ) died in world war i , and about 1 % of the entire united kingdom 's population died in world war ii .
