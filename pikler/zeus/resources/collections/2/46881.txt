Binary operation     in mathematics , a binary operation , often denoted * , on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set . for example , if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation * be addition , then their sum is also a natural number , and is the result of applying this particular binary operation . another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication . for instance , take the natural numbers 2 and 3. when multiplied together they give 6 , another natural number . others : the sum between matrices . the composition of functions . the union and the intersection of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets , or on subsets in a power set .
