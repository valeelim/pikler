Dew point     the dew point is the temperature where water vapour condenses into liquid water . all air holds different amounts of water vapour . the dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air . the higher the dew point is , the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature . the dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air . condensation of water vapour starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond . the dew point , like other measures of humidity , can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer . other pages . - relative humidity other websites . - what is the dew point ? - noaa dew point - dew point formula - windows program for heat index , dew point , etc - dew point evaporates on kprc newscast ( `` the dew point is absolutely worthless information '' ) - often needed answers about temp , humidity & dew point from the sci.geo.meteorology usenet newsgroup
