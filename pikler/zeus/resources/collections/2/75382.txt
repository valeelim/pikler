Song cycle     a song cycle in classical music is a group of songs that belong together . although each song may be sung separately , the composer really imagined that they would be performed together as one work . sometimes they tell a story , but sometimes they just belong together because they are about the same idea ( e.g . the sadness that can be caused by love ) . they are often for solo voice and piano accompaniment , but they can also be without accompaniment , or with several instruments or even a whole orchestra . the words of a cycle are often by the same poet , but this is not always the case . song cycles started to become popular with composers in the romantic period . although there were examples of song cycles written before that , it was the german composers of the 19th century who are most often thought of as writers of song cycles . their songs are called `` lieder '' . the great composer franz schubert wrote about 600 songs . these include two long song cycles : `` winterreise '' ( `` winter ’ s journey '' ) and `` die schöne müllerin '' ( `` the beautiful miller ’ s daughter '' ) . each of these song cycles is long enough for a whole concert . robert schumann wrote song cycles including two which he simply called `` liederkreise '' ( `` song cycles '' ) , and his well-known `` dichterliebe '' ( `` poet ’ s love '' ) and `` frauenliebe und -leben '' ( `` women ’ s love and life '' ) . brahms wrote `` vier ernste gesänge '' ( `` four serious songs '' ) , and gustav mahler , who became very interested in folk song , wrote several song cycles with orchestra accompaniment , including `` das lied von der erde '' ( `` the song of the earth '' ) .
