Atlas     an atlas is a collection of maps or manifolds , traditionally bound into book form , but also found in multimedia formats . it may show geographic features and political boundaries , but often social , religious and economic statistics as well . the earliest atlases were not called by that name at the time of their publication . the first book that could be called an atlas was constructed from the calculations of claudius ptolemy , a geographer who worked in alexandria circa a.d. 150. the first edition was published in bologna in 1477 and was illustrated with a set of 27 maps , though scholars say that it is not known whether the printed maps were engraved versions of original maps made by ptolemy , or whether they were constructed by medieval greek scholars from ptolemy 's text . from about 1544 , many maps were produced , especially in the important trading centers of rome and venice . each publisher worked independently . they produced maps based upon their own needs . the maps often varied dramatically in size . over time , it became common to bind the maps together into one book . although the term atlas was not in use in 1544 , these works are now called `` iato '' atlases - ( italian , assembled to order ) or more frequently `` lafreri atlases '' after one of the leading publishers of the period .
