Boudica     boudica ( born about 25 ad , died 60/61 ad ) was the queen of the celtic iceni people in norfolk in the eastern part of roman britain . a statue of boudica was put up in the westminster area of london in 1902. her husband prasutagus ruled an independent client state of rome . when he died , he left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the roman emperor . it was normal roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their client king . for example , the provinces of bithynia and galatia , were made part of the empire in just this way . also , roman law allowed inheritance only through the male line . when prasutagus died , his will was ignored by the governor , gaius suetonius paulinus , and his kingdom was annexed just as if it had been conquered . to make matters worse , roman money-lenders called in the debts which prasutagus had borrowed during his life . the lands and property of the iceni were confiscated and their nobles treated like slaves . when boudica protested , paulinus had her flogged , and her two daughters raped in public . tacitus reports :
