Ramanujan prime     in mathematics , a ramanujan prime is a prime number that satisfies a result proven by srinivasa ramanujan . it relates to the prime counting function . in 1919 , ramanujan published a new proof of bertrand 's postulate ( which had already been proven by pafnuty chebyshev ) . ramanujan 's result at the end of the paper was : where formula_2 '' ( x ) '' is the prime counting function . the prime counting function is the number of primes less than or equal to `` x '' . the numbers 2 , 11 , 17 , 29 , 41 are first few ramanujan primes . in other words : ramanujan primes are the integers `` r '' that are the smallest to satisfy the condition
