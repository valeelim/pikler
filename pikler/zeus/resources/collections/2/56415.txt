Magnitude (mathematics)    magnitude ( mathematics ) the magnitude of a mathematical object is its size : a property by which it can be larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind . in mathematical language one would say : it is an ordering of the class of objects to which it belongs . the ancient greeks between several types of magnitude , including : - ( positive ) fractions - line segments ( ordered by length ) - plane figures ( ordered by area ) - solids ( ordered by volume ) - angles ( ordered by angular magnitude ) they had proven that the first two could not be the same , or even isomorphic systems of magnitude . they did not consider negative magnitudes to be meaningful , and `` magnitude '' is still chiefly used in contexts in which zero is either the lowest size or less than all possible sizes . the magnitude of a real number is usually called the absolute value or modulus . it is written | `` x '' | , and is defined by : this gives the number 's distance from zero on the real number line . for example , the modulus of -5 is 5 .
