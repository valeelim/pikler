English Reformation     the english reformation was part of the protestant reformation . this led to some christian churches in europe breaking away from rome . each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way . earlier the roman catholic church had supreme powers . henry viii broke ties with the church and became head of the english church . this was called the royal supremacy . it was the beginning of the church of england . for years , the church of england was almost exactly the same as the catholic church , except that it was ruled by the king instead of the pope . this is different from the reformation on the european continent , where the reformers wanted big changes right away . there were several causes for the english reformation . one of these was that henry viii , who was king of england , wanted to divorce his wife , catherine of aragon . another reason was because henry wanted the church 's wealth and power . he thought that this would make him richer and more powerful .
