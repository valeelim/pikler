Cartesian coordinate system     in mathematics , the cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system used to place points on a plane using two numbers , usually called the `` x-coordinate '' and the `` y-coordinate '' . to place the coordinates , two perpendicular lines , called axes ( singular : axis ) , are drawn . cartesian coordinates can be used in 3d , by adding a third number , the `` z-coordinate '' . each added coordinate represents a dimension . using the cartesian coordinate system , simple shapes , like parabolas , can be made using algebraic equations . the results of the equations can be plotted ( drawn ) on the cartesian grid , and a shape appears . for example , a circle can be made with the equation x² + y² = 4 ( see figure 2 ) . the name cartesian comes from the french mathematician and philosopher rené descartes ( latin : `` cartesius '' ) , who worked to merge algebra and euclidean geometry . this work was important in creating calculus and cartography . the idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two works by descartes . in part two of his `` discourse on method '' , descartes explains plotting the position of a point or object on a surface , using two perpendicular axes as measuring guides . in `` la géométrie '' , he further explores these ideas .
