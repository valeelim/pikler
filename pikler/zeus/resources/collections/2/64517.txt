Names for small numbers     naming very small numbers is the same as naming very big numbers , but with one important difference . there is a minus sign over what the 10 in the formula is raised to . so if one wanted to write 0.007 in shorthand form , they would write it 7 x 10 since 7 is the third digit after the decimal point ( the zero in front of the decimal point does not count ) . naming a very small number with lots of different numbers inside it is the same as doing it with a very big number , but again with that one difference of the minus sign . so 0.0000452 would become 4.52 x 10 ( 0.0000452 -- > 4.52 x 0.00001 -- > 4.52 x 10 ) . other pages . - names for large numbers other websites . - names of large and small numbers
