Ceres (dwarf planet)    ceres ( dwarf planet ) ceres , also known as 1 ceres , is the smallest dwarf planet in the solar system and the only one in the main asteroid belt . it was discovered on 1 january 1801 , by giuseppe piazzi , and is named after the roman goddess ceresâ€”the goddess of growing plants , the harvest , and of motherly love . after about 200 years from its discovery , the international astronomical union decided to upgrade ceres from an asteroid ( or minor planet ) to dwarf planetary status in 2006. with a diameter of about 950 km , ceres is by far the largest and most massive object in the asteroid belt , and has about a third of the belt 's total mass . it was once thought to be smaller than vesta , which is brighter . recent observations have discovered that the asteroid is spherical , unlike the irregular shapes of smaller bodies with lower gravity . at its brightest it is still too dim to be seen with the naked eye . on september 27 , 2007 , nasa launched the dawn space probe to explore ceres and vesta . related pages .
