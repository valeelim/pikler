Chromatography     chromatography is a method using mixed substances that depends on the speed at which they move through special `` media '' , or chemical substances . it consists of a `` stationary phase '' ( a solid ) and a `` mobile phase '' ( a liquid or a gas ) . the mobile phase flows through the stationary phase . chromatography is much used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry . the stationary phase is a flat plane , such as paper , or a substance on glass . `` paper chromatography '' is a technique for separating and identifying mixtures that are ( or can be ) coloured . it has been largely replaced by `` thin layer chromatography '' , but is still a powerful teaching tool . `` double-way paper chromatography '' , also called 'two-dimensional chromatography ' , uses two solvents and rotates the paper 90Â° in between . it is useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds having similar polarity , for example , amino acids . the compounds used initially ensures you to know whether the colour is pure , ( one substance only ) or mixtures ( multiple substances . )
