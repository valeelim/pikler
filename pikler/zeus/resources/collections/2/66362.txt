Ilocos     ilocos collectively refers to two provinces in the philippines : ilocos norte and ilocos sur . inhabitants are called `` ilocanos '' and they speak the ilocano language . the term ilocos region is derived from this term . however , the designation of ilocos as the basis of the name of the region promotes the wrong notion that all the residents of region 1 are ilocanos . because 28 % of the inhabitants are pangasinan people , who belong to a different ethno-linguistic group from the ilocanos .
