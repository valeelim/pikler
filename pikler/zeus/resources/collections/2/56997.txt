Arpeggio     in music , an arpeggio is a group of notes in a chord which are played one after the other , instead of all at the same time . the arpeggio may either go up or go down , but it is more common going up . the word `` arpeggio '' comes from the italian word `` arpeggiare '' , which means `` to play on a harp '' . this is because harps are very good at playing arpeggiated chords . an arpeggio is a type of broken chord , but there are many different kinds . learning many musical instruments include playing scales and arpeggios . they are often played as part of music examinations , especially for piano and the string instruments . this is because these skills are useful for playing a lot of music . for example , bach 's prelude in c ( ) is made of many different arpeggios . guitarists sometimes play arpeggios instead of strumming , and banjo players do it a lot . an `` arpeggiated chord '' means a chord which is `` spread '' . this means the notes do not start exactly at the same time . this is sometimes called `` arpeggiato '' , and in modern music is called a `` rolled chord '' . an arpeggiated chord is written with a wiggly line going from top to bottom in front of the chord . an arpeggiated chord is spread from the lowest to the highest note . occasionally composers such as béla bartók ask for them to be played from top to bottom . this is shown by adding an arrow pointing down .
