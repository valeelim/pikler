Israeli West Bank barrier     israel-west-bank barrier is a wall built by the state of israel to separate palestinian territories from israel . it is built mostly of fences and in some places it is built of high concrete walls . there are many arguments about the barrier . people who want the barrier say it is needed to protect israeli civilians from palestinian terrorism , including suicide bombing attacks . since the barrier was built , the number of attacks has gone down . people who are against the barrier say that it is against international law because israel and the palestinians have not agreed where the border between them should be . israel has built the barrier without consensus . this will make talks about deciding the borders more difficult .
