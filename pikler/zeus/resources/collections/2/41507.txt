Shotgun     a shotgun is a type of gun . to make a shotgun work , gunpowder is lit by a primer inside of a shotgun shell . the gas from the burning gunpowder will push whatever is being fired out of the barrel . usually a shotgun shell will have many small metal balls called `` buckshot '' or `` birdshot '' . these balls spread out when they are fired . sometimes a shotgun shell will have a bigger piece of metal , like a bullet , called a `` slug '' . a shotgun can have one or two barrels , each with a chamber to hold a shell . these barrels can be next to each other or on top of each other . there are also different types of ways of loading and shooting a shotgun . some will snap open , and shells can be put inside until they are shot again . others hold more shells and are pumped back and forth to shoot . some shotguns are semi automatic , so each time the trigger is pulled , one shot is fired without any need to use a pump or a lever . some shotguns are fully automatic , meaning that pulling and holding the trigger back will keep shooting the gun without needing to reload until the shotgun is out of ammunition . however , these are uncommon .
