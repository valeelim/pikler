Monogenea     monogenea are a type of flatworm . they are parasites which means that they always need another creature to live on . they live on the outside of their host . some parasites , like tapeworms , live on the inside of a larger creature . monogenea are especially common on the skin , fins and gills of fish . less commonly , they can be found in the urinary bladder and rectum of cold-blooded vertebrates . no types of monogenea infect birds , but one ( `` oculotrema hippopotami '' ) infects mammals . it is a parasite in the eye of a hippopotamus . monogenea are usually hermaphrodites . this means that they have both sexes . first they are males , and only later do they become females as well . they have direct life-cycles with no asexual reproduction ( unlike the digenea ) . in those types of monogenea that lay eggs , the young ones grow to a larval stage called an `` oncomiracidium '' . it is at the `` larva '' stage that they are able to travel from one host creature to another . when they are adults , monogenea eat the blood , mucus , and epithelial cells of their host creature .
