Nintendo Virtual Boy     the nintendo virtual boy was a mostly-portable ( easily moved ) game console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics . to use the system , one had to put one 's face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen . by showing each eye a different image , the system could create a 3d effect . the way the system displayed images was not by lcds , as some would think . at the time , lcds could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console : they would blur if anything moved on the screen , and users would see double instead of depth . instead , a vertical line of 224 very bright , but very small , leds were used for each eye . these leds flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns . this line of leds was then magnified by a lens , and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye , creating a full image due to the human eye 's persistence of vision . unfortunately , due to the quick flashing of the leds , many users felt sick , became dizzy , or had headaches after playing for a long time . to help this , an `` automatic pause '' feature was added , which stopped the game play every 30 minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes .
