Tarantella     a tarantella is a very fast dance in 6/8 time . the name comes from the town of taranto in italy . people used to believe that if someone was bitten by a tarantula spider they needed to do this dance in order to drive out the poison . the dancer would get more and more excited until he ( or she ) seemed mad . some people think that maybe these people never really believed this , but that it was an excuse to dance at a time when the church said that dancing was not allowed . the spider is , in fact , only a little bit poisonous . some composers enjoyed writing fast pieces in 6/8 time which they called `` tarantella '' . mendelssohn wrote one as the last movement of his symphony no 4 ( the italian ) . chopin and liszt also wrote tarantellas . other pages . - arachnophobia
