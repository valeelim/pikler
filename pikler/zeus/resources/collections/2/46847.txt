Theory of computation     the theory of computation is a branch of mathematics . generally it is seen as belonging to computer science . the field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer . if this is the case , then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way . there are two major branches in it . the first is computability theory . it looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer . since this is a theoretical field of study , no real computers are used . they are replaced by a system called the turing machine . once it is known if such a solution exists , computer scientists want to know if it can be found , and perhaps how it can be improved . this field of study is covered by the complexity theory . that theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another . such methods are usually called algorithms . this is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do .
