Ultrasound     ultrasound is a type of sound with a frequency bigger than humans can hear . this frequency , the 'upper-limit of human hearing , ' is approximately 20,000 hertz ( 20 kilohertz ) . some animals , such as dogs , dolphins , bats , and mice , are able to hear sounds which have a frequency greater than upper-limit of the human ear . this makes them able to hear ultrasounds . children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults can not hear , as in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing gets lower as a person gets older . this frequency limit is caused by the middle ear that acts as a low-pass filter . if ultrasound is fed directly into the skull bone and reaches the cochlea without passing through the middle ear , much higher frequencies ( up to about 200 khz ) can be heard . this effect ( sometimes called ultrasonic hearing ) was first discovered by divers exposed to a high-frequency ( ca . 50 khz ) sonar signal . medical ultrasonography is commonly used during pregnancy . ultrasound is generally thought of as a `` safe test '' because it does not use destructive ionizing radiation like x-rays , nuclear medicine , or cat scanning .
