Windsurfing     windsurfing is a water sport invented in the u.k. by peter chilvers in 1958 on hayling island , hampshire . it is performed on a board with a sail . the sail both empowers the board and helps the board change directions . the sport is a combination of surfing and sailing . windsurfers can travel on either flat or rough water , as long as there is wind . windsurfing is done mostly in the summer and spring . windsurfing competitions can be freestyle or racing around buoys and it features in the olympics . windsurfing sails come in many different sizes . the larger the sails are , the more human strength is needed to control them , but the more power is given to go faster . the different sizes of board affect the speed . again , the thinner the board , the faster you will go . the range of thickness depends on the materials used . another sport similar to windsurfing is kite surfing . all these sports have boards that range in size and price , but all need much practice to be done well . there are many sporting places around the world that people travel to just to go surfing . some of the best places are in the west coast of the united states , hawaii , australia , and indonesia .
