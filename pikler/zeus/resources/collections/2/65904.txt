School colors     school colors are the colors representing the school of which one goes to . school colors are often found in pairs and rarely no more than trios , though some professional teams use up to four colors in a set . the choice of colors usually follows the rule of tincture from heraldry , but exceptions to this rule are known . common primary colors include orange , purple , blue , red , and green . these colors are either paired with a color representing a metal ( often black , brown , gray ( or silver ) , white , or gold ) , or occasionally each other , such as orange/blue , red/green , or blue/yellow . pairing two metals , such as black/white , silver or gold , and especially black/gold , is also a common practice . finally , some american schools , in a display of patriotism , adopt the national colors of red/white/blue . in an effort to further establish identity and promote a standard , many institutions often decree the use of specific shades of colors . maroon , generally regarded as a darker shade of red , is a common primary color . various shades of blue , from powder to prussian , are also in use ; a few schools have adopted two different shades of blue for their colors , with the darker shade serving as the primary . the shade of gold can vary greatly even within an institution , from a vivid yellow to a more convincing old gold .
