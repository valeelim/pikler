Frequency modulation     in telecommunications and signal processing , frequency modulation transmits information over a carrier wave by varying the frequency . this technique is different from amplitude modulation which varies the amplitude , but keeps the frequency constant . this kind of modulation is used in broadcasting and other radio work . in the context of broadcasting , frequency modulation is often shortened to fm . when transmitting analogue sound , the sound quality of fm signals is better than that of amplitude modulation ( am ) signals . however , fm signals do not travel as far as am beause they use higher frequencies that do not bounce off the kennellyâ€“heaviside layer . many radio stations send out both kinds of signals . am may be used for talk shows , and fm for music . fm broadcasting usually includes a difference signal , which can cause two different speakers at home to create different sounds . this creates stereo sound . other websites . - frequency modulation
