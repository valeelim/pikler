Conifer cone     a cone ( or pine cone ) is an organ on plants in the division pinophyta ( conifers ) that contains the reproductive structures . it is the part of a tree that lets the tree reproduce . its formal name in botany is strobilus , plural `` strobili '' . the familiar woody cone is the female cone , which produces seeds . the male cones , which produce pollen , are usually smaller and much less conspicuous even at full maturity . the individual plates of a cone are known as scales . the male cone ( microstrobilus or pollen cone ) is structurally similar across all conifers , differing only in small ways ( mostly in scale arrangement ) from species to species . extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls ( modified leaves ) . under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia ( pollen sacs ) . conifer cones and their seeds have been used for lots of different purposes . they are often used for decorations . some seeds , for example , the seeds of pinyon pines , are used in prepared foods and baking .
