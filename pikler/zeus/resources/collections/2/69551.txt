Prix de Rome     the prix de rome was a scholarship ( money prize ) for art students in paris . it was created in 1663 in france when louis xiv was reigning . every year the prize was given to promising young painters , sculptors , and architects . they had to finish a very difficult piece of work to show that they deserved to win the prize . the person who won the prize would get money so that he could go to rome for a year to study . sometimes they were allowed to stay longer if they were doing exceptionally good work . in 1803 , music was added to the subjects , and in 1804 engraving was added . sometimes people won “ second prize ” which allowed them to study for a shorter period . many artists who won the prix de rome are now almost forgotten . on the other hand , there are many artists who became very famous but did not win the prix de rome . these people include augustin pajou eugène delacroix , edouard manet , edgar degas and the composers ernest chausson and maurice ravel . ravel tried five times to win it . there was a big argument about this at the paris conservatoire , and rules were reorganized after that .
