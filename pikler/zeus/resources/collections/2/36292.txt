Legacy     in law , a legacy is something acquired by inheritance , or by a will ( law ) . in historical terms , a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time . a historical legacy can be counted in later times as a good thing or a bad thing . for example , the invention of the wheel ( for carts , as a potter 's wheel , as a millstone to help turn grain into flour , and as an early water wheel ) in mesopotamia can be seen as something good . the development of slavery is a bad legacy . sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy that will be remembered for a long time . buddha and confucius left moral legacies . more than 2000 years ago the greek mathematician , euclid of alexandria , collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called `` elements '' . students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics . other sciences also owe inherited much from the greeks . in athens , citizens voted on what the city would do . this early form of democracy is a cultural legacy .
