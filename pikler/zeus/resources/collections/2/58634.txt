Database normalisation     database normalisation is an approach to designing databases which was introduced by edgar f. codd in the 1970s . certain databases , known as `` relational databases '' , allow data to be stored in separate groups . each group is commonly called `` table '' . to provide useful information , these groups are connected to each other . for example , students could be stored in one group , and classes in another group . to show that a student is enrolled in a class , a `` relationship '' is established from one group to the other . a student could have a relationship to many classes , each of which he or she would be enrolled in , while a class would have a relationship to many students . a traditional alternative is the `` flat file database '' , where all of the data is grouped together like in a spreadsheet . the problem with flat file databases is that they can have a lot of blank spaces and there is a lot of information that has to be repeated for each entry . this means that the database is bigger than it has to be , and it makes it more likely that the database will contain mistakes . relational databases , by breaking the data into groups , reduce the chance of mistakes happening and does not take up any more space than necessary . but for it to work it needs to be well designed .
