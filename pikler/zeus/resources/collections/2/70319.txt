Spiracle     insects have small holes in their bodies that allow them to breathe . these holes are called spiracles . air comes in the spiracles and goes to invertebrate trachea , or tubes . these tubes take the oxygen to other parts of the insect body . because insects have no lungs , air comes in and goes out of the spiracles passively ( by itself ) . some insects can open and close the spiracles to keep water out . some spiders also have spiracles . sharks and rays have a spiracle behind each eye . when the shark is not moving , the spiracle helps the shark to breathe .
