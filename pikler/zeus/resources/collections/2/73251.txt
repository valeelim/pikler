Endorphins     endorphins are natural chemicals in the body that fight pain . endorphins are released when a person gets hurt , but also during exercise , laughter or sex . in addition to blocking pain , endorphins can make people happy . endorphins resemble drugs like morphine , so when scientists first discovered these chemicals in the 1970s , they termed them `` endogenous morphine . '' since then , scientists have identified and named five different types of endorphins , all of which occur naturally in the body . endorphins can also be found in most animals . four types of endorphins are created in the human body . they are named `` alpha '' ( α ) , `` beta '' ( β ) , `` gamma '' ( γ ) and `` sigma '' ( σ ) endorphins . the four types have different numbers and types of amino acids in their molecules ; they have between 16 and 31 amino acids in each molecule . beta-endorphins ( β-endorphins ) are the most powerful endorphins in the body . they are usually in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland . more endorphins are released in the pituitary gland during times of pain or stress . exercise increases the endorphin release too . for the same reason , exercise results in a better mood .
