Rice wine     rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks . however , it is not a true wine , despite the name . true wine is made by fermenting grapes , and perhaps other fruit . in rice wine , the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar . this sugar is then fermented . this process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer . the `` rice wines '' made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines ( 18–25 % alcohol compared to 10–14 % for normal wines ) . beers on the other hand usually have 4–8 % alcohol in them . many people use the term `` rice wine '' to refer to sake ( which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines ) .
