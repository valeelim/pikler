Ligament     in anatomy , the term ligament usually means fibrous tissue that connects bones to other bones or cartilages . in this use , a `` ligament '' is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long , stringy collagen fibres . ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint . they do `` not '' connect muscles to bones ; that is the function of tendons . some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations , or prevent certain movements altogether . ligaments are only slightly elastic ; when under tension , they gradually lengthen . this is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible : if the ligaments lengthen too much , then the joint will be weakened . athletes , gymnasts , dancers , and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments , making their joints more supple . the consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint . not all broken ligaments need surgery , but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint , the broken ligament can be joined .
