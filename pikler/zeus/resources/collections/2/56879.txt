John Taverner     john taverner ( born about 1490 – died 18 october , 1545 ) was the most important english composer of his time . he was also an organist . we can not be sure exactly when taverner was born . some people think that he was a boy chorister at the church of tattershall in lincolnshire but his name does not appear on the list of choristers there . people now think that he worked there later as a lay clerk . he got a job at cardinal college ( now called christ church ) in oxford but he could not stay very long because king henry viii made lots of changes to the way people had to worship in church . taverner even hid some books which the king had forbidden under the floor , and he got into trouble for doing this . in the end the cardinal did not punish him because , he said , he was “ only a musician ” . in 1530 he seems to have gone back to lincolnshire and stayed there for the rest of his life . he probably wrote no more music , but he was quite rich . taverner composed eight masses . the most famous one is called the `` western wynde '' . it was a “ parody mass ” , which meant that it used a popular tune with that title . another mass was called `` gloria tibi trinitas '' . this work set a fashion for pieces which were called `` in nomine '' s , because the tune was from the benedictus in the mass which sets the words “ in nomine domine ” ( “ in the name of the father ” ) . “ in nomine ” s were compositions for instruments which used this tune .
