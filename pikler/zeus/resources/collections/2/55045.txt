Fable     a fable is a type of story which shows something in life or has a meaning to a word . a fable is a funny story but may teach a lesson or suggest a moral from it . a fable starts in the middle of the story , that means , jumps into the main event without detailed introduction of characters . the characters of a fable may be people , animals , legendary creatures , gods , or anything else . when animals and objects are used in fables , they think and talk like people , even though they act like animals or objects . for example , in a fable a clay pot might say that it is frightened of being broken . the stories told by fables are usually very simple . to understand a fable , the reader or listener does not need to know all about the characters , only one important thing . for this reason animals are often used in fables in a way that is easily understood because it is always the same . they keep the same `` characteristics '' from story to story . - a lion is noble - a rooster is boastful - a peacock is proud
