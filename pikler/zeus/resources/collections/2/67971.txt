Nitrogen cycle     the nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organism [ s ] . air is about 78 % nitrogen . nitrogen is needed for life . it is an important part of proteins , dna , and rna . in plants , nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth . nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air ( n ) into forms that can be used by life . most nitrogen fixation is done by microorganisms called bacteria . these bacteria have an enzyme that combines n with hydrogen gas ( h ) to make ammonia ( nh ) . some of these bacteria live in the roots of plants ( mostly legumes ) . in these roots , they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates . other plants take nitrogen compounds out of the soil through their roots . all nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants . ammonium ( nh ) in soil is made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and decomposers , bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts . this process is called `` ammonification '' . ammonium has a positive charge . it easily joins to clay and humus in the soil . ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals . sewage and other waste-water is regularly measured because of this . if ammonia levels are too high , `` nitrification '' must happen .
