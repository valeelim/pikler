Armenians     the armenians are a nation from the caucasus . their country is armenia . the armenian culture is very old . armenia was the first country to be christian , when the armenian king tiridates iii changed his religion by st. gregory the illuminator . because of this , many armenians are christians . in the assyrian period , the armenian people of nairi formed the kingdom of ararat ( well known in assyrian as urartu ) . one of the earliest record of armenians is from a text which says `` armani '' , արման ( most common armenian name arman , the older variant of armen , արմեն ) together with ibla , as land conquered by naram-sin ( 2300 bc ) identified with an akkadian colony in the diarbekr region . to this day the assyrians speak about armenians by saying `` armani '' . another record is by thutmose iii of egypt , says the people of `` ermenen '' in 1446 bc , and says in their land `` heaven rests upon its four pillars '' . ( thutmose was the first pharaoh to cross the euphrates to reach the armenian highlands ) . to this day kurds and turks refer to armenians by `` ermeni '' .
