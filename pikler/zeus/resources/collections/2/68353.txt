Pelagianism     pelagianism is a theory named after pelagius . it is the belief that people are not born with original sin and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without divine aid . for this reason , adam 's sin was there to set a bad example for those that came after him ; other than that it had no consequences . jesus was there to set a good example ( much like adam 's bad example ) but also to pay the price for our sins . pelagius believed that because people `` choose '' to sin , they are like criminals who need to be pardoned , `` not '' victims of an inherited sinful nature . pelagianism was condemned as heresy at the council of ephesus in 431. however , some people believe that pelagius was simply misunderstood . today there are no known pelagians left because most of his writings have been lost . related pages . - fall of man other websites . - canons from the council of carthage against pelagianism , may 1 , 418 - catholic encyclopedia : pelagius and pelagianism - pelagians , donatists , monks , anabaptists and other perfectionists - a sympathetic look at pelagianism and similar 'perfectionist ' movements
