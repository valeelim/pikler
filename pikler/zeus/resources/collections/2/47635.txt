Ice age     an ice age is a period when for a long time the temperature of earth 's climate is very low . this leads to an expansion of the continental ice sheets , polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers . `` ice age '' is a phrase coined for the period of extensive ice sheets in the recent pleistocene period . we now know that ice ages have happened a number of times in the past , the greatest and longest of which took place in the proterozoic era , before multi-cellular eukaryotes evolved . during ice ages the sea level drops as water is held in the great ice sheets at the poles . how much it drops depends on several factors , such as the length of time that a cold period lasts . within an ice age , there are stages . the longer cold stages are called glacials or glacial periods . the shorter warm periods are called interglacials . the last glacial ended about 11,000 years ago when the present interglacial started . the greenland and antarctic ice sheets still exist . the last two million years have been the pleistocene ice age . during glacials , large and thick ice sheets cover much of the north american and eurasian continents .
