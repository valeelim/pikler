Oi!    oi ! oi ! is a type of punk rock that was started in the united kingdom in the late 1970s . the people that started it wanted to connect punk with a working class street-level following . oi ! is a mixing of the styles of early punk bands , such as the clash , sex pistols and the ramones . it is also influenced by early british rock bands ( such as the rolling stones and the who ) , football chants , pub rock and glam rock bands . the music is often very simple , and the lyrics are blunt ( brutally honest , without tact ) . punk rock began to become popular in the 1970s . some perceived that it was becoming more and more commercialised . this was the kind of thing that punks were against . oi ! began partly as a response to this perception . it was also partly a response to stereotyping that others made about punks . one stereotype was that many people in the early punk rock scene were young people using big words and trying to be artistic , but failing . early oi ! bands such as sham 69 were around for years before the word `` oi ! '' was used to describe their style of music . the word was first used as a name for the new genre in 1980 , by journalist garry bushell . he took the name from the way the cockney rejects used `` oi ! '' during live shows to introduce their songs . `` oi ! oi ! oi ! '' was the title of the third track on their second album . the word is an old cockney expression , meaning `` hey '' or `` hello '' . other bands that were labelled as oi ! bands in the early days of the genre included angelic upstarts , the 4-skins , the business , blitz , the blood , and combat 84. more recent punk bands such as rancid and dropkick murphys have credited oi ! as a source of inspiration .
