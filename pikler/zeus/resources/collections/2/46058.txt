Pterodactyloidea     pterodactyloidea is the suborder of short-tailed pterosaurs . their fossil record starts in the late jurassic . they became extinct in the k/t extinction event at the end of the cretaceous period . `` pterodactylus '' , `` pteranodon '' and `` quetzalcoatlus '' are in this suborder . recent work shows that the group had more variety at the end of the cretaceous than was thought earlier . in the early 2010s , several new pterosaur taxa were discovered dating to the late cretaceous . these finds include some small sized pterosaur species . at the end of the cretaceous period , the cretaceousâ€“paleogene extinction event , which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and most avian dinosaurs as well , and many other animals , seems also to have taken the pterosaurs . this is the classification of the different divisions of pterodactyloidea : - order pterosauria - suborder pterodactyloidea - superfamily ornithocheiroidea - family istiodactylidae - family ornithocheiridae - `` coloborhynchus '' - family pteranodontidae
