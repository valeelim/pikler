Non-ionizing radiation     non-ionizing radiation ( or , esp . in british english , non-ionising radiation ) means any type of electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules - that is , to completely remove an electron from an atom or molecule . the composition of this radiation can vary depending on what may be ionized . visible light , near ultraviolet , infrared , microwave and radio waves are all examples of non-ionizing radiation , though visible and near ultraviolet can also ionize some molecules . the light from the sun that reaches the earth is largely composed of non-ionizing radiation , with the notable exception of some ultraviolet rays . however , most ionizing radiation is filtered out by the atmosphere . because it is lower energy radiation , the use of this type of radiation in medical fields and everyday life poses fewer health risks than ionizing radiation in forms such as x-rays . other pages . - mobile phone radiation and health - ionizing radiation
