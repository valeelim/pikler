Oort cloud     the oort cloud , or öpik–oort cloud , is a cloud of comets and other objects . astronomers believe it is way beyond the orbits of pluto and the kuiper belt . the oort cloud is believed to be the source of long-period comets in the solar system . the oort cloud may lie about 50,000 au , or nearly a light-year , from the sun . this means the cloud is nearly a quarter of the way to proxima centauri , the nearest star to the sun . the kuiper belt and scattered disc , the other two reservoirs of trans-neptunian objects , are less than one thousandth of the oort cloud 's distance . the outer limit of the oort cloud defines the boundary of the solar system and the region of the sun 's gravitational dominance . the dutch astronomer jan hendrik oort was the creator of the oort cloud idea . the oort cloud was named after him , as were the oort comet , and oort constants . the oort cloud takes up a lot of space and has trillions of comets about tens of millions of kilometers apart . the oort cloud is made up of an inner oort cloud and an outer oort cloud . the outer cloud is weakly bound to the sun ; long-term comets are thought to come from there . the inner cloud is also called the hills cloud and may be the maker of comets .
