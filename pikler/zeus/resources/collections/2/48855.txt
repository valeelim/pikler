Carbon steel     carbon steel , or plain-carbon steel , is a metal alloy . it is a combination of two elements , iron and carbon . other elements are present in quantities too small to affect its properties . the only other elements allowed in plain-carbon steel are : manganese ( 1.65 % max ) , silicon ( 0.60 % max ) , and copper ( 0.60 % max ) . steel with a low carbon content has the same properties as iron , soft but easily formed . as carbon content rises the metal becomes harder and stronger but less ductile and more difficult to weld . higher carbon content lowers steel 's melting point and its temperature resistance in general . typical compositions of carbon are : - mild ( low carbon ) steel : approximately 0.05 % to 0.25 % carbon content with up to 0.4 % manganese content ( e.g . aisi 1018 steel ) . less strong but cheap and easy to shape ; surface hardness can be increased through carburizing . - medium carbon steel : approximately 0.29 % to 0.54 % carbon content with 0.60 to 1.65 % manganese content ( e.g . aisi 1040 steel ) . balances ductility and strength and has good wear resistance ; used for large parts , forging and car parts .
