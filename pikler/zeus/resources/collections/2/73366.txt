Operetta     operetta is a term which started to be used in the 19th century to describe an opera that was not too serious and often full of fun . it is often described as “ light opera ” ( “ light ” meaning “ not serious “ ) . in an opera everything is usually sung . in an operetta there is a lot of spoken dialogue , and songs and dances are added to this . similar traditions already existed in other countries , e.g . in germany where the singspiel tradition was popular ( e.g . mozart ’ s `` the magic flute ) '' . the operetta tradition started in france and soon spread to austria and other countries . it remained popular until the mid-20th century , when it gradually turned into musical comedy . the composer jacques offenbach can be thought of as the creator of the operetta tradition . it grew out of the opéra comique which had become quite long and serious . there was a need for shorter , more humorous musical entertainments . offenbach was composing operettas in the 1850s in paris . in england such works were often called “ comic operas ” or “ opera comedies ” . then johann strauss became very popular in vienna . he was already very well known in the ballroom , but when he started to write for the theatre he soon became a rival to offenbach , whose operettas had become very popular in vienna . strauss ’ s operetta `` die fledermaus '' ( “ the bat ” ) has been performed more than any other operetta . in spain the zarzuela was a kind of operetta .
