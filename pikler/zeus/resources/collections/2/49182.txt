Torsion (mechanics)    torsion ( mechanics ) in solid mechanics , torsion is the twisting of an object that is result of an applied torque . in circular sections , the resultant shearing stress is perpendicular to the radius . the shear stress at a point on a shaft is : `` t '' is the applied torque , `` r '' is the distance from the center of rotation , and `` j '' is the polar moment of inertia . the angle of twist can be found by using : where : - `` θ '' is the angle of twist in radians . - `` t '' is the torque ( n·m or ft·lb ) . - `` l '' is the length of the object the torque is being applied to or over . - `` g '' is the shear modulus or more commonly the modulus of rigidity and is usually given in gigapascals ( gpa ) or ft·lb . - `` j '' is the polar moment of inertia , for a round shaft or concentric tube only . for other shapes j must be determined by other means . for solid shafts the membrane analogy is useful , and for thin walled tubes of arbitrary shape the shear flow approximation is fairly good , if the section is not re-entrant . for thick walled tubes of arbitrary shape there is no simple solution , fea may be the best method .
