Venus of Willendorf     venus of willendorf , also known as the woman of willendorf , is an 11.1 cm ( 4 3/8 inches ) high statuette of a female figure . it was discovered in 1908 by archaeologist josef szombathy at a paleolithic site near willendorf . willendorf is a village in lower austria near the city of krems . the statuette is made of a kind of limestone that can not be found in the area . it is colored with red ochre . a study made in 1990 suggests that the figure was made between 24.000 and 22.000 bce . very little is known about its origin , how it was made , or what it meant to the people who made it . the venus is not a realistic portrait but rather an idealization of the female figure . her vulva , breasts , and swollen belly are very pronounced . this suggests a strong connection to fertility . her tiny arms are folded over her breasts , and she has no visible face . her head is covered with what might be coils of braids , eyes , or a kind of headdress . the lack of a face has prompted some archaeologists and philosophers to view the venus as a `` universal mother .
