César Cui     césar cui ( born vilnius , 18 january 1835 ; died 26 march 1918 ) was a russian composer . he is the least known of the five russian composers who were nicknamed the “ moguchaya kuchka ” ( “ mighty handful ” ) , a group which included mily balakirev , nikolai rimsky-korsakov , modest mussorgsky and alexander borodin . cui ’ s father came from france and his mother from lithuania . like most russian composers in the 19th century he was an amateur composer . his main job was as an expert on military fortifications . he became a professor in this subject and wrote important textbooks about military defences . he became a general . cui liked his friends from the moguchaya kuchka , but was often very critical of music by other russian composers such as tchaikovsky and rachmaninoff . this may have been because he was jealous of their success . he did not find orchestration easy and balakirev helped him a lot with the orchestration of some of his compositions . he was best when writing songs and short piano pieces . he liked to write music that sounded far eastern in character . cellists like to play a short piece he wrote called “ orientale ” .
