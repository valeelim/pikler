Scutellosaurus     scutellosaurus was a small bipedal herbivorous dinosaur from the lower jurassic period , 200â€“196 million years ago . it was about a metre long . its back was armoured , and it is placed in the thyreophora with the other armoured dinosaurs . it was one of the earliest members of this group , and the most basal ( primitive ) form so far known . its closest relatives may have been `` emausaurus '' and `` scelidosaurus '' . these , and the larger armoured dinosaurs `` ankylosaurus '' , `` stegosaurus '' and `` huayangosaurus '' , were all quadrupedal . the lightly built bipedal `` scutellosaurus '' is similar in form to the ancestral dinosaurs , which were bipedal . `` scutellosaurus '' was around long , tall at the hips , and weighed . the fossil evidence includes two partial skeletons recovered from arizona , although of the skull only the lower jaw has been recovered . there were also several hundred scutes running along its neck to its back and as far down as its tail . some of these shields were flat , while others were pitted . it had an unusually long tail , possibly a counterbalance to the weight of the armoured body , and long arms that suggest it may have browsed on all fours .
