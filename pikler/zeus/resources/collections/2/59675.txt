Crotchet     a crotchet or quarter note is a note played for one fourth of a whole note ( or `` semibreve '' ) . quarter notes are written as a filled-in oval ( or round ) note head and a straight , flagless stem ( the line ) . the stem usually points up ( like a d ) if it is below the middle line of the stave or down ( like a p ) if it is on or above the middle line . when beginners start to learn to play an instrument they are often taught that one crotchet lasts for one beat ( one count ) . that is because they are learning pieces with simple time signatures . it is , however , important to remember that other note lengths ( minims , dotted crotchets etc . ) can also be treated as one beat , depending on the time signature .
