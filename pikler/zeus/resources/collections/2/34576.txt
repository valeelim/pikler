Glacier     a glacier is a large body of ice and snow . it forms because the snow in an area does not all melt in summer . each winter , more snow is added . the weight of all the snow creates pressure . this pressure turns the lower parts of the snow into ice . after this happens for many years , the glacier will start growing large . it becomes so heavy that gravity causes the ice to move . it flows downwards like water but very slowly . a glacier only moves about per year . new snowfalls replace the parts that flow away . glaciers are the largest sources of fresh water on earth . the largest bodies of salt water are the oceans glaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough snow over time . this can take a long time . it often takes tens or hundreds of years for a glacier to form . there are two kinds of glaciers : `` continental glaciers '' and `` alpine glaciers '' . alpine glaciers are also called `` mountain glaciers '' . - continental glaciers are glaciers that spread out over a large area of land . they were created mostly during the ice ages a long time ago . there are still some continental glaciers in greenland and antarctica . they often flow downwards into the sea and break up . the broken parts that float in the sea are called icebergs .
