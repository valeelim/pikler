Potsdam Conference     the potsdam conference was a meeting of the soviet union , the united kingdom and the united states in potsdam , germany from july 17 to august 2 , 1945. the prime minister of the united kingdom ( clement attlee ) , the president of the united states ( harry s. truman ) and the leader of the ussr ( joseph stalin ) met to talk about germany on july 1945 and were going to discuss what should happen to it now that the second world war was over . the first conference was held at yalta , but the allies did not agree on anything very important . however , a lot had happened since the yalta conference . firstly , the usa had a new president named harry truman . he was much tougher on communism than the previous president , roosevelt , had been . this was a problem for stalin . also , churchill had been voted out and was replaced by clement attlee . stalin saw himself as far more experienced than these new leaders . stalin also caused trouble , as some of what the allies agreed on at yalta was that poland should have a neutral government . stalin had killed the neutral government leaders and replaced them with ones that would listen to him . this meant that there were a lot of problems at potsdam .
