Yomi     yomi ( 黄泉 ) , the japanese word for the underworld in which horrible creatures guard the exits . according to shinto mythology as related in kojiki , this is where the dead go to exist and rot forever . when one eats at the hearth of yomi it is impossible to return to the land of the living . yomi is similar to hades or hell . in the shintoist tradition , yomi is known because izanami retreated to that place after her death . izanagi followed her there and when he returned , he washed himself , creating amaterasu , susanoo , and tsukuyomi . ( see japanese mythology . ) yomi is different from christian hell in that all souls go there , no matter their actions in life ; and one does not receive punishment for evils made when alive . it is a dirty and polluted place . in japanese tradition , pollution is usually associated to evil . by the tradition of kojiki , yomi is usually believed to be underground , and its entrance to be located in izumo province . yomi is ruled over by izanami no mikoto , the grand deity of yomi ( `` yomotsu-ōkami '' 黄泉大神 ) . according to kojiki . the entrance to yomi was blocked by izanagi when he returned to earth , using a great boulder ( `` chibiki-no-iwa '' 千引の岩 ) at the base of the slope that leads to yomi ( `` yomotsu hirasaka '' 黄泉平坂 ) .
