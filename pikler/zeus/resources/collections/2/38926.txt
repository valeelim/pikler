Drum and bugle corps     a drum and bugle corps is similar to a marching band but it only has brass instruments , percussion instruments , and color guards . armies used signal drums and bugles as signals for centuries . the modern drum and bugle corps came from military drum and bugle units coming back from world war i and the wars after it . early drum and bugle corps was a year-round activity , where musicians performed at shows all the time . now , most drum and bugle corps schedule tours during the summer , where they travel around the country , performing a new show every year , with different music and movements . before 1971 , most american drum and bugle corps , or `` corps , '' performed in shows run by the american legion or vfw . in 1971 , 5 important corps founded a new group , called the `` midwest combine . '' other eastern and western corps did the same thing with their respective regions . these corps formed these organizations because they did not like the rules of the american legion , which many believed prevented creativity . the corps also believed that they did not give enough of the money from ticket sales to the corps who performed . the different groups decided that they would all perform as a `` package . '' that is , show organizers had to pay and schedule to have all the corps perform , even if they only wanted one of them . this strategy went very well for the corps , and in 1972 , all the groups , plus a few other corps formed a big organization called `` drum corps international , '' or dci . this group gave the corps a lot of money from shows and artistic freedom .
