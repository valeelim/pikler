DNA polymerase     a dna polymerase is an enzyme which makes dna molecules from its nucleotide building blocks . dna polymerases are essential for dna replication . they usually work in pairs as they copy one double-stranded dna molecule into two double-stranded dnas . in dna replication dna polymerase `` reads '' a piece of dna that 's already there and uses it to make a new piece that is exactly the same as the old piece . dna polymerases also play key roles in other processes within cells , including dna repair , genetic recombination , reverse transcription , and antibody production . dna polymerases are widely used in molecular biology laboratories , notably for the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , dna sequencing , and molecular cloning . dna polymerase can only connect deoxyribonucleotides to a 3'-oh group that is already there , so dna is always made in the 5'3 ' direction .
