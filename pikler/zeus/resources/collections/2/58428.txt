Sumer Is Icumen In     `` sumer is icumen in '' is a very old english song which can be sung as a round . it is the oldest example of a round that we know of . the composer is unknown . it was written down around the middle of the 13th century by a monk but we do not know whether that monk composed it , or whether it had been composed earlier . the title means `` summer has come in '' . the round can be sung in six parts . there are also two parts which can be repeated again and again ( an ostinato ) throughout the piece . the language is middle english and is based on the dialect spoken in wessex , england at the time . this is the manuscript that the monk wrote : to sing as a round , one singer ( or group of singers ) would begin at the beginning , a second singer would start at the beginning as the first got to the point marked with the red cross , then the third would join in when the second singer got to the red cross , and so on until all six were singing . the repeated pattern is marked `` pes '' . the instructions are written in latin .
