Rugby sevens     rugby sevens is the shortened version of rugby union in which only seven players per side feature , instead of the full fifteen . the version of rugby union is very popular , with notable competitions including the irb sevens world series and the rugby world cup sevens . it is also played at events such as the commonwealth games and rugby league has also adopted the sevens format . rugby sevens was invented in melrose , a small town in scotland . it is played under the same rules and on a field of the same dimensions as the 15-player game but a rugby sevens match lasts approximately 15 minutes ( 7 minutes aside with 1 minute half-time break ) but the finals last somewhat more than 20 minutes ; each half in a final is ten minutes instead of the normal seven minutes also the game ends when the ball goes of the pitch or points are scored . the point system is similar to rugby union where a try gets a team 5 points and conversion 2 points with 3 points for penalties and drop-goals ( drop-goals are very uncommon in sevens ) . points scoring occurs with much greater regularity in sevens compared to fifteens , since there are more spaces for players to run . scrums still exist within sevens , composed of just three players from each team . given the speedy nature of the game , players are usually either from the backline or the trio of loose forwards in fifteens rugby . all sevens players , wether in the forwards or otherwise must be fit , agile , relatively strong and demonstrate a high level of fitness in order to compete at an optimum level . countries such as new zealand , france , fiji , england , wales and samoa have very successful sevens teams .
