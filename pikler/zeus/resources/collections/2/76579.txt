Porcupine     a porcupine is a rodent with a coat of sharp spines , or quills , that defend them from predators . the porcupines include the third biggest rodent , after the capybara , and beaver , and are not to be confused with hedgehogs . most porcupines are about 60–90 cm long , with a 20–25 cm long tail . weighing between 12-35 pounds ( 5–16 kg ) , they are rounded , large and slow . porcupines come in various shades of brown , grey , and the unusual white . the name `` porcupine '' comes from middle french `` porc d'épine '' `` thorny pork '' , hence the nickname `` quill pig '' for the animal . the correct term for a baby porcupine is a porcupette . a porcupette has soft quills made of hardened hair . this protects the mother from injury as she gives birth . the animal 's quills or spines take on many forms , depending on the type , but all are hairs coated with thick plates of keratin , and they are in the skin musculature . old world porcupines ( hystricidae ) have quills in clusters , whereas in new world porcupines ( erethizontidae ) single quills are mixed with bristles , underfur , and hair .
