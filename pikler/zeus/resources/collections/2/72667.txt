Nucleobase     nucleobases are important for genetics . they are parts of rna and dna that may be involved in pairing ( see base pair ) . they include cytosine , guanine , adenine , thymine in ( dna ) , uracil in ( rna ) and xanthine and hypoxanthine ( mutated forms of guanine and adenine ) . these are abbreviated as c , g , a , t , u , x and hx . they are usually simply called bases in genetics . because a , g , c and t appear in the dna , these molecules are called dna-bases ; a , g , c and u are called rna-bases . uracil replaces thymine in rna . other websites . - base pairing in dna double helix ( shows specific hydrogen bonds )
