Sea cucumber     sea cucumbers are a class of echinoderms , the holothuroidea . they have a longish body , and leathery skin . sea cucumbers live on the floor of the ocean . most sea cucumbers are scavengers . there are about 1500 species of sea cucumbers . sea cucumbers have a unique respiratory system , and effective defences against predators . chinese eat them . like all echinoderms , sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin , calcareous structures that are usually reduced to isolated ossicles joined by connective tissue . these can sometimes be enlarged to flattened plates , forming an armour . in pelagic species the skeleton is absent . sea cucumbers communicate with each other by sending hormone signals through the water . a remarkable feature of these animals is the collagen which forms their body wall . this can be loosened and tightened at will . if the animal wants to squeeze through a small gap , it can undo the collagen connections , and pour into the space . to keep itself safe in these cracks , the sea cucumber hooks up all its collagen fibres to make its body firm again .
