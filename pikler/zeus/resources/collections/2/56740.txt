Room temperature     room temperature does not have an exact scientific definition . it means a temperature that is normal in rooms used by human beings . a comfortable room temperature depends on individual needs and other factors . according to the west midlands public health observatory ( uk ) , 21 °c ( 70 °f ) is the recommended living room temperature , and 18 °c ( 64.4 °f ) is a good bedroom temperature . however , this might not be true for countries found near the equator . as the temperature is higher , the room temperature is around 30 °c ( 86 °f ) . room temperature is the temperature that is comfortable and normal to be in . for scientific work , room temperature is taken to be about 20 to 25 degrees celsius with an average of 23 °c ( about 73.4 degrees fahrenheit ( °f ) , 528 to 537 degrees rankine ( °r ) , or 293 to 298 kelvins ( k ) ) . for numerical convenience , either 20 °c or 300 k is often used . the progress and results of many scientific and industrial processes can sometimes depend on the temperature of the surroundings of the equipment . for example , a measurement of the charge of the electron does not depend upon the temperature of the test equipment . in this case , if scientists mention temperature at all , they usually only mention `` room temperature '' , which means that what is being measured has not been cooled or heated .
