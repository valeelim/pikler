Entomology     entomology is the science of insects . people who study insects are called entomologists . insects have been studied since prehistoric times , but it was not until as early as the 16th century that insects were scientifically studied . some entomologists study how insects are related to each other . others study how insects live and reproduce because we do not know very much about some kinds of insects . other entomologists study ways to keep insects away from crops that people use for food . there are billions of unknown species throughout the world and taxonomists categorize the newly found . entomologists meet to talk about their study of insects and to share ideas , just as all scientists do .
