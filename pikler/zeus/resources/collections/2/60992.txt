Cyanobacteria     cyanobacteria are a taxon of bacteria which conduct photosynthesis . they are not algae , though they were once called blue-green algae . it is a phylum of bacteria , with about 1500 species . in endosymbiont theory , chloroplasts ( plastids ) are descended from cyanobacteria . their dna profile is evidence for this . cyanobacteria have an extremely long fossil record , starting at least 3,500 million years ago . they were the main organisms in the stromatolites of the archaean and proterozoic eons . the ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic photosynthesis is highly significant . the early atmosphere on earth was largely reducing , that is , without oxygen . the cyanobacteria in stromatolites were the first known organisms to photosynthesise and produce free oxygen . after about a billion years , the effect of this photosynthesis began a huge change in the atmosphere . the process , called the great oxygenation event , took a long time . eventually , it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen , and led to the kinds of environment we know today , where most organisms use and need oxygen .
