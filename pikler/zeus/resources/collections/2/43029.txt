Spin (physics)    spin ( physics ) in physics , spin is the angular momentum of an object . for large visible objects like the earth , spin is the angular momentum of the turning of the earth around its axis . this tells the amount of rotation that it has . angular momentum changes with the mass and shape of the object , and with how fast it is turning . experiments such as the stern-gerlach experiment have shown that sub-atomic particles , such as electrons , seem to have a north pole and a south pole much like magnets do . scientists once thought that this was caused by the particle spinning on its axis like a planet . later , it was shown that the electron would have to be spinning faster than the speed of light to do this . this is why scientists no longer believe that the electron is actually spinning like a planet . scientists do , however , continue to refer to the magnetic properties of particles as `` spin '' . spin , whatever it is , seems to follow some of the laws of angular momentum , but not all of them . a `` spinning '' electron ( or any other sub-atomic particle with spin ) can only have certain values of angular momentum . electrons can also align themselves against a magnetic field in ways that would be impossible in the everyday world .
