Music competition     a music competition is an event in which people compete for prizes by performing music . music competitions can be for solo performers or for small or large groups such as orchestras , bands or choirs . some competitions are for young people who are starting to make a professional career in music . other music competitions may be for amateurs , which means that professional musicians are not allowed to compete . the person who decides who is the winner is called the adjudicator . some big festivals have a team of several adjudicators who decide together on the winner . the british and international federation of music festivals organizes music competitions for amateurs in many parts of the british isles . children and adults can take part , competing in classes for music , speech and drama and dance . competitions like these are often called `` festivals '' because the main reason for taking part is to enjoy performing rather than just to win . there are many big international competitions for some of the most talented musicians from all over the world . winning a big competition can help a young musician to start a successful career . some people think it can also be a bad thing to win a big competition , especially for musicians who are still very young . it may make them a star for a short time but they still have to get better and mature as a musician and a person .
