Unperson     in the george orwell book nineteen eighty-four , an unperson is someone who has been vaporized . vaporization is when a person is secretly murdered and from society , the present , the universe , and existence . such a person would be taken out of books , photographs , and articles so that no trace of them is found in the present anywhere â€“ no record of them would be found.this was so that a person who defied the party would be gone from all citizens ' memories , even friends and family . there is no newspeak word for what happened to unpeople , therefore it is thoughtcrime to say an unperson 's name or think of unpeople . this is similar to the stalinist soviet party erasing people from photographs after death ; this is an example of `` real '' unpeople . ( see images ) the stalin-era soviet union also provided real-world examples of unpersons in its treatment of leon trotsky and other members of the communist party who became politically inconvenient . in his 1960 magazine article `` pravda means 'truth ' '' , reprinted in `` expanded universe '' , robert a. heinlein argued that john paul jones and a mysterious may 15 , 1960 cosmonaut had also received this treatment .
