Sulfuric acid     sulfuric acid , also known as sulphuric acid , is a strong acid . it is also a chemical compound . its chemical formula is hso . it was known as `` oil of vitriol '' in ancient times . it is a dense ( thick ) , clear , corrosive liquid that can dissolve in water . it can also melt through some weak substances . it was once known as `` oil of vitriol '' . this name was created by jabir ibn hayyan , the person who discovered it . it used to be prepared by the reaction of potassium nitrate with sulfur . this reaction would produce sulfur trioxide which would dissolve in steam to produce sulfuric acid . then this reaction was done in lead containers . the contact process , the most common process , was invented in 1831 and is still used today . it is made by reacting sulfur trioxide with sulfuric acid to produce oleum . then oleum is dissolved in water to produce more sulfuric acid . the sulfur trioxide is produced by burning sulfur to produce sulfur dioxide , which was then oxidized to sulfur trioxide with a catalyst . this process is called the contact process .
