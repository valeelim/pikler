498a     498a is an indian law in which a husband and his family are summarily arrested without any investigation when a complaint is lodged by the wife or any of her relative claiming that the husband or his relatives treated her cruelly . once the complaint is lodged the husband and his family are presumed guilty and it is up to them to prove that they are innocent in a court of law . this law has been under much controversy due to its increasing misuse leading to breakdown of families . it does not cost anything to file a 498a , and there is no penalty ( or even a fine ) for filing a false dowry complaint which has contributed to a fast rise in the number of such cases in courts today . the case of 498a can be quashed when there are vague the allegations in the fir . a fir is a first document on which whole investigation and charge sheet is based . a fir is bible for getting evidence and eventually to secure conviction of an accused based on the evidence , therefore a fir must contain all the material facts related to an offence . it also must contain all the specific ingredient needed for satisfying an offence and material through which investigation may proceed . if a fir misses material facts then it is a vague fir which can be quashed by invoking the jurisdiction of 482 crpc .
