Diethyl ether     diethyl ether is a clear liquid chemical . it is often just called ether . ether burns very easily and boils at about 35Â°c . it has a sweet smell and does not mix with water . ether was discovered in 1275. it was used in the past as a general anesthetic to make people unconscious during surgery . now other chemicals are used because ether has side effects and can catch fire . ether is used as a solvent by scientists for chemical reactions . people used to take ether as a recreational drug ( drugs used for fun , such as alcohol ) in the 1800s . people would either drink a drink with small amounts of ether in it , just like people drink alcoholic drinks , or inhale the fumes given off by pure or nearly pure ether . this could have addicted these people to the ether if they did that often enough . it was a big problem in some places , like ireland and poland . it first became popular because europeans thought it was unladylike to drink alcohol . women would drink ether instead , as would teetotalers , people who had decided not to drink alcohol .
