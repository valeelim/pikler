Superconductor     a superconductor is a special type of material that conducts electricity without resistance . that means that electrons ( tiny particles with negative charge ) can flow very easily through the material . this can be achieved only at very low temperatures . the critical temperature at which a material becomes superconducting varies from material to material . most materials are not superconductors . another property of superconductors is the flux trapping effect , which can cause a rare earth magnet to float above a cooled superconductor .
