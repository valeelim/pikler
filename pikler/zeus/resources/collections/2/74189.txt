Cetartiodactyla     cetartiodactyla is the taxonomical superorder which includes whales ( and dolphins ) and even-toed ungulates . the name was created by merging the name for the two orders , cetacea and artiodactyla , into a single word . cetartiodactyla is commonly used because it is thought that whales evolved from the artiodactyls . because of this , their closest living land relative is thought to be the hippopotamus .
