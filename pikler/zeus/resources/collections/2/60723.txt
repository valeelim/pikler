Heterodoxy     heterodoxy means a position that is not within the standards of orthodoxy or to put it precisely `` any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position '' . as an adjective , `` heterodox '' is used to describe a subject as `` characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards '' ( `` status quo '' ) . in the eastern orthodox church , the term is used to refer to christian churches not belonging to the eastern orthodox communion , but have no positions that are as different from those of orthodox christianity to thought to be as false as heresy . heterodoxy in the roman catholic church in a similar way means views that differ from strictly orthodox views , but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid heresy . many roman catholics profess some heterodox views , either on doctrinal or social issues . for example , the orthodox catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain , and `` the church can only entrust them to the mercy of god '' ( catechism of the catholic church 1261 ) . a heterodox catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by god at their judgment . the belief is not orthodox , as the church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants ; however , it is also not heresy , as the church accepts that such a scenario `` might '' be possible . by contrast , a denial of the doctrine of `` original sin '' ( thereby negating the necessity of baptism for children ) or papal infallibility -- would be labeled heretical .
