Tennis Court Oath     the oath was a pledge signed by 576 members out of 577 of france 's third estate and a few members of the first estate on june 20 , 1789 in a tennis court near the palace of versailles . the meeting hall of the estates general had been locked accidentally , but the third estate thought that this was an invasion of their rights , and were very angry with the king . they stood in a nearby indoor tennis court . they swore an oath that they would not move until `` the voice of the nation was heard '' and their demands were met . they were joined by the nobles and clergy . the vote had always been taken by class , and usually , the clergy and the nobility voted to support whatever the king wanted , so the vote of the middle class did not matter . the middle class argued that voting should be `` by poll '' not by order , because they had more representatives than the first two estates combined . they also wanted the estates general to meet as one body , so that voting would be by poll , rather than by class .
