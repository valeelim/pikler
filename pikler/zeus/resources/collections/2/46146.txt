Therizinosaurus     therizinosaurus was a huge herbivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the cretaceous period . new , well-preserved finds such as `` alxasaurus '' in 1993 and `` beipiaosaurus '' in 1996 provided details about the bird-like pelvis , feet and skulls of primitive members . this helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as `` therizinosaurus '' and that therizinosaurs were , more specifically , advanced , herbivorous maniraptoran theropods . their fossils were first found in the late 1940s in asia . they were named in 1954 after more bones were found . it was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore ; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long . the feeding habits of `` therizinosaurus '' are unknown , since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet . however , like other therizinosaurs , it was probably primarily herbivorous . there are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of `` therizinosaurus '' , such as defense against predators ( e.g . the contemporary `` tarbosaurus '' ) and in intraspecific fighting , such as fighting for territory or for mating , or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth . the claws may have served all these functions .
