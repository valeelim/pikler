Pierre de Fermat     pierre de fermat ( 17 august 1601 â€“ 12 january 1665 ) was a french lawyer at the `` parlement '' of toulouse , southern france , and a mathematician . many people see him as the father of modern calculus . his method of finding the biggest and smallest ordinates of curved lines also makes him a contributor to differential calculus , which was not known at that time . his studies in the theory of numbers give him the rank of the founder of the modern theory . he also made notable contributions to analytic geometry and probability . he is also famous for making a simple mathematical statement ( known as fermat 's last theorem ) that he said he could prove , but he never wrote down his proof . mathematicians tried to prove it for hundreds of years before finally managing it . fermat probably did not really have a proof for this theorem , and only thought he did .
