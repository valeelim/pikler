Nihilism     nihilism comes from the latin nihil , or nothing . it is the belief that values are falsely invented . the term 'nihilism ' can also be used to describe the idea that life , or the world , has no distinct meaning or purpose . nihilists believe that there are no true morals . many people think of the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche when they think about nihilism , because he said that morals were invented . but in his books , nietzsche said that people needed to create their own morals to get over nihilism . mikhail bakunin â€™ s ( 18141876 ) `` reaction in germany '' ( 1842 ) included this passage : `` let us therefore trust the eternal spirit which destroys and annihilates only because it is the unfathomable and eternal source of all life . the passion for destruction is a creative passion , too ! '' the term was made popular by ivan turgenev 's novel `` fathers and sons '' ( 1862 ) . bazarov , the hero in it , was a nihilist . nihilism was the basis of much revolutionary terrorism . it was taken up by sergei nechaev , a russian who wrote a pamphlet that influenced lenin . dostoyevsky was a member of a nihilist group in his 20s . he served ten years in exile as a consequence . his novel `` devils '' ( or `` the possessed '' ) deals with nechaev . his famous novel `` crime and punishment '' is also on that theme .
