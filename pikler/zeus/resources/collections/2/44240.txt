Shoghi Effendi     shoghi effendi ( 1 march 1897-4 november 1957 ) was a persian man . he was the great-grandson of bahá'u'lláh who founded the religion known as the bahá'í faith . after bahá'u'lláh died , shoghi effendi 's grandfather , `abdu'l-bahá lead the bahá'ís . `abdu'l-bahá died , he left a `` will and testament '' that said that shoghi effendi was the `` guardian '' , and that his job was to guard and lead the bahá'í faith . `abdu'l-bahá 's will said that only shoghi effendi could interpret `abdu'l-bahá 's or bahá'u'lláh 's books and letters . this was to prevent different people from splitting the religion up because they thought bahá'u'lláh or `abdu'l-bahá meant different things , the way many other religions have split up .
