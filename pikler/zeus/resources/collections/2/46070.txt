Congregation     a congregation is a group of people who have come together ( congregated ) for something , usually for religious worship . in christian churches the word “ congregation ” is often used to mean all the people in the main part of the church , but not the choir or the priests . this term came from long ago after the church was first formed . for example : the order of service might say that the choir will sing verse 1 of a hymn and `` the congregation are asked to join in at verse 2 '' .
