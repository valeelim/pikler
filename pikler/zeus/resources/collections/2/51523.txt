Echinoderm     echinoderms are a successful phylum of marine animals . they include sea stars , brittle stars , sea urchins , sea cucumbers and their relatives . echinoderms have these features : 1. a skeleton of plates . these are formed from calcite , a mineral made of calcium carbonate . the plates are usually spiny , and the skeleton is covered outside and in by a layer of skin . 1. five-rayed ( pentameral ) symmetry . 1. a water-vascular system . this is an internal system of tubes and bladders filled with water . 1. tube feet . these are extensions of the water-vascular system . the tube feet poke out from the skeleton , and are used in walking , respiration and feeding . the animal handles the world outside by using its tube feet . 1. stenohaline . they ca n't handle big changes in the salinity of the water . no doubt this is why they are : 1. entirely marine . echinoderms live in all parts of the ocean , but mostly on the sea floor . some are filter feeders , and others ( starfish ) are important predators of molluscs and other shell-fish . they are extremely common near the shore , and on reefs .
