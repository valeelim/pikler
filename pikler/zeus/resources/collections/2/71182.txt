Criterium     a criterium , or crit , is a type of bicycle race held on a short course ( usually less than 5 km ) , often run on closed-off city centre streets . race length can be either a time or a number of laps . often a criterium lasts about one hour , which is shorter than that of a traditional road race – which can last many hours , sometimes of several days or even weeks , as in a grand tour . however , the average speed and is much higher . the winner is the first rider to cross the finish line without having been `` lapped '' ( overtaken ) . events often have prizes ( called `` primes '' , usually cash ) for winning specific intermediate laps ( for instance , every 10th lap ) . winning criteriums needs a mix of good technical skills – especially the ability to corner rapidly and sharply – and riding safely with a large group on a short circuit and exceptional fitness to attack other riders and repeatedly accelerate hard from corners . criteriums are relatively easy to organize and do not require a large amount of space . they are the most common type of bicycle racing in the continental united states .
