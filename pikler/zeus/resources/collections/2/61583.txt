Anglicanism     anglicanism is a denomination within the christian religion . it is made up of the church of england and the anglican communion ( a group of anglican churches from many other countries ) . the term at its broadest includes those who have accepted the work of the english reformation as embodied in the church of england or in the offshoot churches which in other countries have adhered , at least substantially , to its doctrines , its organisation , and its liturgy . it is sometimes seen as being the middle way , between roman catholicism and extreme protestantism . and that is why it is not always included as part of protestantism . this is because , in the english reformation , the english church kept the early catholic ministry of bishops , priests , and deacons , and most of the doctrine and liturgy . the critical point which led to the anglican church was the outright rejection of the pope , and so of the catholic church as an organisation . the term anglican comes from the phrase `` ecclesia anglicana '' . this is a medieval latin phrase dating to at least 1246. it means 'the english church ' . the noun anglican is used to describe the people , institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the state established church of england and the anglican communion , a theologically broad and often divergent affiliation of thirty-eight provinces that are in communion with the archbishop of canterbury .
