Rainbow jersey     the rainbow jersey is a special jersey worn by world champion cyclists during races . it is mainly white with five horizontal bands in the uci colours around the chest . from the bottom up the colours are : green , yellow , black , red and blue , the same colours that appear in the rings on the olympic flag . there are different jerseys for each discipline ( road racing , track racing , cyclo-cross , bmx , and the types of mountain biking ) . a cyclist must wear the jersey when competing in the same discipline , category and speciality that he is world champion for . for example , the world road race champion would wear the jersey while competing in stage races and one-day races , but would not during time trials . similarly , on the track , the world individual pursuit champion would only wear the jersey when competing in other individual pursuit events . a champion who does not wear the rainbow jersey can be fined 2500 to 5000 swiss francs . the team 's sponsor pays a lot of money to have their name on each rider 's jersey . they can still put their names on the world champion 's jersey , but probably smaller because there is less space . sponsors do not mind because the world champion gets a lot more publicity than ordinary riders .
