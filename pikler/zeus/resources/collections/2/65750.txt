Proxy server     in computer networks , a proxy server is a server ( computer ) which clients ( people or computers ) use to access other computers . a proxy server that passes information to its clients without changing it is usually called a gateway or sometimes `` tunneling proxy '' . proxy servers get their name because they act like a proxy ( a stand-in ) and act on behalf of a client 's computer . a client that connects to the proxy server requests some service , such as a file , connection , web page , or other resource , that is available on a `` different '' server . the proxy server then goes to the `` other '' server and requests what the client wants for them . a proxy server can change the information that it gives to the client , and if the same information is accessed many times or by many different clients it can use what is called a cache to make things faster . a cache is the term for information that has been accessed and saved for future use ; if a proxy server has what the client is accessing in its cache , it will make it faster because it does not need to go and access the other server to provide what the client wants .
