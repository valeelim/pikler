Insurance     insurance is a term in law and economics . it is something people buy to protect themselves from losing money . people who buy insurance pay a `` premium '' ( often paid every month ) and promise to be careful ( a `` duty of care '' ) . in exchange for this , if something bad happens to the person or thing that is insured , the company that sold the insurance will pay money back . ( however , there are some times when the company will not have to pay money back , such as if the person was not careful . ) there are different kinds of insurance . there are life insurance and general insurance . in life insurance , someone ensures their life or someone else 's life . at the death of insured person or on the date of maturity whichever happens earlier , the amount insured will be paid . general insurance is a non-life policy , such as : - fire insurance - marine insurance actuaries are the people who figure out how much the premium should be . they balance how much the insurer might have to pay out against the chances of having to pay out . if actuaries think there is a big chance that the company will have to pay out , they will make the premium higher .
