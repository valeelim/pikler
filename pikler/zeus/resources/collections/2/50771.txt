Symphonic poem     a symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music which has a story attached to it or describes something such as poem or a painting or any idea which is not music . a symphonic poem is a kind of programme music ( music for instruments which has an idea outside music ) . symphonic poems were mostly written in the 19th century at the time known as the romantic period . they are normally in one movement lasting perhaps between 10 and 20 minutes . some of the longest ones , such as `` ein heldenleben '' by richard strauss are much longer , like a symphony with four movements which run into one another . the idea can be seen in beethoven â€™ s overtures which tell the story of the opera or play which is about to be performed . composers such as felix mendelssohn then started to write overtures which told a story but were not attached to any opera . `` fingal 's cave '' ( 1832 ) describes the sea lapping against the rocks of a cave in the scottish hebrides . franz liszt was the composer who made the symphonic poem an important musical form . he wrote twelve works which he called `` symphonische dichtung '' ( `` symphonic poem '' ) because the music developed in the same way as in a symphony . one example is `` mazeppa '' ( 1851 ) which describes the poem by victor hugo about a wild horse that carries a man tied to him until he is rescued by the ukrainians and made into their chief .
