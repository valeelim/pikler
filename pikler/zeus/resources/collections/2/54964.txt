Heat conduction     heat conduction ( or thermal conduction ) is the movement of heat from one solid to another one that has different temperature when they are touching each other . for example , we can warm our hands by touching hot-water bottles . when the cold hands touch the hot-water bottle , heat flows from the hotter object ( hot-water bottle ) to the colder one ( hand ) . people make things with different thermal conductivity , for example cookware to heat things or insulated containers to prevent temperature change . other ways to transfer heat are by thermal radiation and/or convection . usually more than one of these processes happen at the same time . in the atomic theory solids , liquids and gases are made of tiny particles called `` atoms '' . the temperature of the material measures how fast the atoms are moving and the heat measures the total amount of energy due to the vibration of the atoms . you might imagine conduction to take place when one part of a material is heated . the atoms in this part vibrate faster and are more likely to hit their neighbors . when collisions take place , the energy is passed on to the neighboring atoms allowing the energy to travel through the solid . ( rather like the way energy passes along a set of tumbling dominos ) .
