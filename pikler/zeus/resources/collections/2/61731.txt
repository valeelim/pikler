Holy See     the holy see ( latin : `` sancta sedes '' , `` holy seat '' ) is the office of the bishop of rome , that is , the pope . the term holy see also means the pope and the roman curia , the central government of the roman catholic church . every episcopal see is seen as holy and the eastern orthodox church constantly applies the adjective `` holy '' or `` sacred '' ( ) to all its sees , but `` the holy see '' ( definite singular ) normally means the see of rome , which is also called `` the apostolic see '' . while `` apostolic see '' can refer to any see founded by any of the apostles , the term is in this case used to refer to the see of the bishop seen as successor of the chief of the apostles , saint peter . aside from rome , the archiepiscopal see of mainz , which was also of electoral and primatial rank , is the only other western see that bears the title of `` holy see '' , although this usage is less common . the pope governs the church through the roman curia . the roman curia consists of the secretariat of state , nine congregations , three tribunals , 11 pontifical councils , and a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level . the secretariat of state , under the cardinal secretary of state , directs and coordinates the curia . the current incumbent , tarcisio cardinal bertone , is the holy see 's equivalent of a prime minister . archbishop dominique mamberti , secretary of the section for relations with states of the secretariat of state acts as the holy see 's foreign minister . bertone and mamberti have been named in their respective roles under by pope benedict xvi in september 2006 .
