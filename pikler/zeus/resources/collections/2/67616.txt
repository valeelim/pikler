Music stand     a music stand is something musicians can use to put sheet music on when they are performing . there are several different sorts of music stand , but almost all of them can be adjusted in height so that they can be used by tall or short players , and by players whether they are sitting down or standing up . the most popular type of music stand is the metal one that can be folded up so that it is easy to carry about . some music stands are made of wood . these are sometimes very and therefore quite expensive . orchestras usually give their players very heavy metal music stands . this is because the light , fold-up ones are easily knocked over . it is also very difficult to write on music on a fold-up metal stand because there is nothing to press against ( in rehearsals musicians often have to write fingering , bowing and other markings in the music ) . there are also very small music stands that do not have legs and are designed to be put on a table . these can be used for any kind of instrument that can be played sitting at a table .
