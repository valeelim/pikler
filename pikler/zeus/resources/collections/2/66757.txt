Judea     judea or judaea ( hebrew : `` yehuda '' ) is a term used for the mountainous southern part of the west bank . in modern times , the name `` yehudah '' is most often used by zionists . judea is also the ancient name of the area surrounding jerusalem ( today , parts of israel and the west bank ) . major cities in this area are hebron , bethlehem , efrat and beitar illit . judea was the territory of the ancient kingdom of judah . judea lost its nationhood to the romans in the 1st century bc , by becoming first a tributary kingdom , then a province , of the roman empire . the first interference of rome in the region dates from 63 bc , following the end of the third mithridatic war . after the defeat of mithridates vi of pontus , general gnaeus pompeius magnus ( pompey the great ) stayed behind to make the area secure for rome . judea at the time was not a peaceful place . queen alexandra had recently died , and her sons were troubling the country with a civil war for power . they were hyrcanus and aristobulus . in 63 bc , aristobulus was surrounded in jerusalem by his brother 's armies , and the situation was bad . he sent a messenger to marcus aemilius scaurus , pompey 's representative in the area . aristobulus offered a large bribe to be rescued , that pompey quickly accepted , but later , he tried to accuse scaurus of extortion . this caused his downfall , because scaurus was pompey 's brother in law and was protected by him . the general did not like what aristobulus had done , and put the prince and high priest hyrcanus in charge of the kingdom . judea and galilee became tributary kingdoms of rome , which meant that they had to pay tribute to the roman republic to buy their protection .
