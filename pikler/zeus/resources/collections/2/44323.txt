Nomadic people     nomadic people ( or nomads ) are people who move from one place to another , instead of living in one place . the best known examples of nomads are gypsies , roma , sinti , and irish travelers . many other ethnic groups and communities are traditionally nomadic ; such as berbers , kazakhs , and bedouin . people are nomads for many reasons . most nomads are family men herding their livestock , such as cattle , or horses from pasture to pasture . these people have to change places because of the weather . other nomads are traders and craftsmen ( people who make things ) , traveling to exchange goods or to practice their craft where it is needed . nomads who follow their herds usually live in tents with few things inside , like the mongols . nomads who trade or practice crafts usually have wagons in which they travel , because wagons are better for carrying goods . the sami of lapland were once thought of as a nomadic tribe following a herd of reindeer . but , they are a migratory people who lead their own herd of reindeer to winter feeding grounds and then return them in the spring to their feeding ground close to a permanent home base , where their family lives . this cycle happens every year . nomadic people must work hard to live , and sometimes it is difficult to do so .
