Cerulean     cerulean is a range of colours from deep blue , sky-blue , bright blue , or azure to deep cyan . the word cerulean comes from the latin word `` caeruleum '' , which means `` sky '' or `` heavens '' . this was in turn from latin `` caeruleus '' deep blue : resembling the blue of the sky . in classical times , this term was used to describe blue pigments , particularly mixtures of copper and cobaltous oxides , called genuine cerulean . these early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of permanence . when the artificial pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead . the first recorded use of `` cerulean '' as a color name in english was in 1590. meaning of cerulean . - cerulean represents the `` sky '' or `` heavens '' , or sometimes the ocean . - the united states navy blue angels aerobatics team wears uniforms that are a bright rich tone of cerulean . related pages . - list of colors
