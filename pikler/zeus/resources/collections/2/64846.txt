Unicode     unicode is a digital code for computers that lets them show text in different languages . unicode standards are promoted by the unicode consortium and based on iso standards . their goal is to replace current and previous character encoding standards with a single worldwide standard for all languages . there are almost 100,000 characters in the latest definition of unicode . unicode was developed in the 1990s and integrated earlier codes used on computer systems . unicode provides many printable characters , such as letters , digits , diacritics ( things that attach to letters ) , and punctuation marks . it also provides characters which do not actually print , but instead control how text is processed . for example , a newline and a character that makes text go from right to left are both characters that do not print . unicode considers a graphical character ( for instance é ) as a code point ( alone or in sequence [ e+ ‘ ] ) . each code point is a number with many digits which can be encoded in one or several code units . code units are 8 , 16 , or 32 bits . this allows unicode to represent characters in binary .
