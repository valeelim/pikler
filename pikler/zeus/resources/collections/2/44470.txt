Reflection     reflection is the change in direction of a wave at a boundary between two different media , so that the wave moves back into the medium it came from . the most common examples include the reflection of light , sound and water waves . specular reflection is a mirror-like reflection of light from a surface , in which light from a single incoming direction is reflected into a single outgoing direction . in the diagram to the right , a light ray is coming from the point p , and meets at the mirror at point o. the ray reflects at the point o outwards in the same medium towards point q. reflection is measured relative to a line through point o that is at 90Ëš to the mirror . the angles made by the light ray ( shown in the diagram as formula_1 and formula_2 ) must be equal . both angles have to be equal whenever reflection occurs . this is known as the `` law of reflection '' .
