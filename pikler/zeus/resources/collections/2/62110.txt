Pea     a pea , although treated as a vegetable in cooking , is botanically a fruit ; the term is most commonly used to describe the small spherical seeds or the pods of the legume pisum sativum . this was the original model organism used by gregor mendel in his early work on genetics . the name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the fabaceae like the pigeon pea ( `` cajanus cajan '' ) , the chickpea , the cowpea ( `` vigna unguiculata '' ) and the seeds from several species of `` lathyrus '' . `` p. sativum '' is an annual plant . it is a cool season crop , planted in winter . the average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams . the species is as a fresh vegetable , but is also grown to produce dry peas like the split pea . these varieties are typically called field peas . `` p. sativum '' has been cultivated for thousands of years , the sites of cultivation have been described in southern syria and southeastern turkey , and some argue that the cultivation of peas with wheat and barley seems to be associated with the spread of neolithic agriculture into europe .
