Space-time     space-time is a mathematical model that joins space and time into a single idea called a continuum . this four-dimensional continuum is known as minkowski space . combining these two ideas helped cosmology to understand how the universe works on the big level ( e.g . galaxies ) and small level ( e.g . atoms ) . in non-relativistic classical mechanics , the use of euclidean space instead of space-time is good , because time is treated as universal with a constant rate of passage which is independent of the state of motion of an observer . but in a relativistic universe , time can not be separated from the three dimensions of space . this is because the observed rate at which time passes depends on an object 's velocity relative to the observer . also , the strength of any gravitational field slows the passage of time for an object `` as seen by an observer outside the field '' . wherever matter exists , it bends the geometry of spacetime . this results in a curved shape of space-time which can be understood as gravity . the white lines on the picture on the right represent the effect of mass on space-time .
