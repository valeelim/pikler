Opposition (astronomy and astrology)    opposition ( astronomy and astrology ) opposition is a word used in observational astronomy ( and also astrology ) . it is used when two objects in the sky are on the opposite side of the sky when viewed from the earth . in particular , two planets are in opposition to each other when their ecliptic longitudes differ by 180° . when talking about a single object being in opposition , it is assumed to be opposite from the sun . the moon is in opposition to the sun when it is a full moon . the symbol of opposition is ☍ . a planet ( or asteroid or comet ) is said to be `` in opposition '' when it is in opposition to the sun as seen from the earth . this is the best time to observe a planet because : - it is visible almost all night , rising around sunset , culminating around midnight and setting around sunrise - its orbit brings it closest to the earth , making it appear bigger and brighter - light reflects more brightly from bodies with rough surfaces , at that angle
