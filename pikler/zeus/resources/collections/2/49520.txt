Newton metre     newton metre is the unit of moment in the si system . it is abbreviated n m or n·m , and sometimes written with hyphen `` newton-metre '' . it is a compound unit of torque corresponding to the torque from a force of one newton applied over a distance arm of one metre . a newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to a joule . conversion factors . - 1 metre kilogram-force = 9.8065 n·m - 1 centimetre kilogram-force = 98.0665 mn·m - 1 foot-pound force ( often `` foot-pounds '' ) = 1 pound-force foot ( often `` pound-feet '' ) = 1.3558179 n·m - 1 inch ounce-force = 7.0615518 mn·m
