Modulation (music)    modulation ( music ) modulation , in music , means that the music changes key . a piece of music might , for example , be “ in the key of c major ” ( meaning that it uses the notes of a c major scale , and the c sounds like the “ home key ” or “ tonic ” as it is called in music theory ) . then it could modulate to g major so that the g now feels like the home key and the notes of a g major scale are used ( the fs will be f sharps ) . modulations like the one above are very common , because g is closely related to c ( it is the 5th note in a c major scale : the “ dominant ” ) . a modulation to the subdominant ( 4th note of the scale ) is also common ( e.g . from c major to fmajor ) . music often modulates to the relative minor ( e.g . c major to a minor ) . a modulation that goes to a key whose tonic is not part of the original key is called a “ chromatic modulation ” . modulating from c major to a flat major would be a chromatic modulation because a flat is not a note in the c major scale . most pieces of music will modulate , especially if they are long pieces . it gives the music variety and helps to give it shape : the farther away from the tonic it goes the more tension there is . when the music eventually returns to the original key it feels like a homecoming .
