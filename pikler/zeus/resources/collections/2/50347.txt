Saprophyte     a saprophyte or `` saprotroph '' is an organism which gets its energy from dead and decaying organic matter . this may be decaying pieces of plants or animals . this means that saprophytes are heterotrophs . they are consumers in the food chain . this is the typical life-style of fungi . some fungi are parasites on living organisms , but most are saprophytes . many bacteria and protozoa are also saprophytes . to put it simply , most dead organic matter is eventually broken down and used by bacteria and fungi . lastly , slime moulds are also saprophytes , as well as consuming bacteria . other terms , such as 'saprotroph ' or 'saprobe ' may be used instead of saprophyte . strictly speaking , -phyte means 'plant ' . the problem is that no embryophytes ( land plants ) are true saprotrophs , and bacteria and fungi are no longer considered plants . nevertheless , saprophyte is such a well-known term that most writers continue to use it . saprophytes secrete digestive enzymes to get nutrients and energy . a heterotroph is a general term for an organism that needs organic material to get its carbon for growth and development . many plants which lack chlorophyll need fungi to break down organic material for them . traditionally , they were called saprophytes . now they are given a new name : myco-heterotrophy . quite a number of orchids and gentians .
