Auguste Rodin     auguste rodin ( born françois-auguste-rené rodin ; 12 november 1840 – 17 november 1917 ) was a french sculptor . rodin was born in paris . he made solid objects from stone or clay . his most famous works are 'the thinker ' and 'the kiss ' . although rodin is generally considered the start of modern sculpture , he did not set out to rebel against the past . his training was old-school . he took a craftsman-like approach to his work , but he was never accepted into paris 's foremost school of art . rodin had a unique ability to model a complex , turbulent , deeply pocketed surface in clay . many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime . they clashed with the sculpture tradition , in which works were decorative , formulaic , or highly thematic . rodin 's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory . he modelled the human body with realism , with individual character and physicality . rodin refused to change his style . gradually there came increasing favour from the government and the artistic community .
