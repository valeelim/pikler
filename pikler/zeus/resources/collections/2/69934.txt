Cytokinesis     `` cytokinesis '' is the division of cells after either mitosis or meiosis i and ii . during cytokinesis , the `` cytoplasm '' ( the liquid center of the cell that holds the `` organelles '' into place ) splits into two equal halves , and the cell becomes two daughter cells . this occurs right after the beginning of anaphase ( in mitosis and in meiosis i and ii ) and continues during telophase ( in mitosis and in meiosis i and ii ) until the cell has completely divided . mitosis and meiosis ii , interphase starts again after cytokinesis . a new and complete nucleus has been formed in each of the two cells . in plants cytokinesis is slightly different . as plant cells can not move apart because of their cell wall , a cell plate begins to form during late anaphase and throughout telophase . when the cytoplasm and organelles are divided evenly between the two new cells , the plate then becomes less flimsy and soon becomes another cell wall separating the daughter cells . cytokinesis splits the cell wall , unlike animal cells , where it splits the cell membrane . the cell wall grows later as the two new cells expand .
