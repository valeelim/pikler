Serial ATA     serial ata ( sata or serial advanced technology attachment ) is a standard that has been defined to connect storage devices or optical drives to a computer . the most common standard that was used beforehand was called ata or ide ; it has been renamed pata . the main difference between the two lies in the cables : sata cables have seven wires , pata cables have 40 or 80. another difference is that with sata , there is one cable for each device , while with pata , all devices are connected to the same cable . as of 2015 , almost all desktop computers have a sata interface . pata is still used for industrial applications and embedded systems . electric signals transmitted on a parallel bus made of several wires will influence each other , if the transfer speed is increased . this phenomenon is known as crosstalk in english . another problem with pata is that the termination of the bus is not specified . serial ata uses low-voltage differential signaling , which avoids most of these problems . serial ata uses 8b/10b encoding . this means that 10 bits are used to transfer 8 bits . the first standard of sata used 1.5 gbit/second transfer speed ( or 1.2 gbit/second usable data rate ) . this is only slightly faster than the last pata standard ( ata/133 ) . later standards doubled this rate , at almost every revision . these values are transfer speeds , because of signalling , the usable speed is 25 % lower .
