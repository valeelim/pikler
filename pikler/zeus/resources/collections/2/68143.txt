Judeo-Arabic languages     judeo-arabic languages are a collection of arabic language dialects spoken by jews living or formerly living in arabic-speaking countries . just as with the rest of the arab world , arabic-speaking jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived . most jud√¶o-arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the hebrew alphabet , often including consonant dots from the arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the hebrew alphabet . in retaliation for 1948 arab-israeli war , jews in arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence , causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to israel . their dialects of arabic did not thrive in israel , and most became extinct , replaced by the modern hebrew language . in the middle ages , jews in the islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of arabic , which they wrote in a mildly adapted hebrew script ( rather than using arabic script ) . this phenomenon is called judaeo-arabic and may be compared to both ladino ( judaeo-spanish ) and yiddish ( judaeo-german ) .
