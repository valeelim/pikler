Pizzicato     pizzicato means : playing a string instrument by plucking the strings ( pulling a string with the finger and letting go quickly ) . instruments such as the violin , viola , cello and double bass are normally played with a bow , but if the composer wants the player to pluck instead of bow , the word “ pizzicato ” or just “ pizz ” is written in the music . when the player has to play with the bow again the word “ arco ” is written in the music ( “ arco ” is the italian word for “ bow ” ) . when instruments of the violin family are played pizzicato the player usually plucks the string with the index finger ( pointing finger ) of the right hand somewhere over the fingerboard . bassists typically use the index and middle finger . sometimes the player may rest the thumb on the edge of the fingerboard to keep the hand steady . sometimes more fingers can be used for particularly fast pizzicato sections . cellists and double bass players can use the thumb for plucking , especially for playing chords . it is also possible to play pizzicato with the left hand ( the hand which is normally doing the fingering ) . it is not difficult to pluck an open string with the left hand . stopped strings are harder , and the brilliant violinist and composer niccolò paganini wrote some virtuoso pieces with extremely difficult left hand pizzicato .
