Sarcopterygii     the sarcopterygii is a class of fish . they are lobe-finned fish , like the lungfish and coelacanths . they are a clade of bony fish which first appeared in the silurian , 418 million years ago ( mya ) . one line in this group gave rise to the tetrapods . these are bony fishes with paired rounded fins . these fins , being similar to limbs , suggest that these fish may be ancestors of land vertebrates . all sarcopterygians possess teeth covered with true enamel . as a clade , the group includes all its descendants . this means it includes the tetrapods , that is , all species of four-limbed vertebrates . the fin-limbs of sarcopterygiians are very similar to what people believe was the ancestral form of tetrapod limbs . the ancestors of tetrapods are to be found amongst the lobe-fins of the devonian period . the term 'fishapod ' is becoming used for this transitional group . sarcopterygians and their relatives the actinopterygii ( 'ray-finned fish ' ) make up the superclass osteichthyes , the 'bony fish ' , which have a bony skeleton rather than cartilage . otherwise , there are vast differences in fin , respiratory , and circulatory structures between the sarcopterygii and the actinopterygii .
