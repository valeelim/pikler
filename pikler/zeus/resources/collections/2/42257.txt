Scattered disc     the scattered disc ( or scattered disk ) is a distant part of the solar system . the area has small icy minor planets known as scattered disc objects ( sdos ) . the part of the scattered disc closest to the sun is in an area of space called the kuiper belt . the oort cloud lies beyond the scattered disc . the first sdo was found in 1995 by spacewatch . the scattered disk is still not understood well . astronomers believe that it was created when objects in the kuiper belt were `` scattered '' by the gravity of the outer planets , mainly neptune . unlike most objects in the solar system which move in a round and flat path , scattered disc objects go every which way . different sdos have different orbital eccentricity and orbital inclination .
