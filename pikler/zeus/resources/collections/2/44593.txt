Elevator     an elevator or lift is a vertical transport vehicle that efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a building . they are generally powered by electric motors that either drive traction cables and counterweight systems , or pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston . languages other than english may have loanwords based on either elevator ( e.g. , japanese ) or lift ( e.g. , cantonese ) . because of wheelchair access laws , elevators are often a legal requirement in new multi-story buildings , especially where wheelchair ramps would be impractical . some argue that lifts began as simple rope or chain hoists . a lift is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means . a modern day lift consists of a cab ( also called a `` cage '' or `` car '' ) mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a `` hoistway '' . in the past , lift drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons . in a `` traction '' lift , cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley , commonly called a sheave in the industry . the weight of the car is balanced with a counterweight . sometimes two lifts always move synchronously in opposite directions , and they are each other 's counterweight
