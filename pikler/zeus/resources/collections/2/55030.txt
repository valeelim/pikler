Neuroscience     neuroscience ( or neurobiology ) is the scientific study of the nervous system . it is the branch of biology that investigates the molecular , cellular , developmental , functional , evolutionary , computational , psychosocial and medical aspects of the brain . the basic neuronal design matches both anatomical abnormality and normality within a certain reference of creation because while it is both natural and unnatural it is also broken , dimished , small and complex and as so it is immense in its way of operating within the skull , brain membranes and brain itself . the brain is a structure made up of billions of neurons that work together to form a matrix within a complex of organs termed by their anatomical structure : corpus callosum , basal ganglia , lower anatomical brain region and upper anatomical brain region . neuroscience research from different areas can also be seen as focusing on a set of specific themes and questions .
