Interval (music)    interval ( music ) an interval in music means the distance between two notes ( whether these notes are played together or separately ) . two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another ( counting both white and black notes ) are a “ semitone ” apart . a “ tone ” is two semitones ( see semitone ) . however , an “ intervale ” depends on how the notes are written ( what they are called ) e.g . whether the black note between d and e is written as d sharp or e flat ( which are two different names for the same note ) . please note that in all of the examples below , c is the lower note of the pair , and the other note is the next note of that name above it . so , the interval between a c and a b is only a major 7th if it is between a c and next b above it . in a major scale there are eight notes e.g . a c major scale ( see above ) is : c d e f g a b c and down again . - the interval between c and d is a major 2nd ( major second ) . - the interval between c and e is a major 3rd ( major third ) - the interval between c and f is a perfect 4th ( perfect fourth )
