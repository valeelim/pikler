Snorkeling     snorkeling is swimming while using a tube to breathe underwater . snorkeling is a very popular activity , particularly in places with clear , calm , warm oceans . it allows people to see underwater life in a natural setting , without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving . generally , people snorkel in shallow reefs ranging from sea level to 4 meters ( 13 feet ) deep . snorkelers can also explore deep water reefs . however , to see deeper reefs , a snorkeler has to hold their breath and dive down to the reef to see it . this kind of snorkeling takes more skill and fitness than shallow water snorkeling . it is also more dangerous than shallow water snorkeling . snorkelers use masks so they can see underwater . this allows them to see fish , coral reefs , and other kinds of sea life . man has always been interested by what is under the ocean . evidence shows that people have been free diving for at least 5,000 years . the earliest known free divers were sponge farmers in crete , who lived around 3000 b.c.e . these farmers used free diving to collect underwater sponges . they used hollow reeds like modern snorkels , to allow them to breathe while underwater .
