Camouflage     camouflage is a visual disguise . without it , an animal would be recognised easily . if the natural colour of an animal makes it look like its surroundings , that is camouflage . a tiger 's stripes in the long grass , and the battledress of a modern soldier are examples . camouflage is a form of deception . the word camouflage comes from the french word `` camoufler , '' which means `` to disguise '' . in nature , most animals blend into their environment or conceal their shape . they are very hard to see . this way they survive , and if they survive , then they can reproduce . there are exceptions : animals which are dangerous to eat ( e.g . wasps ) advertise with warning colouration . prey animals hide from predators . predators must search for prey without being seen . natural camouflage is one way to do this : an animal can blend in with its surroundings . another way is for the animal to disguise itself as something harmless . some camouflaged animals also copy movements in nature , e.g. , of a leaf blowing in the wind . other animals attach natural materials to their body for concealment . a few animals change color in changing environments . seasonally : ( many arctic animals , such as the arctic fox , or arctic hare ) . or quickly , like the chameleon and the cuttlefish . some herd animals , like zebra , have a pattern which makes it difficult for the predator when they are running .
