Tuskegee syphilis experiment     the tuskegee syphilis experiment ( /tʌsˈkiːɡiː/ ) was a clinical study . the study was done between 1932 and 1972 by the united states public health service . its goal was to study how syphilis progressed ( got worse ) if it was not treated . the study 's subjects ( the people who were being studied ) were poor african american sharecroppers . they were told that they were receiving free health care from the u.s. government . this experiment is famous because none of the men being studied were told that they had syphilis . even after the 1940s , when doctors realized that penicillin could cure syphilis , the men were not given this cure , or any other treatment . the men were not told that they were not getting real treatment , or that a cure was available . this study raised many important questions about medical ethics . in the 1930s , when the study started , syphilis was a very serious health problem in the united states . in fact , syphilis had been a serious health problem throughout all of history . syphilis gets worse over time . it can be very painful . if it is not treated , it causes brain damage and death . in the 1930s , there was no cure for syphilis . the treatments that were used did not work well and some were poisonous . doctors did not understand syphilis . because of this they did not have any way to help people with the disease .
