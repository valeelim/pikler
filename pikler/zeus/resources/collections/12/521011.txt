Congruence (geometry)    congruence ( geometry ) in geometry , two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and size . also if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other . more formally , two sets of points are called congruent if , and only if , one can be transformed into the other by isometry . for isometry , `` rigid motions '' are used . this means that one object can be repositioned and reflected ( but not resized ) so it coincides exactly with the other object . so two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely . turning the paper over is permitted . congruent polygons are polygons that if you fold a regular polygon in half that is a congruent polygon .
