History of the geologic time scale     this article describes the history of the geologic time scale . the principles were first laid down by nicolaus steno in the late 17th century . steno argued that rock layers ( or strata ) are laid down in succession , and that each represents a `` slice '' of time . steno formulated the principle of superposition . this says that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it . this principle is simple , but applying it to real rocks is complicated by their history . during the 18th century geologists realized that : 1. sequences of strata were often eroded , distorted , tilted , or even inverted after deposition ; 1. strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances ; 1. the strata of any given area represented only part of the earth 's long history . the first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on earth took place in the late 18th century . the most influential of those early attempts was led by abraham werner and others . they divided the rocks of the earth 's crust into four types : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary . each type of rock , according to the theory , formed during a period of earth history . it was possible to speak of a `` tertiary period '' as well as of `` tertiary rocks '' . indeed , `` tertiary '' ( now palaeocene-pliocene ) and `` quaternary '' ( now pleistocene-holocene ) remained in use as names of geological periods well into the 21th century .
