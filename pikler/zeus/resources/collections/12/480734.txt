Basophil     basophils , or basophil granulocytes , are rare granulocytes . if you had 10,000 white blood cells , only 1â€“30 of them would be basophils . basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules . when stained , the granules hide the cell nucleus from sight . however , when unstained , the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes . the mast cell , another granulocyte , is similar in appearance and function . both cell types store histamine , a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated . however , they come from different cell lines . mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream , but instead stay in connective tissue . like all circulating granulocytes , basophils go from the blood into a tissue when needed . the name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic , i.e. , they are stained by basic dyes , as shown in the illustrations . how they work is not well understood . basophils have protein receptors on their cell membrane which binds ige , an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defence and allergy . they are found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection , for example , by ticks .
