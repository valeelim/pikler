Australian Kelpie     the australian kelpie , or simply kelpie , is an australian sheepdog . the word 'kelpie ' is gaelic and means `` water sprite '' . they are very successful at herding and driving livestock with little or no guidance . the kelpie is a medium-sized dog . they come in both the tan markings and solid colors . the kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used mainly to herd sheep , cattle and goats . the kelpie can do the work of several men . they are tireless workers and can work all day in the hottest climates . kelpies are able to travel more than in a single day . like the border collie the kelpie is an intimidator . it locks eyes with an animal to get it to move . unlike the border collie , the kelpie also nips at the heels of herd animals to get and keep them moving . a typical kelpie weighs from 25 to 45 pounds . they have a life expectancy of from 10 to 14 years on average . kelpies have natural oils in their skin that keeps their coat weather resistant . for that reason they should be bathed only when absolutely necessary to avoid drying out their skin . an occasional rubdown with a towel keeps them clean .
