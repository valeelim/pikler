Colobinae     the colobinae are a subfamily of old world monkeys . the family includes 61 species in 11 genera , including the `` colobus '' monkeys , the large-nosed proboscis monkey , and the grey langurs . some classifications split the colobine monkeys into two tribes , while others split them into three groups . both classifications put the three african genera `` colobus '' , `` piliocolobus '' , and `` procolobus '' in one group ; these genera are distinct because they have stub thumbs ( greek κολοβός `` kolobós '' = `` docked '' ) . the various asian genera are placed into one or two groups . analysis of mtdna shows the asian species form two distinct groups , one of langurs and the other of the `` odd-nosed '' species . the grey langurs are not closely related to either .
