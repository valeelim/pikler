Old English poetry     the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation . bede says this was by cædmon ( flourished 658–680 ) . he was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced poetry at a monastery at whitby . this is probably the earliest written anglo-saxon poetry we have . much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date , or even to arrange chronologically . estimates for the date of the great epic `` beowulf '' range from ad 608 through to ad 1000 , and there has never been agreement . it is possible to identify some key moments . `` the dream of the rood '' was written before about ad 700 , when parts were carved in runes on the ruthwell cross . some poems on historical events , such as `` the battle of brunanburh '' ( 937 ) and `` the battle of maldon '' ( 991 ) , seem to have been written shortly after the events , so they can be dated reasonably precisely . anglo-saxon poetry is known by the manuscripts in which it survives . the most important manuscripts are from the late 10th and early 11th centuries . they are known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the beowulf manuscript .
