Exposure (toxicology)    exposure ( toxicology ) toxic exposure means that a toxin ( poison ) touched or got into a person 's body . that person has been exposed to the toxin . after a person is exposed to a toxin , many different things about that person , the toxin , and the exposure affect `` toxicity '' . toxicity is how the person reacts to the toxin , including what symptoms they may have . a person can get exposed to a toxin accidentally or on purpose . people can also use toxins as weapons to try to kill other people ( for example , during chemical or biological warfare ) . anything can be a toxin if enough of it gets into a person 's body . for example , even water can be toxic . if a person drinks enough water ( usually more than 6 gallons in one day ) , they can get water toxicity ( also called `` water poisoning '' or `` water intoxication '' ) . this causes the body 's cells to swell up with extra water . swelling in the brain 's cells can cause brain damage or death . water , in normal amounts , helps keep us alive ; but if a person is exposed to enough of it , it becomes a toxin , and it can kill the person .
