Delegate     a delegate someone who is either chosen or elected to vote or act for others . in organizations like the united nations , each country sends delegates to represent them . before a general election in the us , the process to select candidates begins with delegates . at the state level each of the major political parties selects delegates to attend a national convention . the two ways delegates are selected are the caucus and the primary election . each state may have different ways to select delegates as do political parties . the republican party lets each state decide how to select delegates . the democratic party uses a proportional method for awarding delegates . the percentage of delegates each candidate is awarded depends on the caucus or how many are elected for each candidate . candidate `` x '' may have 40 percent , candidate `` y '' may have 20 percent while candidate `` z '' may have 50 percent . any remaining percent may be undecided votes or for other candidates . a candidate becomes his or her party 's presidential nominee after the delegates sent to the convention give that person a majority of the votes . because there are often multiple rounds of votes taken to select a presidential candidate , delegates sometimes change their votes . but in recent elections that has become unnecessary . since 1976 , it was fairly clear who was the front-runner even before the first vote was taken .
