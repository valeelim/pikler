Line (formation)    line ( formation ) the line formation is a standard tactical formation which was used by infantry in early modern warfare . it continued the phalanx formation or shield wall of infantry armed with polearms in use during antiquity and the middle ages . the line formation used soldiers standing or moving side by side forming a line . the line formation provided the best front for volley fire . however the line could not change direction easily and was open to attack by cavalry . frederick the great used the line formation , or “ march by lines ” as a part of his oblique order to fix this problem . the other part of the oblique order was the “ attack in echelon ” ( change to column formation and angle slightly towards the enemy ) . this way his line of soldiers , usually two ranks deep , could easily change the direction they faced . an infantry battalion would form `` in line '' by placing troops in several ranks . they could range in number from two to five , with two or three being the most common . during the 17th century lines thinned out and became longer . using this line formation required greater discipline since the two opposing armies were often only apart .
