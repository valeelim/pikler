State supreme court     in the united states , a state supreme court ( known by other names in some states ) is the highest judicial tribunal in the court system of a particular state . generally , the state supreme court , like most appellate courts , is exclusively for hearing appeals from lower courts . it does not make any finding of facts , and thus holds no trials . in the case where the trial court made an egregious error in its finding of facts , the state supreme court will send the case back to the trial court for a new trial . this responsibility of correcting the errors of inferior courts is the origin of a number of the different names for supreme courts in various state court systems . the court consists of a panel of judges selected by methods outlined in the state constitution . many states elect their state supreme court justices and/or use elections to retain judges . since 2000 , the amount of money raised by judicial candidates has risen enormously . special interest groups have contributed to many of these campaigns raising questions of impartiality . the us supreme court , in `` caperton v. a.t. massey coal co. '' ( 2009 ) in a 5-4 decision , ruled that an elected state supreme court judge sitting on a case involving a campaign contributor was a violation of due process .
