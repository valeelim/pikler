Brain death     brain death means that the brain has stopped working . brain death is permanent , and can not be cured or reversed . no treatment can help . when a person is brain dead , there is no activity in any part of their brain . every part of the brain is dead ; no oxygen flows to the brain , and there is no electrical activity in any part of the brain . the brain controls everything we need to do to stay alive . for example , it controls breathing , body temperature , heart rate , and many other important things . when a person is brain dead , their brain can not control any of these things . a brain-dead person can not breathe on their own . they will never be able to wake up or be aware of what is going on around them . sometimes , brain-dead people are kept alive with special machines and medications . for example , doctors can put a tube down a person 's throat and use a machine called a ventilator to pump oxygen into their lungs . while these machines can keep the person 's other organs alive for a while , they can not help the brain get better . eventually , the person 's other organs will stop working too .
