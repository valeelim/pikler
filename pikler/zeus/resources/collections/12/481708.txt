Bramble Cay melomys     the bramble cay melomys , or bramble cay mosaic-tailed rat ( `` melomys rubicola '' ) , is an extinct species of rodent in the family muridae . while it was similar to the cape york melomys it had some protein differences and a coarser tail . it was genetically different to species from australia and new guinea . it lived in burrows it had dug among plants , or under branches and leaves on the ground . it was a nocturnal animal , and scientists believe it was a vegetarian . the bramble cay melomys was known only from a small population in bramble cay , a vegetated coral cay of . the cay is in the eastern part of torres strait , off the northern tip of australia . it is only 50 km from new guinea . the melomys were probably trapped on the island by rising sea levels after the last ice age . it is also possible to have come from the fly river , perhaps floating on branches . scientists do not know much about the animals that live in the fly river area . in the 1800s , there were lots of melomys on the island . a search in 1998 found 42 animals . another search in 2002 found 10 animals . in 2004 a search found 12 , but the melomys have not been seen since . during this time , the sea level has risen , making the island smaller , and turtles and sea birds have eaten most of the plants . scientists believe the bramble cay melomys is extinct . it is possible that the species may be found on nearby islands as many of these have never been searched . however , in june 2016 , researchers from queensland 's department of environment and heritage protection , and the university of queensland reported that the species had indeed become extinct .
