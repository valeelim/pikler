Line of Actual Control     the line of actual control ( lac ) is the effective border between india and china . the lac is 4,057-km long and traverses three areas of northern indian states : western ( ladakh , kashmir ) , middle ( uttarakhand , himachal pradesh ) and eastern ( sikkim , arunachal pradesh ) . quote : `` india is used to incursions by chinese troops across the 4,057-km lac in all the three sectors—western ( ladakh ) , middle ( uttarakhand , himachal pradesh ) and eastern ( sikkim , arunachal pradesh ) — in a bid to strengthen china 's claim over disputed areas and ensure new delhi does not change its tibet policy . '' chinese prime minister zhou enlai used the phrase in a letter addressed to indian prime minister nehru dated october 24 , 1959. in a letter dated november 7 , zhou told nehru that the lac consisted of `` the so-called mcmahon line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west '' . during the sino-indian war ( 1962 ) , nehru claimed not to know where the line was : `` there is no sense or meaning in the chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call 'line of actual control ' . what is this 'line of control ' ? is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of september ? advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody . '' it should be noted that these incursions were in response to india 's `` forward policy '' in which india began to contest areas controlled by china , including some that were not included in the mcmahon line .
