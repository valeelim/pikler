Colobus     colobus are a genus of monkeys native to africa . the word `` colobus '' comes from greek κολοβός which means `` docked '' . this refers to their thumbs , which are just stumps . colobus are herbivorous . they eat leaves , fruit , flowers , and twigs . their habitats include primary and secondary forests , riverine forests , and wooded grasslands . their ruminant-like digestive systems help them occupy niches which other primates do not live in . colobus live in territorial groups of about nine individuals , with a single male with a number of females and their offspring . newborn colobus are completely white . mothering is shared : other members of the troop the biological mother care for an infant . colobus are eaten regularly by the common chimpanzee . jane goodall discovered that chimps hunt and eat smaller primates such as `` colobus '' monkeys . she watched a hunting group isolate a colobus high in a tree , block all possible exits , then a chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus . the others then each took parts of the carcass , sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours . the chimps at gombe kill and eat as much as `` one-third of the colobus population '' in the park each year . this was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior .
