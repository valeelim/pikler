Wheelbase     in both road and rail vehicles , the wheelbase is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels . because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle , wheelbase dimensions are very important to the balance and steering . in high performance vehicles a longer wheelbase is more stable at higher speeds . a short wheelbase vehicle is usually able to corner faster but may be less aerodynamic . the wheelbase , along with the track , affects a vehicle 's steering angle ( how sharply it can turn ) . wheelbase has an effect on a vehicle 's turning radius ( or turning circle ) . this is the smallest circle a car can turn or u-turn within . a long wheelbase car or truck can not turn as sharply as a short wheelbase vehicle . if the vehicle is towing a trailer ( in british english a caravan ) the weight distribution of the trailer is critical . if too much of the trailer 's weight , called `` tongue weight '' , presses down on the vehicle 's tow hitch ( more than 15 percent ) it can cause the vehicle to go out of control . too little tongue weight ( less than 10 percent ) can cause the trailer to sway from side to side . this in turn can make the vehicle difficult or even impossible to control . the shorter the wheelbase the more quickly these forces can cause a loss of control . a longer wheelbase vehicle is generally more desirable for towing . each vehicle has a tow rating showing how much weight it can tow safely .
