'' `` my role is different from that of the office of legal counsel ( olc ) , which , through administrations of both parties , has reviewed executive orders for form and legality before they are issued . olc ’ s review is limited to the narrow question of whether , in olc ’ s view , a proposed executive order is lawful on its face and properly drafted . its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an executive order that may bear on the order ’ s purpose . and importantly , it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an executive order is wise or just .
