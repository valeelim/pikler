Middle Passage     the middle passage was the part of the atlantic slave trade where african slaves were brought to the americas on slave ships . millions of african people were shipped to the americas over the middle passage . slaves were treated so badly on the slave ships that about 15 % of them died during the middle passage . even more were killed before they left africa , when slave traders were trying to kidnap them and force them onto the slave ships . historians think that up to two million african people died during the middle passage . however , somewhere between 9.4 million and 12 million africans survived the middle passage , and arrived in the americas as slaves . the atlantic slave trade had three different parts . because of this , it was called `` the triangular trade . '' the middle passage got its name because it was the middle part of the triangular trade . the three parts of the atlantic slave trade were : ( 1 ) europe to africa ( 3 ) the americas to europe after being kidnapped , african slaves were usually forced to walk to forts along the coast of western africa . there they were sold to european and american slave traders . they might have to wait in these forts , which were like prisons , for months before slave ships arrived .
