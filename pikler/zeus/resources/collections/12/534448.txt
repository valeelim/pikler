Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution     ratified on february 3 , 1913 , the sixteenth amendment ( amendment xvi ) to the united states constitution allows the congress to impose a federal income tax . this allows the federal government to collect a tax on personal income , no matter where that income came from . the sixteenth amendment overturned the 1895 supreme court landmark decision in `` pollock v. farmers ' loan & trust co '' . in `` pollock '' , the court ruled that a 2 percent tax on incomes over $ 4,000 was unconstitutional . this was because the law the ruling struck down did not allow for apportionment , the court ruled against it . the sixteenth amendment allowed congress to levy a uniform direct income tax without being subject to apportionment . when the framers of the constitution were determining how the new government would be funded , they were trying to avoid a tax based on a person 's income . in the constitution , article one , sections 2 and 9 created the `` rule of apportionment '' . on a practical basis this required congress to tax the states based on each state 's population instead of a tax on each person 's income or property . for example , if a state made up four percent of the total population , they would be required to pay four percent of the total federal tax . the framers of the constitution expected direct taxes to be used and defined the term broadly . however , they did not see that apportionment would cripple any attempt to collect direct taxes .
