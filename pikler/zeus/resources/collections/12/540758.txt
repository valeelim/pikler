Polynomial remainder theorem     the polynomial remainder theorem states that : for every polynomial formula_1 and every real number formula_2 the remainder of division of formula_1 by formula_4 is formula_5 . this theorem can easily be proven , but it is important for various calculations . if we divided formula_1 by formula_4 , it means that we found such formula_8 and formula_9 , that formula_10 . let formula_11 . then formula_12 q.e.d . let 's divide formula_13 by formula_14 . the theorem says that the remainder will be equal to formula_15 so , let 's divide formula_16 by formula_14 : formula_18 . we get that formula_19 . sometimes , it can be difficult to calculate formula_5 fast ( if the polynomial is very big ) . there exist methods of fast division by formula_4 , so the computing the remainder could be easier than the whole function . the theorem itself is also very important for theoretical use . its proof can easily be applied to another similar objects with little changes . it is used , for example , in the fundamental theorem of algebra , in the form of a generalisation in complex numbers .
