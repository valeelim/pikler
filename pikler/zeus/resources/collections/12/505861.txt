Coronavirus     coronaviruses are viruses in the family coronaviridae . they are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense rna genome . they have a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry . the genome size of coronaviruses are about 26 to 32 kilobases , extraordinarily large for an rna virus . the name `` coronavirus '' is derived from the latin `` corona '' , meaning crown or halo , and refers to how virions look under electron microscopy ( e.m. ) . they have a fringe of large , bulbous surface projections looking like a crown . this morphology is created by the viral spike ( s ) peplomers , which are proteins on the surface of the virus . they decide which cells the virus can infect . proteins that contribute to the structure of coronaviruses are the spike ( s ) , envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) and nucleocapsid ( n ) . coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds . six different strains of coronaviruses infect humans . coronaviruses are believed to cause many common colds in human adults . the significance and economic impact of coronaviruses is hard to assess . unlike rhinoviruses ( another common cold virus ) , human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory .
