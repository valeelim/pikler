Give You What You Like     `` give you what you like '' is a soft rock ballad from avril lavigne . the lyrics are about fighting loneliness by having sex . the song has gotten praise from critics for expanding lavigne 's musical diversity . `` give you what you like '' is the fifth single from lavigne 's self-titled album , `` avril lavigne '' . critics liked `` give you what you like '' . they complimented the mature sound that lavigne showed on the song . they also liked its equally mature themes . jason lipshutz of `` billboard '' wrote that `` the bright-eyed innocence of '17 ' and 'bitchin ' summer ' has vanished on 'give you what you like ' '' . he further called it `` a harrowing glimpse inside the exchange of physical pleasures to combat loneliness '' . but he criticized the song 's production . he ended his review by comparing lavigne 's vocals in the song to those of her 2002 hit , `` i 'm with you '' . allan raible of abc news wrote , `` as the tempos slow down , things get less juvenile and slightly more interesting . 'give you what you like ' begins with the words , 'please wrap your drunken arms around me . ' ( at last , darker material ! ) this is a rather sleazy song , but it is way more interesting than the shallow stabs at teen pop . at least there is some sort of grit . it 's not just a middle finger ( referencing the album 's opening track , `` rock n roll '' ) .
