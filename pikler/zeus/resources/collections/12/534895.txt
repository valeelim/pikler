De Moivre's formula    de moivre 's formula in mathematics , de moivre 's formula , named after abraham de moivre , states that for any complex number `` z '' and integer `` n '' , formula_1 where formula_2 is the modulus of `` z '' , and formula_3 is the argument of `` z '' . here , formula_4 is euler 's number , with formula_5 often being called the polar form of a complex number . the formula is very important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry . it can be easily proved using the trigonometry form of complex numbers , induction , and some trigonometrical identities . furthermore , using this formula any equation of formula_6 , where `` w '' is complex , can be solved .
