Class action     a class action , class suit , or representative action is a type of lawsuit . one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by one member of that group . the class action originated in the united states . it is still mainly a u.s. phenomenon . however , several european countries with civil law have made changes to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers . in 1991 china passed the `` civil procedure law '' that allows class actions . in brazil class action suits have been brought against industries , banks . and other organizations . they have been used against environmental damage , product defects and false advertising to name a few . unlike the us , brazilian judges award much smaller amounts for damages . the predecessor of the class action was called a `` group litigation '' . they were used in england from the 13th century . it involved groups of people suing or being sued in a court . group cases were easier to handle than numbers of individual cases , because of the slow and difficult travelling at that time . judges travelled round a circuit , and might visit a town only once or twice a year . by the 18th century individual lawsuits became the norm .
