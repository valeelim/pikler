Europasaurus     europasaurus is a basal sauropod from the titanosaur clade , but very much smaller than usual . this quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur lived during the upper jurassic ( middle kimmeridgian , about 154 million years ago ) . it was found in northern germany . it is an example of insular dwarfism . this means it probably came from an isolated sauropod population on an island in the lower saxony basin . small sauroopods with an adult body mass less than five tonnes are rare , and small sauropod bones usually come from juveniles . this species was a small adult , based on its bone histology . it was a dwarf species . there are fossils from more than 11 individuals of 1.7 to 6.2 m in total body length . these size differences between the specimens are due to growth stages , from juveniles to fully grown individuals . the little dinosaurs must have lived on one of the large islands around the lower saxony basin . a similar discovery was made in transylvania at the start of the 20th century . a local aristocrat , franz nopcsa , found the fossils on his estate . he realised they might have lived on an island , because he knew that dwarf elephants had lived on islands in the ice age . nopsca 's estate was ruined by world war i , but his find was recorded as `` magyarosaurus '' .
