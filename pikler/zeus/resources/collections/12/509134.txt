Test pilot     a test pilot is a person who drives an aircraft ( such as an airplane or spacecraft ) in ways that allow the aircraft to be tried out . the methods a test pilot uses to try out an aircraft are called `` flight test techniques '' ( ftts ) . the pilot uses the ftts to find out if the aircraft works well or not . test pilots may work for the military or for a company . flying military aircraft in order to test them is the most difficult and dangerous kind of flying other than flying in war . in the 1950s , one test pilot died in an accident every week or so , but many fewer die today . this is because aircraft technology has been improved and because more testing is done on the ground rather than in the air . also , unmanned aerial vehicles are now often used for testing . still , the job of test pilot is more dangerous than other jobs for pilots . a test pilot must be able to : - understand a test plan ; - follow a test plan while flying a plane ; - record the results of each test ; - sense how the aircraft is behaving oddly , if it is doing so ;
