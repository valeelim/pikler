Browder v. Gayle     browder v. gayle , 142 f. supp . 707 ( 1956 ) , was a case heard before a three-judge panel of the united states district court for the middle district of alabama on montgomery and alabama state bus segregation laws . the district court ruled 2-1 , with one dissenting , on june 5 , 1956 that bus segregation was unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendment protections for equal treatment . the state and city appealed , and the decision was upheld by the united states supreme court on november 13 , 1956. a motion for clarification and for rehearing was denied on december 17 , 1956. about two months after the montgomery bus boycott began , civil rights activists reconsidered the case of claudette colvin . she was a 15-year-old girl who had been the first person arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a montgomery , alabama bus . black leaders had been looking for a test case to test the constitutionality of the segregation laws of the state of alabama and the city of montgomery . one of the attorneys , clifford durr , was concerned that an appeal of mrs. rosa parks ' case would get tied up in the alabama state courts . they needed a way to get directly to the federal courts . colvin and several others who were discriminated against on montgomery busses , agreed to become plaintiffs in a federal civil action lawsuit , thus bypassing the alabama court system . the bus company said segregation was valid on `` privately owned busses '' which operated according to the laws of the city and state .
