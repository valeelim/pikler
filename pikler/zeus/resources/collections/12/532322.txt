Undue burden standard     the undue burden standard is a constitutional test created by the supreme court of the united states . the test , first developed in the late 19th century , is widely used in american constitutional law . in short , the undue burden standard says the legislature can not make a particular law that is too burdensome or restrictive of one 's fundamental rights . one use of the standard was in `` morgan v. commonwealth of virginia , '' 328 u.s. 373 ( 1946 ) . in a 7-to-1 ruling , associate justice stanley forman reed fashioned an `` undue burden '' test to decide the constitutionality of a virginia law requiring separate but equal racial segregation in public transportation . `` there is a recognized abstract principle , however , that may be taken as a postulate for testing whether particular state legislation in the absence of action by congress is beyond state power . this is that the state legislation is invalid if it unduly burdens that commerce in matters where uniformity is necessaryâ€”necessary in the constitutional sense of useful in accomplishing a permitted purpose .
