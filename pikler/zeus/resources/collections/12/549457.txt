Etching     etching is made by drawing lines through a protective coating on a copper or zinc plate . the plate is then placed into acid . the acid cuts into the unprotected parts of the surface to create a design in the metal . the printing is done by rolling an ink pad across the surface . the ink sinks into the intaglio ( cut ) surface , and rolls off the waxed surface off the plate . the metal plate is then pressed onto paper .
