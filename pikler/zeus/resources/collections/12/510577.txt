Satellite flare     a satellite flare ( also called a iridium flares or satellite glint ) is a phenomenon caused by man-made satellite where the sunlight is reflected back to earth . this results in a quick and bright `` flare . '' some flares can be up to 20 times brighter than venus . iridium satellites are satellites that are used for telephones and other purposes such as navigation . most of them are in a controlled orbit , so the flares from these satellites can be predicted . computer programs can be fed the satellite 's information and can predict a flare to an observer 's location . the iridium satellite is known for having a weird shape . it has three door-sized antennas that occasionally reflects sunlight back to earth . these can be very bright . so much so , that it can even be seen during the day . this annoys astronomers because it disrupts their observations .
