Mesozoic marine revolution     the mesozoic marine revolution was the great increase in sea-floor predators that ate shellfish . the term was used by vermeij , a paleontologist who spent years investigating changes in seafloor invertebrates . there was a notable change in sea-floor life between the palaeozoic fauna and the modern fauna . this change occurred during the mesozoic . in the mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish ( brachiopods and bivalves ) . these predators are still abundant today : they are mostly the starfish , the gastropods , and the crabs . each predator has its own methods . crabs break the shells by force . various types of gastropods developed the ability to get into shells . the muricidae bore through shells and consume prey . some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance ; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell . once they get their proboscis in , they eat the shellfish . perhaps surprisingly , some sponges can also bore into shells . during the mesozoic there were also a number of vertebrate predators of shellfish : the placodonts , and some ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs had flat shell-crushing teeth .
