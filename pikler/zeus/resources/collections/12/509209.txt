Priming (psychology)    priming ( psychology ) priming is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus . experiments in the early 1970s showed that people were faster recognising a word , when the word followed a related word . for example , nurse is recognized more quickly following doctor than following bread . activation spreading among related ideas was the best explanation for this effect . in experiments the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes . this allows the priming effect to be measured . priming can occur following perceptual , semantic , or conceptual stimulus repetition . for example , if a person reads a list of words including the word `` table '' , and is later asked to complete a word starting with `` tab '' , the probability that he or she will answer `` table '' is greater than if they are not primed . another example is if people see an incomplete sketch they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture , later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time .
