Pottawatomie massacre     the pottawatomie massacre happened on the night of may 24 , 1856. john brown and a number of volunteer free-staters attacked and murdered five men in a small settlement on the pottawatomie creek near manhattan , kansas . the killings were particularly brutal . one by one , settlers were dragged from their homes and hacked to death with broadswords and shot . the victims were pro-slavery , but were not slave owners themselves . the murders were in response to pro-slavery missouri border ruffians who burned and looted lawrence , kansas three days earlier . it happened just two days after the caning of charles sumner , the senator from massachusetts on the floor of the united states senate . the pottawatomie massacre was one of the many bloody episodes in kansas preceding the american civil war . it marked the beginning of the period called bleeding kansas . in 1854 , the missouri compromise , which had restricted the expansion of slavery in the united states , was done away with by the kansasâ€“nebraska act . based on the doctrine of popular sovereignty , the federal government allowed the issue of slavery to be decided by those settling the kansas territory . by popular vote the people who lived there would decide whether kansas would become a `` slave-state '' or be a `` free-state '' ( free of slavery ) . pro-slavery missourians , free-staters and abolitionists all poured into kansas . soon , the different sides held their own elections and set up two opposing territorial governments . in may 1856 , a drunken mob of pro-slavers sacked the town of lawrence . brown was enraged at this and wanted vengeance .
