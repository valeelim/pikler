Bouillabaisse     bouillabaisse is a french fisherman 's soup . this traditional proven√ßal fish stew originated in the port of marseille . the word is a compound of `` bolhir '' ( to boil ) and `` abaissar '' ( to reduce heat , i.e. , simmer ) . it was a stew made by marseille fishermen using the bony rockfish they were unable to sell . as well as fish , the soup has mussels ( fr : `` moules '' ) and may have other marine invertebrates . vegetables such as leeks , onions , tomatoes , celery , and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish . the broth is traditionally served with a rouille , a mayonnaise made of olive oil , garlic , saffron , and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread . in marseille , the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and `` rouille '' , then the fish is served separately on a large platter ( see image ) . a simpler version has the fish and broth brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates .
