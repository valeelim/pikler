Convict lease     convict leasing was a form of forced labor used by prisons in the southern united states . ( `` convict '' is a rude word for `` prisoner '' ; leasing is like renting something . ) under the system , prisons leased prisoners out as free workers to corporations , business owners , and plantation owners . basically , the prisons were selling prisoners like slaves , except that they were not sold forever . this system made a lot of money for prisons and the contractors . the contractors got workers who they did not have to pay , and who they could treat however they wanted . the prisons got payments from the contractors . also , they no longer had to pay for food , clothing , or housing for the prisoners who they leased out ; the contractors did . in 1898 , for example , about 73 % of alabama 's entire yearly state revenue came from convict leasing . for this reason , convict leasing lasted almost 100 years in the south . the state of louisiana leased out convicts as early as 1844. however , convict leasing began to spread throughout the south during the reconstruction era ( 1865â€“1877 ) . this was just after the end of the american civil war , which ended slavery . with no more slaves to work for them , southern farmers and businessmen needed to find new workers . southern legislatures passed laws called black codes to keep blacks from moving freely and to force them to work for whites . as historian douglas blackmon explains :
