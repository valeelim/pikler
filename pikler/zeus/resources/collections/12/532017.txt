Investment bank     the phrase investment bank refers to a business that helps other businesses ( and also governments ) borrow money from other people and businesses and/or allow businesses to partially or fully sell themselves to other people and businesses . unlike a regular bank , they do not typically lend their own money or use their own money to purchase part or all of a business , but instead they help to match the business financing need to those other business and personal investors who are seeking to earn money by either lending to the business or owning part of the business . in the mid twentieth century , certain investment banks started to also try and help their business clients to sell their business entirely to other businesses instead of to investors , as well as to help businesses decide what other business they should buy , in exchange for a fee based on the sale price of the business . this activity became known as mergers and acquisitions and today falls into the category of investment banking . in fact , there are many small investment banks that only offer this activity , and do not help businesses to borrow money or sell ownership in the business .
