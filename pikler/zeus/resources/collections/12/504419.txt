Winnowing     winnowing is a farming method developed by ancient people for separating grain from chaff . it is also used to remove weevils or other pests from stored grain . threshing , which is the loosening of grain or seeds from the husks and straw , comes before winnowing . in its simplest form it involves throwing the mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff . the heavier grains fall back down for recovery . this method is called `` wind-grading '' . other methods include using a winnowing fan ( a shaped basket shaken to raise the chaff ) . yet another is using a tool ( a winnowing fork or shovel ) on a pile of harvested grain . winnowing can also describe the natural removal of fine material from a coarser sediment by wind or flowing water . this is similar to separating wheat from chaff .
