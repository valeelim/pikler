Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution     the eleventh amendment ( amendment xi ) to the united states constitution was passed by congress on march 4 , 1794 and ratified by the states on february 7 , 1795. it deals with each state 's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the u.s. supreme court 's decision in `` chisholm v. georgia '' . the idea of sovereign immunity originated in english common law . it was also proposed by political theorists like thomas hobbes and jean bodin . the founding fathers of the constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits . several anti-federalists were afraid that article iii , section 1 of the constitution , which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits `` between a state and citizens of another state '' , would override that doctrine . the eleventh amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the supreme court in `` chisholm v. georgia '' ( 1793 ) . in `` chisholm '' the court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against us states . also , that states were not immune to these cases . the eleventh amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country . it says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state .
