TAT-1     tat-1 ( transatlantic no . 1 ) was the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable system . it was laid between oban , scotland and clarenville , newfoundland . two cables were laid between 1955 and 1956. one cable for each direction . it was inaugurated on september 25 , 1956. the cable was able to carry 35 simultaneous telephone calls . a 36th channel was used to carry up to 22 telegraph lines . the first transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid in 1858 ( see cyrus west field ) . it only operated for a month , but was replaced with a successful connection in 1866. a radio-based transatlantic telephone service was started in 1927. it charged Â£9 for three minutes . a telephone cable was discussed at that time . but it was not practical until a number of technological advances arrived in the 1940s . the developments that made tat-1 possible were coaxial cable , polyethylene insulation , very reliable vacuum tubes for the submerged repeaters and an improvement in carrier equipment . transistors were not used , being a recent invention of unknown longevity .
