Ethiopian calendar     the ethiopian calendar is the main calendar used in ethiopia . it serves as the liturgical calendar for christians in eritrea and ethiopia belonging to the orthodox tewahedo churches , eastern catholic church and coptic orthodox church . it is a solar calendar which comes from the egyptian calendar . but like the julian calendar , it adds a leap day every four years . it begins the year on august 29 or august 30 in the julian calendar . a seven to eight-year gap between the ethiopian and gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the annunciation of jesus . like the coptic calendar , the ethiopic calendar has twelve months of 30 days plus five or six epagomenal days , which make up a thirteenth month . the ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the coptic calendar . the names of the days are in ge'ez . the sixth epagomenal day is added every four years without exception on august 29 of the julian calendar . this occurs six months before the julian leap day . thus the first day of the ethiopian year , `` 1 mäskäräm '' , for years between 1900 and 2099 ( inclusive ) , is usually september 11 ( gregorian ) . it , however , falls on september 12 in years before the gregorian leap year . the ethiopian new year falls on september 11 of the gregorian calendar . on leap years it falls on september 12 .
