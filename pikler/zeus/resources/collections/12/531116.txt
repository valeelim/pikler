Cerebrospinal fluid     cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) bathes and protects the central nervous system ( the brain and the spinal cord ) . `` cerebro '' means `` brain '' ; `` spinal '' is a short version of `` spinal cord '' ; and fluid is a liquid . csf is made by networks of blood vessels called choriod plexuses in each of the brain 's four ventricles . csf flows through the subarachnoid space - the space between the two layers of meninges that are closest to the skull ( the arachnoid layer and the dura mater ) . csf also fills the brain 's ventricles , and flows down the middle of the spinal cord ( the `` central canal '' ) . csf is created from blood plasma ( the liquid part of blood ) , so csf 's contents are very similar to plasma 's . csf is 99 % water . it carries : - protein ( though much less than plasma carries ) - glucose ( sugar ) - nutrients - neurotransmitters ( chemical messengers ) - electrolytes ( salts ) , like sodium , potassium , calcium , magnesium , and chloride . there should be very few white blood cells in the csf , or none at all . there should be no red blood cells in the csf .
