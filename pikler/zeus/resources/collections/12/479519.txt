Dictyostelid     the dictyostelids are a group of cellular slime molds , or `` social amoebae '' . they are very unusual eukaryote organisms . for much of their life they live as separate cells . then in hard times they come together to reproduce as a fruiting body . the fruiting body produces spores with protective walls . they survive and open up in better times . so these organisms are both unicellular and multicellular . as separate amoebae , they feed and divide normally . they mostly eat soil bacteria . when the food supply runs out , they come together to form a kind of slug-like thing . the slug has a definite front and rear . it responds to light and temperature differences , and has the ability to move . under the right conditions the slug becomes a sporocarp ( fruiting body ) . a stalk holds up one or more balls of spores . these spores are inactive cells protected by tough cell walls . they become new amoebae once food is available . `` dictyostelium '' has been used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics . it is studied as an example of cell communication , differentiation , and programmed cell death . research on `` dictyostelium '' is available on-line at dictybase .
