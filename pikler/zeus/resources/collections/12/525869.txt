Combine harvester     a combine harvester , also called a combine , is a machine that harvests crops . its name comes from doing three separate parts of harvesting crops at once : - reaping : cutting and collecting crops when they are ready for harvesting , - threshing : separating the parts of a crop that can be eaten by people from the parts that ca n't , and - winnowing : removing the already separated parts of the crop that ca n't be eaten by people , the chaff , while keeping the part that can be eaten , the grain . far fewer people work in farming as a result of the combine harvester .
