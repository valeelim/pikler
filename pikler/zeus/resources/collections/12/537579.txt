Saga     sagas are stories mostly about ancient nordic and germanic life . some are entirely invented , and some have an historical basis . they tell about early viking voyages , the battles that took place during the voyages , about migration to iceland and of feuds between icelandic families . they were written in the old norse language , mainly in iceland . the texts are tales in prose which share some similarities with the epic , often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text , of heroic deeds of days long gone , `` tales of worthy men , '' who were often vikings , sometimes pagan , sometimes christian . they are sometimes romanticised and fantastic , but always dealing with human beings one can understand . the best sagas are recognised as fine literature . `` njál 's saga '' , or the `` saga of burnt njál '' , is one of the most famous . in old english ( anglo-saxon ) , beowulf is a saga written in england , and so is the later gawain and the green knight , written in a west midlands dialect . these are both works of the imagination , but layamon 's `` brut '' ( about 1200 ad ) is based on english history since the `` anglo-saxon chronicle '' .
