CRISPR     crispr is a term used in microbiology . it stands for clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats . these are a natural segment of the genetic code found in prokaryotes : most bacteria and archaea have it . crispr has a lot of short repeated sequences . these sequences are part of an adaptive immune system for prokaryotes . it allows them to remember and counter other organisms that prey on them , such as bacteriophages . they have the potential to modify the genes of almost any organism . they are part of a tool that allows precisely targeted cutting and insertion of genes in genetic modification ( gm ) . work is under way to find how they can be used to attack virus diseases in humans . each repetition is followed by short segments of `` spacer dna '' from previous exposures to a bacterial virus or plasmid . crispr spacers recognize and cut up the foreign genetic elements in a manner like rna interference in eukaryotic organisms . in effect , the spacers are fragments of dna from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell line . the foreign source of the spacers was a sign to researchers that the crispr/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria .
