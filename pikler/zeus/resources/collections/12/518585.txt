Dither fish     dither fish are aquarium fish used by cichlid owners to make some species of cichlids less timid . dither fish usually swim around the top of a tank . this behavior encourages more timid fish to relax and venture out more . the timid fish think ( correctly ) that no predators are around . the technique relies on the ability of cichlids in an aquarium to use the behaviour of other fish species as a sign that the environment is safe . good dither fish are typically schooling species , such as some `` danio '' species , barbs and some tetra species .
