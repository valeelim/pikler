Model 1857 12-Pounder Napoleon Field Gun     the model 1857 12-pounder napoleon field gun , officially called the “ light 12-pounder gun ” by the united states army , was the most popular smoothbore cannon used during the american civil war . the cannon was named after french president and emperor , napoleon iii , nephew of napoleon bonaparte . the french `` canon obusier de campagne de 12 cm , modèle 1853 '' , also known as the `` canon de l ’ empereur '' , was a type of canon-obusier ( shell cannon ) or gun-howitzer developed in 1853 by the french army . it could fire ball , shell , canister or grapeshot which allowed it to replace all the earlier french cannons . it was of a cast bronze smoothbore design and could double as a howitzer . it was light enough to be pulled by a team of horses . at the same time it had enough firepower to destroy fortifications at a distance of a half-mile ( 805 meters ) . when it entered the service of emperor napoléon iii it was named after him . in 1857 the design was adopted by the u.s. army as the light 12-pounder m1857 . the union made 1,156 units while the confederacy made 501. because they did not have the manufacturing capacity of the north , confederates attempted to capture as many union-made napoleon 12-pounders as they could . the confederate army also developed their own version . in 1863 , general robert e. lee was so impressed by the m1857 that he had all six-pounders in the army of northern virginia gathered up and sent to richmond to be melted down and re-cast into 12-pounders . the confederates kept producing 12-pounder napoleons until the union army captured the ducktown copper mines near chattanooga , tennessee . this reduced confederates bronze production . after that confederate 1857s were cast of iron .
