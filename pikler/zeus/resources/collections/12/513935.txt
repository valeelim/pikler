Ancient Egyptian royal titles     the ancient egyptian royal titles were a standard way of naming the pharaohs , the kings of ancient egypt . these names and titles showed the king 's worldly and religious powers . the names could provide a sort of mission statement for the king . names and titles sometimes changed during the reign . by the middle kingdom the pharaohs used a set of five titles . the full set of titles , the titulary , using the five names , became the standard and were still in use as late as the roman empire . g5-o33 the horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh 's name . it began in the predynastic period . many of the oldest-known egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title . the horus name was usually written inside a serekh . this was a symbol of a palace fa√ßade . the name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside the serekh . usually there would be an image of the falcon god horus on top or beside it . one egyptian ruler , the 2nd dynasty seth-peribsen , used an image of the god seth instead of horus . perhaps this was showing there had been some kind of religious division within the country . he was succeeded by khasekhemwy , who placed the symbols of both set and horus above his name . later kings always had the image of horus beside their name .
