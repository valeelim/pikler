Campaign for &quot;santorum&quot; neologism    campaign for & quot ; santorum & quot ; neologism the campaign for the neologism `` santorum '' started with a contest held in may 2003 by dan savage . savage is a sex columnist and lgbt rights activist . he asked his readers to create a definition for the word `` santorum '' in response to then-u.s. senator rick santorum 's opinions about homosexuality , and comments about same sex marriage . in his comments , santorum had stated that `` in every society , the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality . that 's not to pick on homosexuality . it 's not , you know , man on child , man on dog , or whatever the case may be . '' savage announced the winning entry , which defined `` santorum '' as `` the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex '' . he created a web site , `` spreadingsantorum.com '' ( and `` santorum.com '' ) , to promote the definition . in 2010 savage said he would take the site down if santorum donated us $ 5 million plus interest to freedom to marry . that group supports legal recognition of same-sex marriages . in september 2011 santorum asked google to remove the definition from its search engine index . google refused . they said that the company does not remove content from search results except in very limited circumstances .
