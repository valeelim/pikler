UML diagram     the unified modeling language ( uml ) is a general-purpose , developmental , modeling language in the field of software engineering , that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system . uml was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design developed by grady booch , ivar jacobson and james rumbaugh at rational software in 1994â€“95 , with further development led by them through 1996. in 1997 uml was adopted as a standard by the object management group ( omg ) , and has been managed by this organization ever since . in 2005 the unified modeling language was also published by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) as an approved iso standard . since then it has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of uml . though well-known and widely used in education and academic papers , as of 2013 uml is little-used in industry , and most such use is informal and ad hoc .
