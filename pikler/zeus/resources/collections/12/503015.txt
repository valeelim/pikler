Lokiarchaeota     the lokiarchaeota are a proposed phylum of the archaea . it was proposed in 2015 after the composite genome of lokiarchaeum was sequenced . the `` lokiarchaeum '' genome has 5,381 protein coding genes . of these , about 32 % do not correspond to any known protein . 26 % closely resemble archeal proteins , and 29 % correspond to bacterial proteins . this is consistent with previous research which suggests significant gene transfer between bacteria and archaea . a small , but significant portion of the proteins ( 175 , 3.3 % ) were most similar to eukaryotic proteins . analysis suggested the genes in question had their origin at the base of the eukaryotic clades . in eukaryotes , the function of these proteins include cell membrane and cell shape formation , and a dynamic protein cytoskeleton . another shared protein , actin , is used in phagocytosis by eukaryotes . phagocytosis is the ability to engulf and consume another particle . this ability is required for the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria . cells with mitochondria is one of the key differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes . in a widely accepted theory , mitochondria began as bacteria and were gradually incorporated into eukaryotic cells . chloroplasts had a similar origin .
