Water tower     a water tower is a building that is used to hold and give out water . it is almost always built on a high place . it works because a pump gives water to the tower , and gravity makes the saved water go out to the places that need water . those places are connected to the tower by pipes . a water tower is good when there is no power because it uses gravity to send out the water .
