Dialetheism     dialetheism is the that some statements can be both true and false at the same time . it is the opposite of the law of noncontradiction ( lnc ) . because of this dialetheism is completely opposite of what most philosophers call common sense . graham priest defines it as believing there can be true contradictions . priest gives as an example the liar paradox ( or liar 's paradox ) . if someone says `` everything i say is a lie '' , then is the statement true or false ? in this paradox it can be both .
