Ventricular tachycardia     ventricular tachycardia ( v-tach or vt ) is a type of tachycardia ( a fast heart rate ) . the heart has four chambers ( closed spaces ) . the top two are called the atria , and the bottom two are called the ventricles . when the heart is working normally , electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first . however , in ventricular tachycardia , the ventricles squeeze first . this happens because the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working . ventricular tachycardia is a medical emergency . first of all , if the heart is beating too fast , it does not have time to refill with blood between beats . this means that the heart will not be able to squeeze out enough blood to the rest of the body . most people in ventricular tachycardia have a heart rate of at least 170 beats per minute . this is very fast . ( a normal heart rate is 60-100 . ) ventricular tachycardia can also cause low blood pressure . if the blood pressure gets low enough , important parts of the body , like the brain , will not get enough blood and oxygen to survive .
