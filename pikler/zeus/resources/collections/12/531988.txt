List of landmark court decisions in the United States     the following is a partial list of landmark court decisions in the united states . landmark decisions establish a significant new legal precedent or concept . they can also substantially change the interpretation of existing law . such a decision may settle the law in more than one way : - by distinguishing a new principle that refines a prior principle . this way it can depart from prior practice without violating the rule of `` stare decisis '' . - or , by establishing a test case ( a case used to set a precedent ) or a measurable standard that can be applied by courts in future decisions . in the united states , landmark court decisions come most frequently from the supreme court . sometimes united states courts of appeals make such decisions , particularly if the supreme court chooses not to review the case or if it adopts the holding of the lower court . although many cases from state supreme courts are significant in developing the law of that state , only a few are so radically different that they announce standards that many other state courts then choose to follow .
