Veridical paradox     in 1962 , w. v. quine said there were three classes of paradoxes : - a `` veridical paradox '' seems absurd but is shown to be true . thus , the paradox of frederic 's birthday in `` the pirates of penzance '' notes that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a leap day . likewise , arrow 's impossibility theorem shows difficulties in mapping voting results to the will of the people . the monty hall paradox shows that a decision which seems to be a 50-50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which the player would be unlikely to make . in 20th century science , hilbert 's paradox of the grand hotel and schr√∂dinger 's cat are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end . - a `` falsidical paradox '' establishes a result that not only `` appears '' false but actually `` is '' false , due to a fallacy in the demonstration . the various invalid mathematical proofs ( e.g. , that 1 = 2 ) are classic examples . most of them rely on a hidden division by zero . another example is the inductive form of the horse paradox , which falsely generalizes from true specific statements . zeno 's paradoxes are falsidical , concluding for example that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a hare can not catch up to a tortoise with a small head start .
