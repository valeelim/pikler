The Temple Institute     the temple institute ( â€“ `` '' ) is a museum , research institute and education center in old city of jerusalem . it was established in 1987 by rabbi yisrael ariel . the institute is dedicated to the two temples in jerusalem ( called the first and second temples ) . rabbi ariel plans to rebuild the second temple on the man-made plateau the jews call the temple mount . the site is currently occupied by an islamic shrine , the dome of the rock . the institute has collected tens of thousands of dollars , mostly from jews in the united states . this is in spite of the fact that rebuilding the temple of herod , destroyed by the romans in 79 ad , would almost certainly cause a major war . in 2014 , the government of jordan sent a letter to the state of israel warning them to guard against any attacks by extremist groups against the temple mount . other websites . - the temple institute
