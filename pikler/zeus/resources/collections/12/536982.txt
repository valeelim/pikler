Mitigating factor     when a person commits a capital crime , a mitigating factor is something that might help the person avoid getting the death penalty . ( `` to mitigate '' means `` to decrease . '' a `` factor '' is something that causes something else . so , in law , a mitigating factor is something that can cause punishment to decrease . ) mitigating factors do not automatically result in decreased punishment . judges and juries also think about aggravating factors things that are likely to cause a more severe punishment . also , mitigating factors are not an excuse for committing a crime . they may help explain what caused a person to commit a crime , but they do not mean the person did nothing wrong . sixteen countries in africa have `` abolished '' the death penalty ( made it illegal in the country ) . another 22 countries have not used the death penalty in over 10 years , or have a moratorium ( a temporary stop ) on the death penalty . according to cornell university 's law school , as of 2015 , only one of the countries in africa that still uses the death penalty has laws about mitigating factors . that country is botswana .
