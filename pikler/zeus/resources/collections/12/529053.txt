Respiratory tract     in humans , the respiratory tract is the parts of the body that help with respiration ( getting oxygen into the body and getting rid of carbon dioxide ) . the respiratory tract is divided into two sections : the upper airways and the lower airways . these two sections are separated by the vocal cords . the upper respiratory tract starts with the nose and the nasal cavity . when a person breathes in through the nose , the air goes into the nasal cavity . the nasal cavity is lined with mucous and little hairs called cilia . these help filter things like dust out of the air a person breathes . the nasal cavity also warms the air . next is the pharynx . the pharynx is a common pathway for air and food . when a person breathes in , air goes through the pharynx on its way to the lungs . when a person eats , food passes through the pharynx on its way to the digestive system . there are three parts to the pharynx : 1. the nasopharynx ends around the uvula . 1. the oropharynx goes from the uvula to the base of the tongue .
