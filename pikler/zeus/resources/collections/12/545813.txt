Endothermic reaction     an endothermic reaction is a chemical reaction that takes in energy from the surroundings . the opposite of an endothermic reaction is an exothermic reaction . reversible reactions are where the products can react to remake the original reactants . the energy is usually transferred as heat energy : the reaction absorbs heat . the temperature decrease can sometimes be detected using a thermometer . some examples of endothermic reactions are : - photosynthesis - the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate - dissolving ammonium chloride in water
