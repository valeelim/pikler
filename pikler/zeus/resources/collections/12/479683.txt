Combination (mathematics)    combination ( mathematics ) in mathematics , combination is used for picking a number of objects from a given set of objects . combinatorics looks at the number of possibilities to pick k objects from a set of n. it does not take into account the order , in which these are picked . people talk about finding permutations , if the order in which the objects are picked matters . it is easy to see that there are more permutations than combinations . one combination , picking the objects 1,3 , and 5 in the example can be done in the following ways : { 1,3,5 } , { 1,5,3 } , { 3,1,5 } , { 3,5,1 } , { 5,1,3 } and { 5,3,1 } .
