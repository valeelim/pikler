Lysozyme     lysozymes are part of the innate immune system . they are enzymes which are in mucus secretions like saliva . they protect against infection by chopping up the bacteria , viruses and fungi which infect animals . the name 'lysozyme ' was coined in 1922 by alexander fleming ( 1881â€“1955 ) , the discoverer of penicillin . fleming first observed the antibacterial action of lysozyme when he treated bacterial cultures with nasal mucus from a patient suffering from a common cold . lysozyme is in a number of secretions , such as tears , saliva , milk , and mucus . it is also present in cytoplasmic granules of macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils . the enzyme works by attacking polymers in the cell walls of bacteria , especially gram-positive bacteria like `` bacillus '' and `` streptococcus '' . lysozyme was the second protein structure , and the first enzyme structure , solved by x-ray diffraction methods . it was the first enzyme to be fully sequenced that contains all twenty common amino acids . it was also the first enzyme to have a detailed , specific mechanism suggested for its action . this work led to an explanation of how enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by their physical structures .
