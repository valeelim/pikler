Bye (sports)    bye ( sports ) a bye in sports and other competitive activities can have two different meanings . both mean that a participant in a competition is not required to compete while most of the other participants are . its main use is in tournament competitions . in single-elimination tournaments , when there are an odd number of participants , a bye allows one or more to play in a later round . other types of eliminator tournaments may also include a bye for others reasons . an example would be as a reward for the best ranked team ( s ) . in round-robin tournaments where there are an odd number of competitors , usually one gets a bye in each round . however , over the whole tournament , each team plays the same number of games . similar to the round-robin context , in leagues where most teams play on the same days during regular-season play , a team that does not play on a given day is said to be on bye . in sports that are played weekly , especially gridiron football , a team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week . for example , during the regular football season in the nfl , each team gets a week off ( bye week ) during the regular season .
