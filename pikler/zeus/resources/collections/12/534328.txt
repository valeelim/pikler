Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution     adopted on march 30 , 1870 , the fifteenth amendment ( amendment xv ) to the united states constitution granted african-american men the right to vote . it was one of the reconstruction amendments . nowhere in the original constitution or the bill of rights were americans given the right to vote . the fifteenth amendment gave african-american men the right to vote . but not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the fourteenth amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens . the reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the bill of rights and constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time . each state had different rules for who could vote . some allowed free blacks the right to vote . others allowed women the right to vote . a few states required ownership of property in order to vote . in the election of 1868 , republican party candidate , ulysses s. grant , won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote . he received support from free black voters in the south . without that support , he probably would have lost the election . at the time blacks could not vote in the northern states . the republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help . at the time republicans controlled both the senate and house . the proposed amendment was passed by congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification . it was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. part of the reason why is that republicans also controlled the state governments in the south . southern democrats were not able to block the measure .
