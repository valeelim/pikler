FN Five-seveN     the fn five-seven , trademarked as the five-seven , is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by fabrique nationale d ’ armes de guerre-herstal ( fn herstal ) in belgium . the pistol is named for its 5.7-mm ( .224 in ) bullet diameter , and the trademark capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer 's initials— '' fn '' . the five-seven pistol was developed in conjunction with the fn p90 personal defense weapon and the fn 5.7×28mm cartridge . the p90 was introduced in 1990 , and the five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition . developed as a companion pistol to the p90 , the five-seven shares many of its design features : it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a large magazine capacity , ambidextrous controls , low recoil , and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types . sales of the five-seven were originally restricted by fn to military and law enforcement customers , but since 2004 , the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection , target shooting , and similar uses . although offered only with sporting ammunition , the five-seven 's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the brady campaign , and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the united states .
