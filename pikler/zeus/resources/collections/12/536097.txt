Federalism in the United States     federalism in the united states is the relationship between the state governments and the federal government . this relationship is set out in the united states constitution . the constitution says which powers the federal government has , and which powers belong to the states . the goal of federalism is to create a balance of power , so neither the states or the federal government can get too powerful . when america was a colony of the british empire , it was ruled by the government of king george iii . many american colonists thought this government was corrupt and did not care about the colonists ' rights . the founding fathers of the united states started to believe in an idea they called republicanism . this idea said that the people in a country should be able to choose their government . it said that the government 's job was to protect people 's natural rights , and if the government did not do this , the people had the right to overthrow it . by 1775 , these ideas were common in colonial america .
