Cementum     cementum is the hard outside layer of a tooth root . it is not present in the crown ( part above the gums ) portion of a tooth . cementum allows periodontal ligaments to attach onto it , allowing tooth to be connected to the maxilla or mandible . cementum is made up of - 45 % to 50 % hydroxyapatite ( mineral found in teeth and bones ) - 50 % to 55 % collagen ( mostly type i collagen ) and non-collagen organic matter the process of creating cementum is called cementogenesis . it is made by special type of cells known as cementoblasts . cementoblasts are found on the surface of the cementum . when a cementoblast is no longer on the surface , or when it is found surrounded by cementum , it is then known as a cementocyte . in contrast , cementoclasts are special cells that remove cementum instead of making cementum . the cementoenamel junction , or the cervical line , is the where enamel and cementum meet . the cementum and enamel may meet in different ways . - as a butt joint : this is when the enamel meets and touches the cementum .
