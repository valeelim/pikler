Izumo no Okuni     she is from izumo taisha shrine in the late 16th century . she was a daughter of sanemon nakamura but it is not sure when she was born and died . she started to dance kagura-mai and nenbutsu-odori ( two traditional dances ) in kimono in order to gather money for repairing izumo taisha . although dance was holy at that time , okuni went on stage in the highest fashion . she inserted a song and character of ghost on stage . it became popular because it was unique . at first okuni danced simple dances . later , she danced with clothing of a man , and showed at the kitano tenmangutemple in 1603. this became the first kabuki . okuni 's troupe was exclusively female . thus , she required her actresses to play both male and female roles . in particular , okuni herself was best known for her roles as samurai and christian priests . as her group gained fame , she was copied by many others , particularly brothels . they offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients , and get prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills . this new style of exclusively female groups became known as shibai , onnakabuki , ( from onna , the japanese word for `` woman '' or `` girl '' ) and okuni kabuki .
