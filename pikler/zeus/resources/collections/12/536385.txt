Cancer of unknown primary origin     cancer of unknown primary origin ( cup , `` occult cancer '' ) is a term used to describe a cancer that is said to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis , but a primary tumor can not be identified . a diagnosis of cup requires a clinical picture with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor . cup is found in about 3 to 5 % of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer , and carries a poor prognosis in most ( 80 to 85 % ) of those circumstances . the other 15 to 20 % of patients , however , have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment .
