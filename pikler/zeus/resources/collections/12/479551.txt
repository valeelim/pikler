Pedal steel guitar     the pedal steel guitar is a type of electric steel guitar that is built on legs or a stand . it usually has foot pedals which adjust the sound of the instrument . like other electric guitars , the musical instrument produces sound by the vibration of its strings which are converted by magnetic pickup connected to an amplifier . pedal steels may have one or two `` necks '' that typically have 10 strings each . some may have as many as 14. unlike most other guitars , pedal steel guitars have reference lines on the fretboard . this is where frets would be , but there are no actual frets . the player changes the pitch of one or more strings by sliding a steel from one position to another while plucking the strings . pedal steels are typically plucked with a thumb pick and fingers , or two or three fingerpicks . the pedals are mounted on a cross bar below the body . the action of the pedals may be fixed or changed by the player to select which strings the pedals affects . while there are some fairly standard pedal assignments , many advanced players devise their own setups , called `` copedents '' . the pedal steel evolved from the console steel guitar and lap steel guitar .
