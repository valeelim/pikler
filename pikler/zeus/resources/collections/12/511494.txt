Wrecking ball     a wrecking ball is a heavy steel ball used for demolishing large buildings . it is usually hung from a crane . a crane operator swings the ball back and forth like a pendulum . it works best tearing down masonry buildings . early round shapes would sometimes get stuck in walls and roofs . the modern wrecking ball is pear-shaped to avoid this problem . it is not clear when the wrecking ball was invented . they were commonly in use by 1936 in new york city . today they are no longer used as much in demolition . the wrecking ball has largely been replaced by the more efficient high reach excavator . `` think of a long-reach excavator as a demolition scalpel , compared to the mallet of a wrecking ball '' . < br >
