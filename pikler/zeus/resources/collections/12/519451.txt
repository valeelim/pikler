Arbitration     arbitration , a form of alternative dispute resolution ( adr ) , is a way of resolving disputes outside the courts . litigation can be expensive , time-consuming and unpredictable . with arbitration the parties to a dispute agree to have the disagreement decided by a neutral third party . more often this is a panel of three arbitrators . each party suggests one , then both arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator . the decision is the result of a majority vote . arbitration includes an agreement in advance by both parties to comply with the decision of the arbitrator ( s ) . the process includes a hearing in which both parties may be heard . the arbitrator ( s ) reviews the evidence in the case and makes a decision . one that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts . another form of alternative dispute resolution is mediation . mediation and arbitration both use neutral third parties . for that reason they are sometimes confused . one difference is that a mediator does not make any decisions . instead the mediator works towards getting both parties to agree . unlike arbitration , there is usually only one mediator . another difference is that mediation is usually non-binding . mediation is used more often in smaller disputes or when the matter is kept confidential . in some jurisdictions , mediation is required before a case can come to court .
