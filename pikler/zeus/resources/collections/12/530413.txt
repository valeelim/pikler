Radio galaxy     radio galaxies and their relatives , radio-loud quasars and blazars , are types of active galaxy that are very luminous at radio wavelengths . they have luminosities up to 10 w between 10 mhz and 100 ghz . the radio emission is due to the synchrotron process . the observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium , modified by the effects of relativistic beaming . radio galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxies . `` radio-loud '' active galaxies can be detected at large distances , making them valuable tools for observation . recently , much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium , particularly in galaxy groups and clusters .
