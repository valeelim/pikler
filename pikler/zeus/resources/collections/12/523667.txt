Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council     both pakistanis and the republic of indians came into formal existence as independent sovereign states 14/15th august , 1947. the principle of partition was specified in the plan : the all muslim majority areas were to constitute part of pakistan and similarly the hindu majority areas were to go to bharat . besides , the 565 princely states at that time including the state of jammu and kashmir were given the option either to join merger with pakistan or remain with india . such joining to either state was to be determined by the geographical contiguity and communal composition of the population . the state of jammu and kashmir with a 78 % muslims majority ( according to 1941 census ) should have acceded to pakistan . years old dispute between indian and pakistan unfortunately still hangs fire but this fact has not stopped the government of pakistan from going all out in helping the development and prosperity of its administration of kashmiri terriorities . the azad jammu and kashmir council ( ajk council ) is that vital constitutional link , in the interim which serves as a conduit for the purpose .
