Cloud forest     a cloud forest or fog forest is a ( usually ) tropical or subtropical , evergreen , montane , moist forest . it has a long-lasting , frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover , usually at the canopy level . cloud forests often have mosses covering the ground and vegetation . such mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains , where moisture from clouds is held in place . their altitude varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level . often there is a particular altitude where the environment is suitable for cloud forest . this has fog at the vegetation level , reducing direct sunlight and loss of the watery mist . much of the moisture to plants arrives by fog drip , where fog condenses on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below .
