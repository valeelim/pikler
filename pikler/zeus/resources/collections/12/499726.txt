Adapiform     adapiforms are an extinct group of early primates . adapiforms radiated throughout much of the northern continental mass , reaching as far south as northern africa and tropical asia . they lived from the eocene to the miocene epochs . some adapiforms looked similar to living lemurs . adapiforms are known from the fossil record only , and it is unclear whether they form a monophyletic or paraphyletic group . when assumed to be a clade , they are usually grouped under the `` wet-nosed '' taxon strepsirrhini , which would make them more closely related to the lemurs and less so to the `` dry-nosed '' haplorhini taxon that includes monkeys and apes . in 2009 , franzen and colleagues put the newly described genus `` darwinius '' as a stem `` missing link '' between strepsirrhini and haplorhini . later work on the `` darwinius '' fossil by erik seiffert and colleagues rejected this `` missing link '' idea . they classify `` darwinius '' and other adapiforms as strepsirrhini . the fossil record of the adapiforms is quite considerable . the fossils are first found in the earliest eocene , 55 million years ago ( mya ) . they lived in four continents ( north america , africa , europe and asia ) . the eocene was a period when the earth was much warmer than today , with very extensive tropical forests , far more so than today . the widespread remains mean a much earlier origin , and molecular clock dates suggest that primates evolved more than 80â€“90 mya , nearly 40 million years before they appear in the fossil record .
