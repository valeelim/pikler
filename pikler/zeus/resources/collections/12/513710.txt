Opus isodomum     opus isodomum is an ancient technique of wall building . it uses perfectly cut , completely regular square stone blocks of equal height , and sometimes of the same length . in classical antiquity this technique was perfected and widely used , especially for public buildings ( temples , theaters , amphitheaters etc. ) . one of the most well-known examples is the parthenon . vitruvius briefly described this technique in his de architectura , 2nd book , 8th chapter as following : `` a wall is called “ isodomum “ when all the courses are of equal height '' . vitruvius further states that the stone blocks of opus isodomum are bound together by mortar , but more often they are not connected with mortar but with metal ties such as iron cramps , fixed in stone blocks with molten lead . completely regular isodomum is relatively rare , especially in the provinces . more frequent is isodomum made of stone blocks of the same height but not of the same length . in order to strengthen this type of wall , builders always take good care that the ends of stone blocks in alternating courses of the wall do not match .
