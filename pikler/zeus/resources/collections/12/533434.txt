Root server     a root server is a special server in the domain name system that tells a computer what name servers to use for a single top level domain like `` .com '' or `` .net '' . there are 13 root servers that are in use . they use the letters a through m. a root server is used when a computer tries to look up a domain . for example , if a person types `` www.google.com '' into a web browser , their computer will ask their isp what the ip address for `` www.google.com '' is . if the isp 's dns server does not know ( does not have it cached ) , it will ask a root server which dns server can tell it the address . the isp 's root server will then get the address from the dns server that the root server tells it to . in 1981 , the idea of a domain name system was made as part of rfc 799. rfc 819 , rfc 882 , and rfc 883 said how dns was supposed to work and made it easier to understand . in 1984 , rfc 920 was the first rfc to say what the top level domains would be for the new dns . in 1985 , the first domain name was made and `` modern '' dns began .
