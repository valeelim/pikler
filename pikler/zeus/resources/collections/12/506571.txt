Catnip     nepeta cataria , catnip or catmint , is a species of the genus `` nepeta '' . it is in the lamiaceae family . the name `` catmint '' is sometimes used for the genus as a whole . catnip , and some other species in the genus `` nepeta '' , is known for its effects on cat behaviour . cats rub on the plant , roll on the ground , paw at it , lick it , and chew it . some leap about and purr , some cry out . cats do it for about five to fifteen minutes , after which olfactory fatigue usually sets in . the nepetalactone in catnip acts as a feline attractant after it enters the cat 's nose . at the olfactory epithelium , the nepetalactone binds to one or more olfactory receptors . the catnip effect works on the whole cat family , not just on domestic cats.. several tests showed that leopards , cougars , servals , and lynxes often reacted strongly to catnip in a manner similar to domestic cats . lions and tigers may react strongly as well , but they do n't react all the time . with domestic cats , `` n. cataria '' is a recreational substance for pets to enjoy . catnip and catnip-laced products are available to consumers .
