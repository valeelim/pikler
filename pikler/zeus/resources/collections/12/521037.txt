Mating     mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms , usually for the purposes of sexual reproduction . some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals , while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi . fertilization is the fusion of gametes . copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for internal fertilization . mating may also lead to external fertilization , as seen in amphibians , fishes and plants . for most species , mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes . for some hermaphroditic species , copulation is not needed because the parent organism can self-fertilize ( autogamy ) . in some flowering plants self-pollination can happen within the same flower , and some hermaphrodite animals self-fertilize . many gastropods are hermaphrodite , and do simultaneous copulation . so do earthworms . in some birds , mating includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring . the human practice of mating and artificial insemination of domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry .
