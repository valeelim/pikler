Black Hills     the black hills are a small mountain range from the great plains of north america in south dakota . native americans have a long history in the black hills . after conquering the cheyenne in 1776 , the lakota took over the territory of the black hills . in 1868 , the u.s. government signed the fort laramie treaty of 1868. this exempted the black hills from all white settlement forever . but , when european americans discovered gold there in 1874 , miners swept into the area in a gold rush . the us government reassigned the lakota , against their wishes , to other reservations in western south dakota . unlike most of south dakota , the black hills were settled by european americans from population centers to the west and south . miners flocked there from earlier gold boom places in colorado and montana . as the economy shifted from mining and logging , the tourism industry has grown . the black hills have two areas : `` the southern hills '' and `` the northern hills '' . the southern hills is home to mount rushmore national memorial , wind cave national park , jewel cave national monument , harney peak ( the highest point in the united states east of the rockies ) , custer state park ( the largest state park in south dakota , and one of the largest in the us ) , the crazy horse memorial ( the largest sculpture in the world ) , and the mammoth site in hot springs , the world â€™ s largest mammoth research facility .
