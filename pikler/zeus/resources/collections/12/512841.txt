Stimulus (psychology)    stimulus ( psychology ) a stimulus in psychology is an energy change ( such as light or sound ) which is received by the senses . the usage changes somewhat according to which school of psychology is using it : - in classical conditioning and behaviorism , a stimulus is the basis for behavior . - in perceptual psychology it is the basis for perception . in this context , a distinction is made between the `` distal stimulus '' ( the external , perceived object ) and the `` proximal stimulus '' ( the stimulation of sensory organs ) . - in experimental psychology , the term 'stimulus ' is used to describe `` the event or object to which a response is measured '' . in this case , not everything that is presented to participants is a stimulus . for example , a fixation cross is not said to be a stimulus , because it merely serves to center subject 's gaze at the center of the screen . also , longer events are usually not called 'stimuli ' , even when a response to such an event is measured . a stimulus or stimuli might be used to see if a person is in a coma and what type of coma .
