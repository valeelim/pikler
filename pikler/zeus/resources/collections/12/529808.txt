Zika fever     zika fever is an illness caused by the zika virus . the zika virus belongs to the genus `` flavivirus '' , like dengue fever and chikungunya . however , zika fever is usually not as bad as those illnesses . most people who get the zika virus ( 60-80 % ) have no symptoms . people who do have symptoms usually have a low fever , conjunctivitis , joint pain ( mainly in the hands and feet ) , and a rash . the rash often starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body . usually , the symptoms are not very bad , and get better after 2 to 7 days . starting in 2015 , there has been an outbreak of zika virus ( meaning that many people have gotten the virus ) in brazil . scientists think that when a woman with the zika virus is pregnant , she can give the virus to her fetus . scientists think this can cause microcephaly , a birth defect that causes a baby to have a smaller head than usual . this can cause intellectual disability and other problems in the brain , like seizures . because of this , in january 2016 , the united states centers for disease control and prevention warned pregnant women not to travel to brazil , colombia , el salvador , french guiana , guatemala , haiti , honduras , martinique , mexico , panama , paraguay , suriname , venezuela , or puerto rico , because of the risk of getting the zika virus there .
