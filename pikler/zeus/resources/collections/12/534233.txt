Two-body problem     the two-body problem is a problem from classical mechanics : there are two bodies which influence each other . very often they attract or repel each other . in many cases they rotate . the problem uses bodies which are circles , or spheres . solving the problem is possible for many situations , but it usually involves higher level mathematics . when one of the two bodies has a mass that is much smaller , the influence of this smaller body on the larger one is very small , and can be disregarded . in such a case , the problem can be reformulated as a one-centre problem , where there is a stationary big body in the centre , and a small body orbiting around the big one . this setting is very comon . johannes kepler was the first person to formulate and solve it . for this reason , it is also known as kepler problem . isaac newton was the first person to solve to the general two-body problem . looking at the generalizations , there are two other problem which are related : - the three-body problem ( three bodies influence each other ) : this problem can only be solved exactly for few very special cases . it needs to be approximated for the other ones .
