Docodont     docodonts are an order or suborder of extinct mammaliaforms . they lived during the mid- to late-mesozoic era . they had sophisticated molars , from which the suborder gets its name . in the fossil record , isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found . docodonts are not quite as closely related to the placentals and marsupials as the monotremes are , so they are not included among the crown-group mammals . because of their molars and their lower jaw being a single bone ( the dentary ) , they are generally regarded as mammals . however , those authors who limit the term `` mammalia '' to the ( living ) crown group exclude docodonts . they use the term mammaliaformes instead . docodonts were primarily herbivorous or insectivorous . however , `` castorocauda '' , adapted to a semi-aquatic life , has teeth which suggest it ate fish . `` castorocauda '' is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton ( a real luxury in paleontology ) . it breaks the `` small nocturnal insectivore '' stereotype . it was noticeably larger than most mesozoic mammaliaform fossils , and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur . of course , this strongly suggests mammalian-type temperature regulation .
