HMS Birkenhead     the hms `` birkenhead '' was a british troopship that sank on 25 february 1852 near cape town , south africa . it was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the royal navy . she was designed as a steam-powered frigate , but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned . many of the lifeboats could not be lowered because of poor maintenance and a thick layer of paint that kept the mechanisms from working . the soldiers famously stood aside and allowed the women and children to get into the working lifeboats safely . only 193 of the 643 people on board survived . the chivalry shown by the soldiers gave rise to the `` women and children first '' protocol when abandoning ship . the `` birkenhead drill '' is memorialized in rudyard kipling 's poem `` soldier an ' sailor too '' : the birkenhead steamed out of simon 's bay near cape town , south africa on february 25 , 1852 bound for port elizabeth , south africa . the ship had been built by the famous scottish john laird family of birkenhead , merseyside , england . she was a 1400-ton ship that was just over 200 feet long . on board were 643 men , women and children as well as several officer 's horses . among the passengers were soldiers destined for the queen 's ( second ) royal regiment of foot . they were commanded by ensign boylan , one corporal and 51 men .
