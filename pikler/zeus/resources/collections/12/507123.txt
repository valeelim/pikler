Production vehicle     the features of a production vehicle or production car are mass-produced identical models , offered for sale to the public . they must also be able to be legally driven on public roads ( `` street legal '' ) . legislation and other rules further define the production vehicle within particular countries or uses . there is no single worldwide definition of the term . the term `` production car '' had come into use by about 1917 in the united states . the phrase was a shortened form of `` mass-produced car '' . the phrase also meant the car was made in production , as opposed to a prototype . at that time production cars meant cheaper vehicles such as ford 's model t. these were made in relatively large numbers on production lines . the more expensive cars were coach built models ( see `` limited production '' below ) . now the term has broadened to include vehicles that are hand assembled or assembled on an assembly line . the main criteria is there are a number of the same model with the same specifications .
