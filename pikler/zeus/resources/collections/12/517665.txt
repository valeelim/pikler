Bullet cluster     the bullet cluster ( 1e 0657-558 ) consists of two colliding clusters of galaxies . strictly speaking , the name `` bullet cluster '' refers to the smaller subcluster , moving away from the larger one . it is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 x 10 parsecs ( 3.7 billion light-years ) . gravitational lensing studies of the bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter . however , this interpretation of the gravitational lensing results is disputed . observations of other galaxy cluster collisions , such as macs j0025.4-1222 , are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter . mordehai milgrom , the original proposer of mond ( modified newtonian dynamics ) , has posted on-line a rebuttal of claims that the bullet cluster proves the existence of dark matter . milgrom claims that mond correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters , and even in clusters such as the bullet cluster it removes the need for most dark matter , leaving only a factor of two which milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter ( non-luminous baryonic matter ) rather than cold dark matter . without mond , or some similar theory , the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10 , i.e . mond reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2 .
