Due process     due process is the legal requirement that the government must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person . due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it . when a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law , this is a due process violation , which offends the rule of law . due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings . this means that judges—instead of legislators—may define and guarantee basic fairness , justice , and liberty . this interpretation has proven controversial , and is seen as being closer to the concepts of natural justice , and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions . this interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically . due process developed from clause 39 of the magna carta in england . the magna carta called it `` the law of the land '' which became the more modern term due process . when english and american law gradually went in different directions , due process was not upheld in england , but did become part of the constitution of the united states . it is found in the fifth amendment which says `` no person shall…be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law , '' . it is applied to all states by the fourteenth amendment .
