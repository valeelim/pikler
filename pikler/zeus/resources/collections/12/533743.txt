Humboldt Current     the humboldt current is a cold , low-salinity ocean current . it flows north along the west coast of south america from the southern tip of chile to northern peru . also called the 'peru current ' , it flows in the direction of the equator . it extends 1,000 kilometers offshore . the humboldt current is a large marine ecosystem , named after the prussian naturalist alexander von humboldt . it is one of the major nutrient systems of the world , bringing nutrients up into the surface waters of the ocean . this supports an extraordinary abundance of marine life . upwelling occurs off peru year-round but off chile only during the spring and summer . this is because the subtropical center of high pressure is displaced during the summer . about 18-20 % of the world ’ s fish catch comes from the humboldt current . the species are mostly pelagic : sardines , anchovies and jack mackerel . this high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals ( eared seals and cetaceans ) and seabirds . the cold , nutrient-rich water upwelling to the surface drives the system ’ s extraordinary productivity .
