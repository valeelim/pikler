Crimes against humanity     crimes against humanity are crimes that are committed against a large group of people who have not done anything wrong . groups who commit crimes against humanity do not hurt just one person , or just a few people . they want to hurt an entire group of people that they do not like . for example , in nazi germany during the holocaust , the nazis tried to kill all of the jewish people in europe . this is an example of a crime against humanity . unlike war crimes , crimes against humanity can happen during peace or war . not every crime committed against a big group is a crime against humanity . to be crimes against humanity , crimes must be : - planned by a government , or - accepted by the government . even though the crimes are very common , the government does not do anything to try to stop them . in this way , the government is giving its approval for the crimes , without actually telling people to do them . crimes against humanity must also be committed against a civilian population ( people who are not soldiers ) .
