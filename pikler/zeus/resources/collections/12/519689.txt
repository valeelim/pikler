Gene family     a gene family is a set of several similar genes . they occur by the duplication of a single original gene . usually they have similar biochemical functions . the idea that genes get duplicated is almost as old as the science of genetics . one such family are the genes for human haemoglobin subunits . the ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes , called the α-globin and β-globin loci . these two gene clusters are thought to have arisen from a precursor gene being duplicated , about 500 million years ago . the biggest gene family is said to be the olfaction genes . the homeobox genes are another important group . genes for the immune system include several gene families . they code for the major histocompatibility complex , and the immunoglobulins . the toll-like receptors are the main sensors of infection in mammals .
