Gold Star family     gold star families ( or gold star american families ) are the relatives of us military members who died in battle . starting in world war i , the families of us soldiers and sailors often flew flags that had a blue star for each member of the family that was serving in the military . if one of them died in battle , the blue star was changed to a gold star . in august of 1947 , the united states congress authorized the military to present a gold star lapel pin to the family members of those killed in action . that first pin was a simple gold star on a purple background with a laurel wreath around the star . another pin -- this time a gold star with a gold background and four oak sprigs around the star -- was authorized by congress in 1973. it was awarded to the next of kin of service members who die during military service . the military continues to award gold star lapel pins to the family members or next of kin of service members who die during military service .
