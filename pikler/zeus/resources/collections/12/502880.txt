Polydnavirus     the polydnaviruses ( pdv ) are a family of insect viruses . there are two genera : ichnoviruses ( iv ) and bracoviruses ( bv ) . the ichnoviruses occur in ichneumonid wasps and bracoviruses in braconid wasps . the genome of the virus is composed of multiple segments of double-stranded dna packed in capsid proteins and a double or single layer envelope . the sequences are quite different between bv and iv , suggesting that the two types evolved independently . these viruses are part of a unique biological system with three parts : a parasitoid wasp , an insect ( usually lepidopteran ) larva , and the virus . the full genome of the virus is integrated into the genome of the wasp and the virus only replicates in a particular part of the ovary of pupal and adult female wasps . the virus is injected with the wasp egg into the body cavity of a host caterpillar and infects cells of the caterpillar . the infection does not lead to replication of new viruses , rather it affects the caterpillar 's immune system . without the virus infection , phagocytic haemocytes ( blood cells ) will kill the wasp egg . the immune suppression caused by the virus allows the wasp egg to survive . it hatches and develops in the caterpillar . also , genes from the polydnavirus in the host alter host development and metabolism to be good for the growth and survival of the parasitoid larva . thus the virus and wasp have a symbiotic ( mutualistic ) relationship .
