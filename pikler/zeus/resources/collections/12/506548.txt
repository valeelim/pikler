Yi qi     yi is a genus of climbing and gliding dinosaurs from the jurassic of china . its only species , yi qi is known from a single fossil specimen of an adult found in middle or late jurassicof hebei , china . it lived about 160 million years ago . `` yi '' was a small , possibly tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) animal . like other of its family , `` yi '' had an unusual , elongated third finger . this helped to support a membranous gliding plane ( aerofoil ) made of skin . the gliding planes of `` yi qi '' were also supported by a long , bony strut attached to the wrist . this modified wrist bone and gliding membrane is unique among all known dinosaurs , and might have resulted in wings similar in appearance to those of bats .
