Asiatic linsang     the asiatic linsang ( `` prionodon '' ) is a genus with two species , the banded linsang ( `` prionodon linsang '' ) and the spotted linsang ( `` prionodon pardicolor '' ) . they are native to southeast asia : dna analysis on 29 species showed that `` prionodon '' was the sister-group of the family felidae . so the asiatic linsangs are put in a family of their own , the prionodontidae . `` prionodon '' is not closely related to the african linsangs , although they look similar , and live a similar life . they are small cat-like carnivores adapted to catching small prey among the trees of a tropical forest . the similarities between the two groups came about by convergent evolution . `` prionodon '' is basal to the feliformia and a sister taxon of the felidae .
