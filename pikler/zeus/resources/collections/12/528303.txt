Extermination camp     extermination camps ( death camps ) were built by nazi germany during world war ii . the goal of the death camps was to kill millions of people as quickly as possible . at the death camps , people were murdered mostly by being given poison gas in gas chambers . however , the nazis also killed many people in other ways at the death camps . they killed some in mass executions ( for example , by shooting many people at once ) . they killed others through `` extermination through labor . '' this was by making prisoners do very hard forced labor without giving them the food , medical care , or other basic things they needed to survive . many other people died at the death camps from starvation , illness , and freezing to death . the nazis sent many different kinds of people to the death camps . however , about 90 % of the people killed in the death camps were jewish . nazi germany wanted to 'exterminate ' the jewish people ( they wanted to kill all of the jews , so they would not exist any more ) . this plan was called the final solution . it is now called the holocaust .
