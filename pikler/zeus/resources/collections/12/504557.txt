Trituberculata     the trituberculata is an extinct group of mammals in the fossil record from about 215â€“85 illion years ago ( mya ) . the discoveries were isolated teeth , so not much else can be said about the animals . they were small insectivores , and probably nocturnal . the group contains the ancestors of placentalia and marsupialia ; all modern mammals except monotremes are descended from trituberculates . the name comes from the three tubercles ( cusps ) of the molar teeth ( not to be confused with triconodonta ) . the clade trituberculata is not always regarded as valid . they probably do not form a monophyletic group . instead , some may be `` true '' basal mammals ( though not always closest related to each other ) . others ( such as the symmetrodonts ) may fall just outside the therian crown group . sources . - kemp t.s . 2005 . `` the origin and evolution of mammals '' . oxford university press . isbn 0-19-850760-7 - kermack d.m . & k.a . 1984 . `` the evolution of mammalian characters '' . london : croom helm . isbn 0-7099-1534-9
