Exsanguination     exsanguination is losing enough blood to cause death . a person does not have to lose all of their blood to exsanguinate . people can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood . the average adult has about 5 to 6 liters of blood in their body ( women , and people who weigh more , have more blood ) . this means a person can die from losing 2 / to 4 liters of blood . to compare , this is five to eight times as much blood as people usually give in a blood donation . children and babies have much less blood than adults , and can exsanguinate by losing much less blood than adults . exsanguination is often called bleeding to death or bleeding out . it is a medical emergency . doctors define exsanguination this way : - the patient has lost over 40 % of their blood ( 2 to 2.4 liters in an average adult ) - the patient is still losing blood - the bleeding is so bad that if it is not stopped quickly , the patient will die bleeding can be `` external '' or `` internal '' . `` external '' means `` outside the body . '' external bleeding is visible - it can be seen outside the body . for example , a person who cuts their hand and has blood on their hand is having external bleeding .
