Katzenbach v. McClung     katzenbach v. mcclung , 379 u.s. 294 ( 1964 ) , is a landmark decision by the united states supreme court . the court held that congress acted within its power under the commerce clause of the united states constitution in forbidding racial discrimination in restaurants as this was a burden to interstate commerce . the ruling was a 9–0 decision in favor of the plaintiff—the united states government . it was also a test case of the civil rights act of 1964. in particular , ollie 's barbecue was a family-owned restaurant that operated in birmingham , alabama , that seated 220 customers . it was located on a state highway and was 11 city blocks from an interstate highway . in a typical year , approximately half of the food it purchased from a local supplier came from out-of-state . it catered to local families and white-collar workers . however , they refused to serve african american customers in the restaurant . about 24 of the 36 employees of the restaurant were black . congress passed the civil rights act of 1964 outlawing segregation in american schools and public places . one section of the act , title ii , was specifically intended to grant african-americans full access to public facilities such as hotels , restaurants , and public recreation areas . on the same day , the supreme court heard challenges to title ii from a motel owner and from ollie mcclung . both claimed that the federal government had no right to impose any regulations on small , private businesses . both ultimately lost . ollie mcclung had won in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama when he received an injunction preventing the government from enforcing title ii against his restaurant . but then u.s. attorney general nicholas katzenbach , appealed this decision to the u.s. supreme court .
