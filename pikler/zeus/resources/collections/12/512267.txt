Grime (music)    grime ( music ) grime is a genre of urban music which first emerged in london in the early 2000s , primarily a development of uk garage , drum and bass , dancehall and hip hop . [ 1 ] grime music can usually be defined by the beat of the music-130-145 beats per minute , and the strong london accent rapping in a fast and aggressive style.grime is sometimes associated with dubstep , a similar but largely instrumental genre which also evolved from the early 2000s uk garage scene . grime originated from the uk , mainly in london . many of the artists found their success in the underground first before gaining mainstream attention . examples of the sound can be heard in the late 20th century , with tracks by so solid crew , more fire crew 's `` oi '' , and sticky 's `` boo '' which featured ms. dynamite . this indicated the movement of uk garage away from its r'n'b and hip-hop influences towards darker themes and sounds . dizzee rascal and wiley ( both former roll deep members ) were possibly the first artists to bring the genre to the media 's attention with their two albums `` boy in da corner '' and '' treddin ' on thin ice '' respectively . among the first tracks to be recognised as grime were `` eskimo '' by wiley , who was the founder of the `` eskibeat '' label and `` pulse x '' by musical mob .
