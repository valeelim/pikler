Tensor     a tensor is a mathematical object . tensors provide a mathematical framework for solving physics problems in areas such as elasticity , fluid mechanics and general relativity . the word `` tensor '' comes from the latin word `` tendere '' meaning `` to stretch '' . a tensor of order zero ( zeroth-order tensor ) is a scalar . a tensor of order one ( first-order tensor ) is a linear map that maps every vector into a scalar . a vector is a tensor of order one . a tensor of order two ( second-order tensor ) is a linear map that maps every vector into a vector .
