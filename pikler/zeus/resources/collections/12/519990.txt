Security interest     a security interest is a legal claim on collateral . the collateral can be real estate , personal property or any asset . collateral is usually used to secure a loan . the borrower is the party who borrows the funds . the lender is the one who lends the money in return for a security interest . the lender can repossess the asset if the borrower fails to repay the loan . the lender can then sell the asset to repay the loan . a loan secured by collateral is called a `` secured loan '' ( also called a lien ) . a loan with no collateral ( such as a credit card ) is an unsecured loan . there is nothing for the lender to repossess . there are different types of security interest or liens : - consensual agreements are entered into consensually between a borrower and a lender . for example , a borrower may want to purchase a car or house and the property purchased secures the buyer 's obligation to pay for the property . - statutory liens are security interests that may be secured by statutes . - mechanic 's liens are those that come about when a mechanic or contractor is not paid for work they performed . the owner may not sell the property ( real or personal ) until the debt is paid .
