Volcanoes of South America     the volcanoes of south america are part of the pacific ring of fire . most of them are along the backbone of the andes . the andes , together with the volcanoes , has been produced by the movement of the americas towards the west . this has been happening for a long time , certainly 60 million years or more . this continental drift leads to subduction of oceanic plates beneath the continental plates of the land mass . in turn , this produced the mountain ranges ( orogeny ) and the volcanic activity . a rather different cause is at work on the galápagos islands . there , a hotspot under the plate caused the islands and their volcanoes to rise up from the sea floor . the country of bolivia hosts numerous active and extinct volcanoes across its territory . the active volcanoes are located in western bolivia where they make up the western limit of the altiplano plateau . many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with chile . apart from andean volcanoes , bolivia has the remants of ancient volcanoes around the precambrian guaporé shield in the eastern part of the country .
