Precision (numbers)    precision ( numbers ) in mathematics , precision describes the level of exactness in a number 's digits , such as number 54.6 having precision 1 ( one decimal digit ) . a number with end zeroes ( `` 00 '' ) has a negative precision , such as 500 having precision -2 , or 4,000 as precision -3. a whole number ( not ending in `` 0 '' ) has precision 0. the level of precision differs from the word `` accuracy '' of a number , which means the correctness or truth of a number as used to describe an item or count .
