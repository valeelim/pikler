Insolvency     insolvency means that a person or organisation does not have enough money to pay all of the people who they owe money . different countries have different definitions of exactly what insolvency means , but usually it means either that : - a person can not pay their debts as they fall due ( which is sometimes called `` cash flow insolvency '' ) ; or - the total amount of a person 's liabilities is larger than the total amount of their assets ( which is called `` balance sheet insolvency '' ) . when a person or a business is insolvent , then people whom they owe money to may apply to court to put then into bankruptcy . people often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency , and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other . insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or ( sometimes ) that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets . bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts . although the two terms are connected , just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy .
