Ontario Heritage Act     the ontario heritage act is a law that was made on march 5 , 1975. it lets the province of ontario and cities protect important buildings and other places . these places are called designated heritage properties . if a place is listed as an important place under the `` act '' , the person who owns the place needs to ask the government of their city to let them change any of the important parts of the place . they also need to ask the government to let them destroy any buildings . before 2005 , people could still destroy buildings that were listed as important , even if the government of the city did not want to let them . they did this by waiting for 180 days after asking to destroy the building . once 180 days were over , if the people who owned the buildings did not agree with the government of the city , the people who owned the buildings could destroy the building . in 2005 , the provincial government changed the act . people who own important buildings are not allowed to destroy the buildings any more , if the government of the city does not let them . if the government of the city does not let them destroy the building , they are allowed to ask the conservation review board to let them do it anyway . if the conservation review board does not let them destroy the building , then the person who owns the building is not allowed to destroy the building .
