Chandra X-ray Observatory     the chandra x-ray observatory ( cxo ) is a space telescope launched by nasa on july 23 , 1999. chandra is sensitive to x-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous x-ray telescope . this is done by the high angular resolution of its mirrors . since the earth 's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of x-rays , earth-based telescopes can not detect them . space-based telescopes are needed to make these observations . chandra is an earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit , and its mission is ongoing as of 2015. chandra is one of the great observatories , with the hubble space telescope , compton gamma ray observatory ( 1991â€“2000 ) , and the spitzer space telescope . the telescope is named after subrahmanyan chandrasekhar .
