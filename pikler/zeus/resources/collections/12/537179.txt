Miranda warning     a miranda warning is a list of rights that people in the united states have when they are being questioned by the police or arrested . these rights are called miranda rights . because of a united states supreme court decision in a case called `` miranda v. arizona '' , , the police have to give a person this list of rights before they start questioning them . one goal of the miranda warning is to make sure that suspects ' rights under the fifth and sixth amendments to the constitution are protected . another goal is to make sure suspects know about their rights , and know that they can use them . in `` miranda v. arizona '' , a man named ernesto miranda confessed to raping and murdering a 17-year-old girl . miranda was convicted and sent to prison . however , he and his lawyers appealed his conviction all the way to the supreme court . they argued that miranda 's confession should not have been used as evidence because : - the police never told him he had the right to a lawyer - the police never told him he had `` the right to remain silent '' ( the right to refuse to answer questions ) . this is called the `` right against self-incrimination '' ( the right not to say anything that will prove you committed a crime ) . it is protected in the fifth amendment .
