Quorum     a quorum is the minimum number of members of an organization who must be present in order for their meeting to be legal or official . the word is often used in legislative assemblies , corporations and societies who make official decisions . the by-laws of an organization will usually say how many members make up a quorum . in the case of legislatures and government bodies , the requirements for a quorum are often set by statute or in their constitution . some bodies use a fixed number for a quorum while others use a percentage of the members . it is usually the responsibility of the chairperson to make sure there is a quorum present . if there is not a quorum at a meeting , then in most cases the only business that can be discussed is taking steps to obtain a quorum , to decide on a time when to adjourn the meeting and to adjourn the meeting . the noun quorum is the plural of the latin word `` qui '' , meaning `` of whom . '' a similar term , `` quorum-busting '' , is a tactic used by members of a group when they know they will lose a vote . if enough members do not show up for a meeting , a vote can not take place if there is no quorum . it is a delaying tactic similar to a filibuster . both are used in the hopes that if a vote is delayed long enough , it may not take place at all .
