Kapo     a kapo or prisoner functionary was a special type of prisoner in the nazi concentration camps during the holocaust . kapos were chosen by the `` schutzstaffel '' ( ss ) camp guards to help run the camps . some kapos were in charge of other prisoners , who had to do forced labor . other kapos did paperwork and kept records in the camps . the nazis used kapos for many reasons . with kapos helping to run the camps , the camps did not need as many ss guards . the kapos helped the ss control the other prisoners . this made it possible for a small number of ss to run large concentration camps . also , because kapos were prisoners , they were not paid for their work , so this system also saved a lot of money . even though they were not paid , the kapos got special treatment . they did not have to do hard labor , and they were not physically abused like the other prisoners . they sometimes got extra food , cigarettes , alcohol , regular clothes , and private rooms . however , to keep this special treatment , the kapos had to keep the ss guards happy . if they did not control the other prisoners well enough , the kapos would lose their jobs . they would become regular prisoners again .
