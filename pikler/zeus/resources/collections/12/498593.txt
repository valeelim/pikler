Tandem repeat     tandem repeats occur in dna when a pattern of nucleotides is repeated . the repeats sit next to each other , in tandem . these are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end . an example would be : if between 10 and 60 nucleotides are repeated , it is called a minisatellite . those with fewer are known as microsatellites or 'short tandem repeats ' . when exactly two nucleotides are repeated , it is called a `` dinucleotide repeat '' ( for example : acacacac… ) . when three nucleotides are repeated , it is called a `` trinucleotide repeat '' ( for example : cagcagcagcag… ) . abnormalities in such regions can give rise to trinucleotide repeat disorders . the repeat unit copy number is variable . this is a variable number tandem repeat ( vntr ) . a tandem repeat patternt helps determine an individual 's inherited traits . tandem repeats can be very useful in determining parentage . short tandem repeats are used for certain genealogical dna tests . dna is examined from microsatellites in the chromosomal dna .
