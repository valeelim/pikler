The Ghan     the ghan is a passenger train between adelaide , alice springs , and darwin on the adelaideâ€“darwin railway in australia . the train is operated by great southern rail . it takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in alice springs . the train 's name is a short version of its nickname `` the afghan express '' . this nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew . the train 's name honours afghan camel drivers who arrived in australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country 's unexplored interior . another view is that the name was an insult . in 1891 , the railway from quorn reached oodnadatta . this was home to about 150 cameleers , known as 'afghans ' . 'the ghan express ' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because , when an expensive sleeping car was put on from quorn to oodnadatta , 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an afghan ' . as early as 1924 , it was known as the 'the afghan express ' because it was so unreliable , often days , or weeks late . by 1951 , when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives , the insult of the names , like the cameleers , had faded away . modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage .
