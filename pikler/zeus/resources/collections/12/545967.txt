Border Ruffian     border ruffians were pro-slavery activists from the slave-state of missouri . from 1854 to 1860 they crossed the state border into kansas territory to force the acceptance of slavery there . the name was applied by free-staters in kansas and abolitionists throughout the north . armed ruffians interfered in territorial elections , and attacked free-state settlements . this violence was the origin of the phrase `` bleeding kansas '' . the ruffians contributed to the growing sectional tensions , and helped bring on the american civil war . only a few of the border ruffians actually owned slaves . most were simply too poor . what motivated them was hatred of northerners and abolitionists . the ruffians were driven by the rhetoric of leaders such as u.s. senator david rice atchison of missouri , who called northerners `` negro thieves '' and `` abolitionist tyrants . '' he encouraged missourians to defend the institution of slavery `` with the bayonet and with blood '' and , if necessary , `` to kill every god-damned abolitionist in the district . ''
