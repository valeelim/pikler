Maryland Campaign     the maryland campaign ( september 4 , 1862â€“september 20 , 1862 ) , also called the antietam campaign , was a series of four battles in west virginia and maryland initiated by confederate general robert e. lee . it was considered as one of the major turning points in the civil war for the union . the goal was for lee 's army to invade the northern states of maryland and pennsylvania . that way he could threaten the cities of washington , d.c. and baltimore . by a series of decisive victories lee thought that the south could gain recognition from england and france and get them to support the southern cause . the hope was if lee was victorious , it might cause abraham lincoln to sue for peace . during the summer of 1862 , the hopes of the north that the rebellion could be easily crushed were quickly fading . in july , major general george b. mcclellan 's defeated attempt to capture the southern capital at richmond , virginia failed . near the end of august , the second battle of bull run was another confederate victory . the union armies retreated back to washington , d.c. only a few miles away . in the west , confederate offensives were proving to be successful . this was causing poor morale among the union army soldiers .
