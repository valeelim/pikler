Staining     staining is used in microscopy to make cells and tissues easier to see and understand . this is a way to improve contrast in the microscopic image . stains and dyes are often used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues , often with the aid of different microscopes . staining can be done on living tissues ( `` in vivo '' ) or on dead tissues ( `` in '' `` vitro '' ) . dead tissue needs to be `` fixed '' so it does not decay . the fixative keeps the structure as it is . after fixation a tissue may be cut into thin slices , and put on a series of glass microscope slides . occasionally , it is necessary to dissolve cell membranes so large dye molecules can get into the cells . standards are published in the `` biotechnic & histochemistry '' journal . the simplest way is to dip the slide plus specimen into a solution of dye , then rinse it and examine . the stains used are certified stains , tested by the biological stain commission . gram staining is used to classify bacteria . it is based on the composition of their cell wall . gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls , iodine as a mordant , and a counterstain which marks all bacteria .
