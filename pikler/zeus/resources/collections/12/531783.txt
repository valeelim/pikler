Warrant (law)    warrant ( law ) a warrant is a writ that permits someone to take a specific legal action . most often the writ is from a judge . it is used by law enforcement to take actions such as searching for evidence , making an arrest or seizing property . in the united states , in order for police and other law enforcement personnel to search for evidence , they need a warrant . they must also have probable cause ( a good reason to believe they will find evidence of a crime ) . a search warrant must be signed by a judge or magistrate . the officer must provide a sworn statement of fact called an affidavit . if the judge or magistrate believes the affidavit establishes probable cause , he or she approves the warrant . a warrant is usually for a specific period of time and spells out exactly what the officers may search for and seize . in many cases an arrest warrant is not needed . if a police officer personally sees someone committing a crime , the officer may arrest that individual without a warrant . an officer may also arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe the person had committed or were about to commit a crime . for example , a police officer is notified a bank has just been robbed and is given a description of the suspect . the single robber left in a dark blue ford mustang . the officer stops a dark blue ford mustang with bags of money on the back seat ( in plain sight ) and the driver matches the description . the officer believes he has probable cause and arrests the driver .
