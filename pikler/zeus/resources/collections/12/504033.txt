National School Lunch Program     the national school lunch program ( nslp ) is a government-funded program that helps provide free and reduced-price lunches to students in american schools . the national school lunch program was created to fight hunger and bad nutrition that existed during world war i. one-third of the young men called to be soldiers in world war i were turned down from service . this was due to poor nutrition-related problems such as being underweight . after the war , teachers , parents , doctors , and scientists began to fight poor nutrition in children . ‘ hot lunch clubs ’ opened up all over the country to give healthy meals to schoolchildren . this program started as a volunteer-run school lunch program in the 1920s . however , in the 1930s , this program received public support and some state funding . during the great depression , many farmers were paid record low prices for their food . this was because there was more farm-grown food than people needed . the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) tried to solve the problem by giving the extra food to schools . the usda was allowed to use government money to buy extra food and give it to the schools . in order to receive the food donations , school lunch programs had to run on a non-profit basis . this meant that the meals needed to be served to poor students at free or reduced rates . school cafeterias began to pop up around the country . both the schools and the usda began to depend on the relationship .
