IC 10     ic 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation cassiopeia . it was discovered in 1887. edwin hubble suspected it might belong to the local group of galaxies , but this was uncertain for decades . the radial velocity of ic 10 was measured in 1962. it is approaching the milky way at about 350 km/s . this strengthened the evidence for its being in the local group . its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by measurements of its distance by observations of cepheids . despite its closeness , the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the galactic plane of the milky way . it is heavily obscured by interstellar matter . the apparent distance between ic 10 and the andromeda galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the andromeda galaxy and the triangulum galaxy , which suggests that ic 10 may belong to the m31 subgroup . ic 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the local group of galaxies . it has many more wolf-rayet stars per square kiloparsec ( 5.1 stars/kpc² ) than the large magellanic cloud ( 2.0 stars/kpc² ) or the small magellanic cloud ( 0.9 stars/kpc² ) . although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the smc , it is much smaller . the evolutionary status of the wolf-rayet stars suggests they all formed in a relatively short period . the galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04–0.08 solar masses per year , which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for a few billion years longer .
