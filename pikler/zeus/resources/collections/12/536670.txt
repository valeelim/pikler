Peristalsis     peristalsis is a process of contraction and relaxation of the muscle around parts of the alimentary canal . the most familiar example of this is in the oesophagus . in the oesophagus , peristalsis pushes the ball of food down the oesophagus . the smooth muscle of the oesophagus contracts and relaxes in sequence , and this pushes the ball of food down the oesophagus . the muscle is worked by a nervous mechanism called the `` migrating motor complex '' . this works in one direction only , and also works in the lower regions of the digestive system .
