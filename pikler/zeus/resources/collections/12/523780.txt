Carbon sequestration     carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide ( co ) gas in the atmosphere . one method of sequestration is by capturing co produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere . when the co gas is in long-term storage , that means it has been sequestered . carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from earth 's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle . it is also used to prevent future human caused climate change . there are two long-term ways to remove co from the atmosphere : 1. terrestrial sequestration- plants and trees store co in their bodies and in their roots . 1. geologic sequestration- bury the co thousands of feet underground . < br >
