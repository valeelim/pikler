Smoothbore     a smoothbore weapon is one that has a barrel without rifling . smoothbores range from handheld firearms to powerful tank guns and large artillery mortars . the majority of shotguns are smoothbores and the terms `` shotgun '' and `` smoothbore '' can be synonymous . the earliest mention of a smoothbore weapon was about the year 1000 in dunhuang . the weapon was called a fire lance . the basic parts that make up a gun are a barrel , a charge and a projectile . the gun must also have a way to ignite the black powder charge . the earliest guns were made of bamboo , later replaced with metal barrels . the first mass produced guns were the matchlocks . the classic european matchlock gun was a smoothbore weapon that held a burning slow match in a clamp at the end of a small curved lever called a `` serpentine '' . when the lever ( or in later models a trigger ) was pulled , it lowered the smoldering match into the flash pan . this ignited the priming powder . the flash from the primer travelled through the touch hole igniting the main charge of propellant in the gun barrel .
