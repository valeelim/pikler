Trait     a trait or character in biology is a feature of a living thing . it is part of an organism 's phenotype . every living thing , from tiny organisms like bacteria , to plants , animals and humans , has some characteristics which make it special . thus an elephant has tusks , large size and weight , large ears and very large molar teeth ( et cetera ) . these are typical characters of the african and indian elephants . biologists call those `` traits '' . the living thing is built in a certain way ; this is its `` anatomy '' , its structure or body . the physical structure `` works '' in a certain way ; this is its function , the way its body works . an animal also `` acts '' in a certain way ; this is its behavior . the way that a living thing is structured , the way its body works and the way that it acts are all traits . the basic traits are shared by all the members of the group , `` that is why they are put in the same group '' . other traits are only shared by a small number of the group . for example : - it is an anatomical trait of giraffes to have long necks . all giraffes have this trait .
