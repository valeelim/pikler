Gonzales v. Oregon     gonzales v. oregon was a landmark case decided by the united states supreme court in 2006. in 2001 , attorney general john ashcroft tried to stop oregon 's death with dignity act . this law allowed terminally ill people to get a prescription for a medication that they could take to kill themselves . ( this is called `` physician-assisted suicide . '' ) ashcroft tried to stop doctors from prescribing medicines for physician-assisted suicide . he threatened to use a federal anti-drug law to punish them . the state of oregon went to court to fight ashcroft . eventually , the supreme court ruled that ashcroft did not have the power to stop doctors from prescribing legal drugs in a way that was legal in oregon . this decision allowed physician-assisted suicide to continue in oregon . in 1994 , the people of oregon voted to pass the death with dignity act . under this law , if a terminally ill adult wants to , they can get a lethal prescription from a doctor . they can only do this if they are a competent adult ( they are able to make decisions on their own ) . they must also meet many other requirements .
