Strict scrutiny     strict scrutiny is the most stringent standard of judicial review used by united states courts . it is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to weigh the government 's interest against a constitutional right or principle . the lesser standards are rational basis review and exacting or intermediate scrutiny . these standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the united states . the idea of `` levels of judicial scrutiny '' , including strict scrutiny , was introduced in `` united states v. carolene products co. '' ( 1938 ) , one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of new deal legislation . the first and most notable case in which the supreme court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government 's actions valid was `` korematsu v. united states '' ( 1944 ) . in `` korematsu '' the court upheld the government ruling 6-9 that the need to protect the country from espionage outweighed the rights of mr. korematsu .
