Steppe Geoglyphs     the steppe geoglyphs are a number of neolithic earth constructions in the turgay trough area of turgai in northern kazakhstan . there are at least 260 of these earthworks . many or all of them are smaller earthworks ( mounds , trenches and ramparts ) arranged with each other to make geometric and other shapes ( composite figures ) . these shapes are squares , rings and three others . the composite figures range from slightly under 90 m in length to over 400 m in diameter . besides being made of earth dug out and piled up , some of the geoglyphs are made by placing stones next to each other . some of the large shapes have been given names , including bestamskoe ring , ushtogaysky ( `` or '' ushtogay ) square , turgay triradial swastika , large cross ashtasti , ekedyn cross , ashutasti ring , kyzyloba line , koga cross , and shili square . optical dating ( optically stimulated luminescence ) was used to get a date for these structures . the results indicate that they date between eight and one thousand years ago .
