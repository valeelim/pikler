Antiprism     in geometry an antiprism is a polyhedron . it is made of two copies of a regular polygon . these polygons are connected using an alternating band of triangles . to connect an n-sided polygon , 2n triangles are needed . antiprisms are similar to prisms , but prisms use parallelograms for the bands at the side . a right antiprism uses a right angle to connect the base polygons to the band of triangles . a uniform antiprism uses equilateral triangles as base surfaces .
