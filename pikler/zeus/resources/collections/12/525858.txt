Database of Molecular Motions     the database of macromolecular motions is a bioinformatics computer database on the internet . it attempts to divide motions of protein and some rna biological molecules into different types . it was originally made by mark b. gerstein , werner g. krebs and nat echols in the molecular biophysics and biochemistry group at yale university . people can use an internet page to search this computer database for a particular motion by either the protein name or protein data bank number . however , many people find this computer database by just coming over from the internet page for the protein entry at the protein data bank . for proteins found in both computer databases , this different computer database often gives a link back to the internet page for the protein on this internet site . the computer database includes an internet tool or free software as a service ( the `` morph server '' ) which lets non-experts see certain protein motions through the generation of short motion pictures . the motion pictures are made automatically by computer software on the internet site . when done the internet site sends an email with the motion picture information back to the user .
