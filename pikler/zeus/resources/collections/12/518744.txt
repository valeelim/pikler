Legal burden of proof     the burden of proof ( ) in the united states is a level of proof that a party seeking to prove a fact must reach before it is accepted in a court of law . the latin saying is `` semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit '' . it means : `` the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges . '' in a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution . a defendant is not required to prove his or her innocence . the standard the prosecution must reach is proof of their version of the facts beyond a reasonable doubt . in a civil trial the burden of proof is on the one bringing the case to court , called the plaintiff . in a civil trial the burden of proof is on the plaintiff . the standard that must be met is that the `` preponderance of the evidence '' ( weight of the evidence ) is enough to prove their case . if a defendant in a civil or criminal case wants to provide an alternative set of facts to those provided by the prosecution or the plaintiff , this is called an `` affirmative defense '' . this shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to prove his or her version of the facts . the defendant seek to to excuse or justify his or her actions that brought the lawsuit . common affirmative defenses include entrapment , self-defense , unclean hands , insanity , and the statute of limitations .
