Least squares     least squares is the name of a procedure in mathematics , to construct a function from a number of observed values . the basic idea is to construct the function in such a way that the sum of the difference between the observed value and its data point is minimized . since the difference may go in either direction , the value of the difference is squared , for each value . carl friedrich gauss developed the method . he used ideas from pierre-simon laplace . adrien-marie legendre developed the same method independently , in 1805. ordinary least squares
