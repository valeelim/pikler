Island dwarfism     island dwarfism , or insular dwarfism , is the reduction in size of large animals over a number of generations . the same process can happen in evolution on a mainland : an example is the evolution of the dwarfed marmosets and tamarins among new world monkeys . the smallest member is `` cebuella pygmaea '' . the main cause is their population 's range being limited to a small environment , and this happens most often on islands . this process has occurred many times throughout evolutionary history . examples include dinosaurs , like `` europasaurus '' , and modern animals such as elephants and their relatives . this process can occur not only on traditional islands , but also in other situations where an ecosystem is isolated from external resources and breeding . it may include caves , desert oases , isolated valleys and isolated mountains ( `` sky islands '' ) . insular dwarfism is one aspect of the more general `` island rule '' , that when mainland animals colonize islands , small species tend to evolve larger bodies , and large species tend to evolve smaller bodies .
