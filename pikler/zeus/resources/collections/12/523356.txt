Nordertor     the nordertor ( danish : `` nørreport '' ) is an old town gate of the city of flensburg . the gate was built around 1595. today , the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the german town flensburg . in 1345 the town of flensburg began to build its town wall . a gate was built on the north side of the town . it was called `` norder porte '' . it was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the nordertor . this marked the northern boundary of the town . it was a checkpoint that was closed in the night . on the north side of the gate are two plaques . the left one shows the royal coat of arms of king christian iv , 1577-1648 and the latin words : „regna firmat pietas “ — piety strengthens the realms . the right one shows the coat of arms of flensburg with the german words : „friede ernährt , unfrieden verzehrt “ — peace nurtures , strife devours . there is also a date- 1767. this means that the town gate was restored in the time of christian vii , 1749-1808. after 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall . there had been a ban on building outside the wall before then . the neustadt ( `` newtown '' ) , in the neighborhood of the nordertor was built . in 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect paul ziegler . the nordertor got a clock . in 1966 the deutsche bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it . it was a 30 pfennig stamp , used to send letters within germany . the nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times . in the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed . in 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings , so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate .
