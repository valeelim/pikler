The Selfish Gene     the selfish gene is a book on evolution by richard dawkins , published in 1976. it builds upon the work of george c. williams 's book : `` adaptation and natural selection '' , and helped popularize w.d . hamilton 's work . dawkins used the term `` selfish gene '' as a way of expressing the `` gene-centred view of evolution '' . from the gene-centred view , it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related , the more sense ( at the level of the genes ) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other . an organism evolves to maximise its inclusive fitnessâ€”the number of copies of its genes passed on globally ( rather than by a particular individual ) . dawkins proposes the idea of the `` replicator '' : the book also coins the term `` meme '' for a unit of human cultural evolution analogous to the gene .
