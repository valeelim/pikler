Garden of the Sanhedrin Tombs     the tombs of the sanhedrin is a series of tombs in jerusalem , israel . the tombs are cut into the rock underground . it was named after the `` sanhedrin '' - courts of judges that were chosen in every city of ancient israel . the cave was cleared in 1903 by the american archaeologist g. a. burton . in 1950 , archaeologist yotam julius rothschild finished excavating the cave ( clearing it out completely , so he could see what was inside ) . in the cave was a coffin with the name `` isaac '' written on it . the coffin was taken to france , and today it is in the louvre museum in paris . many burial caves were found in the sanhedrin caves . the whole area is part of the necropolis , a very big , underground cemetery used during the second temple period in jerusalem . there are a few reasons why this area in jerusalem has so many burial caves . first , the area was used for stone quarrying - taking huge pieces of stone out of the ground to use them to build things . this left large caves . also , at the time , rich people in jerusalem liked the idea of burial caves . this made the idea of a necropolis easier and popular .
