Rights of Englishmen     the rights of englishmen is an assumed group of rights that had its roots in the basic rights granted in the magna carta . the idea reached its peak during the british settlement of north america . by this time colonial englishmen felt they were entitled to certain additional rights and liberties . these were over and above those already granted them by the english monarchy . one of these perceived rights was the idea of no taxation without representation . this was a grievance of british colonists who believed that they were not directly represented in the british parliament . they believed that any laws it passed affecting the colonists ( such as the sugar act and the stamp act ) were illegal under the bill of rights 1689 , and were a denial of their rights as englishmen . this led to the american revolution and is expressed in the declaration of independence as `` certain unalienable rights '' . they stopped thinking of themselves as englishman and became americans .
