Axillary nerve     the axillary nerve is a nerve in the armpit . it comes from the brachial plexus . it has nerve fibers from the c5 and c6 nerve roots . the axillary nerve goes through the quadrangular space . it is sometimes called the circumflex nerve . the axillary nerve sends and receives signals from three muscles in the arm : deltoid ( a muscle of the shoulder ) , teres minor ( one of the rotator cuff muscles ) and the long head of the triceps brachii . the axillary nerve sends signals to two muscles in the forearm , and to muscles in the hand . the axillary nerve also sends signals to the brain from the shoulder joint , and from the skin . the axillary nerve can get injured from shoulder dislocation , squashing the armpit using a crutch or a broken arm . injury to the nerve results in : - paralysis ( meaning it ca n't move ) of the teres minor muscle and deltoid muscle , resulting in trouble moving the arm . paralysis of deltoid and teres minor muscles results in flat shoulder deformity . - loss of feeling in the skin over a small part of the lateral upper arm .
