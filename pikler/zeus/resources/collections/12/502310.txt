Human     a human ( also called a human being or person ) is a member of the species `` homo sapiens '' , which means 'wise man ' in latin . carolus linnaeus put humans in the mammalian order of primates . humans are a type of hominoid , and chimpanzees are their closest living relatives . humans are social animals . they usually live in groups . they help and protect each other . they care for their children . humans are bipedal , which means they walk on two legs . humans have a very complex brain , which is much larger than that of the other living apes . they use language , make ideas , and feel emotions . this brain , and the fact that arms are not needed for walking , lets humans use tools . humans use tools far more than any other species . there are humans living on every continent . as of 2017 , there were over 7.3 billion people living on earth . humans have a long period of development after birth . their life depends less on instinct than other animals , and more on learning . humans are also born with their brains not so well developed as those of other mammals . this makes for an unusually long childhood , and this which makes family life important . there is a good reason for this . if their brains were better developed they would be larger , and this would make birth more difficult . in birth , the baby 's head has to get through the 'birth canal ' , a passageway through the mother 's pelvis .
