Monoid     in abstract algebra , a monoid is a set of elements with two key properties 1. it can be combined associatively ; e.g . formula_1 1. there exists an identity element ; e.g . formula_2 , or formula_3 in computing science common monoids include addition , multiplication , or , and . these properties are useful for various problems e.g . they allow a large set of data to be divided , processed in parallel and combined . as each part produces a monoid , the final combined result will be the same . this also works with more complex monoids e.g . a map of word counts .
