Concurring opinion     in law , a concurring opinion is a written opinion by one or more judges of a court which agrees with the decision made by the majority of the court , but states different ( or additional ) reasons for the decision . it may also be used to add comments . when no absolute majority of the court can agree on the basis for deciding the case , the decision of the court may be contained in a number of concurring opinions . the concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is called the plurality opinion . having failed to receive a majority of the court 's votes , concurring opinions are not binding precedent ( common law ) and can not be cited as such . but concurring opinions can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive precedent ( assuming there is no binding precedent already in effect ) . the conflict in views between a majority opinion and a concurring opinion can assist a lawyer in understanding the points of law in the majority opinion . occasionally , a judge will use a concurring opinion to signal that he or she is open to certain types of `` test cases '' that would allow the development of a new legal rule . in turn , such a concurring opinion may become more famous than the majority opinion in the same case . a well-known example of this phenomenon is `` escola v. coca-cola bottling co. '' ( 1944 ) .
