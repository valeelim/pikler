Chevron (geology)    chevron ( geology ) a chevron in geology is a sharply-folded rock formation . chevron folds are regular folded beds with straight limbs and sharp hinges . well developed , these folds produce a set of v-shaped beds . they develop in response to compressive stress . the angles of the folds are generally 60 degrees or less . chevron folding is helped if the bedding alternates between beds of different make-up . turbidites , with alternating sandstones and shales , are the typical geological setting for chevron folds to occurs . chevrons can also form in land deposits , especially where there are sand dunes .
