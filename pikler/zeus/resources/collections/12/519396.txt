Insanity defense     in criminal trials , the insanity defense is the claim that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to a mental illness . people who have been determined to be insane have been exempt from full criminal punishment since the code of hammurabi . there are different definitions of legal insanity in different jurisdictions . a finding of insanity usually results in the defendant being confined in a mental health facility instead of a prison . the first to use this defense was daniel sickles when he killed his wife 's lover francis barton key ( son of francis scott key ) in 1859. in the united kingdom , ireland , and the united states , use of the insanity defense is rare . however , insanity pleas have steadily increased in the uk . mitigating factors , including things not eligible for the insanity defense like intoxication ( or , more frequently , diminished capacity ) , may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences . the question of who bears the burden of proof is an issue in the united states . before the john hinckley , jr. trial the burden of proof rested with the government in most states . afterwards many of these states required the defense to prove the defendant was legally insane . where the state still bears the burden of proof , the standard for the prosecution is beyond a reasonable doubt . where the defense bears the burden , the standard is preponderance of the evidence ( a lower standard ) .
