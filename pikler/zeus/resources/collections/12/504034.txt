First derivative test     in calculus , the first derivative test is used to determine local of a function . furthermore , the first derivative test can be used to determine of increase and intervals of decrease . critical points are values in the of a function where its is 0 or ( formula_1 or formula_2 does n't exist ) . to find the critical points of a function , compute the first derivative of the function and set it equal to zero . solve for the of this . similarly , if you have a ( formula_3 , where formula_4 ) find what values will cause the to be equal to 0 because this will make the function undefined , and therefore not at this point . these are all of your critical numbers . plug these numbers into your original function to find the exact of these critical points . formula_6 formula_7 formula_8 formula_9 and formula_10 formula_11 formula_12 so the two critical points are formula_13 and formula_14 . to determine whether these points are local maximas , minimas , or neither , we need to consider the intervals between each of the points . plug in a value from each interval into the first derivative of the function . if the value is positive , then that is an interval of increase . if the value is negative , then that is an interval of decrease . finally , if two neighboring intervals change sign then that point is either a local maxima or minima . if the first interval is positive and the second interval negative , then the critical point is a local maxima . if the first interval is negative and the second interval positive , then the critical point is a local minima . if both intervals are positive or both intervals are negative , then the critical point is neither a local maxima or minima .
