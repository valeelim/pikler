P-type semiconductor     a p-type semiconductor is a type of semiconductor . ordinary semiconductors are made of materials that do not conduct ( or carry ) an electric current very well but are not highly resistant to doing so . they fall half way between conductors and insulators . an electric current occurs when electrons move through a material . in order to move , there must be an electron 'hole ' in the material for the electron to move into . a p-type semiconductor has more holes than electrons . this allows the current to flow along the material from hole to hole but only in one direction . semiconductors are most often made from silicon . silicon is an element with four electrons in its outer shell . to make a p-type semiconductor extra materials like boron or aluminium are added to the silicon . these materials have only three electrons in their outer shell . when the extra material replaces some of the silicon it leaves a 'hole ' where the fourth electron would have been if the semiconductor was pure silicon .
