Gliese 667 Cc     gliese 667 cc is an extrasolar planet 23.62 light years away . it orbits around the red dwarf star gliese 667 c , one of the gliese 667 triple star system . the system is in the constellation of scorpius . it is the most earth-like planet in 50 light years . gliese 667 cc was first found by the european southern observatory . they used the wobble method ( also known as radial velocity ) . they watched how the star `` wobbled '' as gliese 667 cc circled around its star . on 2 february 2012 researchers at the university of g√∂ttingen and the carnegie institution for science confirmed the planets existance . gliese 667 cc circles its star every 28 days , and is 0.125 au away from its star . it fits within the habitable zone . its mass is 3.8 times that of the earth . its size is probably about 50 % larger than earth . because of gliese 667 cc 's distance from its star , it is predicted to be tidally locked to its star . just as earth 's moon always shows the same face to the earth , the length of gliese 667 cc 's day would then match the length of its year . this means it would be permanently light on one half and permanently dark on the other half of its surface . tidal locking also means the planet would have no axial tilt and that means the planet would not experience any seasons .
