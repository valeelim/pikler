Henderson v. United States (1950)    henderson v. united states ( 1950 ) henderson v. united states , 339 u.s. 816 ( 1950 ) , was a landmark decision by the united states supreme court that abolished segregation in railroad dining cars . in the early part of the 20th century , railroads did not provide dining facilities for african-americans . but public pressure in the 1930s and 1940s forced railroads to provide some kind of dining arrangement for black passengers . in response , they set up one or two tables for african-americans . no matter how many needed to eat , there were only a few chairs available to them . on may 17 , 1942 , elmer w. henderson , an african-american passenger , was travelling first-class on the southern railway from washington , d.c. to atlanta , georgia . he was a lawyer traveling as part of his duties for president roosevelt 's fair employment practice committee . at about 5:30 pm , while the train was in virginia , the first call to dinner was announced and he went promptly to the dining car . under practices then in effect , the two end tables nearest the kitchen were to be reserved initially for negroes . as the tables were partly occupied by white passengers ( with at least one seat at them unoccupied ) the dining-car steward would not seat henderson in the dining car . instead , the steward offered to serve him at his pullman seat . henderson said no and the steward agreed to send him word when space was available . no word was sent and he was not served , although he twice returned to the diner before it was closed at 9 pm .
