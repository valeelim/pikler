Deimatic defence     deimatic defence is when prey startle predators and so get time to escape . the predator gets a shock , and often jumps back when startled . many prey use this tactic when a predator gets close . it is an anti-predator defence . this method is a fake , where a real aposematic warning signal is genuine . many species of frog put on warning displays ; but only some of these species do have poison glands . displays are classified as deimatic or aposematic by the responses of the animals that see them . 1. where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey , the display is classed as deimatic , and the prey is bluffing ; 1. where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it , the display is taken as aposematic , meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful . in the second case , the behaviour is both deimatic and aposematic . it startles the predator , and the display truly indicates the prey is bad to eat .
