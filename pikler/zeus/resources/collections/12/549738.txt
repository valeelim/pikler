Springfield Model 1795 Musket     the us springfield model 1795 musket was the first smoothbore flintlock musket produced in the united states . it was based on the french model 1763 charleville musket and like the french design was a .69 caliber musket . the charleville and the brown bess were the two most famous muskets during the 18th century . the charleville musket had been the primary musket used by americans during the american revolutionary war . the charleville being the more accurate of the two , it was selected as the model for a new american musket . about the middle of the 18th century , french gunsmith honor√© blanc developed the concept of interchangeable parts for muskets . blanc tried to interest other european gunsmiths , but they were not impressed by the idea . but he did interest the american ambassador to france , thomas jefferson . jefferson quickly saw that mass production of weapons parts would free america from dependence on european sources for parts . he could n't get blanc to move to the united states but he did convince president george washington it was a good idea . in 1798 , eli whitney got the first contract for 10,000 muskets to be delivered within two years . whitney used a large force of unskilled workers and machinery to produce standardized identical parts at a low cost . congress had already decided to pattern the new musket after the 1763 french charleville model . whitney , like other contractors , had been given 2 or 3 to work with .
