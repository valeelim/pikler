Rapid eye movement     in mammals and birds , sleep can be divided into two categories . in one of them , the eyes move rapidly . this is called rem-sleep ( from rapid eye movement ) . most dreams take place in this phase . rem-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night . the periods of rem-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night . rem-sleep was first discovered in 1952-53. the other category , where this movement of the eyes does not happen , is called nrem-sleep ( non-rem sleep ) . usually , dreams do not occur during this time . there are three or four stages of nrem-sleep . stage i is just barely sleeping , or dozing . stage ii is also light sleep . normally , in adult humans , about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep . stages iii and iv are called deep sleep . deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing . it can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage iii or stage iv sleep . sometimes stages iii and iv are combined and called stage iii . adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each . the night 's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles . each cycle includes , in this order : stage i , stage ii , stage iii ( iv ) , stage ii and rem .
