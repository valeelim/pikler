Watermelon stereotype     the watermelon stereotype is the steretypical view that black people can be made happy easily ; they only need a watermelon and a little rest for their happiness . the stereotype was perpetuated in minstrel shows often depicting african americans as ignorant and workshy , given to song and dance and inordinately fond of watermelon . this stereotype is common in the united states , and probably goes back to the times of slavery : the people who were in favour of slavery wanted to show that black people were simple-minded and only needed few things for their happiness .
