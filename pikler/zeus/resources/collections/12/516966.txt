Hedjet     hedjet is the name for the white crown of upper egypt , used in ancient egypt . the crown was white and after lower and upper egypt joined together , it was combined with the deshret , the red crown of lower egypt . this double crown was called the pschent . the symbol sometimes used for the hedjet was the vulture goddess nekhbet . this would be shown next to the head of the cobra goddess wadjet , the uraeus on the pschent . the white crown has a long history , going back into the predynastic period . this shows that kingship had been the base of egyptian society for some time . the earliest image of the hedjet was thought to have been in the qustul in nubia . new discoveries , particularly the excavation of cemetery u and the tome u-j , dating to naqada iiia have shown that it appears earlier in egypt . nekhbet , the protective goddess of nekhebet ( modern el kab ) near hierakonpolis , was shown as a woman , sometimes with the head of a vulture , wearing the white crown . the falcon god horus of hierakonpolis ( egyptian : nekhen ) was generally shown wearing a white crown . the white crown is on the narmer palette found at hierakonpolis . it shows the king of the south wearing the `` hedjet '' , triumphing over his northern enemies . the kings of the united egypt saw themselves as successors of horus . vases from the reign of khasekhemwy show the king as horus wearing the white crown .
