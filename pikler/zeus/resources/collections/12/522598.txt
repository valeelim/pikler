Neurosecretion     neurosecretion is when nerve cells make , store and release hormones . the hormonal system of the body is almost entirely controlled by the central nervous system . it normally does this by sending nerve impulses down axons to a gland . however , some special nerve cells can make hormones themselves , and deliver them to glands which act as storage organs . the neurons of the neuroendocrine system are large ; they are mini factories for producing secretory products . these cells are called neurosecretory cells , and they make neurohormones . most neurohormones are secreted from nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the brain which ( either immediately , or after storage ) circulate in the blood . they are similar to normal endocrine cells and glands because they regulate both endocrine and nonendocrine cells . there are also neuroendocrine cells in the adrenal glands , which are just above the kidneys . they are called chromaffin cells , and they release epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .
