Law of noncontradiction     the law of non-contradiction is a rule of logic . it states that if something is true , then the opposite of it is false . for example , if an animal is a cat , the same animal can not be not a cat . or , stated in logic , if +p , then not -p , +p can not be -p at the same time and in the same sense . the law was stated as a principle of mathematical logic by russell and whitehead in `` principia mathematica '' . ravi zacharias has said most eastern philosophies reject the law of noncontradiction . the law of non-contradiction is found in ancient indian logic as a rule in the `` shrauta sutras '' , the writing of pāṇini , and the `` brahma sutras '' attributed to vyasa . it was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as madhvacharya . the idea of noncontradiction is rejected in some strands of buddhism .
