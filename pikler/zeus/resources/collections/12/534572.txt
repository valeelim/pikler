Atmosphere of Mars     the atmosphere of mars is the layer of gases surrounding mars . it is mainly made up of carbon dioxide . the average atmospheric pressure of the martian surface ( 6.0 mbar ) is much lower than that of the earth ( 1,013 mbar ) . the pressure is well below the armstrong limit , meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body : 98.6 °f ( 37.0 °c ) . the martian atmosphere contains 96 % carbon dioxide , 1.9 % argon , 1.9 % nitrogen , and traces of oxygen , carbon monoxide , water and methane , and so on . ever since the discovery of methane in 2003 , scientists say that this might indicate life . it has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes , volcanic or hydrothermal activity . the atmosphere of mars is quite dusty , giving the martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface . data from nasa pointed out that the dust particles are 1.5 micrometres diameter . on 18 march 2015 , nasa found an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of mars .
