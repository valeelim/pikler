Equity (law)    equity ( law ) in common law countries equity is based on a judiciary assessment of fairness . it is what is often what is considered fair and right under natural law . it is used when the laws themselves do not address an issue or are inadequate in some way . examples of equity decisions include imposing a lien , correcting a property line or ordering someone to do something to prevent damage . common law in england can be traced back to the norman conquest . the laws , such as they were then , did not address every concern . at first , a subject ( of the king ) had to petition the king to ask to be heard in his court . one of the first instances of this was in 1070 when lanfranc , the archbishop of canterbury had a case against odo , earl of kent , the king 's brother . the archbishop petitioned that lands taken by odo be restored . rules of equity began when it became apparent that the common law courts could not solve all legal problems . the king set up courts of chancery ( equity ) . by the 1800s the equity courts were becoming obsolete . in 1875 parliament did away with the chancery courts altogether .
