Clothes dryer     a clothes dryer is a machine that is used to remove water from clothing after it is washed . a dryer is made of a rotating cylinder called a `` drum ' that holds clothes and lets hot air in to evaporate the water . then the heated air and water vapor exit through a vent . the drum spins so that the clothing stays apart making the hot air work better . dryers can use electricity to both operate the machine and create heat to dry the clothes . others use natural gas to create the heat . ventless clothes dryers work differently since they can not vent the hot air . the two types of ventless dryers are condensation dryers and heat pump dryers . condensation dryers heat the air the same as a regular dryer , but use a heat exchanger . the air is cooled and the water goes down a drain . a heat pump dryer works similarly but passes the air a heat pump . the water either goes down the drain or into a collection tank .
