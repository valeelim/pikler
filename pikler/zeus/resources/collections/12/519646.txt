Defence in depth     defense in depth ( also known as deep or elastic defense ) is a military strategy . it is a delaying tactic intended to slow down the advance of an enemy instead of stopping them . the tactic buys time by yielding to the enemy slowly . it usually causes additional casualties . a defense in depth can slow down an advancing army causing them to lose momentum . hannibal used this tactic at the battle of cannae in 216 bc . facing a much larger roman army , he placed his less experienced soldiers in the center . on either side were his most experienced fighters . when the romans advanced , his center gradually moved back while the troops on the wings began to surround the romans . it was the largest slaughter of roman soldiers in the history of the republic . the classic example is medieval hill forts and castles with rings of defenses ( usually walls ) . the inner circles of defenders support the outer circles with missiles fire . the attacker has to breach each line of defense exhausting himself in the process .
