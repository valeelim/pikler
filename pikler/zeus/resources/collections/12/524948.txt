'regninses ' , means `` people of the kingdom '' . it is not known how they came by that name . it was recorded by the romans but it could be a translation or a name the romans gave them . their ruler was tiberius claudius cogidubnus . tacitus said of him : the theory that cogidubnus was created `` legatus '' , a rank only ever given to senators , is based on reconstructing the damaged chichester inscription . it would read as `` cogidubni regis legati augusti in britannia '' ( `` king and imperial legate in britain '' ) . it could also be `` cogidubni regis magni britanniae '' ( `` great king of britain '' ) .
