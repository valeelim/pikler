Mare Nostrum     mare nostrum ( latin for `` our sea '' ) was a roman name for the mediterranean sea . in the years after the unification of italy in 1861 , the term was used again by italian nationalists . they believed that italy should follow on from the roman empire . the term `` mare nostrum '' was used in the first place by romans to refer to the tyrrhenian sea . this was after they had taken over the countries around it . these were sicily , sardinia and corsica . it happened during the punic wars with carthage . when they controlled hispania they expanded the term to the whole western mediterranean . by 30 bc , the romans had taken over the countries around the mediterranean from the iberian peninsula to egypt . so they started to use the name `` mare nostrum '' for the whole mediterranean sea . they used other names as well , such as `` mare internum '' ( `` the internal sea '' ) . however , they did not use the name `` mediterranean '' ( middle sea ) , as this name came later . in the 1880 's some italians became interested in nationalism . other european countries had made colonies in africa ( called the `` scramble for africa '' ) . they wanted italy to have african colonies too . the term `` mare nostrum '' was used again by the italian poet emilio lipi
