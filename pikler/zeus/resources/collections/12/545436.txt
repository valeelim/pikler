Free-Stater (Kansas)    free-stater ( kansas ) free-staters were those settlers in kansas territory during the bleeding kansas era in the 1850s . they opposed the extension of slavery to kansas . the name came from the term `` free state '' . this meant a u.s. state without slavery . some free-staters were abolitionists from new england . other free-staters were abolitionists who came to kansas territory from ohio , iowa , and other midwestern states . however , the majority of free-staters , regardless of where they were from , did not claim to be abolitionists at the beginning . instead , the official free-state line supported the idea of excluding `` all '' black people from the state of kansas . while they did n't have slaves themselves most were prejudiced against black people believing the popular idea they were inferior . most of the settlers seemed to want free soil for white people only . pro-slavery southerners in kansas territory said all free-staters were abolitionists . this was in order to motivate the south 's opposition . however , eli thayer and other new england company leaders denied that they were seeking to abolish slavery . also , the failed topeka constitution drafted by the free-staters in 1855 would have excluded any black person from settling in kansas . this is whether they were slaves or free . in contrast , abolitionists wanted equal rights for all blacks and to end discrimination against them .
