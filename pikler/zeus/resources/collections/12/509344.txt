Ghost net     ghost nets are fishing nets that have been lost , or that have been been left by fishermen . these nets then float around in the sea , or they end up attached to a rock or other structure . this poses a problem , because the nets continue working . fish and other animals get caught , and then starve , or die of other causes . since most nets use plastic , they take a long time to decay . in addition , the nets may release toxic substances while they decay .
