Law of the excluded middle     the law of the excluded middle is a simple rule of logic . it states that for any proposition , there is no middle ground . every proposition is either true or false . for example , `` ginger is a cat '' affirms the fact that ginger is a cat . if it is true , then its opposite can not also be true . if ginger is a cat , then ginger is not something else .
