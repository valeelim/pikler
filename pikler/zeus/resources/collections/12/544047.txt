Noise (electronics)    noise ( electronics ) in electronics , noise is a random fluctuation in an electrical signal . this happens in all electronic circuits . noise made by electronic devices varies greatly . in communication systems , noise is an error or random disturbance of useful information in a communication channel . the noise is the total of unwanted or disturbing energy from natural and sometimes man-made sources . noise is usually distinguished from interference , such as deliberate jamming or other unwanted electromagnetic interference . if a message is transmitted in a natural language ( a series of letters which make sense ) , then it is more resistant to noise than a spoken language .
