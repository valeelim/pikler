Linsang     the linsangs are four feliform species , two in asia and two in africa . the whole group was put in the viverridae in a subfamily . the two pairs are : the species of african linsangs are : - `` poiana leightoni '' – leighton 's linsang - `` poiana richardsonii '' – african linsang the species of asiatic linsangs are : - `` prionodon linsang '' – banded linsang - `` prionodon pardicolor '' – spotted linsang dna analysis shows : 1. the african linsangs ( `` poiana '' ) are true viverrids closely related to the genet . 1. the asiatic linsangs ( `` prionodon '' ) are not , and may be the closest living relatives of the felidae family . discovering this , the asiatic linsangs are now put into a family of their own . they are not viverrids . therefore , the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent . all of them are cat-like in appearance . they are nocturnal , generally solitary tree dwellers . they are carnivorous , eating squirrels and other rodents , small birds , lizards and insects . typical size is a little over 30 cm ( 1 foot ) , with a tail that more than doubles that length . bodies are long , with short legs , giving a low appearance . all species have yellowish bodies with black markings ( stripes , blotches and spots ) , though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between species .
