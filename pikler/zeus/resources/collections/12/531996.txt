Medea     in greek mythology , medea ( ; , `` mēdeia '' , , `` medea '' ) is a sorceress of greek mythology . she was the daughter of king aeëtes of colchis , niece of circe , granddaughter of the sun god helios . she married the hero jason , and had two children with him , mermeros and pheres . in euripides 's play `` medea '' , jason leaves medea when creon , king of corinth , offers him his daughter , glauce . the play tells of medea avenging her husband 's betrayal by killing their children . the myths involving jason have been interpreted as part of a class of myths that tell how the hellenes of the distant heroic age , before the trojan war , faced the challenges of the pre-greek `` pelasgian '' cultures of mainland greece , the aegean and anatolia . jason , perseus , theseus , and above all heracles , are all figures on the threshold between the old world of shamans , earth deities , and the new bronze age greek ways . medea figures in the myth of jason and the argonauts , a myth known best from a late literary version worked up by apollonius of rhodes in the 3rd century bc and called the `` argonautica . '' however , for all its self-consciousness and researched archaic vocabulary , the late epic was based on very old , scattered materials . medea is known in most stories as an enchantress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess hecate or a witch . the myth of jason and medea is very old , originally written around the time hesiod wrote the `` theogony '' . it was known to the composer of the `` little iliad '' , part of the epic cycle .
