Tajdid     tajdid ( ) is an arabic word that means `` renewal '' . it is usually put together with `` din '' to mean `` renewal of the religion . '' a similar but less common expression is `` ihya ' al-din '' ( ) , which may be translated as `` revival of the religion . '' the purpose of the tajdid ( renewal or revival ) is to implement this ideal model in muslims ' lives , wherever and whenever muslim society exists . this purpose implies that tajdid is a continuous effort by muslims always to explain islam and make it applicable in continually changing situations without violating its principles . the notion of tajdid in the islamic tradition can be traced back to the prophet muhammad , who said that `` at the start of each century there will arise in this ummah ( the muslim community ) those who will call for a religious renewal '' . such people ( mujaddids , or renewers of islam ) , are believed to always come in the time when muslim community departs from the true path defined by the qur'an and sunnah ( example of the prophet ) . the task of the mujaddid , therefore , is to return muslims to their basic sources ( the qur'an and sunnah ) , to clean islam from all un-godly elements , to present islam and make it flourish more or less in its original pure form and spirit .
