Transfer case     a transfer case is a part of the drivetrain of four-wheel drive , all-wheel drive , and other multiple powered axle vehicles . typically a transfer case is used to engage ( and disengage ) the four-wheel drive function . when disengaged , most four-wheel drive systems operate in two wheel drive ( engaging just the rear axle and wheels ) . for that reason two-wheel drive vehicles do not need a transfer case . the transfer case transfers the power from the transmission to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts . the transfer case synchronizes the rotation of the front and rear wheels so they turn at exactly the same speed . it usually contains two or more sets of gears . it has a 1:1 ratio drive ( usually called high range ) for normal city and highway use . then it contains a low range gear for off-road use . a common low range gear ratios is 2.72:1. that means for every 2.72 rotations of the transmission output shaft , the transfer case will turn both driveshafts 1 rotation . the jeep wrangler rubicon model uses a 4:1 low range gearing .
