Background radiation     background radiation is the natural radiation we get by living on earth . there are many naturally occurring radioactive isotopes which decay over time . they release radioactive particles or radiation into the surroundings . we call this `` background radiation '' . the biggest source of natural background radiation is radon in the air . this radioactive gas comes from the ground . radon and its isotopes , parent radionuclides , and decay products make up most of the radiation we get . radioactive material is found throughout nature . it occurs naturally in soil , rocks , water , air , and vegetation , from which it is taken into the body . humans also get radiation from radioactive materials outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space . the worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 millisievert ( msv ) per year . this is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure , which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6 msv per year . in addition there are x-rays and other forms of medical imaging . in europe , average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2 msv annually in the united kingdom to more than 7 msv annually for some groups of people in finland .
