Law of the United States     the law of the united states is made up of many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law . the most important these is the united states constitution . this established the federal government of the united states . the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law . this consists of acts of congress , treaties ratified by the senate , regulations promoted by the executive branch , and case law originating from the federal judiciary . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law . federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 u.s. states and in the territories . however , the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . in the dual-sovereign system of american federalism states are the plenary sovereigns . each state has its own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority given by the constitution . states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . most u.s. law ( especially the actual `` living law '' of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law ) experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .
