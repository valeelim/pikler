Mathematical optimization     in many branches of science , including mathematics , mathematical optimization is a branch that is about finding the element that gives an optimal solution to a problem , given some criteria . in the simplest case , this means that a function needs to be minimized or maximized . many problems are more complex , though , and solving them analytically is not feasible : in these cases , numerical methods are often used .
