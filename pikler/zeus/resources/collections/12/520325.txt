Roosevelt Island Bridge     the roosevelt island bridge is a bridge in new york . it is a lift bridge . it connects roosevelt island in manhattan to astoria in queens . it crosses the east channel of the east river . the bridge is the only route to the island for vehicles and foot traffic , except for public transportation . construction of the bridge began on march 17 , 1952. the cost was $ 6.5 million . it opened on may 18 , 1955 , as the welfare island bridge . the name was changed to the `` roosevelt island bridge '' in 1973. before the bridge was built , the only way vehicles could access roosevelt island was by using an elevator on the queensboro bridge . the elevator was torn down in 1970. in 2001 , the new york city department of transportation considered converting the roosevelt island bridge into a fixed bridge . this was to reduce the cost of its maintenance . the bridge is rarely opened ( raised for ships to go underneath ) , because most ships passing by roosevelt island use the west channel of the east river . most of the bridge openings occur in september during the general assembly at the united nations . during this time the west channel is closed for security reasons .
