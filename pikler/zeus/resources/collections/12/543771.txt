Law of definite composition     the law of definite proportions ( or proust 's law ) states that a chemical compound always has exactly the same proportion of elements by mass . amounting to the same thing is the law of constant composition . this states that all samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition by mass . for example , oxygen makes up about / of the mass of any sample of pure water , while hydrogen makes up the remaining / of the mass . the law of definite proportions is the basis of stoichiometry , together with the law of multiple proportions .
