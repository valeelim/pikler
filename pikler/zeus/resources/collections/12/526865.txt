Scale insect     the scale insects are small bugs of the order hemiptera . they are the superfamily coccoidea . there are about 8,000 described species of scale insects . they are ectoparasites of plants , like most bugs . they sit on the outside of plants , stick their mouthparts inside , and suck up the plant sap . adult female scales usually do not move : they are permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized . they secrete a waxy coating for defence . the coating makes them look like fish scales , hence their common name . males and females are quite different form each other . this is sexual dimorphism . female scale insects keep their juvenile shape even when sexually mature ( a condition known as neoteny ) . adult males usually have wings ( depending on their species ) but never feed , and die within a day or two . the details of their reproductive systems vary greatly between species . three types of hermaphroditism are known , and at least seven forms of parthenogenesis . their young , known as crawlers , lose the use of their legs if they are female , and stay put for life . only the males keep their legs and use them in seeking females for mating .
