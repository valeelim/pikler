Pleading     pleading is usually the first step in a lawsuit . this is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses . a `` complaint '' is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which starts the lawsuit . a complaint lists the relevant allegations of fact which leads to one or more legal causes of action . it also has a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed . this is called an `` ad quod damnum '' clause . in some situations , a complaint is called a `` petition '' . in this case the party filing a complaint is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent . in equity , sometimes called chancery , the initial pleading may be called either a `` petition '' or a `` bill of complaint in chancery '' . other terms . - when used in civil proceedings in england and wales , the term `` complaint '' refers to the process by which civil proceedings are started in the magistrates ' court . the complaint may be either written or oral . - a `` demurrer '' is a pleading ( usually filed by a defendant ) . it objects to the legal sufficiency of the opponent 's pleading and demands that the court rule immediately about whether the pleading is legally adequate . this is before the party must plead on the merits in response . since demurrer procedure required an immediate ruling like a motion , many common law jurisdictions therefore went to a narrower understanding of pleadings . they are seen as framing the issues in a case but not being motions in and of themselves . the demurrer is replaced with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or the application to strike out particulars of claim .
