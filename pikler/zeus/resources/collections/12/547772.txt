Antiarch     the antiarchi is an order of heavily armored placoderms . the antiarchs were the second-most successful group of placoderms ( after the arthrodires ) in terms of numbers of species and range of environments . the front part of their bodies were heavily armoured . the rear parts were sometimes scaled , sometimes naked . the pectoral fins were modified . in primitive forms , such as `` yunnanolepis '' , the limbs were thick and short , while in advanced forms , such as `` bothriolepis '' , the limbs were long and had elbow-like joints . probably they helped the fish pull themselves across the substrate , or allow their owners to bury themselves into the substrate . other websites . - review of antiarcha at paleos
