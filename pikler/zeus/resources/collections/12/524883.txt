Tax advantage     tax advantage refers to the financial gain which applies to certain accounts or investments . these include accounts that are , by statute , tax-reduced , tax-deferred , or tax-free . governments establish tax advantages to encourage private individuals to contribute money when it is considered to be in the public interest . an example is retirement plans , which often offer tax advantages to savings for retirement . in the united states municipal bonds may also be exempt from certain taxes . in countries in which the average age of the population is increasing , tax advantages may put pressure on pension plans . for example , where benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis , the benefits paid to those receiving a pension come directly from the contributions ( money paid ) of those of working age . if the proportion of pensioners to working-age people rises , the contributions needed from working people will also rise proportionately . in the united states , the rapid onset of baby boomer retirement is currently causing such a problem .
