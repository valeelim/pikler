File allocation table     a file allocation table ( fat ) is a way that computers look up stored data on a storage device . these include floppy disks , usb flash drives , sd cards and other high capacity storage devices . a fat is a list of clusters that show where a computer file is stored . these clusters are not necessarily right next to each other but can be scattered over the disk or storage medium . the fat is always located in the first few clusters of a storage device.there are always two identical copies , one being a backup of the other . the fat file system is a legacy file system that is both is simple and robust . it works well even in lightweight uses . but it can not deliver the same speed , reliability and scalability as some modern file systems . it is , however , supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers . it is also supported by many mobile devices and embedded systems . that makes it a well suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981 up to the present .
