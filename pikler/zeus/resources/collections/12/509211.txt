Implicit memory     implicit memory is a part of memory where previous experiences of how to do a task helps with doing the task again . implicit memory is unconscious memory : the person or animal performing the task is not aware of the presence of implicit memory . evidence for implicit memory occurs in priming , a process where subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared . implicit memory also leads to the illusion-of-truth effect . subjects are more likely to say statements that they have already heard are true , regardless of their actual truth . in daily life , people rely on implicit memory every day in the form of procedural memory . this is the kind of memory which allows people to remember how to tie their shoes or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about these activities . research into implicit memory indicates that it operates through a different mental process than explicit memory .
