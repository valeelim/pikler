Nazi eugenics     nazi eugenics were a set of beliefs and rules that were very important to nazi germany during world war ii . these beliefs said that the aryan race was the master race – the best race of all – and all other races were inferior ( not as good ) . there were also many other people who the nazis believed were `` life unworthy of life , '' like people with disabilities . these ideas about eugenics were at the center of the nazis ' beliefs and eventually helped lead to the holocaust . because they did not want these `` inferior '' people in german society , the nazis decided to get rid of them , using many different strategies . they began with people with disabilities . the nazis forced more than 400,000 people with disabilities to be sterilized ( to have surgery that would make it impossible for them to have children ) . they also killed over 300,000 people with disabilities in a program called action t4 . in this program , the nazis sent people with disabilities to places like hadamar and hartheim euthanasia centres to be killed . these people were killed with lethal injections and poison gas , in vans and gas chambers at the euthanasia centres .
