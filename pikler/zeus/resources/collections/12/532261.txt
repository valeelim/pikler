Intravenous therapy     intravenous injection or intravenous therapy means putting liquid into a vein , using a needle . many illegal drugs and medications can be given intravenously . drugs and medications work very fast when given intravenously , because they go right into the bloodstream . they reach the brain and start working in a minute or less . also , when a drug is given intravenously , 100 % of the drug gets into the bloodstream . when medications are given in other ways , they do not work as fast . also , not all of the drug reaches the bloodstream . however , medications given by iv do not last as long as medicines given by mouth as soon as the drug reaches the bloodstream , the body begins to break it down so the body can get rid of it . there are two types of intravenous injections . sometimes , people inject just one drug into a vein with a needle . then they take the needle out . when people use illegal drugs like heroin intravenously , they use a single injection . they shoot the drug into their veins , and then take the needle out .
