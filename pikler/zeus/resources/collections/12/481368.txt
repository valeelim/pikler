Squamosal bone     the squamosal is a bone of the head of higher vertebrates . it is the main part of the cheek region in the skull , towards the back and lower part of the skull . in mammals , including humans , it fuses with other bones to form the temporal bone . it is then called the 'squama temporalis ' . in therapsids ( including mammal ancestors ) the lower jaw is simplified into just the dentary . this hinges against the squamous part of the temporal bone . it is referred to as a 'dentary-squamosal jaw ' .
