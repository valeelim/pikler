Absolute truth     absolute truth is something that is true at all times and in all places . it is something that is always true no matter what the circumstances . it is a fact that can not be changed . for example , there are no round squares . there are also no square circles . the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees . these are all true by definition . very similar are the propositions of euclid , because they are proved once the axioms are accepted . one way or another , these are all truths because they are logically true . according to martin luther ( the reformer ) , `` i shall never be a heretic ; i may err in dispute , but i do not wish to decide anything finally ; on the other hand , i am not bound by the opinions of men . '' this means that if truth is not absolute it is not truth at all . interestingly enough , aristotle states that , “ the high-minded man must care more for the truth than for what people think. ” so if we consider ourselves to be wise individuals , our concern should be to find the truth not to submit to opinions .
