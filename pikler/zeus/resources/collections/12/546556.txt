Chromophore     a chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its colour . the colour is caused when a molecule absorbs certain wavelengths of visible light . it transmits or reflects only other wavelengths , which causes the colour we see . in biological molecules that capture or detect light energy , the chromophore is the part of the molecule which responds when hit by light . chromophores make the colour in chromatophores , which are the pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells found in many animals .
