Horneophyton     horneophyton is a genus of early devonian fossil land plants . its fossils are very common in the rhynie chert . both the sporophyte and a female gametophyte have been found as fossils . the sporophyte was about 20 cm tall , and the gametophyte was about 6 cm tall . it is not really a vascular plant . it had vascular tissue but the cells had thin walls . `` horneophyton '' had anatomy similar to the hornworts . it is also similar to the vascular plant `` rhynia '' which lived at the same time . it might therefore be a missing link between the bryophytes like hornworts and the vascular plants like `` rhynia '' .
