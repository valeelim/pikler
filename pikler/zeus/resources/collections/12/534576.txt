Solar Wind Composition Experiment     the solar wind composition experiment ( swc ) was an experiment that took place on the moon during the apollo program ( apollo 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 and 16 ) . it was done to measure the solar wind outside of earth 's magnetosphere . it was the first notable measurement of isotopic solar material . the experiment was suggested by by a swiss team headed by johannes geiss of the university of bern and peter eberhardt of the swiss institute of technology . it was partially funded by the swiss government . the swc experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun . the foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface . after the experiment , the sheet was placed into a teflon bag , and sent back to earth to be studied . the experiment was successful and found helium , neon and argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun . other websites . - experiment operations during apollo evas : solar wind composition
