Per curiam decision     in law , a `` per curiam '' decision ( or opinion ) is a ruling issued by an appellate court in which the decision rendered is made by the court ( or at least , a majority of the court ) acting collectively and unanimously . in contrast to regular opinions , a `` per curiam '' does not list the individual judge responsible for authoring the decision , but minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed . `` per curiams '' are not the only type of decision that can reflect the opinion of the court . other types of decisions can also reflect the opinion of the entire court , such as unanimous decisions , in which the opinion of the court is expressed with an author listed . the latin term `` per curiam '' literally means `` by the court '' . the decisions of the u.s. supreme court are usually not `` per curiam '' . their decisions more commonly take the form of one or more opinions signed by individual justices which are then joined in by other justices . unanimous and signed opinions are not considered `` per curiam '' decisions , as only the court can officially designate opinions as `` per curiam '' . `` per curiam '' decisions tend to be brief in length . the designation is stated at the beginning of the opinion .
