Genome editing     genome editing is a type of genetic engineering . dna is inserted , replaced , or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases , or `` molecular scissors '' . the nucleases make specific double-strand breaks ( dsbs ) at desired places in the genome . the cell â€™ s own mechanisms repair the induced break ( s ) by natural processes . at present there are four families of engineered nucleases being used . to understand the function of a gene or a protein one interferes with it in a sequence-specific way , and watches its effects on the organism . however , in some organisms it is difficult or impossible to do site-specific mutation . therefore more indirect methods have to be used . examples are : - silencing the gene of interest by short rna interference ( sirna ) . yet gene disruption by sirna can be variable and incomplete . - genome editing with nucleases such as zfn . this is different from sirna . the engineered nuclease ( the enzyme which cuts the dna ) is able to modify dna-binding . therefore it can in principle cut any targeted position in the genome , and introduce change the sequences for genes which can not be specifically targeted by conventional rnai .
