Azerbaijani carpet     azerbaijani carpets ( ) are carpets made in azerbaijan , an ancient center of carpet weaving . the azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of many sizes , with dense texture and a smooth or rough surface , whose patterns are characteristic of azerbaijan 's many carpet-making regions . traditionally , since ancient times the carpets were used in azerbaijan to cover floors , decorate interior walls , sofas , chairs , beds and tables . carpet making is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice , with carpet making and rug making being almost women 's job . in the past every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets , and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry . in the case of a newly married son , it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household . starting a new carpet meant a feast , but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family . in the old days finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted . for the traditional process of carpet and rug making , men removed the wool from the sheep in the spring and autumn , while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring , summer and autumn . azerbaijani carpets are divided into four large regional groups : quba-shirvan , ganja-kazakh , karabakh , and baku .
