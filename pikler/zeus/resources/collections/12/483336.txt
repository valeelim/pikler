Brood parasitism     brood parasites are animals , usually birds , which trick other species to raise their young . the best-known example is the cuckoo . the way it works is the parasite develops faster than the resident eggs , kills its nestmates and turfs them out of the nest . the adult birds can not tell the difference in the young , and spend their time raising the offspring of another species . in some cases , the parasite has the ability to make the begging cheeps of the host species . similar methods are used by some fish and insects .
