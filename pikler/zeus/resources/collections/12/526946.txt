Byzantine calendar     the byzantine calendar was a calendar used by the eastern orthodox church from the year 691 to 1728. it was also used by the byzantine empire from 988 to 1453 , and by russia from 988 to 1700. the byzantine calendar is like the julian calendar , but the year starts on 1 september instead of 1 january . year one of the byzantine calendar is from 1 september , 5509 bc to 31 august , 5508 bc . the great schism , dated to 1054 , created two religions from what was formerly one . the western part later became the roman catholic church . the eastern part is known as the eastern orthodox church . at that time the roman catholic church used the julian calendar . in 1453 the byzantine empire collapsed ending the use of their calendar . but others still used it , notably russia . numbering differences began to appear when the gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582 by pope gregory xiii . the roman calendar did not include dates for old testament prophets . the byzantine calendar does . peter the great became czar of russia in 1682. at the time the russians used a form of the julian calendar with byzantine influence . the calendar year started on 1 september and not 1 january . the years were numbered from the date given as earth 's creation and not from the birth of christ . peter changed the calendar to start on january 1 and numbered the years from christ 's birth . but he continued basing the calendar on the julian system instead of the gregorian calendar . by the early 1800s the russian calendar was 12 days behind the gregorian calendar used by western europe . so dating something between the two systems became a problem . dating notations such as 1 march o.s . ( meaning old style , julian or russian ) were used . another example is 16 may 1582 n.s . ( new style or gregorian calendar ) . other notations included both : 25 october/6 november 1917 , trying to show how the same day appeared in different calendars .
