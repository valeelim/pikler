Vacco v. Quill     vacco v. quill , , was a landmark court decision about the right to die . new york had made physician-assisted suicide illegal . a group of doctors challenged this law . the case went all the way to the supreme court of the united states . in 1997 , the supreme court decided that new york 's law against physician-assisted suicide was constitutional and legal . they ruled that the constitution of the united states does not guarantee the `` right to die . '' the state of new york had made physician-assisted suicide illegal . this law made it a crime for a doctor to give a patient medications that would kill them . it also made it illegal for a doctor to do anything else that would end a patient 's life . these things were crimes even if the patient was terminally ill , wanted to die , and was competent ( able to make decisions ) . a group of doctors filed a lawsuit in federal court . they argued that this law was unconstitutional . they said the law violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution . the equal protection clause says that every state must give everyone `` the equal protection of the laws . '' the doctors argued that because of the law against physician-assisted suicide , terminally ill people did not have equal rights under the law . they pointed out that terminally ill patients could refuse treatment , which would lead to their death . however , these same patients did not have the right to give a doctor permission to end their lives . basically , they were arguing that refusing treatment in order to cause death , and asking a doctor to help cause death , were the same thing .
