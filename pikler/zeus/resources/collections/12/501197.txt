Titan arum     the titan arum , `` amorphophallus titanum '' , is a flowering plant with the largest unbranched inflorescence in the world . the titan arum 's inflorescence is not as large as that of the talipot palm , `` corypha umbraculifera '' , but the inflorescence of the talipot palm is branched rather than unbranched . due to its odor , which is like the smell of a decomposing animal , the titan arum is called a 'carrion flower ' , or 'corpse flower ' , or 'corpse plant ' . for the same reason , the name 'corpse flower ' is also used for the genus `` rafflesia '' which , like the titan arum , grows in the rainforests of sumatra . the function of the smell is to attract insect pollinators . both male and female flowers grow in the same inflorescence . the female flowers open first , and only lasts ( or is `` receptive '' ) about 12 to 24 hours . then a day or two following , the male flowers open . this usually prevents the flower from self-pollinating . the popular name `` titan arum '' was invented by the broadcaster and naturalist sir david attenborough for his bbc series `` the private life of plants '' , in which the flowering and pollination of the plant were filmed for the first time . attenborough felt that calling the plant `` amorphophallus '' on a popular tv documentary would be inappropriate .
