BDS movement     the bds movement is a campaign to help palestinians . the letters bds stand for `` boycott , divestment and sanctions '' . they help palestinians by attempting to put economic and political pressure on israel . they want an end of israeli occupation of palestine . the group thinks that they can create a palestinian state by boycotting the israeli government . the movement may be hurting the palestinian economy while having little overall effect on the israeli economy . an example is the israeli-owned soft drink company sodastream . hundreds of palestinians lost good paying jobs in the west bank when sodastream moved its factory to southern israel . sodastream denied the move was bds-related but their profits fell after bds targeted them . the movement has become popular on many us college campuses . but no us schools have sold any stocks and none are expected to do so . israel is concerned about the increasing number of american jews who oppose israel 's policies . some have even joined bds campaigns .
