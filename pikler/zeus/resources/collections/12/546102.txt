Pitch, yaw, and roll    pitch , yaw , and roll pitch , yaw and roll are the three dimensions of movement when an object moves through a medium . the terms may be used to describe an aeroplane 's movements through the air . they are also applied to fishes moving through water , and spacecraft moving through space . there are in fact six degrees of freedom of a rigid body moving in three-dimensional space . as the movement along each of the three axes is independent of each other and independent of the rotation about any of these axes , the motion has six degrees of freedom ( see diagram ) . - pitch : nose up or tail up . - yaw : nose moves from side to side - roll : a circular ( clockwise or anticlockwise ) movement of the body as it moves forward the surfaces of a plane and the fins of a fish have a similar function . they serve to adjust the object 's attitude as it moves through the fluid . submarines face the same dynamic control problems as fish do . the subject is often taught under degrees of freedom ( mechanics ) . this is the number of independent motions that are allowed to the body .
