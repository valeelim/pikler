Egyptian calendar     the ancient civil egyptian calendar was a calendar used by the ancient egyptians . at first it had a year that was 365 days long . the year was made up of 12 months each having 30 days . at some point during the first dynasty five additional days were added ( sometime around 3000 bc ) . egyptian astronomers observed that the annual flood of the nile river fell very close to the first visibility of the star sirius in the morning sky just before sunrise . this calendar would drift by 1 day every four years . but this drift was not enough to cause any problems . even if a person lived to be 60 years old the drift between solar and civil calendars would only be 15 days . in 238 bc the decree of canopus added a sixth day every four years to correct this . but it was largely ignored . in 30 bce the roman emperor augustus reformed the egyptian calendar by adding a leap day to every fourth year . this brought the egyptian calendar in line with the julian calendar used at the time in rome .
