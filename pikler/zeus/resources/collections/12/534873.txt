Geomagnetic reversal     a geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet 's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged . the earth 's field has alternated between periods of `` normal polarity '' , when the direction of the field was the same as the present , and `` reverse polarity '' , when the field was the opposite . these periods are called `` chrons '' . there is no pattern to these changes , which seem to take place at random . chrons last from between 0.1 and 1million years ( see diagram ) with an average of 450,000 years . most reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to happen . the latest one , the brunhesâ€“matuyama reversal , occurred 780,000 years ago ; and may have happened very quickly , within a human lifetime . a brief complete reversal , known as the laschamp event , occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period . that reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years . during this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5 % of its present strength . brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions .
