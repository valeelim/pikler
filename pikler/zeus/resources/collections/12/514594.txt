Honey bee     a honey bee ( or honeybee ) is any bee that is a member of the genus apis . they produce and store honey and make perennial , colonial nests from wax . they are in contrast with the stingless honey bee . honey bees are the only living members of the tribe apini , all in the genus `` apis '' . there are only seven species of honey bee , with a total of 44 subspecies . historically , from six to eleven species have been recognized . honey bees are only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees . some other types of related bees produce and store honey , but only members of the genus `` apis '' are true honey bees . the study of honey bees is known as 'melittology ' . the first `` apis '' bees appear in the fossil record at the eoceneâ€“oligocene boundary ( 34 million years ago ( mya ) ) , in european deposits . this shows that the bees were present in europe by that time . few fossil deposits are known from south asia , the suspected region of honey bee origin . no `` apis '' species existed in the new world during human times before the introduction of `` a. mellifera '' by europeans . only one fossil species is known , a single 14-million-year-old specimen from nevada .
