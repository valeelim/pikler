Haplotype     a haplotype is a term in genetics . it is short for haploid genotype . a haplotype is a collection of specific alleles ( particular dna sequences ) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome . a cluster is usually inherited together . put simply , haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent . a second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) usually found together on a single chromatid ( of a chromosome pair ) . so , finding a few alleles of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region . such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common diseases . comparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines . it is done in genetic genealogy projects .
