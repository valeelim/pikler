Intercostal muscle     the intercostal muscles ( `` intercostales interni '' ) are a group of skeletal muscles between the ribs . these muscles help expand and shrink the size of the chest cavity to help breathing . when breathing in , the muscles of the diaphragm contract . this pulls the diaphragm downwards , and increases the volume of the thorax . at the same time , the external intercostal muscles contract . this pulls the ribcage upwards and outwards . this also increases the volume of the thorax . there are three main layers ; 1 . `` external intercostal muscles '' help inhalation . they pull up the ribs and bend them more open . this expands the thoracic cavity . 1 . `` internal intercostal muscles '' help in `` forced '' breathing out ( quiet expiration is a passive process ) . they depress the ribs and bend them inward . this decreases the width of the thoracic cavity . 1 . `` innermost intercostal muscle '' reduces thorax volume , so are also expiratory muscles .
