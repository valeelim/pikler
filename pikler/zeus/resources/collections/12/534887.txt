Root of a function     in mathematics , a root of a function `` f '' is a number x that turns the value of `` f '' to 0 : one can talk about polynomial roots , because a polynomial is also a function . there exists a theorem that states that every polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one ( complex ) root . from this and the polynomial remainder theorem it can be concluded that every complex polynomial of degree `` n '' has exactly `` n '' complex roots ( some of them may be equal ) .
