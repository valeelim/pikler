Child Labor Amendment     the child labor amendment is a proposed and still-pending amendment to the united states constitution that would specifically authorize congress to regulate `` labor of persons under eighteen years of age '' . the amendment was proposed in 1924 following supreme court rulings in 1918 and 1922 that federal laws regulating and taxing goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 and 16 were unconstitutional . the majority of the state governments ratified the amendment by the mid-1930s . however , it has not been ratified by the required three-fourths of the states according to article v of the constitution . none of the states have ratified it since 1937. there was not much interest in the amendment after the passage of the fair labor standards act of 1938 , which implemented federal regulation of child labor with the supreme court 's approval in 1941. because congress did not set a time limit for its ratification , the amendment is still technically pending before the states . currently , ratification by an additional ten states would be necessary for this amendment to become law .
