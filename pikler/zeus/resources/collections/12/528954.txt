Gunshot     a gunshot is the discharge of a firearm . it produces a mechanical sound effect and a chemical gunshot residue . the term can also refer to a gunshot wound caused by the bullet . multiple discharges of a firearm or firearms are referred to as gunfire . the word can mean either the sound of a gun firing , the projectiles that were fired , or both . for example , the statement `` gunfire came from the next street '' could either mean the sound of discharge , or it could mean the bullets themselves . it is better to be more specific while writing however . `` the sound of gunfire '' or `` we came under gunfire '' would be more descriptive and prevent confusion . there are three things that characterize gunfire and allow a person to detect and locate gunfire and similar weapon discharges : 1. an optical flash ( called muzzle flash ) that occurs when an explosive charge is ignited when firing the weapon . 1. a muzzle blast that occurs when a weapon is fired . a typical muzzle blast generates a sound wave with a sound pressure level ( spl ) of 140db or louder .
