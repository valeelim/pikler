Abutment     in engineering , abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam . this is where the structure 's superstructure rests or contacts . single-span bridges have abutments at each end . these provide vertical and lateral ( side to side ) support for the bridge . they also act as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach . multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans that are not supported by abutments . dam abutments are generally the natural valley walls . they may also be artificial in order to support arch dams such as kurobe dam in japan . the term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch , or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault . the word derives from the verb `` '' , meaning to `` touch by means of a mutual border '' .
