Start menu     the start menu is a part of the graphical user interfaces found in many operating systems . it is well known for its use in microsoft windows , where it is used to start programs , open files , change system settings , and get help if a user does n't know how to do what they want to do . since windows 95 , the button used to show the start menu , called the `` start button '' , is found at the bottom left corner of the screen , on the far left side of the taskbar . clicking this button will make a list of menu items appear , from which the user can find a list of programs , documents or settings , search their computer for something by name ( find ) , enter the location of a file to open it ( run ) , get help on using windows , or turn off the computer ( shut down ) . the start menu has , for the most part , stayed more or less like this , although there were changes in later versions of windows such as windows xp . but for windows 8 ( and its follow-up version , windows 8.1 ) , microsoft replaced the menu with a `` start screen '' that covers the entire screen rather than just part of it . here , programs and files show up as large `` tiles '' that can show information from the program or the contents of the file without the need to open it . for many people , this was a big change that they did not like as they were used to the older look of the start menu , and so when microsoft designed windows 10 , the company brought back this look while keeping the `` live tiles '' from windows 8 .
