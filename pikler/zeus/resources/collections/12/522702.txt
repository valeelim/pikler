Cosmological principle     in modern physical cosmology , the cosmological principle is a prediction based on the idea that the universe is about the same in all places when viewed on a large scale . forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe . there should , therefore , be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure the structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the big bang . astronomer william keel explains : the cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'viewed on a sufficiently large scale , the properties of the universe are the same for all observers . ' this amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample , and that the same physical laws apply throughout . the two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy . homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ( `` the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample '' ) . isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ( `` the same physical laws apply throughout '' ) . the principles are closely related , because a universe that appears isotropic from any two ( for a spherical geometry , three ) locations must also be homogeneous .
