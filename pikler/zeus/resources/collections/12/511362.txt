Demolition     demolition is a process in which buildings are torn down . demolition is different from deconstruction , which is carefully taking a building apart to reuse its parts . for small buildings , such as houses , demolition is often simple . buildings are often pulled down with excavators , bulldozers or small cranes . other specialized equipment may also be used . larger buildings may use a wrecking ball swung by a crane . this works well for masonry buildings . sometimes building implosion is used . this involves using carefully placed explosive charges . if done correctly , the building falls in on itself and not on nearby buildings . before a building can be torn down , several things have to happen . a demolition permit has to be obtained from a city , town or county . all hazardous waste must be removed . this includes asbestos , lead paint and any flammable materials . all utilities ( water , electricity and natural gas ) have to be disconnected . many municipalities have checklists of what to do before a building can be demolished . they also have checklists of things that must be removed first .
