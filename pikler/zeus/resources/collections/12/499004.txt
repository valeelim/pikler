Dentin     dentin or dentine is calcified tissue that makes up the second layer of teeth . in the crown ( top ) of a tooth , dentin is found between enamel and pulp . in the root of a tooth , it is found between cementum and pulp . dentin makes up most of a tooth . dentin is yellow . the yellowness of dentin shows through in a tooth because enamel is semi-translucent . dentin is made up of - 70 % hydroxylapatite ( a mineral found in teeth and bones ) - 20 % organic matter ( matter that comes from living things ) - 10 % water the process of creating dentin is called dentinogenesis . it is made by odontoblasts , a special type of cell that activates later during formation of teeth . unlike enamel , a tooth can keep making more dentin throughout life . dentin is divided into different types based on when it is made . primary dentin makes up most of the tooth . it is the thick bulk between enamel and pulp . primary dentin is the type of dentin a tooth starts out with . it can also be called circumpulpal ( surrounding the pulp ) dentin . mantle dentin is a separate , harder but thinner layer that separates primary dentin from the tooth crown .
