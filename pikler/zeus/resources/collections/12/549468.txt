Metonic cycle     the metonic cycle is a period of about 19 years used in astronomy and calendar studies . in particular , it is often used in the structure of lunisolar calendars , because 19 solar years is almost exactly the same length of time as 235 lunar months . the metonic cycle is named for the astronomer meton of athens , who used the cycle in the calendar of attica in the 5th century bce . but it was used in the calendar of many ancient cultures , including babylonia and china , before then . nineteen years of 12 lunar months each would last a total of lunar months . but from astronomy we know that 19 solar years are the same length as lunar months . so over 19 years , extra lunar months need to be added to make the years line up correctly . adding a thirteenth month in a year is called `` intercalation . '' there are different ways to do it : - the ancient babylonian calendar and the modern hebrew ( jewish ) calendar add an extra month just before the spring equinox on a regular schedule of years : years 3 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 and 19 of each 19-year cycle
