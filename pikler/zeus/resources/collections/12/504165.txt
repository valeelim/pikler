Egyptian chronology     egyptian chronology is the study of events in ancient egypt , and trying to date to when they took place . there is a general agreement about this chronology among egyptologists . the old kingdom began in the 27th century bc , the middle kingdom in the 21st century bc and the new kingdom in the mid-16th century bc . but there are details which are still being argued about . the dates for the early dynastic period can vary by up to 300 years , up to 30 years in the new kingdom , and a few years for the late period . some individual egyptologists have come up with `` alternative chronologies '' . for example the `` new chronology '' proposed in the 1990s , changes the new kingdom dates by 350 years , or the `` glasgow chronology '' ( proposed 1978â€“1982 ) , which changes the new kingdom dates by 500 years . agreement about the general chronology used in egyptology has not changed much over the last 100 years . for the old kingdom , there have been changes by as much as a few centuries . the middle and new kingdoms dates have only changed by a few decades . these changes can be seen by comparing the chronology of two egyptologists , the first from 1906 , the second in 2000 ( all dates in the table are bc ) .
