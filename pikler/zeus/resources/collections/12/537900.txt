Arthrodire     the arthrodires ( arthrodira ) are an order of extinct armoured , jawed fishes of the class placodermi . they flourished in the devonian period before their sudden extinction , surviving for about 50 million years and living in most marine ecological niches . greek for `` jointed neck '' , the arthrodires had movable joints between armour plates surrounding the head and body . the mouth is interesting . as the lower jaw moved down , the head shield moved , allowing a large opening . lacking distinct teeth , like all placoderms , they used the sharpened edges of a bony plate as a biting surface . the eye sockets are protected by a bony ring , a feature shared by birds and some ichthyosaurs . early arthrodires , such as the genus `` arctolepis '' , were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies . the largest member of this group , `` dunkleosteus '' , was a true superpredator of the latest devonian period , from 3 to 9 m in length . in contrast , the long-nosed `` rolfosteus '' measured just 15 cm . a common misconception is the arthrodires were sluggish bottom-dwellers that were outcompeted by more advanced fish . but during their reign , the arthrodires were one of the most diverse and numerically successful vertebrate orders of the devonian . they occupied a vast spectrum of roles from apex predator to detritus-nibbling bottom dweller . the arthrodires were one of many groups eliminated by the mass extinctions of the late devonian . this let other fish such as sharks diversify into the vacant ecological niches during the carboniferous period .
