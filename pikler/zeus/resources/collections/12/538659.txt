Seymouria     seymouria was an amphibian tetrapod from the early permian of north america and europe , about 280 to 270 million years ago ( mya ) . it was small , only 2 ft ( 60 cm ) long . as an adult animal , `` seymouria '' was well adapted to life on land , with many reptilian features . it was for quite a long time thought to be a primitive reptile . however , it is now known that `` its early life stages were in water '' . apparently , it is an amphibian whose adult stage was adapted for life in a dry climate . the discovery of its amphibian nature was a considerable surprise . the adult skeletons were first found in the red beds of texas and oklahoma . these beds were laid down in the huge delta complex of a large river flowing towards a coast , much like the mississippi of today . the species found in germany and new mexico , `` seymouria sanjuanensis '' , had massive legs and held its body well off the ground . this shows an `` effective adaptation to terrrestrial locomotion '' . a simplified life cycle might be : eggs laid in water , larval stages in water , young animal with limbs climbs out and instinctively moves to higher ground . all its life lived as a carnivore on dry land , returning to water occasionally to drink and to breed . the adults would be able to operate in a fairly dry climate .
