Icterid     the icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized new world songbirds . they are usually brightly colored . most species have black as a main plumage color , often enlivened by yellow , orange or red . the family is extremely varied in size , shape , behavior and coloration . this group includes the new world blackbirds , new world orioles , the bobolink , meadowlarks , grackles , cowbirds , oropendolas and caciques . despite their similar names , they are only distantly related to the old world common blackbird ( which is a thrush ) or the old world orioles . icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism . for example , the male great-tailed grackle is 60 % heavier than the female . the smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole , in which the female averages 15 cm in length ( 6 in ) and in weight , while the largest is the amazonian oropendola , the male of which measures and weighs about . this variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families . one unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping , where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively . this lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food .
