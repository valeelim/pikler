Field-programmable gate array     a field-programmable gate array ( often shortened to fpga ) is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits . that means that an fpga is different from a logic gate , because a logic gate has a fixed function . in contrast an fpga has an undefined function at the time of manufacture . before the fpga can be used in a circuit it must be programmed , that is , reconfigured . fpgas are integrated circuits in the category of or plds . fpgas are the highest performance , most flexible and also the most expensive of the pld types . a drawback of fpgas compared to other plds is that they do not remember their design when the power is removed . an fpga therefore needs a separate configuration memory chip that holds the fpga design . when the power is given back to the fpga a fixed part of the fpga reads the configuration from the configuration memory chip . after the fpga is configured it will be able to do the function it was given by the design . an fpga is different from a microprocessor or microcontroller . an fpga in its basic form is not able to run software . only when the fpga is given a configuration that contains a processor-architecture it has the ability to run software .
