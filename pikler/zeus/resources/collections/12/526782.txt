Carrier's constraint    carrier 's constraint carrier 's constraint is an observation about air-breathing vertebrates which flex their bodies sideways when moving . they find it very difficult to move and breathe at the same time . the sideways flexing expands one lung and compresses the other , shunting stale air from lung to lung instead of expelling it completely to make room for fresh air . it was named , by english paleontologist richard cowen , after david r. carrier , who wrote his observations on the problem in 1987. many amphibia and reptiles can and do move very fast over short distances . they do it by moving without breathing , which builds up an `` oxygen debt '' . humans sometimes do this when running very quickly . 100-metre sprinters do not breathe during a race . they collapse and recover afterwards . many reptiles and amphibians are ambush predators , which fits that kind of life quite well . there is no reptile or amphibian equivalent to dogs or deer , with their huge capacity for running long distances . there are , however , some reptiles which get round the carrier constraint . snakes , for example have only one lung . and , of course , dinosaurs were bipedal to start with , and most groups stayed bipedal to the end . lizards run in short bursts with brief pauses . carrier was able to show that they breathed in the pauses .
