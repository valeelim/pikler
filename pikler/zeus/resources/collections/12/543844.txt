Frequency-hopping spread spectrum     frequency hopping spread spectrum is a method of transmitting data wirelessly , using many different frequencies . after a given time , the transmitter and receiver change the frequency on which they transmit the signal . they do this in a seemingly random way , but both have agreed on the order in which they use the frequencies . technlogies such as bluetooth use it . it is one of the technologies generally referred to as spread spectrum .
