'' the noisy miner is a native of australia , and one of the few native birds that is thriving in cities and suburbs . in some parts of australia the number of noisy miners has grown to the point that it is driving out smaller birds like the wrens . it prefers gardens with open spaces and lawns . it usually eats the nectar from garden flowers , mostly on grevilleas , however it also walks around on grass picking up and eating small insects . it is highly aggressive when other birds enter its area of garden or bush , and it flocks together with other nearby noisy miners to make small defensive groups called 'coteries ' of four or five which cooperate to drive off kookaburras or magpies . sometimes they join together into even larger 'colonies ' with up to a hundred or so birds .
