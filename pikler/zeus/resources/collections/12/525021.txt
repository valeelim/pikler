Phillips curve     the phillips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation in an economy . it shows that as unemployment goes down , wages go up . it was discovered by british economist william phillips . he studied wage inflation and unemployment in the united kingdom from 1861 to 1957. the theory states that economic growth causes inflation . this causes more jobs to become available which lowers unemployment . in the 1970s high levels of inflation and unemployment were occurring at the same time . this disproved the theory , at least in the long run . many economists feel that the phillips curve still has value in the short run where there is still a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment . related pages . - microeconomics - economy - monetary policy < br >
