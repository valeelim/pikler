Battle of South Mountain     the battle of south mountain was fought on september 14 , 1862 in maryland â€™ s south mountain between confederate and union forces . the battle of south mountain was a very important battle . it was the first major battle fought north of the potomac river . it was the first invasion of the northern united states by a confederate army . it was also here and not at antietam where the confederates under general robert e. lee were defeated and turned back . the day-long pitched battle was fought for control of the three passes through the mountain : crampton 's , turner 's , and fox 's gaps . during the summer of 1862 , the hopes of the union that the rebellion could be easily crushed were quickly fading . in july , major general george b. mcclellan failed in his attempt to capture the southern capital at richmond , virginia . near the end of august , the second battle of bull run was another defeat for the union . shortly after the battle , lee made his plans to invade the north . lee led his army of northern virginia into maryland on september 4 , 1862. lee thought that if he took the civil war to the union states , a major victory might convince great britain and france to support the south . he also thought it would make the north sue for peace . this would insure the confederate states of america could remain an independent country .
