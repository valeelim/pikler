Brevet (military)    brevet ( military ) a brevet in most militaries is a promotion to a higher rank without the increase in pay or full privileges . it is often given as an honor . it was a term borrowed from the british during the american revolutionary war and used in the continental army . since that time the united states congress has had several reasons for granting brevet ranks . in some of these instances the officer received the higher pay of the breveted rank . the term brevet comes from the latin words `` breve '' and `` brevia '' meaning a legal brief . in the early history , the king of france would call on his feudal lords for troops . these feudal lords raised armies and appointed officers , but they did not have the authority to give a rank in the king 's army . the king would give a commissioned rank to leaders that would be recognized throughout his army by the use of letters patent or brevet . soon all french officers from a cornet ( sub-lieutenant ) to the marshal of france received their commission in this way . they came to be styled `` officers a'brevet '' . the official document granting the brevet was called a `` brevet d'invention '' .
