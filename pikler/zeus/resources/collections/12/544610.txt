Protoplast     protoplast in modern biology , is what is left of a cell when the cell wall is dissolved . that leaves the cell 's nucleus and the surrounding protoplasmic materials . definition : a protoplast is a plant , bacterial or fungal cell that had its cell wall completely or partially removed using either mechanical or enzymatic means . because cell walls are made differently in the different kingdoms , different enzymes are used to remove them . cell walls are made of a variety of polysaccharides . protoplasts can be made by degrading cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading enzymes : the reason for removing the cell walls is to allow many different experimental techniques to be used . protoplasts are widely used for dna transformation ( for making genetically modified organisms ) , since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of dna into the cell . in the case of plant cells , protoplasts can be regenerated into whole plants .
