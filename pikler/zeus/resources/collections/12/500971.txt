Controlled burn     a controlled burn ( sometimes also called a prescribed fire ) is a fire that is started on purpose , and kept under control . it is done by people who are trained in controlling a fire , with the right equipment and the right weather conditions . it is done to help the environment or to make an area safer for people . this is not the same as a practice fire , where a firefighter crew might start a fire in a house or other building that is going to be destroyed . they use it for practice , to learn how to enter a burning house safely and how to put out a house fire . controlled burns , on the other hand , are done outdoors in forests or prairies . there are several reasons why a controlled burn may take place . in some areas , there may be too much dry wood and dead plants . if a fire started there that was not controlled ( like arson , an accident , or a lightning strike ) , that fire could become dangerous . so by having trained people there , and burning it carefully , then the fire wo n't be as hot and wo n't get out of control .
