Article One of the United States Constitution     article one of the united states constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government , the united states congress . the congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of a house of representatives and a senate . section 1 gives federal legislative power exclusively to congress . similar clauses are found in articles ii and iii . the former gives executive power to the president . the latter grants judicial power to the federal judiciary . these three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government . the separation of powers was intended to limit congress to making law , the president to enforcing the law and the courts as interpreting the law in different cases . there is no provision in the constitution that gives congress the power to investigate . however , before the adoption of the constitution , assemblies in the american colonies exercised that power . before them , the british parliament had investigative powers . congress has always considered an implicit power in the constitution . in `` mcgrain v. daugherty '' ( 1927 ) , the supreme court held that congress did have the power to investigate .
