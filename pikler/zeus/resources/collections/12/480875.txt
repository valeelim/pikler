Archaeoceti     the archaeoceti ( 'ancient whales ' ) , or zeuglodontes in older literature , is a group of primitive cetaceans . they lived from the early eocene to the late oligocene , 5523 million years ago ( mya ) . they were the first cetacean radiation , and they include the first amphibious stages in cetacean evolution . so they are the ancestors of both modern cetacean suborders , mysticeti and odontoceti . the group evolved in the shallow waters that separated india and asia 55–45 mya . about 30 species have been found which were adapted to a fully oceanic life . modern characters such as echolocation and filter-feeding evolved later , in a second radiation . all archaeocetes from 55–48 mya are only from indo-pakistan . by 41–34 mya genera are known from across the earth , including north america , egypt , new zealand , and europe . they were very unlikely to be as well-adapted to the open ocean as living cetaceans , so they probably got to north america along coastal waters . they could have gone around africa and over to south america . more likely , over the tethys sea ( between eurasia and africa ) and along the coasts of europe , greenland , and north america .
