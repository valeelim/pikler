Bone Wars     the bone wars was a period of fossil finding and discovery in the u.s.a during the late 19th century . most of the action took place in colorado , nebraska , and wyoming . there was a heated rivalry between edward drinker cope ( of the academy of natural sciences in philadelphia ) and othniel charles marsh ( of the peabody museum of natural history at yale ) . they used bribery , theft , and destruction of bones . each scientist attacked the other in scientific publications , seeking to ruin his credibility and have his funding cut off . their search for fossils led them west to rich `` bone beds '' in the west . from 1877 to 1892 , both paleontologists used their wealth and influence . they paid for their own expeditions , and the services and dinosaur bones from fossil hunters . by the end of the bone wars , both men had exhausted their funds in this way . cope and marsh were financially and socially ruined by their attempts to disgrace each other . their contributions to paleontology were massive and provided plenty of material for later work : both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths . 142 new species of dinosaurs were discovered and described by them , though today only 32 of their names are valid .
