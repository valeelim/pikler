Agilodocodon     agilodocodon was a shrew-sized docodont from the middle jurassic . it is the earliest known tree-climbing mammal-like therapsid . `` agilodocodon scansorius '' was about 13 centimeters from head to tail , and weighed about 27 grams . its appearance was similar to a squirrel , with a long snout , curved , horny claws and flexible ankle and wrist joints typical of modern arboreal mammals . the front teeth were spade-like , indicating that `` agilodocodon scansorius '' could gnaw tree bark and eat gum or sap . this interpretation is questioned by another palaeontologist . he thinks `` agilodocodon '' 's teeth `` are quite different '' from the modern sap-eating monkeys , and the long , thin lower jaw seems too weak for gnawing tree bark . the fossils of `` agilodocodon scansorius '' , with the mole-like `` docofossor brachydactylus '' , were found by farmers in the chinese tiaojishan formation . they were got and examined by the beijing museum of natural history . the species `` agilodocodon scansorius '' was reported in the journal `` science '' in 2015 .
