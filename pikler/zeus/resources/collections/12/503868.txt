Hexacorallia     hexacorallia is a large subclass of anthozoa in the aquatic phylum cnidaria . it has about 4,300 species , all polyps , generally with 6-fold symmetry . it includes all the stony corals , most of which are colonial and reef-forming . it also contains the sea anemones , tube anemones , and zoanthids , in six living orders . the hexacorallia are distinguished from the other subclass of anthozoa , the octocorallia , because they have six or less axes of symmetry in their body structure and only single rows of tentacles . they are formed of individual soft polyps which in some species live in colonies and secrete a calcite skeleton . as with all cnidarians , these organisms have a complex life cycle including a mobile planktonic phase and a later sessile phase . hexacorallia also include the extinct orders of the rugose corals and tabulate corals . they built the coral reefs of the palaeozoic era . in fact , there are a total of eight extinct orders of the hexacorallia , which shows it has always been an important group of marine organisms .
