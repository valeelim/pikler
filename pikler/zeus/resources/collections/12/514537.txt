Humorism     humorism , or humoralism , was a system of medicine about the makeup and workings of the human body . it was a belief that too much or too little of any of four distinct body fluids in a person directly influenced their temperament and health . the humoralist system of medicine is highly individualistic . each each individual patient was made up of their own unique combination of humors . it resembled an early holistic approach to medicine linking mental and physical processes . from hippocrates onward , the humoral theory was adopted by greek , roman and persian physicians . it became the most commonly held view of the human body among early physicians until the coming of modern medical research in the nineteenth century . it has not been used in medicine since then . < br >
