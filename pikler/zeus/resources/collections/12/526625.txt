Double Falcon     double falcon ( also possibly dju and nebwy ) was a predynastic pharaoh of lower egypt belonging to dynasty 0. he may have reigned during the 32nd century bce . the length of his reign is unknown . in 1910 m. j. clédat , an egyptologist , discovered the first evidence for king double falcon . a farmer at el-mehemdiah in the north-eastern delta brought him a jar and some incised fragments found while planting a palm-grove in nearby el-beda . clédat soon discovered four serekhs of king double falcon . in 1912 hermann junker found a tomb at tura , which contained a complete jar with a serekh topped by two falcons . more serekhs of king double falcon have been found in the sinai , in tell ibrahim awad in the eastern delta , in adaima and abydos in upper egypt , and in the palmahim quarry in southern israel . because these finds have mainly been in lower egypt and north-western sinai , it shows double falcon may have only ruled over these areas . however as some of his serekhs have been found in upper egypt and canaan , it shows that the power of the dynasty 0 kings was spreading . this had already begun towards the end of the naqada iii period , through trading or warfare .
