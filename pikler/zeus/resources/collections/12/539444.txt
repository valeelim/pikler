Smelting     smelting is the general term for getting a metal from its natural ore. gold is an exception , because it is usually found as a pure metal . other metals , like iron , copper , zinc , and silver , need to be got from their ore. the process of smelting always involves heating the ore , and may also use a reducing agent like coke or charcoal . most ores are oxides and this process removes the oxygen from the oxide , leaving behind the metal . the metal is still not pure , so then another process is needed . a flux is added , to clean and purify the metal . limestone is the usual flux for this purpose . it removes the impurities as slag . beyond this , each metal has its own special methods . producing iron from its ore is done in a blast furnace . producing zinc or aluminium from their ores requires ( in addition to heat ) electrolysis . smelting is a key to the early civilisations . the earliest evidence of copper smelting dates from between 5500 bc and 5000 bc . the sites are in ploƒçnik and belovode , serbia .
