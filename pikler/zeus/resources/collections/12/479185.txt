Maluridae     maluridae is a family of small , insectivorous passerine birds endemic to australia and new guinea . commonly known as 'wrens ' , they are unrelated to the true wrens of the northern hemisphere . the family includes 14 species of fairywren , 3 emu-wrens , and 10 grasswrens . the maluridae are one of the many bird families to have evolved from a great adaptive radiation of what were crows to new ecological opportunities in australasia . their closest relatives are the meliphagidae ( honeyeaters ) , and the pardalotidae . their obvious similarity to the wrens of europe and america is not genetic , but simply the consequence of convergent evolution between more-or-less unrelated species that share the same ecological niche . their behaviour is similar to many other passerine families . the males defend territory and attract females by song and bright coloured plumage . females are a dowdy brownish colour , better for camouflage . the males ' colour is much less bright out of season . they are insectivorous , and nest in dense undergrowth . the parallels with eurasian wrens are quite striking .
