Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution     ratified on january 23 , 1933 , the twentieth amendment ( amendment xx ) to the united states constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from march 4 to january 20. it moved the start and end dates for members of congress from march 4 to january 3. in both cases the start and end time is at noon . it also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect . in the latter part of the eighteenth century , when the constitution was written , travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards . to cross the atlantic ocean could take several weeks . traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the us could take even longer . communications were mainly by letter or messenger . for these reasons the framers of the constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages . four months , the time from the election in november to the swearing-in in march , was necessary at the time .
