Gender performativity     gender performativity is a term first used by the feminist philosopher judith butler in her 1990 book `` gender trouble '' . she argues that people being born male of female does not make people behave in certain ways . she says that people learn to behave in particular ways to fit in to society . the idea of gender is just an act , or performance . this act is the way a persons walks , talks , dresses , and behaves . she calls this acting gender performativity . so what society regards as conventional gender , is just a performances made to please social expectations , and not true expressions of a persons 'gender identity ' .
