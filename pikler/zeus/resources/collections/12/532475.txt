Jury trial     a jury trial or trial by jury is a legal proceeding in which a jury either makes a decision or makes findings of fact . this is called a verdict . the judge usually follows the jury 's verdict in his ruling . it is distinguished from a bench trial , in which a judge or panel of judges make all decisions . william the conqueror brought to england a system of having witnesses who had any knowledge of a crime , tell the court what they knew . they did this after first swearing an oath . the word juror in english comes from the french `` jurer '' ( to swear ) . in the 12th century juries were used by the king to discover and present facts . usually this was in answer to questions posed by the king or his ministers who made the final decision in the case . eventually this led to a system where the jury made a verdict based on evidence . in the late colonial period , juries became a tool used to express american discontent with british rule . a series of navigation acts prohibited the american colonies from trading directly with the netherlands , spain , france , and their colonies . as more and more trade restriction were imposed , the american colonists turned to smuggling . when smugglers were caught , they were brought before juries made up of other colonists . these sympathetic juries often acquitted their fellow colonists . the king , angered at these lawbreakers going free , created new courts that did not allow juries . this was a breach of common law practice and infringed on their rights as british citizens . after the revolutionary war , the seventh amendment 's right to a jury trial was written to limit the powers of the executive and the judicial branches of the new federal government .
