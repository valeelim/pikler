Wild grape     wild grapes are natural , uncultivated grapes . there are many species . most are similar to each other , and difficult to tell apart . fox grape ( `` vitis labrusca '' ) , summer grape ( `` vitis aestivalis '' ) , and riverbank grape ( `` vitis riparia '' ) are some common species . wild grapes have woody vines which can climb over thirty feet tall . they have large , three-lobed leaves with teeth on the edges . they can be found on streambanks , pond edges , roadsides , and in open woods . in woods , the vine is probably very large and has grown up with the tree . wild grapes use tendrils ( like above-ground roots ) to grab onto branches or bark of larger plants . the bark is brownish-gray and very shreddy . wild grape flowers are green and small . they bloom from may to july . the fruit , of course , is what grapes are known for . they grow large berries in clusters of up to twenty . fruits become ripe from august to october . the fruit is very important for wildlife . each berry contains two to six seeds . when animals eat the fruit , they help spread the vines by defecating seeds in new places .
