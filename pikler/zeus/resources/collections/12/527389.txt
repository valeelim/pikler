Sonderkommando photographs     the `` sonderkommando '' photographs are four blurry pictures , taken secretly in august 1944 inside the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii . the photographs were taken by a prisoner in auschwitz ii-birkenau . this was auschwitz 's extermination camp - a place where people were sent to be killed in gas chambers . these are some of the only known photos that show what happened around the gas chambers . the photographer was a member of the `` sonderkommando '' , a group of inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers . he took two photos from inside one of the gas chambers and two from outside . to keep from being caught , he had to aim the camera from his hip and was not able to focus the camera . the polish resistance ( a movement of polish people fighting against the nazis ) snuck the camera film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube . the photographs were numbered 280â€“283 by the auschwitz-birkenau state museum . numbers 280 and 281 show the cremation of dead bodies in a fire pit . number 283 just shows trees ( since the photographer could not see where he was aiming the camera , he aimed too high for this photo ) . number 282 shows a group of naked women just before they went into the gas chamber .
