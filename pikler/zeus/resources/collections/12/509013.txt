Geoid     the geoid is a shape like the surface of the earth . it is a 3-d geometrical shape like an orange . shapes of this kind are called oblate spheroids , which is a kind of ellipsoid . the geoid , however , is a very special kind of oblate spheroid . it is defined as follows : it was defined by gauss , nearly two hundred years ago . it is often described as the true physical shape of the earth . the study of earth 's measurements and shapes is called geodesy . for many practical purposes , a simpler shape is used because that makes calculations easier . that shape is called a reference ellipsoid . in basic education , the shape of the earth is described as being like an orange , a sphere but wider round the equator . this shape is produced by all celestial spinning spheres , such as stars and planets . the details differ somewhat in each individual case .
