Genet     genets are old world mammals . they are viverrids , in the same family as civet cats . they are feliform carnivores of the family viverridae . the closest relatives of genets are the civets , linsangs , fossa , and mongooses . almost all species are in the genus genetta . the common genet , `` genetta genetta '' , is the only viverrid living in europe . other species live in africa . fossils of the genus have been found from the pliocene . genets have long tails , about one to one and a half times the length of their bodies . these longs tails are a counterweight which helps them keep their balance as they leap from tree limb to tree limb . they are not strictly terrestrial , and spend much of their time in trees . genets have semi-retractable claws , which they use for climbing and holding prey , but not for fighting . genets are highly agile creatures , with quick reflexes and exceptional climbing skills , and are the only viverrids that are able to stand bipedally . they are able to walk , trot , run , climb up and down trees , and jump .
