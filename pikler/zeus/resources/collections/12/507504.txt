Futures contract     a futures contract is an agreement between two parties . the buyer pays the seller today for the promise of the commodity at a future date . futures contracts are traded in futures exchanges . the commodities can be things such as livestock , agriculture produce , metals , energy , and financial products . trading futures can be profitable . but it is also complex and very risky . instead of gaining a profit , an investor can lose the money invested . they could be required to pay more than they invested . examples . - sam has an apple orchard . he needs money to pay for labor and fertilizer . bob offers to pay sam $ 20 in exchange for 2 bushels of apples after harvest . bob now has two futures of apples .
