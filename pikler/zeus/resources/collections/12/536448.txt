Naked singularity     in general relativity , a naked singularity is a gravitational singularity that is viewable from the outside . the event horizon is like a bubble which surrounds a black hole . inside the event horizon , the pull of the light can not escape , so we are unable to view objects inside the event horizon . this includes the event horizon itself . naked singularities do not have an event horizon , hence the term 'naked ' . the existence of naked singularities is a very important topic in physics , because it would mean we could actually see phenomena made by black holes that we would n't be able to see otherwise . in addition , naked singularities would pose big problems for general relativity , since scientists still have n't figured out a working idea for what happens to space-time in and around a black hole . quantum mechanics , the main other scientific theory scientists turn to in physics , is also unable to explain how space-time would behave in such a situation . although the cosmic censorship hypothesis says that naked singularities can not exist , some research says that if loop quantum gravity ( a scientific theory that says the universe is made of small 'loops ' ) is correct , naked singularities could exist in nature . other calculations and arguments have been made to support this .
