Honeyguide     honeyguides ( family indicatoridae ) are near-passerine birds of the order piciformes . they are also known as 'indicator birds ' , or 'honey birds ' . they have an old world tropical distribution , with most species in africa and two in asia . these birds are known for their interaction with humans . one or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies , so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind . the breeding behavior of eight species in `` indicator '' and `` prodotiscus '' is known . they are all brood parasites that lay an egg in a nest of another species . most prefer hole-nesting species , often the related barbets and woodpeckers , but `` prodotiscus '' parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers . honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host 's chicks from the nest . they have hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts ' eggs or kill the nestlings . african honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species . the honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching , much as cuckoo hatchlings do . the honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it , so that it has a head start in development compared to the host .
