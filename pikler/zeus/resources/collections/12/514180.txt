Desert climate     desert climate ( often called arid climate ) is a type of climate where precipitation is generally less than a year . low rainfall is a feature of deserts such as the arabian , central australia and the sahara . it is a feature of continental interiors , the western sides of continents , and the leeward side of tall mountain ranges . parts of the arctic and antarctic have arid climates even though they are cold . a `` true desert '' is one where plant cover is very sparse and rainfall is rare or infrequent . because desert air is dry there is little moisture to hold onto the heat of the day . desert nights are usually very cold . this wide temperature variation can make a desert climate difficult to live in . some deserts get more than 250mm of rainfall yearly but are still arid areas . for example , the kalahari desert gets up to a year . it has great sand dunes like the sahara , but they do not shift in the winds . they have plants that anchor the sand and help to keep their shape . other areas can also have more than 250mm of precipitation but lose more water via evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation . tuscon and alice springs are good examples of this . tucson gets an average of of rainfall a year . alice springs receives about yearly . some scientists do not consider these as true deserts .
