Undertale     undertale ( also written as undertale ) is a role-playing video game made by toby fox , an independent artist . in the game , players control a human child who has fallen into the underground , a large and out-of-the-way place under the top of the earth , separated from the rest of the world by a magic wall . the player meets many kinds of monsters as they try to return to the surface , mainly through the fighting system ; the player takes turns selecting actions and avoiding attacks made of many bullets , and can choose to make peace with monsters instead of attacking and killing them . the player 's choices change many things in the game , including how characters act , and what kind of story it is . fox developed almost the whole game by himself ; he wrote the words and made the music by himself , and only used a few pieces of extra art given to him by other artists . the game was inspired by the `` mother '' and `` mario & luigi '' role-playing series , the `` bullet hell '' shooter series `` touhou project '' , and the british comedy show `` mr. bean '' . `` undertale '' was originally meant to be two hours long and released in mid-2014 , but creating the game took over three years , making the campaign longer and not making the game available until much later .
