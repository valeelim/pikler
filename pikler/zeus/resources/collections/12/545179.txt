Mid-engine design     a mid-engine layout describes the location of an automobile engine between the front and rear axles . a physics term , moment of inertia , shows how hard it is to turn a moving object . in a front engine front-wheel drive car , the drive wheels also have to steer the car , causing torque steer ( pull to one side during acceleration ) . front-wheel drive can cause the vehicle to oversteer ( turn more sharply than the driver expects ) in a corner . a front engine rear-wheel drive can have good weight distribution ( balance front to rear ) , but has a higher moment of inertia than mid engine layout . the mid-engine layout has none of these disadvantages . it has better weight distribution and a lower moment of inertia . its main disadvantage is that the engine , mounted in the middle , leaves much less room for passengers and cargo . however , in racing there is usually only a driver so passengers and cargo are not an issue .
