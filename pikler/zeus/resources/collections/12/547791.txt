Motion of no confidence     a motion of no confidence , is a vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader . this is mainly a statement or vote which states that a person in a superior position , be it government , managerial , etc. , is no longer deemed fit to hold that position . the first motion of no confidence occurred in march 1782 when , following news of the british defeat at yorktown in the american revolutionary war the previous october , the parliament of great britain voted that they `` can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers '' . in modern times , passage of a motion of no confidence is a relatively rare event in two-party democracies . in almost all cases , party discipline is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence . there are variations of this in different countries . for example , in germany , spain , and israel , a vote of no confidence requires that the opposition , on the same ballot , propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the respective head of state . a motion of no confidence in some countries can be proposed in the government collectively or by any individual member , including the prime minister . in spain it is presented by the prime minister after consultation .
