Screw thread     a screw thread , often shortened to thread , is a helical structure . it is a ridge wrapped around a cylinder or cone in the form of a helix , with the former being called a `` straight '' thread and the latter called a `` tapered '' thread . the tightening of a screw ( hardware ) to a bolt is like driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks fast through friction and slight plastic deformation ( how the surfaces of the two objects slightly squash together ) . a screw thread is one of the six simple machines which give mechanical advantage . in this dynamic ( moving ) use , screw threads are set up as gears . most of the steam engines of the 19th century turned steam into motion . by using gears with screw threads , the direction of movement can be changed . a very complicated modern version is the way the movement of pistons in a car engine is turned into movement of the car wheels . the illustration of transmission gears gives an idea of how screw threads are used in the transmission . the mechanical advantage of a screw thread depends on its `` lead '' , which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution .
