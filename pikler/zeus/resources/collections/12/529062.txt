Sans serif     in typography , a sans serif typeface is one that does not have the tiny feet called `` serifs '' at the end of strokes . the term comes from the french word `` sans '' , meaning `` without '' and `` serif '' from the dutch word `` schreef '' meaning `` line '' . sans serif typefaces have been used since the 18th century , but became most used in the twentieth century as the modern art movement developed . most designers of typefaces were artists . some were outstanding in other artistic fields , and were part of the wider artistic culture of their times . the apostle of sans serif was jan tschichold ( 2 april 1902 leipzig , germany â€“ 11 august 1974 locarno , switzerland ) , a german-swiss graphic designer . tschichold not only designed typefaces , he showed how they could be used in the design of book printing . he was a chief designer for penguin books after the second world war . sans serif faces are most used for display signs , advertising and for headings in books . although they seem to work well for the text in books , they are much less used for that purpose .
