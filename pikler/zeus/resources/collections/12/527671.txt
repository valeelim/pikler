Distributive property     distribution is a concept from algebra : it tells how binary operations are to be handled . the most simple case is that of addition and multiplication of numbers . for example , in arithmetic : in the left-hand side of the first equation , the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and 3 ; on the right-hand side , it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually , with the products added afterwards . because these give the same final answer ( 8 ) , it is said that multiplication by 2 `` distributes '' over addition of 1 and 3. since one could have put any real numbers in place of 2 , 1 , and 3 above , and still have obtained a true equation , we say that multiplication of real numbers `` distributes '' over addition of real numbers . given a set and two binary operators ∗ and + on , we say that the operation : ∗ is `` left-distributive '' over + if , given any elements , and of , ∗ is `` right-distributive '' over + if , given any elements , and of , ∗ is `` distributive '' over + if it is left- and right-distributive . notice that when ∗ is commutative , the three conditions above are logically equivalent .
