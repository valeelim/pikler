Fusil de chasse     the french-made fusil de chasse ( `` fu-zi dee chā-se '' ) , originally meant `` gun of the hunt ” , was a light smoothbore flintlock musket designed for hunting . they were an elegant flintlock with a distinctive `` cow 's foot '' shape to the buttstock that softened recoil . this `` la peid '' stock shape is typical of long guns made at tulle . the fusil de chasse was made at the tulle ( france ) arms factory . the fusils were very similar to the charleville musket , also made at tulle . fusils were typically lighter and shorter than the charleville muskets . the name fusil is phonetically pronounced `` fusee '' in english . '' the french name fusil is a corruption of the italian `` fucile '' meaning flint . both the french and the british had versions of the officer 's fusil . the british fucils were based on the brown bess musket . also from the name fusil comes the term fusilier . a very similar but cheaper version was the fusil de traite ( trade gun ) . the officer 's fusil is fitted for a sling and the stock is shorter than the barrel in order to fit a socket bayonet . the officer 's fusil was much better made . but there is some confusion between the two versions . at 20 gauge ( .62 caliber ) the fusil was also used as a fowling gun ( early predecessor of the shotgun ) . fusils were a common musket in 18th century colonial america and were used by americans during the american revolution .
