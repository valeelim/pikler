Player character     a player character or playable character ( pc ) is a made-up character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are chosen by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game . the characters that are not used by a player are called non-player characters ( npcs ) . the actions of non-player characters are generally chosen by the game itself in video games , or based on rules followed by a gamemaster in tabletop role-playing games . the player character acts as a fictional , different body for the player using it . most video games have one player character for each person playing the game . some games offer a group of player characters for the player to choose from , letting player control one of them at a time . where more there is more than one player character to choose , the characters may have different abilities , strengths , and weaknesses to make the gameplay different with each . a player character may sometimes be based on a real person , such as in sports games that use the names and looks of real sports people . historical people and leaders may sometimes appear as characters too , such as in strategy or empire building games like sid meier 's `` civilization '' series . these characters are avatars rather than true player characters , because the player character 's name and image have little or even no effect on the game itself . avatars are also often seen in casino game simulations .
