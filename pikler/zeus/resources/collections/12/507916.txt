Silphium     silphium was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning and as a medicine . it is also known as silphion , laserwort , or laser . it was the essential item of trade from the ancient north african city of cyrene . most of the coins from cyrene show a picture of the plant . the valuable product was the plant 's resin ( called `` laser '' , laserpicium , or lasarpicium ) . silphium was an important species . the egyptians and the minoan civilization of knossos used a special glyph in their writing for the silphium plant . it was used by most ancient mediterranean cultures . the romans considered it `` worth its weight in denarii '' ( silver coins ) . legend said that it was a gift from the god apollo . which plant species silphium was is unclear . it is commonly believed to be a now-extinct plant of the genus `` ferula '' . the still-living plant species `` ferula tingitana '' has been suggested as another possibility . another resin from different `` ferula '' species , asafoetida , was used as a cheaper substitute for silphium . asafoetida is still available .
