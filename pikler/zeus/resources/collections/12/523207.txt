Smoke detector     a smoke sensor or smoke detector is a device that can detect smoke , which may be an indicator of a fire . there are two basic systems : simple , standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke . more sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel , or system . most smoke detectors use either an optical sensor , or they use a physical process called ionization . many simple smoke sensors use batteries . very often dead batteries are not replaced ; when this happens , the smoke sensors stop working . but , the detector may `` chirp '' when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening . there are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power ; these may use batteries just as a backup .
