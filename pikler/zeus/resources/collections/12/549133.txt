Blowback     blowback is a system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains energy from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gases created by the ignition of the propellant charge . several blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation , each distinguished by the methods used to control bolt movement . in most actions that use blowback operation , the breech is not locked mechanically at the time of firing : the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring ( s ) , relative to the weight of the bullet , delays opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel . a few locked breech designs use a form of blowback ( example : primer actuation ) to perform the unlocking function . other operating principles for self-loading firearms include blow forward , gas operation , recoil operation , revolver , gatling , and chain . the blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation , since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases .
