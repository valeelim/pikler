Betts v. Brady     betts v. brady , , was a landmark case decided by the united states supreme court in 1942. the case had to do with `` indigent '' ( poor ) people who were on trial for crimes , but could not afford to pay for a lawyer . the court ruled that a person did not need a lawyer to get a fair trial . they also ruled that the states did not have to pay for free lawyers for poor defendants . in 1963 , the court reversed its decision in `` betts '' when it decided `` gideon v. wainwright '' , . the sixth amendment to the united states constitution says that `` in all criminal [ trials ] , the accused shall ... have the assistance of counsel for his defence . '' ( `` counsel '' is another word for `` lawyer . '' ) however , in the 1930s , the supreme court made a few decisions that decreased the number of united states citizens who had the right to a lawyer . in 1932 , the court decided a case called `` powell v. alabama '' , . they ruled that the states had to assign free lawyers to poor defendants , but `` only '' if they were being tried for capital crimes . ( capital crimes are crimes that can be punished with the death penalty . )
