Archamoebae     the archamoebae are an important group of amoebae . they are unusual among protists because they have no mitochondria . the group includes many genera which are internal parasites or commensals of animals : for example `` entamoeba '' and `` endolimax '' . some are human pathogens , causing diseases such as amoebic dysentery . other genera of archamoebae live in freshwater habitats , and have flagella . most have a single nucleus and flagellum , but the giant amoeba `` pelomyxa '' has many of each . analysis of 100 genes shows that the archamoebae are part of the amoebozoa which have lost their mitochondria . they are close relatives of the slime moulds . parasitic and commensal forms like `` entamoeba '' and `` endolimax '' developed separately from free-living ancestors .
