Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter     the priestly fraternity of st. peter ( latin : `` fraternitas sacerdotalis sancti petri '' ; for short : `` f.s.s.p . '' ) is a group of catholic priests and seminarians who want to say the mass and other sacraments the way they were said before the second vatican council . according to the laws of the catholic church , the f.s.s.p . is a `` clerical society of apostolic life of pontifical right '' . this means that members have to follow the same rules as diocesan clergy and also swear an oath as members of the society . the fraternity was established by the pope , and local bishops are not allowed to tell the fraternity what to do . instead , the pope is in charge of them , through an organization called `` ecclesia dei '' . a local bishop is still in charge of the fraternity 's work within his own diocese . the members of the f.s.s.p . are priests and seminarians who want to express their faith in a specific way . this way is to offer the mass and other sacraments using the roman rite , the way it was before it was changed after the second vatican council . because of this , the fraternity uses books of worship from the ueat 1964 , including the roman missal , the roman breviary , the pontifical ( `` pontificale romanum '' ) , and the roman ritual .
