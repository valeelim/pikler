Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution     in statistics the maxwell–boltzmann distribution is a particular probability distribution named after james clerk maxwell and ludwig boltzmann . it was first defined and used in physics ( in particular in statistical mechanics ) for describing particle speeds in idealized gases . in an idealized gas the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another , most of the time . sometimes they collide and exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment . particle in this context refers to gaseous particles ( atoms or molecules ) , and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium . while the distribution was first derived by maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds , boltzmann later carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution . a particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely : a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution , and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another . the distribution depends on the temperature of the system and the mass of the particle .
