Eora     the eora people are a group of aboriginal australians . they were skilled hunter–fisher–gatherers . they lived in family groups ( clans ) along the coastal area of what is now known as the sydney basin , in new south wales , australia . their traditional territory spreads from botany bay north to pittwater at the mouth of the hawkesbury river . rock engravings , shell mounds and other evidence found by archaeologists suggests that eora people may have lived in australia for over 50 000 years . many of the eora people died during the 1800s as a result of smallpox and other diseases . there are still people who identify as the descendants of the eora and are living in sydney today . the eora people are made up of many clans ( groups ) including the cadigal , the wanegal , and the cammeraygal . they spoke languages now known as dharug , dharawal and kurringgai . several eora words have found their way into australian english , for example dingo , gibba and woomera . the traditional eora people lived along the coast of the sydney region , surrounded by beaches , rivers , mountains and forests . like most indigenous people , they were hunter-gatherers . they did not have a specific piece of land which they owned , but they moved and lived from place to place .
