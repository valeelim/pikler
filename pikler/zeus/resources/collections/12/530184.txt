Antennae galaxies     the antennae galaxies ( ngc 4038/ngc 4039 ) are colliding . they are in the constellation corvus . the process takes hundreds of millions of years . the collision , with its clouds of gas , dust and magnetic fields , causes rapid star formation . this is their starburst phase . they were discovered by william herschel in 1785. they are in the ngc 4038 group with five other galaxies . these two galaxies are known as the antennae galaxies because they have two long tails of stars , gas and dust ejected from the galaxies as a result of the collision . the nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one giant galaxy . these interacting galaxies are nearer the milky way than previously thoughtâ€”at 45 million light-years instead of 65 million light-years .
