Pro-slavery (United States)    pro-slavery ( united states ) pro-slavery was an ideology that promoted the practice of slavery and defended against any interference with the system . by the 1830s , slavery was practiced mainly in the southern united states . african american slaves were considered property . slave owners justified them being property because slaves were black—in other words not people . slaves were used on large plantations and small farms as the primary form of labor . largely in response to the abolitionist arguments against slavery , pro-slavery advocates developed arguments to justify slavery as being a good thing . while anti-slavery groups pushed for a gradual end to slavery , abolitionists demanded an immediate end to the practice . pro-slavery became as much anti-abolitionism as it was a defense of slavery . it is sometimes hard to understand why southerners who did not own slaves would defend the practice of slavery . in the south at that time , slaves did not just work on plantations . there were over 4 million blacks were enslaved in the south and they far outnumbered white people . in cities like charleston , south carolina , slaves worked at various jobs such as carpenters , blacksmiths , bricklayers and street sweeper . they performed every kind of manual labor . they raised the family 's children , cooked , cleaned and served the food to their masters . a visitor to charleston commented “ charleston looks more like a negro country than a country settled by white people ” .
