Satellite DNA     satellite dna has many sections of repeating , non-coding dna . satellite dna is a type of tandem repeat . the repeats sit next to each other , in tandem . these are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end . tandem repeats also include minisatellite and microsatellite dna . satellite dna is the main component of centromeres . it forms the main part of heterochromatin . the most common type of tandem repeat is the heterochromatin , which sits on chromosomes around the centromeres and elsewhere . it is `` transcriptionally inactive '' , meaning , it does not code for proteins .
