Haplogroup     a haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes , or single dna strands , which share a common ancestor . they have the same mutation in all versions . haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years . in human genetics , the haplogroups usually studied are y-chromosome ( y-dna ) haplogroups and mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) haplogroups . both can be used to define genetic populations . y-dna is passed only from father to son , while mtdna is passed only from mother to children . neither recombines , and thus y-dna and mtdna change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents ' genetic material . related pages . - j1 ( y-dna )
