Flexagon     in geometry , a flexagon is a flat model , usually made by folding a piece of paper , so that when 'flexed ' ( folded ) , one or more hidden faces will be revealed ( shown ) from within the model . flexagons are usually square or rectangular ( tetraflexagons ) or hexagonal ( hexaflexagons ) . a prefix can be added to the name to show the number of faces that the model can display , including the two faces ( back and front ) that are visible before flexing . for example , a hexaflexagon with a total of six faces is called a hexahexaflexagon . arthur h. stone , a british man , is said to have first discovered the flexagon in 1939. at the time , he was a student at princeton university in the united states . his new american paper would not fit in his english binder so he cut off the ends of the paper and began folding them into different shapes . one of these formed a trihexaflexagon . other students became interested in these shapes . they included bryant tuckerman , richard feynman , and john tukey . together , they formed the princeton flexagon committee . tuckerman worked out a topological method , called the `` tuckerman traverse '' , for revealing all the faces of a flexagon .
