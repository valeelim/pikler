Ordinary least squares     ordinary least squares or linear least squares is a method for estimating unknown parameters in statistics . it is a method used in linear regression : the aim of the method is to minimize the difference between the observed responses and the responses predicted by the linear approximation of the data . a smaller difference means that model fits the data better . ordinary least squares is a special case of a method commonly called least squares . the resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula .
