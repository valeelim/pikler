Pawnee people     the pawnee are a native american plains indians tribe . they lived mainly in what is now nebraska and kansas . unlike other tribes of the great plains , they were semi-nomadic people . they were hunters and farmers . the pawnee farmed for most of the year and lived in earth lodges . during the buffalo hunting season , they lived in tepees so they could follow the herds . in the early 1800s their main village was on the south side of the platte river ( nebraska ) . they raised crops including beans , corn , pumpkins , squashes and sunflowers . the powerful pawnee tribe had four individual bands . these were the chaui ( grand ) , the kitkehaki ( republican pawnees ) , pitahauerat ( tapage pawnees ) and the skidi ( loup or wolf pawnees ) . they were a fierce people who used war paint and tattoos to intimidate their enemies . the pawnee took scalps in battle . pawnee war parties often rode out on scalping missions against other tribes . the pawnee also practiced human sacrifice . most often this took the form of ritually killing a young captive girl in a five-day ceremony . she was sacrificed to the morning star . the last known ritual killing was of a girl in the mid-18th century . the pawnee were the largest tribe to have lived in nebraska . they were one of the earliest tribes to come to the area . estimates are that there were between 10,000 and 12,000 pawnee in nebraska by 1800. they had little to fear from their enemies because they were a large tribe . but smallpox and other diseases reduced their numbers significantly in the early 1800s . they were finally removed to oklahoma in the 1870s .
