Taxing and Spending Clause     the taxing and spending clause contained in article i , , clause 1 of the united states constitution , grants the federal government of the united states its power of taxation . it authorizes congress to levy taxes for two purposes : to pay the debts of the united states and to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states . contained in the taxing and spending clause are two additional clauses : the general welfare clause and the uniformity clause . the articles of confederation ( 1781â€“1789 ) did not grant the central government the power to levy taxes . only the states had this power . congress could get money only by asking the states for funds . they could also borrow money from foreign governments or sell off western lands . this was designed to keep a weak central government with the majority of the governing powers reserved for the independent states . congress had no revenues to pay its debts or to enforce its laws and treaties . this was one of the issues taken up by the constitutional convention in 1787 and changed in the constitution .
