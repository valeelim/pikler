Long range shooting     long range shooting is a relative term generally meaning accurate shooting at distances ordinary shooters with ordinary rifles could not hit . for example , daniel boone , using a flintlock rifle could probably hit a target at up to . today , expert marksmen are hitting targets well over away . modern long range shooting is more than just using modern machined actions and precision gun barrels . these produce a rifle that a decent shooter can hit targets at about 250 yards , ranges that were unheard of by black powder shooters . the ability to hit a target at ( or 10 football fields away ) requires the shooter to become an expert in ballistics . first , the shooter has to know exactly how far away target is . they have to be able to compensate for windage ( the effects of wind on a bullet ) . next , the shooter has to compute the `` elevation '' . this is how far `` above '' the target the shooter must aim to compensate for the force of gravity on the bullet at a given distance . shooters have to compensate also for shots uphill or downhill from their position . there are other factors in making a long range shot . for instance , there is a wikt : phenomenon called `` bullet drift '' . this means a bullet that fired out of the barrel with a muzzle velocity ( speed at the muzzle ) of 2800 fps that exits a barrel with 1:12 rifling is spinning at 168,000 rpms . at just the bullet will drift about in the direction it was spinning . if the rifle has a right-hand twist , the bullet will go to the right of the target .
