Constitutional Convention (United States)    constitutional convention ( united states ) the constitutional convention ( also known as the philadelphia convention ) was held from may 25 to september 17 , 1787 in philadelphia , pennsylvania . although the convention was called to revise the articles of confederation , it became clear from the beginning that many members , including james madison and alexander hamilton , intended to create a new government rather than fix the existing one . the delegates elected george washington to preside over the convention . the result of the convention was the creation of the united states constitution . this makes the meeting one of the most significant events in the history of the united states . most of the disputes were about the makeup and election of the senate . other disagreements concerned how `` proportional representation '' was to be defined ( whether to include slaves or other property ) . they needed to decide whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single president . they also had to work out how to elect the president , how long his term was to be and whether he could stand for reelection . there were issues over what offenses should be impeachable . most of the time during the convention was spent on deciding these issues , while the powers of legislature , executive , and judiciary were not heavily disputed . once the convention began , the delegates first agreed on the principles of the convention , then they agreed on madison 's virginia plan and began to modify it . a committee of detail assembled during the july 4 recess and produced a rough draft . most of this rough draft remained in place , and can be found in the final version of the constitution . after the final issues were resolved , the committee on style produced the final version , and it was voted on and sent to the states .
