Carotenoid     carotenoids ( or tetraterpenoids ) are organic pigments . they are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants , and also some bacteria and fungi . the only animals known to produce carotenoids are aphids and mites , which got the genes from fungi . there are over 600 known carotenoids . they are of two types , xanthophylls ( which contain oxygen ) and carotenes ( which are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen ) . carotenoids have two key roles in plants and algae : they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis , and they protect chlorophyll from photodamage . some carotenoids have vitamin a activity ( so they can convert to retinol ) . these and other carotenoids can also act as antioxidants . in the eye , certain other carotenoids ( lutein , astaxanthin , and zeaxanthin ) apparently act directly to absorb damaging blue and near-ultraviolet light . this protects the macula of the retina , the part of the eye with the sharpest vision .
