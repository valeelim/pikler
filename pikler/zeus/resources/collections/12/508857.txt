Aglaophyton     aglaophyton is a genus of early devonian fossil land plants . its fossils have been found in the rhynie chert . only the sporophyte generation have been found as fossils . only one species has been found , `` aglaophyton major '' . `` aglaophyton '' was at first thought to be a species of the vascular plant genus `` rhynia '' which lived at the same time . later it was discovered that it is not really a vascular plant . it had vascular tissue , but the cells had thin walls . it might therefore be a missing link between the bryophytes and `` horneophyton '' and the vascular plants like `` rhynia '' . in 2004 , crane et al . published a cladogram which has `` aglaophyton '' as the sister group of the vascular plants . other websites . - cladogram from
