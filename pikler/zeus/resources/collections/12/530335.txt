Labour Briefing     labour briefing is a monthly political magazine made by members of the british labour party . the magazine was started in 1980 as london labour briefing . throughout the 1990s , `` london labour briefing '' lost supporters and influence as new labour 's hold over the labour party increased . this was also because control inside the labour party was centralised , and the role played by activists was reduced . `` london labour briefing '' was renamed `` labour briefing '' and was then known as `` labour left briefing '' . in 2008 it was changed back to `` labour briefing '' on merging with `` voice of the unions '' . it supports the socialist campaign group of members of parliament , and aims to promote and build the network of local campaign groups .
