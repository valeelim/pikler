Synthetic genomics     synthetic genomics is a type of genetic engineering . it makes genes which never occur in nature . synthetic genomics does not use naturally occurring genes . it may use custom-designed base pair series . in the future , it might use genetic codes that are not composed of the two base pairs of dna currently used by life forms . the development of synthetic genomics uses technical abilities and technologies in the field of genetics . researchers can make long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale . this allows them to do experiments on genomes which do not exist in nature . they also use ideas in protein folding and high-end computing facilities . the j. craig venter institute has assembled a quasi-synthetic `` mycoplasma genitalium '' bacterial genome by recombination of 25 overlapping fragments in a single step : other companies , including one called synthetic genomics , have been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes .
