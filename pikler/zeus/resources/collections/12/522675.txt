Codification (law)    codification ( law ) in law , codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction . they are listed , usually by subject , forming a legal code ( a codex or book of law ) . codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions . ancient sumer 's code of ur-nammu was compiled 2100-2050 bc . it is the earliest known surviving civil code . three centuries later , the babylonian king hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him . religious laws such as the torah were codified . important codifications were developed in the ancient roman empire , with the compilations of the lex duodecim tabularum . much later the corpus iuris civilis was assembled . these codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule . during much of ancient history the roman laws were left mostly uncodified . the first `` permanent '' system of codified laws could be found in china . this was with the compilation of the `` tang code '' in ad 624. this formed the basis of the chinese criminal code . this was then replaced by the `` great qing legal code '' . this code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the xinhai revolution and the establishment of the republic of china . the new laws of the republic of china were inspired by the german codified work , the `` b√ºrgerliches gesetzbuch '' . a very influential example in europe was the french napoleonic code of 1804 .
