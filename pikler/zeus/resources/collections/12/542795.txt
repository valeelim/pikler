Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act     the wilson-gorman tariff of 1894 ( also called the income tax act of 1894 ) was a bill passed by congress that reduced the tariffs on certain imports into the united states . the final version lowered duties slightly , but added a number of other provisions . one of these was a 2 % federal income tax . other items such as coal , lumber , wool and sugar were added to the duty-free list . debates over tariffs had been going on since america became a country . as the us became increasingly industrialized , the debates became more heated . the act was an effort by democrats to help the country recover from the panic of 1893 , a serious economic depression . it tried to accomplish this by lowering tariffs and making up for the loss of revenues by a federal income tax . they believed if the us lowered tariffs other countries would also . they also believed they could push through a direct tax on personal income . the act failed to achieve any of its goals . a year later it was repealed by the supreme court decision `` pollock v. farmers ' loan & trust co '' as being unconstitutional . indirectly , the tariff was a contributing cause to the spanish–american war .
