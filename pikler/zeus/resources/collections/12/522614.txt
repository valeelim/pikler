Ironclad warship     an ironclad is a ship protected by iron or steel armor plates . the first recorded use of an ironclad was during the japanese invasion of korea . western use of ironclads began about the second half of the 19th century . the western ironclad was developed because up to then wooden warships were easily damaged by explosive or incendiary shells . in 1592 admiral yi-sun put armor plates on his `` tortoise-ships '' . these protected the sides and top from bullets , arrows and fire . this allowed his small fleet to be victorious in several battles with the ese fleet . the first western ironclad battleship , `` gloire '' , was launched by the french navy in november 1859. the british admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856. they prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857. in early 1859 the royal navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet . after the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the american civil war . it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . this type of ship would come to be very successful in the american civil war .
