J1 (Y-DNA)    j1 ( y-dna ) haplogroup j1 , more fully y dna haplogroup j-m267 , is a y chromosome haplogroup found in the middle east . this means it represents a group of descendants from a single common ancestor along the father 's line . it carries a mutation on the y chromosome known as m267 . this type of mutation is called a snp , or a single nucleotide polymorphism , which is a change in the chemicals at one position in a gene 's dna . y chromosomes are passed down from father to son without changing , so an snp like this shows common ancestry . the origin of this mutation was between 4,000 and 24,000 years ago . this mutation followed a previous mutation , which created the haplogroup known as haplogroup j-p209 or simply haplogroup j , and so this makes this y chromosome the `` child '' of the older version of the y chromosome . haplogroup j arose from a mutation which occurred about 31,700 years ago in southwest asia . the original semitic people are estimated to be : - 10 % in western europe , in the iberian peninsula , central asia , sub-saharan africa and horn of africa .
