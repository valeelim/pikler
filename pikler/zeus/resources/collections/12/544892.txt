Term limit     a term limit is a law that limits the number of terms an officeholder may serve in a particular elected office . when term limits are found in presidential systems , they act as a method to reduce the potential for monopoly . this is when a leader effectively becomes a `` president for life '' . term limits are intended to protect a democracy from becoming a de facto dictatorship . sometimes , there is an absolute limit on the number of terms an officeholder can serve . in other cases , the restrictions are merely on the number of consecutive ( one directly following the other ) terms . ancient greece and ancient rome , two early civilizations which had elected offices , both imposed limits on some positions . in the ancient athenian democracy , only offices selected by sortition were subject to terms limits . they included one term of one year for each office , except members of the council of five hundred , where the council was changed every year . in the roman republic , a law was passed imposing a limit of a single term on the office of censor . the annual magistrates - tribune of the plebs , aedile , quaestor , praetor , and consulâ€”were forbidden reelection until a number of years had passed . also there was a term limit of 6 months for a dictator .
