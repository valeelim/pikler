Ford Bronco     the ford bronco is a utility vehicle that was produced from 1966 to 1996. it had five distinct generations . all these vehicles are currently classified as sport utility vehicles ( suv ) . the broncos can be divided into two categories : early broncos ( 1966–77 ) and full-size broncos ( 1978–96 ) . the bronco was introduced in 1966. it was a competitor to the small four-wheel drive compact suvs that included the jeep cj-5 and international harvester scout . it was built on its own platform . ford positioned the bronco between the jeep and scout . but it was too small to capture the us market . a major redesign in 1978 moved the bronco to a larger size . it used a shortened ford f-series truck chassis to compete with both the similarly adapted chevrolet k5 blazer , as well as the dodge ramcharger . the full-size broncos and the successor expedition were produced at ford 's michigan truck plant in wayne , michigan .
