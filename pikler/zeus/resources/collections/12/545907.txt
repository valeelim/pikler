Data corruption     data corruption is errors in computer data that happens while the computer is reading , writing , storing , transmitting or processing the data . such errors introduce unintended changes to the original data . if data corruption happens in a file , unexpected results will happen when accessed by the system or an application ; such results may range from a minor loss of data to a system crash . for example , if a microsoft word file is corrupted , when a person tries to open that file with microsoft word , they may get an error message . that means that person will get either a file that can not be opened or a file with a minor loss of data . one of the ways this can happen is if a power shortage happens while saving the document , the computer can not power down properly and the file becomes corrupted . hackers can also corrupt data , be it accidentally or on purpose .
