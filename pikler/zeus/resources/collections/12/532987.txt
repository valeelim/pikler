Conosa     the conosa is one of three subphyla in the amoebozoa . it is subdivided into two infraphyla â€“ the mycetozoa and the archamoebae . - mycetozoa : a group of slime moulds . - archamoebae : distinguishing mark : they have no mitochondria . conosa includes the species `` dictyostelium discoideum '' and `` entamoeba histolytica '' , among others . about 2000 species are known , and probably there are many more . because these cells have few visible characteristics , they do look rather alike : `` they exhibit few morphological traits that can be used as taxonomic characters '' . as their molecular biology becomes known , many species may get split .
