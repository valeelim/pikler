D-flat major     d major ( or d-flat major ) is a major scale based on d. its key signature has five flats . its relative minor is b minor , and its parallel minor is d minor . this is usually replaced by c♯ minor because d♭ minor 's eight flats ( including the double-flat ) make it generally impractical to use . therefore , d♭ minor is often used as the parallel key of c♯ minor . for example , chopin 's prelude no . 15 in d-flat major ( `` raindrop '' ) , modulates from d-flat major to c-sharp minor for the middle section in the parallel minor , and in his fantaisie-impromptu , primarily in c-sharp minor , chopin switches to d-flat major for the middle section for the opposite reason . claude debussy also switches from d-flat major to c-sharp minor in the significant section in his famous clair de lune . antonín dvořák 's new world symphony likewise switches to c-sharp minor for a while for the significant section in the slow movement .
