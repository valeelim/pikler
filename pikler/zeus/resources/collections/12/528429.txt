Pareto distribution     the pareto distribution is a probability distribution named after vilfredo pareto . it is continous and follows a power law . it is a heavy tailed distribution . the pareto distribution was first used to show how income is distributed among households ( which is commonly called income distribution ) . pareto distributions are often used in the cases when many different small independent factors contribute to a result . pareto wrote a book called `` cours d'Ã©conomie politique '' , where he tried to show that the number of people who have an income greater than x is proportional to formula_1 . the parameter formula_2 is constant , and about 1.5. this is all that is needed to describe the pareto distribution . insurance companies often use pareto distributions to model damage .
