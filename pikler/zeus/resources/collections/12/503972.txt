Truncated icosahedron     a truncated icosahedron is an archimedean solid . a regular icosahedron is made of 20 faces . when a regular icosahedron is truncated , this means that each `` corner '' ( or vertex ) is replaced by a pentagon , as there are five edges at each corner . a truncated icosahedron is made of 12 regular pentagons and 20 hexagons . it has 60 vertices , and 90 edges . the molecule fullerene is made of 60 carbon atoms and looks like a truncated icosahedron . most soccer balls are truncated icosahedra .
