Trust law     in law a trust is a relationship where property is held by one party for the benefit of another party . a trust is created by the owner , also called a `` settlor '' , `` trustor '' or `` grantor '' who transfers property to a trustee . the trustee holds that property for the trust 's beneficiaries . trusts exist mainly in common law jurisdictions . they have existed since roman times . when an owner of property places that property into trust , he or she turns over part or all of his or her rights to the trustee . this separates the property 's legal ownership and control from its settlor 's ownership and benefits . this controls the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent , incapacitated , or dead . trusts are frequently created in wills , defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries . the trustee is given legal title to the trust property , but has an obligation to act for the good of the beneficiaries . the benefits of the trust belong to the beneficiary . the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed . but the trustee must otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties . trustees who do n't do this are self-dealing . courts can reverse self dealing actions , order profits returned , and impose other sanctions .
