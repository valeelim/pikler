Internet Assigned Numbers Authority     the internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ) is a department of icann . iana is a nonprofit corporation that handles many internet-related symbols and numbers . iana is in charge of allocating numbers like ip addresses used in internet protocols . these protocols are published in request for comments ( rfc ) documents . iana works with the internet engineering task force ( ietf ) and the rfc editorial team . assigning ip addresses and domain names needs more administration . iana delegates these to smaller administrations because of the many layers involved . iana gives ip addresses in blocks to regional internet registries ( rirs ) . each rir assigns addresses for a different part of the world . all the rirs formed the number resource organization to coordinate with each other . rirs split their address pools into smaller chunks and give them to internet service providers in their region . iana assigns addresses with a /8 prefix for ipv4 . it also assigns ipv6 addresses with /23 and /12 prefixes . these ipv6 addresses come from the 2000 : :/3 ipv6 address block . because ipv4 addresses have run out , iana does not assign them any more .
