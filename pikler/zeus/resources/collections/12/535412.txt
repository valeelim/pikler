Dissenting opinion     a dissenting opinion ( or dissent ) is an opinion in a legal case . it is written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court . in some cases , they simply declare a disagreement with the majority opinion . in other cases they may be used to instruct , prod , or otherwise try to convince other justices of the point of view expressed by the minority . when not necessarily referring to a legal decision , this can also be referred to as a minority report . dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions . they are also delivered and published at the same time . a dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law . however , they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court 's holding should be limited or overturned . in some cases , a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law . a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular rule of law formerly advocated in dissent . as with concurring opinions , the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often highlight the precise holding of the majority opinion . chief justice charles evans hughes stated in 1936 : `` a dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal '' .
