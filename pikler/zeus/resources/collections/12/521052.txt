This Land Is Your Land     `` this land is your land '' is one of the best known folk songs in the united states . its lyrics were written by american folk singer woody guthrie in 1940 , based on a melody that already existed . guthrie 's melody was very similar to the melody of `` oh , my loving brother '' . this was a baptist gospel hymn that had been recorded by the carter family as `` when the world 's on fire '' , and had inspired their `` little darlin ' , pal of mine . '' he used the same melody for the chorus and the verses . guthrie did not like irving berlin 's song `` god bless america '' , sung at that time by kate smith . guthrie was angry with the positive ( smug ) attitude of the song . he thought it was not realistic and the words sounded too proud of the country . the song was popular and was being played on the radio all the time . tired of hearing it on the radio , he wrote a response originally named `` god blessed america for me '' . guthrie rewrote the lyrics and the title over time and the song finally became `` this land is your land '' . he sometimes added more overtly political verses in line with his views of communism than appear in recordings or publications .
