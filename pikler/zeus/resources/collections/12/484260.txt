You Know You're Right    you know you 're right `` you know you 're right '' is the first song off american grunge band nirvana 's self-titled 2002 compilation album . the song was released on october 8 , 2002. it was the last song that was recorded by nirvana , before kurt cobain 's death . on the `` billboard '' charts , `` you know you 're right '' was able to peak at # 1 on the mainstream rock , # 1 on the alternative songs , and # 45 on the hot 100 charts . there was a legal battle between cobain 's widow courtney love and nirvana bandmates dave grohl and krist novoselic . both grohl and novoselic wanted to use the song for a nirvana box-set that was planned but love did not allow this and blocked it from being released . love said that the song would have been `` wasted '' by using for a box set , and said that it would be better-suited for a single-disc collection . the lawsuit was settled in september 2002 and it announced that `` you know you 're right '' would arrive on `` a one-cd history of the band '' called `` nirvana '' later that year . other websites .
