Archimedean solid     in geometry , an archimedean solid is a convex shape which is composed of polygons . it is a polyhedron , with the following properties : - each face is made of a regular polygon - all the corners of the shape look the same - the shape is neither a platonic solid , nor a prism , nor an antiprism . depending on the way there are counted , there are thirteen or fifteen such shapes . of two of these shapes , there are two versions , which can not be made congruent using rotation . the archimedean solids are named after the ancient greek mathematician archimedes , who probably discovered them in the 3rd century bc . the writings of archimedes have been lost , but pappus of alexandria summarized them in the 4th century . during the renaissance , artists and mathematicians valued `` pure forms '' and rediscovered all of these forms . johannes kepler probably completed this search around 1620. constructing an archimedean solid takes at least two different polygons . properties . - archimedean solids are made of regular polygons , therefore all edges have the same length .
