Battle of Osawatomie     the battle of osawatomie took place on saturday , august 30 , 1856 in the town of osawatomie , kansas . john brown and about 40 men tried to defend the town against an attack by about 250â€“300 border ruffians . the missouri ruffians were led by john w. reid . the attack began early in the morning when frederick brown , son of john brown , was shot and killed outside of the town . this alerted john brown and others who tried to defend the town . but heavy casualties forced brown and the other abolitionists back across the nearby river . the town was looted and burned but brown was not pursued . this was one of many clashes between pro-slavery and free-staters during the period known as bleeding kansas . in 1854 , the passage of the kansas-nebraska act began a policy known as popular sovereignty in the united states . it allowed settlers in the kansas territory to decide by popular vote whether kansas would be admitted to the united states as a slave or free state . this led activists from both sides of the issue to flood into kansas trying to influence the outcome . it led to a period of violence that continued into the amer civil war .
