Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution     ratified on december 15 , 1791 , the eighth amendment ( amendment viii ) to the united states constitution is a part of the united states bill of rights . this amendment has three parts that each grant specific rights . the excessive bail clause limits excessive bail for any person arrested for a crime but has not yet been placed on trial . the excessive fines clause is intended to limit fines imposed by state and federal governments on persons who have been convicted of a crime . the most controversial and most important part is the cruel and unusual punishment clause . the eighth amendment applies to criminal punishment and not to most civil procedures . the wording of the eighth amendment is almost the same as three of the provisions in the english bill of rights of 1689. these provisions were based on the case of titus oates , whose lies under oath caused the execution of many innocent people . because the english authorities did not want to make honest people fear to give evidence in court , he was not put to death . while his punishment included those considered ordinary at the time , the combination of these punishments were applied in an excessive and brutal way . oates was convicted of sedition , thrown into prison to remain there . however , after james ii of england became king in 1685 , he was tried again , this time for perjury . in addition to being imprisoned for life , he was to be `` whipped through the streets of london five days a year for the remainder of his life . '' the first use of the provision of the english bill of rights was the virginia declaration of rights of 1776 .
