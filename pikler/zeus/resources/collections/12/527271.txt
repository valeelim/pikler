Autotransformer     an autotransformer ( sometimes called autostep down transformer ) is a transformer which has only one winding . the `` auto '' ( greek for `` self '' ) prefix refers to the single coil acting on itself and not to any kind of automatic mechanism . the winding acts as both primary winding and secondary winding in a normal transformer . since part of the winding does `` double duty '' , autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller , lighter , and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers . the disadvantage of an autotransformer include not providing electrical isolation between the primary winding and the secondary winding . there is also a higher possibility of short circuits due to low impedance . autotransformers are used in power transmission , power distribution , audio , rail transport , etc . autotransformers are often used to step up ( increase ) or step down ( decrease ) voltages in the 110–120 v range and in the 220–240 v range . other websites . - the basics of autotransformers
