Movius Line     the movius line is a theoretical line drawn across northern india . it was proposed by the american archaeologist hallam l. movius in 1948 to show a technological difference between the early prehistoric tool technologies of the east and the west of the old world . movius noticed that the palaeolithic stone tools from sites east of northern india never contained handaxes . they had less formal implements known as chopping tools . these were sometimes as extensively worked as the acheulean tools from further west , but could not be described as true handaxes . movius then drew a line on a map of india to show where the difference occurred , dividing the tools of africa , europe and western and southern asia from those of eastern and south-eastern asia . fossil evidence also suggests a difference in the evolutionary development of the people who made the two different tool types across the movius line . the line is still in use as a distinction between the two traditions . the existence of the line , in terms of stone tool technology and human evolution , is still not explained .
