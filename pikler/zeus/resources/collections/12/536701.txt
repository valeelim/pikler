Roper v. Simmons     roper v. simmons , , was a landmark decision of the united states supreme court . the court ruled that it is unconstitutional to execute a person for crimes they committed before they were 18 years old . this decision affected 25 states in the country , which still allowed executions of children under age 18. also , the decision reversed the court 's past ruling in `` stanford v. kentucky '' , , which had said that executions of children ages 1618 were sometimes legal . the first known `` juvenile '' ( child under the age of 18 ) to be executed in america was thomas granger . in 1642 , he was executed at age 16 or 17 for sodomy . between 1642 and 2016 , 364 juveniles have been executed in the united states . until 1988 , the supreme court had put no limits on how old a person had to be in order to be executed . this meant each state could set their own rules . in some states , the minimum age for execution was as low as 14. for example , in 1944 , south carolina executed a 14-year-old boy named george stinney in the electric chair . stinney was the youngest person in the united states to be convicted and executed during the 20th century .
