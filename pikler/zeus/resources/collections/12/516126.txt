Hachikō     hachikō ( november 10 , 1923 – march 8 , 1935 ) was an akita dog . he is best known for his unusual loyalty . he remained a faithful pet for many years after his owner died . the dog was born on a farm near the city of ōdate in akita prefecture . in 1924 , hidesaburō ueno , a professor in the agriculture department at the university of tokyo , took hachikō , a golden brown akita as a pet . during his owner 's life , hachikō greeted him at the end of each day at the nearby shibuya station . the two kept their daily routine until may 1925 , when professor ueno did not come back to the train station . the professor had died of a cerebral hemorrhage . each day for the next nine years , nine months and fifteen days , hachikō waited for ueno 's return . he showed up at the exact time the train was due at the station . other travellers begin to notice hachikō still showing up . many of the people had seen hachikō and professor ueno meet each afternoon . at first , people who worked at the station were not very friendly to the dog . but after a story was written about him in `` asahi shinbun '' , people started to bring hachikō treats and food for him to eat while he waited .
