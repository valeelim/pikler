Hateg Island     hațeg island was a large offshore island in the tethys sea during the late cretaceous . it was in an area now around modern-day hațeg , hunedoara county , romania . upper cretaceous fossils of small-sized dinosaurs have been found in the former island 's rocks . the island was formed mainly by tectonic uplift during the early alpine orogeny towards the end of the cretaceous . there is no real present-day analog , but the island of hainan ( off the coast of china ) is perhaps closest as regards climate , geology and topography , though still not a particularly good match . the vegetation , for example , was quite distinct from today , as was the fauna . hungarian paleontologist franz nopcsa ( 1877–1933 ) had the idea that `` limited resources '' found on the island often have an effect of `` reducing the size of animals '' over the generations , producing a localized form of dwarfism . nopcsa 's theory of island dwarfism – also known as the `` island rule '' – is today widely accepted .
