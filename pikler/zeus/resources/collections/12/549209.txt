Meteorite strewnfield     a meteorite strewnfield is the area where meteorites and glassy tektites from a single meteor fall are found . there are two ways for strewnfields to form : 1. mid-air fragmentation . when a large meteor enters the atmosphere it often fragments into many pieces . this showers the material over a large oval-shaped area . the shape of this oval is caused by the flight path of the meteor . when multiple-explosions occur , the material may be found in several overlapping ovals . 1. impact fragmentation : the fragmentation can occur on impact . in this case the strewnfield shape may be different , usually circular . example . - the australasian strewnfield is the youngest and largest of the tektite strewnfields . recent estimates suggest it may cover 10 % -30 % of the earth 's surface .
