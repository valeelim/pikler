Thomas Newcomen     thomas newcomen ( february 1664 – 5 august 1729 ) was an english inventor . he made the first practical steam engine for pumping water , the newcomen steam engine . newcomen was an ironmonger and a baptist lay preacher . he was born in dartmouth , devon , england , to a merchant family and baptised at st. saviour 's church on 24 february 1664. flooding in coal and tin mines was a large problem . newcomen was trying to improve ways to pump out the water from the mines . his ironmonger 's business specialised in tools for the mining industry . his first engine was not very efficient , and used a lot of coal . the watt steam engine , was much more fuel efficient . watt and his partner matthew boulton got substantial royalties because their machines saved so much on fuel bills . there are examples of newcomen engines in the science museum ( london ) and the ford museum , dearborn , michigan . perhaps the last newcomen-style engine to be used commercially – and the last still on its original site – is at the elsecar heritage centre , near barnsley in south yorkshire . newcomen engines that can be seen working are the newcomen memorial engine at dartmouth and the replica engine at the black country museum in dudley , west midlands .
