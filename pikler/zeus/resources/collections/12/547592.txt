Angiosperm Phylogeny Group     the angiosperm phylogeny group ( apg ) is an informal international group of botanists who came together to try try and get a consensus on the taxonomy of flowering plants ( angiosperms ) . they wanted to base it on plant relationships got from phylogeny . four versions of a classification system have come from this collaboration . they were published in 1998 , 2003 , 2009 and 2016. earlier angiosperm classifications were not based on monophyletic groups ( i.e. , groups that include all the descendants of a common ancestor ) . the principles of the apg 's approach to classification were set out in the first paper of 1998 , and have remained unchanged in subsequent revisions . briefly , these are : - the linnean system of orders and families should be kept . - groups should be monophyletic ( i.e . consist of `` all '' descendants of a common ancestor ) . - a limited number of larger orders will be more useful than lots of small orders . - above or parallel to the level of orders and families , the term clades is used more freely . some clades have later been given formal names . the authors say that it is `` not possible , nor is it desirable '' to name all clades in a phylogenetic tree . however , systematists need to agree on names for some clades , particularly orders and families , for communication and discussion .
