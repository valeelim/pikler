Abduction (logic)    abduction ( logic ) abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type `` how did this come about ? '' . it produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct . consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning . how did that happen ? in london , the answer is most often that it rained . but in los angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on . abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation . it makes the simplest and most likely explanation . in abductive reasoning , unlike in deductive reasoning , the premises do not guarantee the conclusion . abductive reasoning is `` inference to the best explanation '' . the philosopher charles sanders peirce ( 1839â€“1914 ) introduced abduction into modern logic .
