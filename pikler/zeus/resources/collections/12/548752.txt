Field artillery in the American Civil War     field artillery in the american civil war were cannon that could be moved around the battlefield or could travel with an army unit . field artillery could only fight unlimbered ( disconnected from the cart and horses that pulled it ) . the limber ( or caisson ) along with the team of six horses would be moved to a safe area nearby . gun crews were organized into an artillery battery , six guns ( later in the war , four ) were deployed along a line about wide with the guns spaced about apart . at times the horses remained hitched to the limber or caisson so the battery could move quickly . an artillery crew was made up of eight highly trained men . an artillery battery had a total of between 70 and 100 soldiers . there were several types of field artillery used during the civil war . these included the 6 pounder gun , 12 and the 24 pound howitzer , the famous model 1857 12-pounder napoleon field gun , the 3 inch ordnance rifle and the 10 and 20 pound parrott rifle . most cannons were muzzleloading weapons . cannon barrels were of two types . one was the older smoothbore cannons as used during the mexicanâ€“american war . they usually had barrels made of bronze and fired round iron cannonballs . the newer type was the rifled cannon that were made of cast iron and wrought iron . they fired bullet-shaped shells . both guns and ammunition had a tendency to be unreliable and they were dangerous to shoot .
