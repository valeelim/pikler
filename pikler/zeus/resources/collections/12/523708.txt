Phosphorus cycle     the phosphorus cycle includes the following steps : - phosphorus in fertilizer , rocks , and mountains is distributed by rain to nearby land and bodies of water - animals eat the plants grown by fertilizer . they expel the phosphorus as waste . it eventually reaches the water as runoff . - phosphorus is cycled through animals that live in water . it is eventually deposited into the ocean floor . - phosphates contribute to the sediment at the bottom of the water . that sediment becomes rock - the ocean bed eventually becomes a mountain range over several millions of years because of normal geological functions - the phosphorus in those mountain ranges is washed off into bodies of water and the cycle begins again . references . - friedland , andrew j. , rick relyea , and david courard-hauri . `` the phosphorus cycle .
