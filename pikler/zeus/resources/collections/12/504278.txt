Raymond Gosling     raymond gosling ( 15 july 1926 â€“ 18 may 2015 ) was a british biophysicist . he was known for doing x-ray diffraction studies on dna . these studies were the first step in understanding the 3-d structure of dna . he did these studies as a doctoral student in the research group headed by maurice wilkins at kings college london . gosling 's first supervisor was a.r . stokes of the physics department . by 1950 , gosling 's diffraction photographs were described by wilkins at the time as `` much better than astbury 's , and almost like single crystals '' . gosling was re-assigned to rosalind franklin when she joined wilkins ' group in 1951. for the next two years , they worked closely together to improve the x-ray diffraction photography of dna and get a sharper image . gosling made the x-ray diffraction image of dna known as `` photo 51 '' . this work led directly to the 1963 nobel prize in physiology or medicine being awarded to francis crick , james d. watson and maurice wilkins . gosling was the co-author with franklin of one of the three dna double helix papers published in `` nature '' in april 1953 .
