Brown Bess     the brown bess is a nickname for the british short land pattern musket . it was produced from 1725â€“1838 . the land pattern , or more popularly known as the `` brown bess '' , and its versions were all .75 caliber smoothbore flintlock muskets . they were the standard guns for all land forces in the british empire . it was one of the most important military firearms ever designed . it helped win the british empire . the brown bess was replaced after 1838 by smoothbore percussion cap muskets . its effective range was about but in most battle situations the distance between forces was only about . even at that range the gun was not particularly accurate . the british tactic was to fire in vollies followed by a bayonet attack . while the origins of the name brown bess are uncertain , a plausible explanation is the name was based on the german `` braun buss '' , meaning strong gun . the gun was commissioned during the reign of king george i of great britain , who was from germany . one of the earliest forms of flintlock musket used by the english army was the `` dog lock '' . very similar to the snaphaunce it was the first to introduce the half-cocked position of the hammer . this made the gun much safer to handle and load . it was in use during the english civil war and many found their way to the british north american colonies . another name for the dog lock was the english lock , and the gun was a swedish styled musket . some of these have been found at jamestown and yorktown , virginia by archaeologists .
