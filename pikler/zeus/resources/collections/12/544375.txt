Chandrasekhar limit     the chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star . building on work by others , the indian physicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar worked on the calculation . he published series of papers between 1931 and 1935. the chandrasekhar limit is about 1.4 times the mass of the sun . the chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star 's core is not enough to balance the star 's own gravitational self-attraction . then , white dwarfs with masses over the limit would gravitationally collapse into a neutron star or black hole . however , white dwarfs usually explode before they undergo collapse . those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs .
