Prisoner's dilemma    prisoner 's dilemma the prisoner 's dilemma is a paradox about co-operation . it shows why two `` rational '' individuals might not co-operate , even if it seems in their best interests . it is studied in game theory . the police catch two criminals after they committed a crime . the police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped . they question the two in separate cells . each prisoner can either stay silent or betray ( hurt ) the other by blaming the crime on them . if both stay silent , they only go to jail for 6 months . if one betrays and the other stays silent , the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all . if they both betray each other , they each go to jail for 2 years . no matter what happens , the prisoners will never see each other again . if you are a prisoner in this situation and you only care about yourself , the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner . no matter what , you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not .
