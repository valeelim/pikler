Radio astronomy     radio astronomy is astronomy which studies celestial objects at radio frequencies . the first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the 1930s . karl jansky found radiation coming from the milky way . later , other sources of radio emission were found . these include stars and galaxies , as well as entirely new classes of objects , such as radio galaxies , quasars , pulsars , and masers . the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation , evidence for the big bang theory , was made through radio astronomy . radio astronomy is done using large radio antennas . these are called radio telescopes . they are used alone , or with multiple linked telescopes . the use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high angular resolution . the resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components , not the size of its components .
