Transmission medium     a transmission medium is something ( solid , liquid , gas , or plasma ) that can transmit energy . for example , the transmission medium for sounds is usually air . but sound can also be transmitted through solids and liquids . a wire can transmit electrons in the form of electricity . there are advantages and disadvantages to every transmission medium . these can be things such as cost , bandwidth ( or how much of something can be transmitted ) , the speed of the transmission and scope . physical mediums : are actually wires or cables used to connect two or more devices . these can be twisted pair , coaxial and fiber optic cables . twisted pair cables were traditionally used in telephone wire lines and cables . but they are still widely used in networks and other uses . they are called `` twisted pair '' cables because they have many small thin insulated wires twisted around each other in a balanced circuit . twisted pair cables can contain up to 4200 pairs of wires . related pages . - luminiferous aether
