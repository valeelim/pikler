Josephoartigasia     josephoartigasia is an extinct genus of giant rodent from the pliocene . it is related to the living pacarana . the genus includes the largest known rodent , `` josephoartigasia monesi '' . the two species would have looked like gigantic pacarana , or capybaras the size of cows . however , dr virginie millien , from mcgill university in montreal , said the mathematical models originally used to calculate the rodent 's mass from its skull probably overestimated its body size . a recent report said it had big front teeth , which it might have used for defence .
