Statute of limitations     statutes of limitations are laws passed by a legislative body in common law systems that set the maximum time after an event when a lawsuit may be filed . in civil law systems , similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as `` periods of prescription '' . when the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes , the statute of limitations provides an absolute defense to the legal claim . the intention of these laws is to make sure legal cases are brought to trial in a reasonable length of time . a statute of limitations restricts when a case may be filed , but is not a deadline for the completion of a case . if a case is filed during the period specified in the statute of limitations , the case may be heard and decided by the court even after that period expires . the statute of limitations is determined by the cause of action , and different causes of action may have different limitations period even within the same state or country . the limitations period may be extended to ensure fairness to the parties , for example , if the person making the claim was a minor at the time the legal claim arose , or if the defendant committed a wrongful act to conceal the legal claim from the injured plaintiff .
