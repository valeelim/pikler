Raphe nuclei     the raphe nuclei ( singular = raphe nucleus ) are a cluster of nuclei in the hindbrain which release a neurotransmitter called serotonin ( 5-ht ) . the serotonin molecules get sent all over the brain , where they 're needed for all sorts of roles . 'selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ' ( ssri ) antidepressants are believed to act in these nuclei , as well as at their targets . many opioids ( drugs that calm people down ) can act on the raphe nuclei to secrete too much 5-ht .
