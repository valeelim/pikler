Battle of Falling Waters     the battle of falling waters ( july 6 , 1863 â€“ july 16 , 1863 ) , also called the battle of williamsport and the battle of hagerstown , was fought as part of the gettysburg campaign during the american civil war . it was an inconclusive battle in that it did not end in a clear victory for either side . having been defeated at the battle of gettysburg , general robert e. lee 's army retreated along the fairfield road toward hagerstown and williamsport , maryland . blocked from escaping into virginia by the flooded potomac river , lee 's forces created a defensive line with their backs to the river . the union army was cautiously following lee and arrived in the area beginning on july 12. there were a number of skirmishes and heavy fighting on july 13. that evening the river was low enough and lee 's army began crossing into virginia . on july 14 , union cavalry attacked the confederate rearguard taking about 700 prisoners . by late 1862 , virginia was running out of food to feed its army . lee 's horses were dying of disease because they had little or no fodder . the cavalry and artillery units had to be widely scattered behind his lines in order to find food for the horses . in the winter of 1863 , food trains from the south were becoming more and more scarce . his men were living on rations of one-quarter pound of salted meat per day . confederate president jefferson davis and his secretary of war james seddon wanted to send detachments from lee 's army to other more successful war fronts . lee was opposed to the idea . because of increased activity by the union army of the potomac recently , he could not afford to weaken his army any further .
