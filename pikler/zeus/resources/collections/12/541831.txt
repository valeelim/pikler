Furcula     the furcula ( `` little fork '' in latin ) is commonly called the wishbone . it is a forked bone in birds and some extinct dinosaurs . it is a strut between a bird 's shoulders , and connects to each of the bird 's scapulae ( shoulder blades ) . a strut is a structure which resists compression ( pushing together ) along its length . it is formed by the fusion of the two clavicles ( shoulder blades ) . in birds , its main function is to strengthen the thoracic skeleton to withstand the forces of flight . x-ray films of starlings in flight have shown that the furcula expands when the wings are pulled downward , and snaps back as they are raised . acting like a spring , the furcula stores some of the energy generated by contraction of the breast muscles . then it releases the energy during the upstroke as the furcula snaps back to the normal position . this , in turn , draws the shoulders toward the midline of the body . surprisingly , the furcula is not essential for flying , and there are a number of birds which can fly well , but have a reduced furcula , or none at all .
