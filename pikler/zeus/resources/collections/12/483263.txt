Blackwater river     a blackwater river is a river with a deep , slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands . its colour is caused by the decaying vegetation . as vegetation decays , tannins leach into the water , making a transparent , acidic water that is darkly stained , looking like tea or coffee . most rivers in the amazon basin and the southern united states are blackwater rivers . not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense . some rivers in temperate regions , which drain or flow through areas of dark black soil , are black due to the color of the soil . these rivers are `` black mud rivers '' or estuaries . blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater . the unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ both from whitewater and clearwater rivers . the classification of amazonian rivers into black , clear and whitewater was first proposed by alfred russel wallace in 1853 .
