Radiometer     a radiometer or roentgenometer is a device for measuring the radiant flux ( power ) of electromagnetic radiation . generally , a radiometer is an infrared radiation detector or ultraviolet detector . types . - the name radiometer is frequently used to refer to a crookes radiometer ( `` light-mill '' ) . this is an early device wherein a rotor in a partial vacuum spins when exposed to light . - the nichols radiometer is a newer and more sensitive radiometer than the crookes type . it measures radiation pressure . it has two small mirrors suspended on a quartz fiber . - a microwave radiometer operates in the microwave wavelengths . the radiometer contains argon gas to enable it to rotate . - the mems radiometer can operate on the same principles of nichols or crooke radiometers . it can operate over a wide spectrum of wavelength and particle energy levels .
