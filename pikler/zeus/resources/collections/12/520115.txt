Particle detector     a particle detector , also known as a radiation detector , is a device used to , , and/or high-energy particles . these particles can be made by nuclear decay , cosmic radiation , or reactions in a particle accelerator . particle detectors are used in particle physics , nuclear physics , and nuclear engineering . modern detectors are also used as calorimeters to measure the energy of radiation . they can measure other things , such as the momentum , spin , or charge of the particles . detectors designed for modern accelerators are very big . they are also very expensive . they are called `` counters '' when they simply count particles , but do not measure anything else . usually , particle detectors can also track ionizing radiation ( high energy photons or even visible light ) . many of the detectors invented so far are ionization detectors ( such as gaseous ionization detectors and semiconductor detectors ) and scintillation detectors . other principles , such as ƒçerenkov light and transition radiation , have also been applied to detect particles .
