Tarantula nebula     the tarantula nebula ( also known as 30 doradus ) is an h ii region in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . it was originally thought to be a star , but in 1751 lacaille recognized it was a nebula . the tarantula nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8. considering its distance of 49 kpc ( 160,000 light-years ) , this is an extremely luminous object . its luminosity is so great that if it were as close to earth as the orion nebula , the tarantula nebula would cast shadows . it is the most active starburst region known in the local group of galaxies . it is also one of the largest such regions in the local group with an estimated diameter of 200 pc . 30 doradus has at its centre the star cluster ngc 2070 which includes the group of stars known as r136 . this group puts out most of the energy that makes the nebula visible . the estimated mass of the cluster is 450,000 solar masses . it may become a globular cluster in the future . in addition to ngc 2070 , the tarantula nebula has other star clusters , including the much older hodge 301. the most massive stars of hodge 301 have already exploded in supernovae . the closest supernova observed since the invention of the telescope , supernova 1987a , occurred in the outskirts of the tarantula nebula . the remnants of many other supernovae are difficult to detect in the complex nebulosity .
