OGPU     ogpu was the secret police of the soviet union from 1922 to 1934. it was after the cheka and before the nkvd . its official name was the joint state political directorate . the ogpu was theoretically supposed to operate with more restraint than the original bolshevik secret police , the cheka . the ogpu 's powers were greatly increased in 1926 , when the soviet criminal code was amended to include a section on `` anti-state terrorism '' . the law were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted . even before then , it set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of terrorism , usually without calling any witnesses . in time , the ogpu 's powers grew even greater than those of the cheka . perhaps its most spectacular success was the trust operation of 1924–1925 . ogpu agents contacted émigrés in western europe and pretended to be on a large group working to overthrow the communist regime , known as the `` trust '' . exiled russians gave the trust large sums of money and supplies , as did foreign intelligence agencies . the trust finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anti-communist operators , sidney reilly , into russia to meet with the trust . once he was in russia , he was captured and killed . it was a great propaganda success .
