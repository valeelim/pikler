Pulmonary contusion     a pulmonary contusion ( or lung contusion ) is a contusion ( bruise ) of the lung , caused by chest trauma . the bruise harms the capillaries , and then blood and other liquids collect in the lungs . these extra liquids prevent with gas exchange . without gas exchange , oxygen levels drop ( hypoxia ) . if the lung is cut , then the injury is instead a pulmonary laceration and has different symptoms . a lung contusion is usually caused by blunt trauma . explosion injuries or a shock wave from a penetrating trauma may also cause this injury . doctors began studying this injury after explosives hurt soldiers in world wars i and ii . in the 1960s when cars became popular people began to get this kind of injury from car accidents . lung contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung . in contusion , the structure of the lung does not change . in laceration , the pieces of lung may be moved . when blood fills lacerations , the injury is called pulmonary hematoma . the difference between a contusion and a hematoma is that in a contusion , the alveoli ( tiny air-filled sacs that give oxygen ) will bleed , but a hematoma is a blood clot .
