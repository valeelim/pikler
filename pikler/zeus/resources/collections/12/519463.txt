Algebraic topology     algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces . algebraic topology can be used in a number of other fields such as physics , branches of geometry and number theory . algebraic topology can be used to count `` holes '' in a shape : for example , a wedding ring and a hollow pipe both have one hole , but a figure-8 has two . this can also be done in different dimensions ; the sphere has a kind of `` 2-dimensional '' hole .
