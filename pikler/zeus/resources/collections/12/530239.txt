Abjad     an abjad is an alphabet in which all its letters are consonants . even though vowels can be added in some abjads , they are not needed to write a word correctly . well-known examples of abjads are the arabic alphabet and the hebrew alphabet . abjads are the first writing systems that were made only to show a word 's pronunciation instead of its meaning , unlike ideographs or ideograms , and have been created before full alphabets that had letters for both consonants and vowels , like the greek alphabet . the earliest known abjad in the world is the phoenician alphabet . since afro-asiatic languages have a feature where the root meaning of the word is found in the word 's string of consonants , abjads are widely used for those languages . there are even languages that do n't have consonant roots that use abjads , such as persian and urdu , which both use the arabic alphabet .
