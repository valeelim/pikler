Judicial interpretation     judicial interpretation is an explanation of how the judiciary interprets the law . in common law , judicial interpretation is made up of guidelines that come from case law rather than from a legislature . these represent all previous judicial decisions . in constitutional law , there are different methods of judicial interpretation . these include : - textualism is when judges look at the actual language of more than anything else . this method can be hampered when the language of the constitution itself is ambiguous . this is also called literalism . - strict constructionism is when a judge interprets the text only as it is spoken . once a clear meaning has been established , there is no need for further analysis . judges should avoid drawing inferences from previous statutes or the constitution and instead focus on exactly what was written . - founders ' intent is when judges try to gauge the intentions of the authors of the constitution . problems can arise when judges try to determine which particular founders or framers to consult . it is also a problem to try to determine what they meant based on often sparse and incomplete documentation . this is also called original intent .
