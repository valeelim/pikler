ARCNET     attached resource computer network ( abbreviated arcnet or arcnet ) is a communications protocol for local area networks . arcnet was the first widely available networking system for microcomputers ; it became popular in the 1980s for office automation tasks . it was later applied to embedded systems where certain features of the protocol are especially useful . it was first used in 1977. arcnet uses a star-like topology , which is much easier to build and maintain than the bus topologies of other protocols developed later , such asethernet . original arcnet used coaxial cables , and a token-passing mechanism , much like token ring . at about 20 mbit/s maximum speed , arcnet is much slower than other network protocols , such as ethernet . because of its token-passing mechanisms , there are no collisions between packets . this makes it suitable for certain industrial applications , as well as for ohme automation , where it is still used .
