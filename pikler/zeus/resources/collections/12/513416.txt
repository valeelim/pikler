Drivetrain     the drivetrain of a motor vehicle is the group of parts that deliver power to the wheels that move the vehicle . the drivetrain includes the transmission or transaxle , driveshafts , differentials , axles and wheels . it does not include the engine or motor that creates the power . in contrast , the powertrain includes the engine and the drivetrain . in order to transmit power from the engine to the rear wheels , the drivetrain uses some of that power to work . drivetrain loss is the power lost , measured in horsepower , between what the engine generates and what is available at the wheels . as power is transmitted through the drivetrain , forces including inertia , drag and friction cause some power to be wasted . the more component parts power is transmitted through , the more power is lost . however each combination of drivetrain parts is different as to how much is lost . the automatic transmission wastes the most power of any drivetrain component .
