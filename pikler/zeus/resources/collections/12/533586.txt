Platanus     platanus is a genus of plants , which mostly occur on the northern hemisphere . all of them are trees , which reach heights between and . there are eight to ten recent species of `` platanus '' , and at least three extinct ones . in english , these trees are called planes or plane trees . some north american species are called sycamores , but this name is also used for a species of fig . the london plane , `` platanus '' Ã— `` acerifolia '' , is a hybrid or a cultivar . exactly what the parents were in uncertain . it was extensively planted on london streets before wwii , but is no longer in favour . the london plane is very tolerant of air pollution and root compaction ( small space for roots ) . for these reasons it was a popular urban roadside tree . now , however , it is indirectly something of a pest . aphids in their millions suck sap from its leaves , and drop sugary liquid onto cars parked underneath . older london streets have virtually no off-road parking .
