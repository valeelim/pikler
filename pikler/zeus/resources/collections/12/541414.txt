Kohl     kohl is an ancient eye cosmetic , traditionally made by grinding stibnite ( sbs ) . it is widely used in the middle east , north africa , and south asia as eye liner , to contour and/or darken the eyelids , and as mascara for the eyelashes . it is worn mostly by women , but also by some men and children . kohl is very ancient , and is seen in depictions of high status women and godesses in ancient egypt . it has also been used in india as a cosmetic for a long time . the content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly . in north africa and middle east , homemade kohl is often made by grinding galena ( lead sulfide ) . in the west , soot or organic charcoal may be used instead of lead . plant oils and the soot from various nuts , seeds , and gum resins are often added to the carbon powder . unfortunately , the non-lead products do not give such a good result as the the older , traditional varieties . handmade , lead-based kohl continues to be popular .
