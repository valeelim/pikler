Seriatim     in law , seriatim ( latin for `` in series '' ) indicates that a court is addressing multiple issues in a certain order , such as the order that the issues were originally presented to the court . a seriatim opinion describes an opinion delivered by a court with multiple judges , in which each judge reads his or her own opinion rather than a single judge writing an opinion on behalf of the entire court . this is a practice generally used when a legal case does not have a majority opinion . use of the word , and other latin phrases , has become less frequent in legal communications as a result of , among other factors , efforts by groups such as the plain language movement to promote the use of `` plain english '' in legal discourse . in modern use pleadings is used for `` one by one in sequence '' . for example , in english civil cases , defence statements generally used to conclude with the phrase `` save as expressly admitted herein , each allegation of the plaintiffs is denied as if set out in full and traversed herein `` seriatim '' . '' this formulation is now discouraged under the english civil procedure rules , especially rule 16.5 ( 3 ) - ( 5 ) .
