Severnaya Zemlya     severnaya zemlya is an group of islands of about 30 islands in the arctic ocean . the islands were known as `` emperor nicholas ii land '' . severnaya zemlya was first noted in 1913 and first charted in 1930â€“32 , making it the last group of islands on earth to be discovered . politically , the islands are part of russia 's krasnoyarsk krai region , but are uninhabited by humans except for an arctic base . there is a meterological station on golomjanny island . scientists live there for some months of the year . severnaya zemlya splits the arctic sea into an western part , called laptev sea , and an eastern part , called kara sea . a phenomenon called arctic sea ice decline can be shown on the islands : in the 20th century , the islands were a portion of eurasia which was always covered by ice . even as the ice melted in summer , some of the ice remained , and blocked what is called the northeast passage . if it were ice free the northeast passage would permit to naviagate from the atlantic to the pacific ocean easily . by the late summer of 2012 , the permanent ice had reached a record low extent and open water appeared to the north of the archipelago .
