Optic tectum     the optic tectum is a major part of the midbrain of vertebrates . in vertebrates such as fish , reptiles and birds , it is the main visual processor of the brain . in mammals , however , most of the work is done in the visual cortex . this is at the back of the cerebral cortex . the tectum does preliminary visual processing , and controls eye movement . when human anatomy textbooks use the term superior colliculus they are referring to the tectum . the diagram is based on human anatomy . each layer of the tectum contains a topographic map of the surrounding world . if neurons at a point in the map fire , it starts a response towards the corresponding point in space . in primates , the tectum ( `` superior colliculus '' ) directs eye movements . visual input from the retina , or `` command '' input from the cerebral cortex , create a `` bump '' of activity in the tectal map . if strong enough , this causes an eye movement . in primates , the tectum is also involved in generating head turns , arm-reaching movements , and shifts in attention which do not involve any movements . in other species , the tectum is involved in a wide range of responses , including whole-body turns in walking rats , swimming fishes , or flying birds ; tongue-strikes toward prey in frogs ; fang-strikes in snakes , etc .
