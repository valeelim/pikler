Cardiac muscle     cardiac muscle ( heart muscle ) is striated muscle ( striped muscle ) in the walls of the heart . it makes up the tissue called the myocardium . it is involuntary : a person can not control it consciously . cardiac muscle is one of three main types of muscle , the others being skeletal and smooth muscle . the cells that make up cardiac muscle have one ( 74 % ) or two ( 24.5 % ) nuclei . the myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer . coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle cells in the heart force blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems . this mechanism illustrates systole ( contraction ) of the heart . cardiac muscle cells , unlike most other tissues in the body , rely on the coronary arteries to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products directly . there is no time for them to diffuse . the heart muscle can become sick and weak . for example , if a person has very high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , part of the heart muscle can get overworked . the heart muscle becomes bigger and can not do its job as well . this is called hypertrophy .
