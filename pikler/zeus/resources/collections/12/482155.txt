Myxobacteria     the myxobacteria ( `` slime bacteria '' ) are a group of bacteria that usuallly live in the soil . they feed on insoluble organic substances . they have very large genomes compared to other bacteria . myxobacteria are included in the delta group of proteobacteria , a large group of gram-negative forms . myxobacteria move by gliding on the surface . they travel in `` swarms '' with many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals . the swarm puts out extracellular enzymes to digest food . this increases feeding efficiency . when nutrients are scarce , myxobacterial cells aggregate into `` fruiting bodies '' . these fruiting bodies are different shapes and colours , depending on the species . inside the fruiting bodies , cells develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls . these myxospores , like spores in other organisms , survive until nutrients are more plentiful . then cell growth is restarted with a group ( swarm ) of myxobacteria , not just isolated cells . similar life cycles have developed among the amoebae called cellular slime moulds .
