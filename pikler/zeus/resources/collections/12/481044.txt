Transcription factor     transcription factors help to regulate genes . each transcription factor binds to a specific dna sequence . that is how they control the rate of transcription of genetic information from dna to messenger rna . transcription factors are sometimes called a 'sequence-specific dna-binding factor ' . alone or with other proteins in a complex , they promote or block rna polymerase . rna polymerase is the enzyme that transcribes genetic information from dna to rna for specific genes . a defining feature of transcription factors is that they have one or more dna-binding domains ( dbds ) , which attach to specific sequences of dna next to the genes that they regulate . other proteins such as coactivators , chromatin remodellers , histone acetylases or deacetylases , kinases , and methylases , also playing crucial roles in gene regulation . because they lack dna-binding domains , they are not transcription factors .
