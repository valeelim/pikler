Forced migration     forced migration ( also called displacement ) is when people are made to leave their home or homeland . it is usually caused by violence , persecution , danger , or because an authority ( such as a government ) has told people to move . people are removed either by force or because of a threat or command . a person who has become forced to migrate is called a `` forced migrant '' or `` displaced person '' . they may be called a refugee , but that term has a specific legal definition . migration of people is constantly happening , but in a stable society it usually happens because a person chooses to do it . forced migration occurs when people 's lives , well-being or freedom is endangered . they may have little or no choice but to move . in some cases , such as human trafficking and slavery , people are physically removed from their homes . occasionally a government forces people and communities out of their homes or homelands for the purposes of economic development or military . it has been most often been associated with the building of dams and military bases .
