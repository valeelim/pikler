Turritopsis dohrnii     turritopsis dohrnii , the so-called immortal jellyfish , is a species of small jellyfish found in the mediterranean sea and in the waters off japan . it is the only known case of an animal capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature , colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual . like most other hydrozoans , `` t. dohrnii '' begin life as free-swimming tiny larvae known as a planula . as a planula settles down , it gives rise to a colony of polyps that are attached to the sea-floor . jellyfish , also known as medusae , bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form . eventually they become sexually mature . all the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones . `` turritopsis dohrnil '' is a species of jellyfish that apparently does not die of natural causes , because it can revert to the juvenile stage from the adult stage . however , it is not actually immortal . most `` turritopsis '' are likely to be eaten by predators or die from disease in the adult stage .
