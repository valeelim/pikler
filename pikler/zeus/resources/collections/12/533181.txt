Wernicke's area    wernicke 's area wernicke 's area is an area of the brain . it is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex linked to speech ( the other is broca 's area ) . it is involved in the production of written and spoken language . it is in brodmann area 22 , in the dominant cerebral hemisphere . the dominant hemisphere is the left in about 95 % of right handed individuals , and 60 % of left handed individuals . as with broca 's area , wernicke 's area was discovered by autopsies of patients who had speech difficulties . carl wernicke , a german neurologist , had a patient who could speak quite well , but was unable to understand the speech of others . after the patient 's death , wernicke found damage to an area at the upper portion of the temporal lobe , just behind the auditory cortex . he thought , correctly , that this area was responsible for speech comprehension . this kind of aphasia is known as wernicke 's aphasia , or receptive aphasia . despite the fact that broca 's and wernicke 's areas are in different lobes , they are quite near each other . they are connected by a tract of nerves called the `` arcuate fascilicus '' , and by another recently discovered tract .
