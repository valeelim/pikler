Mind control wasp     hymenoepimecis argyraphaga is a costa rican parasitoid wasp whose host is the spider `` plesiometa argyra '' . the wasp modifies the spider 's web building behavior to make a web of very strong lines . this supports the wasp 's cocoon without breaking in the rain . the adult female wasp temporarily paralyzes the spider and lays an egg on its abdomen . the egg hatches into a larva . the larva sucks the spider 's blood through small holes , while the spider goes on about its normal web building and insect catching behavior . when the larva is ready to pupate , it injects a chemical into the spider . this causes the spider to build a web whose design is completely different from any it has ever made . then the spider sits still in the middle of the web . the wasp larva then moults , kills the spider with a poison and sucks its body dry before discarding it and building a cocoon that hangs from the middle of the web the spider has just built . the larva pupates inside the cocoon , then emerges to mate and begin the cycle over again .
