Shielding effect     shielding is when an electron becomes less attracted to an atom the further it is away from the nucleus . this is because the forces holding atoms together become weaker as distance increases . in a reactive metal like sodium , the single electron on an electron shell furthest from the nucleus is more likely to be lost in a reaction with another element . this is because less energy is needed to pull them away . other elements with similar properties like potassium that are lower down on the periodic table than sodium will be even more likely to lose their furthest electron in a reaction . this is because of the addition of more electron shells between the nucleus and the furthest electron , increasing distance . the shielding effect also happens with elements that have many electrons on their furthest electron shell , for example chlorine . in this case however , more energy is needed to give the atom an electron . the amount of energy needed is increased with the number electron shells around the nucleus of the atom , for example in elements further down the periodic table like bromine .
