Popular sovereignty in the United States     popular sovereignty was a political doctrine in the united states that held that the people who lived in a state or region should decide what kind of government or laws they should have . it allowed settlers of a territory to decide for themselves on the question of slavery without any interference from the federal government . during 19th century it was a compromise used to determine if a western territory or new state would accept or reject slavery within its borders . it was first promoted in the 1840s . stephen douglas , one of the sponsors of the kansasâ€“nebraska act inserted it in the new law as a measure to balance free states with slave states . abraham lincoln was one of those who did not agree . he thought congress should regulate federal territories . the act was passed but popular sovereignty proved to have deadly consequences . when kansas was being considered for statehood , there was a rush by both people who were for and against slavery to go to kansas and vote on the issue of slavery . this resulted in a great deal of fraud and violence . it led directly to bleeding kansas , the bloody border war over slavery .
