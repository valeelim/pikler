Threshing     threshing is the process of separating the edible part of cereal grain ( or other crop ) from the scaly , inedible chaff that surrounds it . it is the step in grain processing after harvesting and before winnowing . early threshing methods removed some of the bran but modern methods do not . threshing may be done by beating the grain using a flail on a threshing floor . another traditional method of threshing is to make donkeys or oxen walk in circles on the grain on a hard surface . < br >
