Thrombolite     thrombolites are ancient types of microbial communities that photosynthesize . they are similar to stromatolites , but they are formed differently . stromatolites are clearly layered , but thrombolites are not . they are `` clotted accretionary structures '' . they formed in shallow water by the trapping , holding , and cementing sedimentary grains by microorganisms , especially cyanobacteria . they were common in the cambrian and early ordovician , and few examples still exist today .
