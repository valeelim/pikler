Price elasticity of demand     in economics , the price elasticity of demand ( ped or e ) is a measure to show the responsiveness ( or elasticity ) of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in its price , ceteris paribus . it is also known as the percentage change in quantity demanded for a good or service for a percentage change in the price of the same good or service . in short , the price elasticity of demand is given by the following formula : formula_1 as the price and the quantity demanded of a good are inversely related ( i.e . an increase in price will always cause a decrease in quantity demanded and vice versa ) , the sign of ped is always negative . hence , economists tend to just ignore the sign and compare the absolute values instead . in absolute terms , if the percentage change in the price is more than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded , the elasticity value is greater than one and the demand for the good is price elastic . likewise , if the percentage change in the price is less than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded , the elasticity value is smaller than one and the demand for the good is price inelastic .
