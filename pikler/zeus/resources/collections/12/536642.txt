Gregg v. Georgia     gregg v. georgia , `` proffitt v. florida '' , `` jurek v. texas '' , `` woodson v. north carolina '' , and `` roberts v. louisiana '' , were a group of landmark cases that the united states supreme court decided together in 1976. they had to do with capital punishment in the united states . in these cases , the court ruled that the states could use capital punishment ( the death penalty ) , but only if they followed certain rules . if the states did not follow these rules when they sentenced people to death , they would be violating the constitution of the united states by giving out a cruel and unusual punishment . in 1972 , the court had ruled that the way georgia was using the death penalty was unconstitutional . after this decision , all of the states stopped using the death penalty while they changed their capital punishment laws . because of this , there were no executions in the united states between 1972 and 1976. however , in `` gregg v. georgia '' , the court ruled that georgia 's new death penalty law was constitutional , and they gave the state permission to execute troy leon gregg . this ended the temporary stop on executions in the united states . it made it clear to the states that as long as they followed the rules set out in the `` gregg '' decision , they could start using the death penalty again .
