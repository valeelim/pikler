Methods of computing square roots     there are a numbers of ways to calculate square roots of numbers , and even more ways to estimate them . the mathematical operation of finding a root is the opposite operation of exponentiation , and therefore involves a similar but reverse thought process . firstly , one needs to know how precise the result is expected to be . this is because often square roots are irrational . for example , square root of a nice round whole number 28 is a fraction which in its decimal notation has infinite length , and therefore it is impossible to express it exactly : formula_1 moreover , for some real numbers the square root is a complex number . for example , square root of -4 is a complex number 2 '' i '' : formula_2 in many cases there may be multiple valid answers . for example , square root of 4 is 2 , but -2 is also a valid answer . one can verify that they are both valid answers by squaring each candidate answer and checking if you obtain 4 as the result of verification : formula_3 formula_4
