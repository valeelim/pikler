Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution     the seventh amendment ( amendment vii ) to the united states constitution is part of the bill of rights . this amendment codifies the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases . it also stops courts from overturning a jury 's verdict . the seventh amendment 's provision for jury trials in civil cases has never been incorporated ( applied to the states ) . however , the rights to civil jury trials are found in nearly every state constitution . the prohibition of overturning a jury 's verdict applies to federal cases , state cases involving federal law , and to review of state cases by federal courts . `` united states v. wonson '' ( 1812 ) established the `` historical test '' , which interpreted the amendment as relying on english common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil lawsuit . the amendment thus does not guarantee trial by jury in cases under maritime law , in lawsuits against the government itself , and for many parts of patent claims . in all other cases , the jury can be waived by consent of the parties . the amendment also guarantees a minimum of six members for a jury in a civil trial .
