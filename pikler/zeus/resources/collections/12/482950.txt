Defragmentation     when file systems store a file , they usually try to store the whole file in one part . when the disk drive fills up , finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult . in such a case , the file systems will split the file into parts , and store each part at a different location on the disk . this process is known as fragmentation . fragmentation occurs because the different parts are not stored next to one another . when the file is read , it has to be assembled from the different locations . files that are stored in one part can be read faster . defragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts , so that they are stored next to each other . this is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk . defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives . to read each part , the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored . the problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases , the file system can not be changed while it is in progress . for that reason , defragmentation should not be done , when it can be avoided .
