Prosimian     prosimians are a group of proto-primates . it includes all living and extinct strepsirrhines ( lemurs , lorises , and adapiforms ) , as well as the haplorhine tarsiers and their extinct relatives , the omomyiforms . they have characteristics that are more `` primitive '' ( ancestral or plesiomorphic ) than those of simians ( monkeys , apes , and humans ) . prosimians are a paraphyletic group and not a clade ( a group of an ancestor and all its descendants ) . tarsiers share a more recent common ancestor with all simians than with the strepsirrhines . consequently , the term `` prosimian '' is no longer an official term in taxonomy . it is still used to compare their behaviour with that of other primates . prosimians are the only primates native to madagascar , but are also found throughout africa and in asia .
