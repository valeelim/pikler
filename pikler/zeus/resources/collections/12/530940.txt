Material property     in science , a property is anything that describes a material or substance . it is a characteristic of that material . for example , how hard the material is , its colour , or its shape . elasticity is a property of rubber ; in other words : rubber is elastic . a property may be a constant ( always the same ) or it may only appear when something changes , such as temperature . chemical properties include things like surface tension , ph , reactivity , allotropy . conductivity is how able a material is to transport electric charge or heat . other examples . - ductility , how easy it is to stretch a material - flammability , how easily a material will catch fire - luminosity , how bright an object is - malleability , how easy it is to re-shape a material without damaging it - permeability , how dense a magnetic field would be if current passes through it - tensile strength , how much force must be applied to a material to break it - viscosity , how thick a fluid is related pages . - physical property
