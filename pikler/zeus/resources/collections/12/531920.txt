Incorporation of the Bill of Rights     the incorporation of the bill of rights ( also called incorporation for short ) is the process by which american courts have applied portions of the u.s. bill of rights to the states . this has been done through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment . before 1925 , the bill of rights was held only to apply to the federal government . under the incorporation doctrine , most provisions of the bill of rights now also apply to the state and local governments . prior to the ratification of the fourteenth amendment and what became the incorporation doctrine , the supreme court in 1833 held in `` barron v. baltimore '' that the bill of rights applied only to the federal government , not the states . even years after the ratification of the fourteenth amendment , the supreme court in `` united states v. cruikshank '' ( 1876 ) still held that the first and second amendment did not apply to state governments . however , beginning in the 1920s , a series of supreme court decisions interpreted the fourteenth amendment to `` incorporate '' most portions of the bill of rights , making these portions , for the first time , enforceable against the state governments . this process has been called selective incorporation .
