Marasmus     marasmus is a form of malnutrition . it happens in people ( especially children ) who do not get enough food . a healthy person gets energy from eating food , especially foods with protein and fat in them . because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food , they do not get the energy they need to survive . this is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories . generally , this disease when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births . lean and weak , swelling limbs , less developed muscles , dry skin , diarrhoea , etc.. , are the symptoms of this disease . children with marasmus look emaciated ( very skinny ) . this is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and muscles to make energy . the child 's body weight will be less than 60 % of a normal child his or her age . marasmus can be treated . however , about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they can not get treatment where they live . the word “ marasmus ” comes from the greek word μαρασμός `` marasmos '' ( meaning `` decay `` )
