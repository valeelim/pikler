Differential (mechanical device)    differential ( mechanical device ) a differential is a mechanical device made up of several gears . it is used in almost all mechanized four-wheel vehicles . it is used to transmit the power from the driveshaft to the drive wheels . its main function is to allow the drive wheels to turn at different rpms allowing the wheels to go around corners while still receiving power from the engine . different types . - an open differential ( od ) is the most common type . it is also the least expensive . an open differential allows the vehicle to go around corners without dragging the outside wheel . however , power is transferred to the wheel with the least amount of traction ( grip on the road ) . if that wheel is on ice or other slippery surfaces , the vehicle will not move forward and the wheel with the power will simply spin . in vehicles with two-wheel drive , if they have an open differential in effect they have only a single drive wheel . in four-wheel drive vehicles using open differentials ( usually standard from the factory ) , only one wheel on each axle powers the vehicle . advantages include seldom breaking an axle , less tire wear , and they are free as most new vehicles come with open differentials .
