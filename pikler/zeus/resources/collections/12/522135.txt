Orbital resonance     orbital resonance is a resonance of two orbiting bodies exerting a regular , periodic gravitational effect on each other . their orbital periods may be related by a ratio of two small integers . it is caused by the changing gravitational forces of bodies which go round each other . the stability of the solar system was first investigated by laplace , and there is still much that is not known about it . as a satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other , the gravitaional forces can change , sometimes hugely . this is partly because orbits are usually ellipses , not circular , and so the forces change accordingly . also , the planets and stars are usually not spherical . they spin , and vary in their degree of oblateness . this also changes the forces on an orbiting body . in particular , the forces may be unstable , so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable ( do not change with time ) . satellites often end up with one face towards their planet , because that is the most stable position ( tidal locking ) . there are other stability effects . gaps in saturn 's rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions . in the rings of saturn , the cassini division is a gap between the inner b ring and the outer a ring . it was cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon mimas . there is a stability ratio for neptune and pluto : the 2:3 ratio means pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes neptune to complete three .
