Corona     a corona is an aura of plasma which surrounds the sun and other stars . the sun 's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse . it is also observable with a device called a coronagraph . the word `` corona '' is a latin word meaning `` crown '' , from the ancient greek κορώνη ( korōnē , “ garland , wreath ” ) . the sun 's corona is much hotter ( by a factor from 150 to 450 ) than the visible surface of the sun . the photosphere 's average temperature is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona 's one to three million kelvin . the corona is 10 times as dense as the photosphere , and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light . the corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow chromosphere . the exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate . the outer edges of the sun 's corona are constantly being blown away by the open magnetic flux generating the solar wind .
