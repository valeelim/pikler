Intracranial hemorrhage     an intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain . ( `` intracranial '' means `` inside the skull '' ; `` hemorrhage '' means `` dangerous bleeding '' ) . the most dangerous type of stroke , a hemorrhagic stroke , is a type of intracranial hemorrhage . it is a bleed in the brain that happens when the brain has not been injured . when blood vessels in the brain break or are injured , they bleed . bleeding in the brain is very dangerous , because if enough blood builds up , the blood can squeeze or crush the brain . it can also make it impossible for oxygen to get past the blood to parts of the brain . without oxygen , these parts of the brain will die . bleeding in the brain can happen for two reasons . it can happen because of a head injury . a bad head injury can break some of the blood vessels in the brain . bleeding in the brain can also happen when blood vessels in the brain break without being injured . for example , this may happen when a cerebral aneurysm bursts . the three most common types of bleeding problems in the brain are epidural hematomas , subdural hematomas , and subarachnoid hemorrhages . these happen in different parts of the meninges ( the layers that cover the brain ) .
