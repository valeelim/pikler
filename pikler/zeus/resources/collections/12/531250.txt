Stromule     a stromule is a microscopic structure found in plant cells . stromules ( stroma-filled tubules ) are highly dynamic structures extending from the surface of all plastids , including chloroplasts . protrusions from and interconnections between plastids were seen in 1888 and 1908 , and have been described from time to time in the literature since then . stromules were recently rediscovered in 1997. they exist in a number of angiosperm species including `` arabidopsis thaliana '' , wheat , rice and tomato , but their role is not yet fully understood .
