3D0 Interactive Multiplayer     the 3do interactive multiplayer ( often just called the 3do ) is a video game console invented by the 3do company . it was created by trip hawkins , the man who created electronic arts . the 3do was not built by the company itself . they had a list of instructions that other companies could use to build their own . panasonic made the first models in 1993 , and other types of the machine were sold in 1994 by sanyo and goldstar . many good things were said about it when it was created , including being named time magazine 's `` 1993 product of the year '' . it also had many technologies that were new and advanced . but the 3do cost more money than the video game consoles that were already popular . this meant more people bought consoles from sega or nintendo instead of the 3d0 . because of this , no more 3d0s were made after 1996 .
