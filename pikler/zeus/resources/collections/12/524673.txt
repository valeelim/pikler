GMC Envoy     gmc envoy is a midsize suv sold by the gmc division of general motors . it was introduced in 1998. in 2002 the envoy was improved and rode on the same chassisas the new chevrolet trailblazer . the envoy was later given an extended wheelbase . in 2004 it was given a trim package called xuv . this was an envoy xl with no third row seating and a retractable roof over the cargo bay . this was an attempt to make it both an suv and a pickup truck . the resulting odd-looking envoy xuv did not sell well . 2009 was the last model year for the envoy . it had daytime running lights , electronic stability control , anti-lock brakes and a rollover sensor that automatically deployed the side curtain air bags . it was replaced by the gmc terrain .
