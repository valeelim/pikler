Radical Republican     the radical republicans were a political faction of american politicians within the republican party . they existed from 1854 until the end of reconstruction in 1877. they called themselves `` radicals '' . they were opposed during the war by the moderate republicans ( led by abraham lincoln ) . one of the fears of the radicals was that if northern and southern democrats came back together again as they had before the civil war the republican party would no longer be the dominant political party . in 1854 , the republican party was formed as a result of the kansasâ€“nebraska act . the act split the whig party in two . the northern whigs united with the members of the free soil party . together with the know-nothing party they formed the republican party . between its formation in 1854 and 1861 , the republican party had many different factions or groups . it had attracted been whigs , anti-slavery democrats , , know-nothings , and abolitionists . but by the start of the civil war it had been reduced to just three factions : conservatives , moderates and radicals .
