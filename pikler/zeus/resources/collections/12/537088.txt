In re Gault     in re gault , , was a landmark case decided by the supreme court of the united states in 1967. the court ruled that juveniles ( children and teenagers ) have the same rights as adults when they are accused of a crime . for example , they have due process rights , like the right to have a lawyer , when they are being questioned by the police , and when they are on trial . the court 's ruling in this case was so important for children 's rights that justice earl warren said it would become `` the magna carta for juveniles . '' in the four years before the supreme court decided `` in re : gault '' , the court also decided some other very important cases about due process rights the rights people have when they are accused of a crime . however , these rulings did not apply to children who were being tried in juvenile courts . the case was argued by norman dorsen in favor of the juveniles . the sixth amendment to the united states constitution says that `` in all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to ... the assistance of counsel for his defence . '' ( `` counsel '' is a legal word for `` lawyer . '' )
