William Astbury     william thomas astbury frs ( bill astbury , 25 february 1898 , longton – 4 june 1961 , leeds ) was an english physicist and molecular biologist . astbury made early x-ray diffraction studies of biological molecules . his work on keratin helped linus pauling discover the alpha helix . he also studied the structure for dna in 1937 and made the first step in working out its structure . in 1937 torbjörn caspersson of sweden sent him well-prepared samples of dna from calf thymus . the fact that dna produced a diffraction pattern showed it had a regular structure . astbury reported that dna 's structure repeated every 2.7 nanometres and that the bases lay flat , stacked , 0.34 nanometres apart . at a symposium in 1938 at cold spring harbor , astbury pointed out that the 0.34 nanometre spacing was the same as amino acids in polypeptide chains . actually , the spacing of the bases in the b-form of dna is 0.332 nm . in 1946 astbury presented a paper at a symposium in cambridge in which he said : `` biosynthesis is supremely a question of fitting molecules or parts of molecules against another ... one of the great biological developments of our time is the realisation that probably the most fundamental interaction of all is that between the proteins and the nucleic acids '' . he also said that the spacing between the nucleotides and the spacing of amino acids in proteins `` was not an arithmetical accident '' .
