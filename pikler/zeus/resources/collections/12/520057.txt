William Benjamin Carpenter     william benjamin carpenter md mrcs cb frs ( 29 october 1813 â€“ 19 november 1885 ) was an english physician , invertebrate zoologist and physiologist . he was instrumental in the early stages of the unified university of london . carpenter was born on 29 oct 1813 in exeter , the eldest son of dr lant carpenter , an important unitarian preacher who influenced a `` rising generation of unitarian intellectuals '' . from his father , carpenter inherited a belief in the essential lawfulness of the creation : this meant that natural causes were the explanation of the world as we find it . william embraced this `` naturalistic cosmogeny '' as his starting point . although qualified medically , he was best known for his work on marine zoology , notably the lower organisms such as foraminifera and crinoids . these researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration , such as the 1868 oceanographic survey with `` hms lightning '' and later the more famous challenger expedition . in the long term , however , he has become known as a founder of idea of the adaptive unconscious . he observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness . these same observations were also made by hermann helmholtz . perhaps because these views were in conflict with the theories of descartes , they were neglected for a hundred years . carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought , the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness . he noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious .
