Keflavík     keflavík ( meaning `` driftwood bay '' ) is a town in the suðurnes region in southwest iceland . in 2009 its population was at 8,169 people . in 1995 , the town merged with njarðvík and hafnir to form the reykjanesbær municipality . the town was founded in the 16th century , possibly by scottish people . like many other icelandic towns , the city grew with the help of the fishing industry . the city then continued to grow from flight operations done at the keflavík international airport ( which was built by the united states during world war ii ) . the airport used to be an important nato military base and refueling stop for trans-atlantic flights . it is now iceland 's main airport . the airport was also used during the cold war to monitor marine and submarine traffic from the atlantic ocean . the base was officially closed on 30 september 2006 , when the united states withdrew the remaining 30 military personnel . in iceland , keflavík was known for being a rich source of musicians during the 1960s and 70s , and is therefore also known as `` bítlabærinn '' or `` the beatle town '' .
