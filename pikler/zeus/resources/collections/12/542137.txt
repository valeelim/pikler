Gullah     the gullah ( also called geechee ) are the descendants of african slaves who lived in the lowcountry regions of georgia and south carolina . they lived on the mainland and on the sea islands . the gullah region used to include what is now florida , georgia , south carolina , and north carolina , but today the gullah area is only in georgia and south carolina . the gullah were able to keep parts of their african culture , but were also influenced by north american culture . the gullah people speak a creole language that is based on english , but has many african loanwords . the name `` gullah '' may come from angola , where the ancestors of some gullah people likely came from . they created a new culture from the numerous african peoples brought into charleston and south carolina . other scholars think that it came from the name of other ethnic groups in africa . along the western coast of africa , the people had cultivated african rice for 3,000 years . when british colonial planters discovered that rice would grow in the american south , they wanted enslaved africans from this region . africans were taken as slaves from the western region of africa ( in what is today sierra leone ) , transported to the americas , and were traded in charlestowne , south carolina . these african farmers brought their skills for farming and irrigation .
