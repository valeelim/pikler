Electoral fraud     electoral fraud or vote rigging is any alteration or changing the vote count in election . acts of fraud affect vote counts to bring about an election result . this can be by increasing the vote share of one candidate or lowering the vote count of another . it can also be a person casting more than one vote when only one vote is permitted . this is called ballot-box stuffing . what defines electoral fraud under law varies from country to country . many kinds of election fraud are outlawed in specific electoral laws . other kinds violate general laws , such as those banning assault , harassment or libel . technically the term 'electoral fraud ' covers only those acts which are illegal . generally the term is sometimes used to describe acts which are legal but considered morally unacceptable , outside the spirit of electoral laws , or in violation of the principles of democracy . in national elections , successful electoral fraud can have the effect of a coup d'Ã©tat or corruption of democracy . in a narrow election a small amount of fraud may be enough to change the result . even if the outcome is not affected , fraud can still have a damaging effect if not punished . for example , it can reduce voters ' confidence in democracy . even the perception of fraud can be damaging . fraudulent elections can lead to the breakdown of democracy and the establishment or ratification of a dictatorship .
