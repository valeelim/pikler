Radiography     radiography is the name for the use of x-rays to see what is happening to parts of the body . it is an imaging technique which uses electromagnetic radiation other than light , usually x-rays . to create the image , a beam of x-rays is produced by an x-ray machine and is projected toward the object . a certain amount of x-ray is absorbed by the object , which is dependent on the density and composition of that object . the x-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector ( either photographic film or a digital detector ) . the detector gives a superimposed 2d representation of the object 's internal structures . tomography is a more advanced technique . in tomography , the machine blurs out structures not in the focal plane . this gives a series of pictures , like a set of slices through the body . it is called ct scanning , or computer tomography . the computer builds a 3-d picture for the expert to look at . radiography has many medical and industrial uses .
