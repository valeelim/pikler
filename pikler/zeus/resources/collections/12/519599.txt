Pseudogene     pseudogenes are genes that have lost their function . they have lost their gene expression in the cell or their ability to code protein . the term was coined in 1977. pseudogenes can result from mutations in a gene whose product is not needed for the survival of the organism . although not protein-coding , the dna of pseudogenes may be functional . it may be similar to other kinds of non-coding dna which have a regulatory role . most have some gene-like features . they lack protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations , or their inability to encode rna ( such as with rrna pseudogenes ) . pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome , so they are often labeled as junk dna . pseudogenes contain fascinating biological and evolutionary histories in their sequences . this is due to a pseudogene 's shared ancestry with a functional gene . in the same way that darwin thought of two species as having a shared common ancestry followed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence ( see speciation ) , a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years .
