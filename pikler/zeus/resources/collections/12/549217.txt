Rifling     rifling consists of spiral grooves cut into the inside of a barrel of a gun . it causes the bullet or projectile to spin as it flies through the air . this greatly improves the accuracy of the bullet over longer distances . the first muskets to use this technology were called rifles . barrels are rifled using a left or right twist . the number of turns per inch is called the `` twist rate '' . these are expressed as a ratio . for example , a 1:7 twist means the bullet will turn once for each seven inches of barrel length . as a general rule , the heavier the bullet , the higher the twist rate . gaspard kollner , a 15th century gunmaker in vienna , is thought by many to have invented rifling . others think it was augustus kotter of nuremberg who invented rifling in about 1520. at about that same time some crossbows fired a bolt ( short heavy arrow ) through a tube with spiral grooving . this gave the bolt more stability in flight . whether these were used before rifling in gun barrels is not certain .
