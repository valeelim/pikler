Clinamen     clinamen is the word lucretius gave to the unpredictable swerve of atoms . he means that these atoms do n't just fall down , but because of the swerve collisions happen . lucretius wrote that without this slight swerve ( atoms ) would `` fall like raindrops and never touch and the world would have never been made '' . lucretius was the first to write about chaos theory .
