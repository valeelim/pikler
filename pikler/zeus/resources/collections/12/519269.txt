Reasonable doubt     evidence that is beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard of evidence required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems . generally , the prosecutor has the burden of proof and is required to prove their case to this standard . this means that the version of events being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no `` reasonable doubt '' in the mind of a `` reasonable person '' that the defendant is guilty . there can still be a doubt , but only to the extent that it would `` not '' affect a reasonable person 's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty . beyond `` the shadow of a doubt '' is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt . but this term extends beyond the latter , to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard . the term `` reasonable doubt '' is most commonly used . if doubt `` does '' affect a `` reasonable person 's '' belief that the defendant is guilty , then the jury is not satisfied beyond `` reasonable doubt '' . the precise meaning of words such as `` reasonable '' and `` doubt '' are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country . a related idea is william blackstone 's formulation : `` it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer '' .
