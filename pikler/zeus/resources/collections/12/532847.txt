CAGE questionnaire     the cage questionnaire is a set of four questions about a person 's drinking habits . it is commonly used to test adults for alcoholism . because it is so short , doctors often start by using the cage questionnaire when they suspect that a patient may be an alcoholic . people can also do the cage questionnaire on their own . `` cage '' is an acronym for the four questions in the test . the four questions in the cage questionnaire are : if a person answers `` yes '' to a question , they score one point for that question . if they answer `` no '' to a question , they score a 0. if a person scores 2 or more - meaning they answered `` yes '' to at least two of the four questions - they are likely to have a problem with alcohol . scoring 2 or more on the cage does not automatically mean that a person is an alcoholic . however , it does mean that they need more testing to see if they are an alcoholic . the most important question is the last one . if a person needs a drink in the morning to feel better , it means they are having alcohol withdrawal symptoms . this means the person 's body is dependent on alcohol . ( the person 's body is so used to having alcohol that when it does not have alcohol , even overnight , the person gets sick . ) this is one of the main signs of alcoholism .
