South Saqqara Stone     the south saqqara stone is a large piece of stone . written on the stone is a list of the pharaohs of the 6th dynasty of ancient egypt . the list includes teti , userkare , pepi i , merenre and pepi ii . the list finishes with pepi ii which means it was probably written during his rule . the list is a record of the events which took place during each kings rule . however the stone was used later as the lid of sarcophagus . this was for the burial of the ancient egyptian queen ankhenespepi . a lot of the writing can not be read any longer . the south saqqara stone was discovered in 1932-33 by gustave j√©quier . it was in a storeroom , south of the pyramid of queen iput ii . this is part of the pyramid complex of pepi ii at saqqara . saqqara was the main burial area for the city of memphis . the stone is a piece of basalt , 2.43 metres by 0.92 metres and 20 centimetres thick . it has writing on both sides , but much of the writing has been removed and is unreadable . the writing on the south saqqara stone means it is an important object . the list of pharaohs has details about the annual or biannual cattle count . this matches details in other lists such as the turin king list . this allows archaeologists to work out how long each king ruled . from the information on the stone it can be worked out that teti ruled for at least 12 years , userkare 2-4 years , pepi i 49-50 years and 11-13 years for merenre .
