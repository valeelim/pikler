Spread spectrum     spread spectrum is a method in radio and other kinds of telecommunication . its purpose is to overcome interference , noise and jamming of signals . sending electromagnetic signals through the air became possible in the later 19th century with wireless telegraphy . the fact that signals were affected by natural interference was soon discovered . by the early 1900s , wireless telegraphy could cross the atlantic . intercepting the enemy 's radio communications and interfering with their transmission was important in world war ii . messages in code were intercepted and recorded for decryption and translation . not only can radio signals be detected , but those listening can be detected , since radio receivers also emit a signal . above all , since radio direction-finding is widely used in civil and military aviation , ways are needed to reduce interference with these transmissions . the main method is spread spectrum . spread spectrum systems transmit the message using a bandwidth that is wider than the bandwidth actually needed by the message signal . this spreading of the transmitted signal over a large bandwidth make the resulting wideband signal appear as a noise signal . this resists intentional and unintentional interference with the transmitted signal .
