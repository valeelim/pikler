Musa     musa is one of two or three genera in the family musaceae ; it includes bananas and plantains . around 70 species of `` musa '' are known , with a broad variety of uses . many bananas and plantains grow as high as trees , but they are not woody . their apparent `` stem '' is made up of the bases of the huge leaf stalks . for this reason , they are technically gigantic herbs . `` musa '' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera species , including the giant leopard moth and other `` hypercompe '' species , including `` h. albescens '' ( only recorded on `` musa '' ) , `` h. eridanus '' , and `` h. icasia '' .
