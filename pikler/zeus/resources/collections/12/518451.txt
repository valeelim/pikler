Gleipnir     in norse mythology , gleipnir was the third chain used to tie up fenrir , the wolf . fenrir was the son of loki and angrboða , the giantess . the first two chains , named lædingr and dromi , were forged by thor and did not hold him . gleipnir was created by the sons of ivaldi and did hold fenrir . it was as thin as spider 's silk . gleipnir was made from six things : - the sound of a cat 's step - the beard of a woman - the roots of a mountain - the spittle of a bird . - a fish 's breath - the sinews of a bear . the gods lured fenrir to the island of lyngvi . they challenged him to be bound by gleipnir . to show fenrir it was no trick , týr put his hand in fenrir 's mouth . when he could not break gleipnir 's grip on him fenrir bit off týr 's hand . fenrir was to remain bound by gleipnir until ragnarök ( the final great battle of the gods ) .
