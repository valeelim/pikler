Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance     carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance or csma/ca is an access method ( or protocol , or rule ) used in ethernet networks . in csma/ca , before a host sends information on the wire , it will `` sense '' to see if the wire is free of signals . if the wire is free , the host sends a piece of test data on the wire to see if it collides with other data . if the test data does not collide , the host goes on to send the real data on the wire .
