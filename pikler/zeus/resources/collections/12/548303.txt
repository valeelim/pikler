Battle of Chancellorsville     the battle of chancellorsville ( april 30 to may 6 , 1863 ) was a major battle in the american civil war . it is generally considered to be confederate general robert e. lee â€™ s greatest victory over the union army . but the confederate victory was lessened by the loss of lieutenant general stonewall jackson . jackson was shot and mortally wounded by his own men who mistook the general and his staff for union cavalry . for this reason lee 's win at chancellorsville was considered a pyrrhic victory . after the battle of fredericksburg the union army was in a state of confusion . the army of the potomac was commanded by major general ambrose burnside . but his generals were in near open revolt against burnside feeling he was unfit to command . burnside even seemed to agree with them . he had refused command of the army of the potomac twice saying he was not up to the job . finally , president abraham lincoln agreed and replaced burnside with general joseph hooker . hooker managed to restore the health and morale of his army within a few weeks . he proudly called them `` the finest army on the planet .
