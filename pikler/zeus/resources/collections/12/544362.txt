Interrupt     an interrupt is when a microprocessor does something that it is not told to do because of things that happen outside what the program is supposed to do . interrupts happen most often because the processor gets a signal from hardware , but they can also come from software that is running along with the program . among the many things can cause interrupts are pressing keys on a keyboard , the built-in timer going off , a data transfer taking place , or any other event that needs an action from the processor right away . interrupts can happen at any time while the processor is running a program , no matter where in the program 's source code it is . a hardware or software call for an interrupt ( known as an `` interrupt request '' , or irq ) is taken care of by an `` interrupt handler '' or `` interrupt service routine '' ( isr ) in the processor . it puts what is it doing at the time onto a stack and then follows certain instructions that does a given task on behalf of the system , which does not have to be part of the program it does . once it is done following the instructions , the isr then takes back what it put on the stack and continues with what it was doing before the interrupt happened .
