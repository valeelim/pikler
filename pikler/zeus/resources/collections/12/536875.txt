Caldwell catalogue     the caldwell catalogue is an astronomical catalogue of 109 objects . it includes star clusters , nebulae , and galaxies for observation by amateur astronomers . the list was compiled by patrick moore as a complement to the messier catalogue . the messier catalogue is used by amateur astronomers as a list of deep-sky objects for observation . however , it was not compiled for that purpose . it does not include many of the sky 's brightest deep-sky objects , such as the hyades , the double cluster ( ngc 869 and ngc 884 ) , and the sculptor galaxy ( ngc 253 ) . the messier catalogue was compiled as a list of known objects that might be confused with comets . as messier got his list from observations in paris , it did not include bright deep-sky objects visible in the southern hemisphere , such as omega centauri , centaurus a , the jewel box , and 47 tucanae . so moore compiled a list of 109 objects â€“ to match the accepted number of messier objects . the list was published in `` sky & telescope '' in december 1995 .
