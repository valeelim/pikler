Great Stink     the great stink was in central london in july and august 1858. during hot weather the smell of untreated faeces was overpowering . it was caused by untreated human waste in the river thames , and on its banks . an ageing and inadequate sewer system emptied directly into the thames . the bad air was thought to transmit contagious diseases . there were three outbreaks of cholera before the great stink was blamed on the problems with the river . a proposal from the civil engineer joseph bazalgette for sewage treatment was finally accepted .
