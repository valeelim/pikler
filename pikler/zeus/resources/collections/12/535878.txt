History of the United States Constitution     the history of the united states constitution is a history of how the government of the united states functions , its rule of law and the rights guaranteed to its citizens . it was signed by the delegates to the constitutional convention in philadelphia on september 17 , 1787. it replaced the articles of confederation , that served as new nation 's first constitution . the government under the articles proved to be weak and inefficient . when the convention was called to meet in philadelphia on may 25 , 1787 , most of the members were aware a new stronger government was necessary . the history of the ( second ) constitution of the united states begins with the history behind the creation of the articles of confederation , the first constitution . the articles of confederation were , in effect , a loose confederation that joined together thirteen independent states to mainly deal with foreign policy . for all other purposes they remained sovereign states . the greatest weakness of the articles of confederation is that it had no direct connection to the people themselves . it recognized state sovereignty . each state collected its own taxes , provided its own militia and printed its own currency . a weak congress was the chief instrument in the new government . there was no executive branch . the recent tyranny suffered under britain 's king george iii made the new country 's leaders wary of a strong central government . in congress , each state only had one vote . states with small populations had the same voting rights as states ten times their size . amending the articles required a unanimous vote , which was virtually impossible with thirteen states each having their own interests .
