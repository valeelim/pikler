Cochineal     the cochineal ( `` dactylopius '' `` coccus '' ) is a scale insect in the suborder sternorrhyncha , from which the natural dye carmine is made . the insect lives in tropical and subtropical south america , mexico and arizona . its larvae eat cacti in the genus `` opuntia '' , feeding on plant moisture and nutrients . these insects are found on the pads of prickly pear cacti , then are brushed off and dried . the insect produces carminic acid , which deters predation by other insects . carminic acid is extracted from the body and eggs , then mixed with aluminium or calcium salts to make carmine dye , also known as cochineal . today , carmine is primarily used as a colorant in food and in lipstick .
