Ring galaxy     a ring galaxy is a kind of galaxy that has a ring shape . hoag 's object and ngc 1291 are two examples . the ring is made up of many massive , young blue stars , which are extremely bright . the middle of the galaxy contains far less luminous matter . some astronomers believe that ring galaxies are formed when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy . because galaxies are mostly made up of empty space , a collision rarely happens between stars . however , the gravitational disruptions could cause a wave of star formation to move through the larger galaxy . other astronomers think that rings are formed around some galaxies when an accretion disc is formed . star formation would then result from the shocks and compressions in the newly formed disc .
