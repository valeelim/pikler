Tube feet     tube feet are small tube-like projections on the underside ( oral side ) of echinoderms . they are part of the water vascular system of echinoderms . tube feet are used to move , feed and respiration . they are arranged in grooves along the arms . they operate through hydraulic pressure . they are used to pass food to the oral mouth at the center , and can attach to surfaces . tube feet allow these animals to stick to the ocean floor and move slowly . a sea star that is overturned simply turns one arm over and attaches it to a solid surface , and levers itself the right way up . tube feet are used by starfish are used to open up bivalve shells . the shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles . what the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet , and apply a steady pull . the starfish , with its muscles and hydraulic system , can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand . apparently , ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit . then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell . the stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm . the starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives , absorbing the nutrients . this digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell , perhaps a couple of days .
