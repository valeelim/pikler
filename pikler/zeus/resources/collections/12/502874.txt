Glyptapanteles     glyptapanteles is a genus of endoparasitoid wasp found in central and north america . the larvae of the members of `` glyptapanteles '' manipulate their hosts into serving as bodyguards . female `` glyptapanteles '' stick their ovipositor into caterpillar hosts . the eggs hatch inside the caterpillar . the caterpillar feeds and grows normally until the 4th or 5th instar . then up to 80 fully grown larvae emerge from its body to pupate . after the larvae of `` glyptapanteles '' emerge , the caterpillar takes up position near the cocoons of the pupae , arches its back , and ceases to move or feed . it will occasionally spin silk over the pupae . however , when disturbed , it begins to thrash violently . this behavior is to strike at and repel possible predators of the pupae , so improving the survival odds of the wasp pupae . only about one in twenty non-parasitized caterpillars responded in this fashion . in 60 % of cases , the parasitized caterpillars successfully warded off these potential predators . no longer eating , the affected caterpillar eventually dies .
