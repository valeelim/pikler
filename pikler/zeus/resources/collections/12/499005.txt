Peat swamp forest     peat swamp forests are forest wetlands in tropical and subtropical areas . they have poor drainage , and waterlogged soil prevents dead leaves and wood from fully decomposing . over time , this creates a thick layer of acidic peat . they are made up of trees which are broadleaved ( not conifers ) , and many other types of flowering plants . peat swamp forests are usually surrounded by lowland rain forests on better-drained soils , and by brackish or salt-water mangrove forests near the coast . these tropical swamp forests are quite different to the north temperate peat bogs in climates such as in ireland . temperate peat bogs are not caused by forests , but mostly by mosses such as `` sphagnum '' , grasses , sedges and shrubs . about 62 % of the world ’ s tropical peat lands occur 80 % in indonesia , 11 % in malaysia , 6 % in papua new guinea , with pockets in brunei , vietnam , the philippines , and thailand . they have trees up to 70 m high . the spongy , unstable , waterlogged , anaerobic beds of peat can be up to 20 m deep with low ph ( ph 2.9 – 4 ) and low nutrients . the forest floor is seasonally flooded . the water is stained dark brown by the tannins that leach from the fallen leaves and peat – hence the name ‘ blackwater swamps ’ . during the dry season , the peat remains waterlogged and pools lie among the trees .
