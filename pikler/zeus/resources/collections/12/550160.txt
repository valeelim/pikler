Recoil     recoil or kick ( sometimes incorrectly called kickback ) is the tendency of a firearm to move backwards and at the same time the muzzle of the gun to rise when fired . this is a reaction to the explosive force of a bullet leaving the barrel of a firearm . a handgun shooter feels the recoil in the hands and arms . a rifle or shotgun shooter feels most of the recoil in his or her shoulder . recoil is explained by newton â€™ s third law of motion . it is usually paraphrased as : `` to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction '' . in simpler terms , when a projectile and the hot gasses go forward , the firearm goes backwards . there are a number of factors that determine the amount of backward force . - projectile mass - the bullet , shot or shell fired from any size gun has an effect on recoil . the heavier the projectile , the more the recoil . - gun mass - the heavier the gun , the less the recoil . - speed of the projectile - the faster the bullet , shot or shell , the more the recoil . also , the recoil will happen quicker than with a low mass projectile . this is felt as a `` sharper ' recoil by the shooter .
