Rational root theorem     the rational root theorem ( or rational zero theorem ) is a proven idea in mathematics . it says that if the coefficients of a polynomial are integers , then one can find all of the possible rational roots by dividing each factor of the leading coefficient by each factor of the constant term . think about this polynomial : ax + ax + ax + … + a all of the possible rational roots are these : ±factors of a / ±factors of a this only finds the rational roots . there may be imaginary roots . other theorems , such as descartes ’ rule of signs , help find how many imaginary roots there are for a given equation . think about this polynomial : 15x + 2x – 10x + x – 8 factors of the leading coefficient are : 15 : ±1 , ±3 , ±5 , ±15 factors of the constant are : -8 : ±1 , ±2 , ±4 , ±8 possible rational roots are : ±1/1 , ±1/2 , ±1/4 , ±1/8 , ±3/1 , ±3/2 , ±3/4 , ±3/8 , ±5/1 , ±5/2 , ±5/4 , ±5/8 , ±15/1 , ±15/2 , ±15/4 , ±15/8 references . 1. larson , ron . algebra 2. evanston , il : mcdougal littell , 2007. print . 1. phillip s. jones , jack d. bedient : the historical roots of elementary mathematics . dover courier publications 1998 , isbn 0-486-25563-8 , pp . 116–117
