LGBT rights in Afghanistan     lgbt people living in afghanistan face legal and social challenges . being a homosexual , or cross-dressing ( wearing clothes usually worn by the oppposite gender ) , are serious crimes in afghan culture . punishment can include the death penalty . in rural parts of the country , local villagers take the law into their own hands and punish people . even though both society and law try to stop homosexual activities , there is a form of bisexuality ( sexual attraction to both sexes ) within mainstream afghan culture . this happens when boys are kidnapped to act as sexual slaves for adult men . this often happens in a military where there is no access to women . it also happens when an adult man gives money or gifts to young boys in return for sexual activity . these acts are accepted within islamic culture because they are not seen as being an act of lgbt identity , but rather an act of male power and dominance . the boys in these acts are forced to be the `` female '' partner in the relationship .
