Intervertebral disc     an intervertebral disc is a kind of padding between vertebrae in the vertebral column . they are shock absorbers in the spine , and are very important to the health of the spine . the disc is a fibrocartilaginous joint . it allows slight movement of the vertebrae , and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together . discs have an outer fibrous ring , made up of both type i and type ii collagen . type i is concentrated towards the edge of the ring where it provides greater strength . the fibrous intervertebral disc contains the `` nucleus pulposus '' and this helps to distribute pressure evenly across the disc . the nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel . the nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber , absorbing impacts and keeping the two vertebrae separated . it is the remnant of the notochord .
