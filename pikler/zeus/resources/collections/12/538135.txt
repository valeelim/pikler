United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda     the united nations assistance mission for rwanda ( unamir ) was created by the united nations security council in october 1993. this was just after the end of the rwandan civil war . unamir 's goals were to help put a peace agreement into place , monitor how well it was going , and support the new government . however , on april 7 , 1994 , while unamir was in rwanda , the rwandan genocide started . the genocide lasted 100 days . during that time , 800,000 people were killed ; 2 million became refugees in other countries ; another two million had to run away to different parts of rwanda ; and up to 250,000 women were raped . the unamir ended in march 1996. since the genocide , the united nations has admitted that they failed to prevent the rwandan genocide . in a genocide , many or all people in a group are killed because of their ethnicity , religion , or political opinions . in the rwandan genocide , members of an ethnic group called the tutsi ( `` abatutsi '' ) were killed because of their ethnicity . the killers were extremist members of another ethnic group called the hutu ( `` abahutu '' ) . the hutu killers also killed other hutus whose political beliefs were not as extreme as theirs .
