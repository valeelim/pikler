Batson v. Kentucky     batson v. kentucky , , was a landmark decision in which the united states supreme court ruled that a prosecutor 's use of peremptory challenges in a criminal case may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race . the court ruled that this practice violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . the case gave rise to the term `` batson challenge '' , an objection to a peremptory challenge . this is based on the standard established by the supreme court 's decision in this case . later decisions have resulted in the extension of `` batson '' to civil cases . for example , in `` edmonson v. leesville concrete company '' , the court allowed private litigants to use this challenge . the supreme court also allowed it in cases are excluded on the basis of gender as in `` j.e.b . v. alabama ex rel . t.b. '' . the principle had been established previously by several state courts , including the california supreme court in 1978 , the massachusetts supreme judicial court in 1979 and the florida supreme court in 1984 .
