Article Four of the United States Constitution     article four of the united states constitution outlines the relationship between the various states , as well as the connection between the states and the federal government . the first section requires states to recognize the `` full faith and credit '' of the public acts , records and court proceedings of other states . this clause makes certain that any judicial decisions made in courts of one state are recognized and honored in all other states . this eliminates the practice of `` forum shopping '' , the practice of having a legal case heard in the court thought most likely to provide a favorable judgment . it also prevents someone moving from one state to another to escape a judgment . in `` mills v. duryee '' ( 1813 ) , the united states supreme court ruled that the merits of a case , as settled by courts of one state , must be recognized by the courts of other states . state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state . later , chief justice john marshall suggested that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other states ' courts as final . however , in `` mcelmoyle v. cohen '' ( 1839 ) , the court heard a case where one party obtained a judgment in south carolina and sought to enforce it in georgia , which had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after a certain amount of time had passed . the court upheld georgia 's refusal to enforce the south carolina judgment . the court found that out-of-state judgments are subject to the procedural law of the states where they are enforced , notwithstanding any priority it may be given in the state in which they it was issued .
