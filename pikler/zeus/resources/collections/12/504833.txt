Minesweeper     a minesweeper is a small naval warship designed to sweep the water clear of mines . minesweepers keep oceans and rivers clear for shipping . in great britain , naval leaders knew before world war i that sea mines were a threat to the nation 's shipping . the real threat was not invasion , but blockade aided by mines . fishing nets pulled behind boats gave an idea on how to clear mines . the royal navy used fishermen and their fishing trawlers to keep the english channel clear of mines . they were supplied with mine gear , rifles , uniforms and pay as the first minesweepers . the dedicated , purpose-built minesweeper first appeared during world war i. by the end of the war , naval mine technology had grown beyond the ability of minesweepers to detect and remove . minesweeping made big advances during world war 2. fighting nations quickly adapted ships to the task of minesweeping . both allied and axis countries made heavy use of minesweepers throughout the war . underwater mines remained a problem even after the war ended , and minesweepers were still in use after japan surrendered to the united states .
