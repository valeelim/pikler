Proof-of-work system     a proof-of-work ( pow ) system is a system where finding a solution to a given problem is difficult and/or expensive , but verifying the solution to the given problem is simple and/or cheap . find the positive integer whose sha256 hash value is : to find this integer , you must compute the sha256 value for every integer starting with zero until you find the right value . while each individual computation is trivial and cheap , cumulatively the work adds up and becomes time consuming and expensive . to successfully reproduce the given hash value , you must do some work . find some data whose sha256 hash value begins with at least 8 leading zeros : in the first example , the problem required the original value as proof that work had been done . in this example , it does not matter what the data is , only that it produces a hash value with the given constraints . finding this data is difficult , but once found , it is trivial to verify by running it through sha256 .
