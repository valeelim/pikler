Small interfering RNA     small interfering rna ( sirna ) is a class of double-stranded rna molecules , 20-25 base pairs long . sirna plays many roles , but it is most notable in the rna interference ( rnai ) pathway , where it interferes with the expression of certain genes . genes are only affected if they have nucleotide sequences complementary to those of the sirna . sirna functions by breaking down mrna after transcription . this prevents translation of the gene into protein . sirna also acts in rnai-related pathways , e.g. , as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure of a genome . the complexity of these pathways is only now being worked out .
