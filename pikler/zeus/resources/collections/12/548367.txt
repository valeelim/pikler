Battle of Fredericksburg     the battle of fredericksburg ( december 11 , 1862 – december 15 , 1862 ) was a major battle in the american civil war fought at fredericksburg , virginia . the battle saw almost 200,000 men engaged—more than any other civil war battle . it involved the first major opposed river crossing in the history of the united states . after the maryland campaign and the bloody battle of antietam , the army of northern virginia under general robert e. lee retreated south into virginia . lee 's rearguard action at the battle of shepherdstown convinced union general george b. mcclellan not to follow him too closely . mcclellan , after asking twice for more reinforcements , decided it was safer to stay put and defend maryland . on october 6 , president abraham lincoln instructed mcclellan to go after the confederates in virginia . although he had 100,000 men he complained he did not have enough troops and supplies to cross into virginia . finally , at the end of october , by which time lee 's army was rested and resupplied , mcclellan slowly moved his army south . but he did not engage them . lincoln waited until after the elections of 1862 before replacing mcclellan . the president had already planned to replace mcclellan for some time . before the autumn of 1862 he had offered command of the army of the potomac to ambrose burnside twice . burnside turned lincoln down both times . finally , on november 7 , lincoln replaced mcclellan as burnside reluctantly accepted the job .
