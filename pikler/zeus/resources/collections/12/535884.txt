Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution     the twenty-sixth amendment to the united states constitution ( amendment xxvi ) lowered the minimum voting age in the united states from 21 to 18. the united states congress approved the amendment on march 23 , 1971 , and sent it to the states to be ratified . within three months and eight days , the states had ratified the amendment , and it became part of the constitution . this was the quickest amendment to be ratified in united states history . lowering the minimum voting age was not a new idea . in the united states , some people started trying to get the voting age lowered during world war ii . during the war , president franklin d. roosevelt lowered the military draft age to 18. this meant that men as young as 18 could be forced to join the military . to many people , it did not seem fair that the government thought these young men were old enough to fight a world war , but not old enough to vote in the country they were fighting for . `` old enough to fight , old enough to vote '' became a common slogan .
