Port and starboard     port and starboard are nautical terms for left and right , respectively . port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel , facing forward . starboard is the right-hand side , facing forward . since port and starboard never change , they are clear references that do not depend on which way the observer is facing . the term `` starboard '' comes from the old english `` steorbord '' , meaning the side on which the ship is steered . before ships had rudders on their center-lines , they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship . because more people are right-handed it was placed on the right-hand side . the term is similar to the old norse `` stýri '' ( rudder ) and `` borð '' ( side of a ship ) . since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat , it would tie up at wharf on the other side . for this reason the left side was called `` port '' . formerly `` larboard '' was used instead of `` port '' . this is from middle english `` ladebord '' and the term `` lade '' is related to the modern `` load '' . `` larboard '' sounded very similar to `` starboard '' and in 1844 the royal navy ordered that `` port '' be used instead . `` larboard '' continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers . in old english the word was `` bæcbord '' , which is used in other european languages , for example as the german `` backbord '' and the french term `` bâbord '' ( derived in turn from middle dutch ) .
