Preamble to the United States Constitution     the preamble to the united states constitution is a brief introduction to the constitution 's purposes and guiding principles . it provides the founding fathers ' intentions for creating the constitution and what they hoped the constitution would achieve . it was added to the constitution as an afterthought and was not discussed on the floor of the constitutional convention nor was it voted on . gouverneur morris , one of the writers of the constitution , wrote and added it at the last moment . the preamble itself did not have any legal meaning . the supreme court upheld this view in `` jacobson v. massachusetts '' ( 1905 ) . `` we the people '' means all of the citizens of the united states . the first few words of the preamble `` we the people of the united states '' were very different than any treaty or law the united states had ever written before . for example , the united states ' first constitution , the articles of confederation , describes itself as `` articles of confederation and perpetual union between the states , '' and then gives a list of all thirteen states . the treaties the united states had signed were the same . they were agreements between states , not people .
