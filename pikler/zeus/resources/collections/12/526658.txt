Serekh     a serekh was an important type of heraldic crest used in ancient egypt . a serekh was a symbol which combined a view of a palace facade and a plan ( top view ) of the royal courtyard . the word `` serekh '' comes from the egyptian word for `` facade '' . there are many different serekhs on different types of objects . many different decorations and details of the facade are shown in many different examples . it seems that there were no strict rules for the design of the serekh . a serekh was normally used as a royal crest , showing the name of the pharaoh . they have been found as far back as the predynastic naqada ii ( gerzean ) period ( ca . 3400 bc. ) . the hieroglyphs forming the king 's name were placed inside a rectangular area above the serekh . this represented the royal courtyard . additionally , the falcon of the god horus , or in a few cases the chimera of seth , is on top the serekh . from the old kingdom period onward , the word serekh appears in old papyri .
