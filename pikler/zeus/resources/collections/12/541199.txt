Pesse canoe     the pesse canoe is probably the world 's oldest known boat . carbon dating shows that the boat was made during the early mesolithic period between 8040 bce and 7510 bce . right now the canoe is in the drents museum in assen , netherlands . the boat is a dugout style canoe measuring long and wide . it was made from a single log of scots pine wood . scratches are found on the walls of the canoe , these were probably made by flint or antler tools . the boat was found in 1955 during the creation of the dutch a28 motorway . the motorway is south of the village of pesse in hoogeveen . to make the base of the motorway , the peat was removed , during this construction a crane operator found what he believed to be a tree trunk underground . local farmer hendrik wanders saw the log and took it for observation . he gave the canoe to the university of groningen , where it was examined and freeze dried to stop decay . it was later taken to the drents museum , near the discovery site . many have wondered if the pesse canoe was actually a boat . some danish historians questioned if a boat so small could sail . in 2011 , a similar canoe was constructed by archaeologist jaap beuker and successfully paddled by a canoeist . others thought that the canoe could be something else , believing it was used as an animal feeder . beuker argued that animals were not kept by the people from the era the boat was made , so it could not have been an animal feeder . the boat is also like other prehistoric canoes .
