Majority opinion     in law , a majority opinion is a judicial opinion agreed to by more than half of the members of a court . a majority opinion becomes the decision of the court in a matter . it also gives an explanation of the reasons for the court 's decision . a dissenting opinion is an opinion written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court . very similar to a majority opinion is a plurality opinion . in this instance , a majority of justices agree on the result of a case , but do not all agree on the reasons for the result . in the united states supreme court , a majority of the justices have to agree with all of the contents of the court 's opinion before it can be published . in a few cases , after reading drafts of the opinions , justices may switch their votes and what was the minority opinion becomes the majority opinion . no opinion is considered official until it is read in open court or made available publicly . normally , appellate courts ( or panels ) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie vote . sometimes and in some jurisdictions , when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused ( excuse ) himself or herself from the case , the court may be stuck with a tie . in this situation the decision of the lower court stands .
