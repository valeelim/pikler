African Plate     the african plate is a major tectonic plate . it includes much of the continent of africa , as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges . since the continent of africa includes both the african and the somali plates , some literature refers to the african plate as the nubian plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole . between 60 million years ago ( mya ) and 10 mya , the somali plate began rifting from the african plate along the east african rift . one hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the afar region . another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards . the african plate 's speed is about per year . it has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction . this is drawing it closer to the eurasian plate . there is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust ( in parts of the central and eastern mediterranean ) . along its northeast margin , the african plate is bounded by the red sea rift where the arabian plate is moving away from the african plate .
