Hohmann transfer orbit     in orbital mechanics , a hohmann transfer orbit moves a spacecraft between orbiting heights . it is the most fuel-efficient method to do so , because the spacecraft is not trying to escape the planet 's gravity , using an elliptical orbit for the transfer . a ship using this would have to apply two velocities , one to enter the elliptical orbit , and one to enter the second orbit . assuming the mass of the spacecraft is much lower than that of the orbiting planet , the two velocities , formula_1 and formula_2 , can be solved for as : formula_3formula_4where - formula_5 is the mass of the planet , - formula_6 is the universal gravitational constant , and - formula_7 and formula_8 are the initial and final distances from the center of the planet . applications . - satellites can be moved into their proper height using a hohmann transfer orbit . - a lunar transfer orbit ( lto ) is used to reach the moon . - the interplanetary transport network uses more than one body and requires lower velocity changes , and thus less fuel .
