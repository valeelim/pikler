Solar eclipses on Mars     the two moons of mars—phobos and deimos—are much smaller than the moon , greatly reducing solar eclipses on that planet.. phobos is only 20 by 25 km ( 12 by 16 mi ) and has a rapid orbital motion , so someone on mars would only see the solar eclipse for no longer than about thirty seconds . phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit mars , while a martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long , meaning that phobos can create two eclipses per martian day . deimos is too small , 15 by 10 km ( 9.3 by 6.2 mi ) , to cause an eclipse . the best someone on mars would see would be a small object passing the sun . both moons are too small to cast a shadow on mars that can be seen from earth . however , since the creation of artificial satellites , the shadow of phobos on mars has been seen .
