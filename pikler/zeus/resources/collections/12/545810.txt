Exothermic reaction     an exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction where the substances reacting release energy as heat . an example of this is combustion . exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings . the reaction that does the complete opposite ( it absorbs heat ) is an endothermic reaction . the energy is usually transferred as heat energy , causing the reaction mixture and its surroundings to become hotter . the temperature increase can be detected using a thermometer . some examples of exothermic reactions are : - burning - respiration - neutralisation reactions between acids and alkalis - the reaction between water and calcium oxide
