Karaite     the words karaite and qaraite are very confusing and can be used about a few different things : 1 ) there are some groups of people ( whose ancestors came from central asia ) who have been called karaite people and the languages of some of these groups of people have also been called karaite languages . their ancestors were a type of christian from the church of the east sometimes also called keraites . many karaite people say that the word karaite means `` black '' in the turco-mongol language of their ancestors . that is a traditional central asian way to say they were originally from the northern turkic tribes . 2 ) there are also qaraite people who are mainly turkic and related to the karaite people but the qaraite people mainly converted to islam . most people say their name also means `` black '' but some of these qaraite people themselves say their name actually comes from an arabic word for someone good at reading the quran . 3 ) there is also a type of judaism commonly called karaite judaism . more accurately it should be spelled in english with a q not a k , so it should be qaraite , but karaite is a more common spelling . in judaism the word karaite comes from a hebrew word meaning `` to call out '' . this jewish word has a completely different origin from the name used by the karaite people and qaraite people . both words look the same by accident only in english . people who practice karaite judaism are called karaite jews . in judaism the term karaite language refers to hebrew .
