Brown v. Board of Education II     brown v. board of education ii ( often called brown ii ) was a supreme court case decided in 1955. the year before , the supreme court had decided `` brown v. board of education '' , which made racial segregation in schools illegal . however , many all-white schools in the united states had not followed this ruling and still had not integrated ( allowed black children into ) their schools . in `` brown ii '' , the court ordered them to integrate their schools `` with all deliberate speed . '' in `` brown ii '' , the supreme court also set out rules about what schools needed to do to de-segregate . finally , it explained how the united states government would make sure the schools did de-segregate . after the supreme court decided the original `` brown '' case , it planned to hear arguments during its next court session about just how school de-segregation was going to happen . segregation in united states schools had existed for centuries . the court understood that it would not be easy to get the states to follow its ruling and de-segregate their schools .
