Spintronics     spintronics is a kind of electronics that uses the tiny magnetic fields that come from electrons as well as their electric charge . the word `` spintronics '' is made up of the words `` spin '' and `` electronics '' in atoms , electrons can be said to go around the nucleus of an atom and so possess some spinning energy . they also have their own spin , like a spinning top , which is separate from the atom and they keep even when they are moving freely . there are two ways for something to spin , described as as clockwise or anti clockwise . in the tiny quantum world the terms 'up ' or 'down ' are used instead . the electron spin of large numbers of electrons plays a role as a source of the magnetism in permanent magnets . in most materials these spins are random in direction and so no magnetic field results . in normal electronics the flow of current in a wire can also be used to produce a magnetic field which is known as electromagnetism . neither of these form a part of spintonics . in spintronics the property of the spin of the electrons themselves is used directly . it makes use of the electrons in a solid metal or semiconductor .
