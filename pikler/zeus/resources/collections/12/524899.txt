Eye-spot (mimicry)    eye-spot ( mimicry ) an eye-spot ( or ocellus ) is an eye-like marking on the body of an animal . they are found on butterflies , reptiles , felids , birds and fish . eye-spots may be a form of mimicry : the spot looks like the eye of a larger animal . its function may be to draw a predator 's attention away from the most vulnerable body parts ; or to look like an unpleasant or dangerous animal . in larger animals , eyespots may play a role in intraspecies communication or courtship â€“ the best-known example is probably the eyespots on a peacock 's display feathers . there is evidence that eyespots in butterflies are anti-predator defences . some are deimatic displays to distract , startle or scare off predators , or at least to deflect attacks away from vital body parts . butterfly eyespots may also play a role in mate recognition and sexual selection , like the eyespots on larger organisms .
