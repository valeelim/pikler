Pharmacokinetics     pharmacokinetics is a branch of pharmacology which studies what the body does to a drug . pharmacokinetics looks at how a substance enters , moves through and exits the body . it relates how the dose delivered affects the concentration within the body . it is closely related to another branch of pharmacology , pharmacodynamics , which describes how a drugs affects the body . when developing new drugs , it is important to know exactly what happens to the chemical once administered . there are four important parameters of pharmacokinetics , usually known by the acronym adme : absorption , distribution , metabolism and excretion . this model was developed in order to simplify perception of the many processes that take place once a drug enters an organism . - absorption - how is the medication absorbed ( through the skin , the intestine , the mouth ) ? - distribution - how does it spread through the organism ? - metabolism - is the medication converted chemically inside the body , and into what . are these new substances active ? could they be toxic ?
