Persian couriers     persian couriers were ancient mounted messengers ( despatch riders ) kept ready at regular stages throughout old persia for carrying the royal despatches at the time of the achaemenid empire . in ancient greek , persian courier was called `` ἄγγαρος '' ( ángaros , “ persian mounted courier ” ) , whence latin `` angarius '' , which is probably from an east asian language ( e.g. , sanskrit `` अजिरा '' ( ajirā , “ agile , swift ” ) ) . the word `` angel '' ( `` ἄγγελος '' ) is probably loaned from and related to greek `` ἄγγαρος '' . in about 440 bc , herodotus wrote in `` the histories '' ( book 8.98 ) about the persian couriers : paraphrase of the herodotus description was used by the united states postal service as a motto on the entrance to the central post office building in new york city : `` neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds .
