Wage     a wage is money that is paid by an employer to an employee in exchange for work . the amount may be fixed for each task completed ( this is called piece rate ) ; or it may be based on time or other measurable quantity of work done . work for wages is the most common form of work . because of this , the term `` wage '' sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment . however , a wage is different to a salary or commission . a salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals ( such as a week or month ) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done . commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product . waged employees may also receive `` tips '' paid directly by clients . they will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary , such as annual leave and sick leave . wages are usually paid by the hour . this is called an hourly wage . wages paid by the day are still common . wage rates may be influenced by market forces ( supply and demand ) , laws , and tradition . market forces are perhaps more dominant in the united states , while tradition , social structure and seniority , perhaps play a greater role in japan . in many countries , laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers . this means that employers can not pay workers a lower rate than the minimum wage ; however , they can pay them a higher rate . the minimum wage rate is there to protect the working class .
