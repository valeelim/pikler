Zhenyuanlong     zhenyuanlong is a genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the yixian formation of liaoning , china . it lived in the early cretaceous period , about 125 million years ago . there is just one specimen . it is estimated the skeleton would have been about 165 centimetres ( 5.41 ft ) long when complete . that means the animal was too large to have flown , especially since early flight was , almost certainly , less efficient than the flight of modern birds . it would surely have looked more like a bird than a modern reptile . this is shown in most reconstructions of dinobirds . this type specimen has a nearly complete skeleton with traces of feathers , including long tail feathers and large wings . this specimen is the first evidence of well-developed feathers in a large , non-flying dromaeosaur . the feathers probably had two functions : temperature control and signalling .
