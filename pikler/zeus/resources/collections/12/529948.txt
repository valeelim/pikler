Zina     zināʾ ( زِنَاء ) or zina ( زِنًى or زِنًا ) is an islamic law concerning unlawful sexual relations between muslims who are not married to one another through a `` nikah '' . it includes extramarital sex and premarital sex.. it also includes adultery ( consensual sexual relations outside marriage ) . zina covers fornication ( consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons ) , and homosexuality ( consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners ) . in the four schools of sunni fiqh ( islamic jurisprudence ) , and the two schools of shi'a fiqh , the term zināʾ is a sin of sexual intercourse that is not allowed by sharia ( islamic law ) and classed as a hudud crime ( class of islamic punishments that are fixed for certain crimes that are considered to be `` claims of god '' ) . to prove an act of zina , a qadi ( religious judge ) in a sharia court relies on an unmarried woman 's pregnancy , the confession in the name of allah , or four witnesses to the actual act of penetration . the last two types of prosecutions are uncommon . most cases of zina in the history of islam have been pregnant unmarried women . in some schools of islamic law , a pregnant woman accused of zina who denies sex was consensual must prove she was raped with four eyewitnesses testifying before the court . this has led to many cases where rape victims have been punished for zina . pressing charges of zina without required eyewitnesses is considered slander ( qadhf , القذف ) in islam , itself a hudud crime .
