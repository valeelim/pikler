My arcade series     the my arcade consoles are a line of unauthorized handheld nintendo entertainment system clones that attach to a tv set manufactured by various companies and sold by dreamgear , llc.most , if not all of these were manufactured in east asia and mostly are of low quality . the consoles are most common in places like walgreens and dollar stores , but excess inventory is sometimes sold in more mainstream stores like meijer and walmart . in 2012 , dreamgear released my arcade portable gaming systems to stores which are 16-bit instead of 8-bit , and seem to use an unauthorized implementation of the game boy advance hardware . many of the games found on these handhelds contain copyright infringement . voice clips are stolen from homer simpson and the flintstones , as well as games using copyrighted characters like elmo . also , they repeat games just with different textures and sounds .
