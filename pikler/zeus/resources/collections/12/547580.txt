Comma-separated values     in computing , a comma-separated values ( csv ) file stores information you might find in a spreadsheet , such as a table of text , numbers , and dates , in a plain text file . typically , the first line in a plain text file would contain header information , which are labels for table information organized vertically . starting with the second line , each line would represent a row . each cell in a row is separated by a comma , hence its name . text in a cell may be surrounded by quotation character ( `` ) , to note the start and end of a cell in a table . quotation characters in a cell value in turn can be denoted by doubling the quotation character ( `` '' ) . csv is a way to describe table data . however , various applications may require different types of tables . having a file in csv format may not be enough for a file to be compatible with a particular application . furthermore , csv is stored in plain text . an application may have problems reading a csv file because of incompatibility with the plain text format , either because of the character encoding or line break format .
