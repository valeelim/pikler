Duct     in anatomy and physiology , a duct is a tube leading from an exocrine gland or organ . it usually carries the gland 's product to where it is used . an example is the vas deferens , which carries sperm to the ejaculatory ducts . another example is tear ducts , which carry tears to the eye . ducts are lined by pavement-type endothelial cells . outside the endothelium in blood and lymphatic vessels is a layer with no cells called the basement membrane . outside that are the smooth muscle cells . the smooth muscle squeezes the contents along .
