Amarna period     the amarna period was an era of ancient egypt in the last half of the eighteenth dynasty . the royal residence of the pharaoh and his queen was shifted to akhetaten ( 'horizon of the aten ' ) in what is now amarna . it was marked by the reign of amenhotep iv , who changed his name to akhenaten ( 1353â€“1336 bc ) . this was to underline the dramatic change of egypt 's polytheistic religion into one where the sun disc aten was worshipped over all other gods . aten was not solely worshipped ( the religion was not monotheistic ) , but other gods were worshipped to a significantly lesser degree . the egyptian pantheon of the equality of all gods and goddesses was restored under akhenaten 's successor . during akhenaten 's reign , royal portraiture changed . sculptures of akhenaten are different from those of earlier pharaohs . akhenaten is shown in an androgynous ( less manly ) and stylized manner , with large thighs , a slim torso , drooping belly , full lips , and a long neck and nose . some believe that the break with convention was due to `` the presence at amarna of new people or groups of artists whose background and training were different from those of the karnak sculptors '' .
