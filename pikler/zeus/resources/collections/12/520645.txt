Kepler's Laws    kepler 's laws kepler 's laws of planetary motion are three laws that describe the motion of planets around the sun : 1. planets move around the sun in elliptic orbits . the sun is in one of the two foci of the orbit . 1. a line segment joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time . 1. the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit . johannes kepler found these laws , between 1609 and 1619. kepler 's laws improve the model of copernicus . if the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero , then kepler basically agrees with copernicus : 1. the planetary orbit is a circle 1. the sun at the center of the orbit 1. the speed of the planet in the orbit is constant the eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to copernicus and kepler are small , so the rules above give good approximations of planetary motion ; but kepler 's laws fit the observations better than copernicus 's . kepler 's corrections are not at all obvious :
