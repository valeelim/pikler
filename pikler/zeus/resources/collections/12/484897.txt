Decison problem     in computability theory and computational complexity theory , a decision problem is a question in some formal system with a yes-or-no answer . the answer is dependent on the values of the input parameters . decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability , that is , the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set . some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable .
