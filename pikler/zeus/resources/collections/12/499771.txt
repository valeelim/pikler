Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution     the fourteenth amendment ( amendment xiv ) to the united states constitution was adopted on july 9 , 1868. it was one of the reconstruction amendments . the amendment discusses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws . it was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the american civil war . this amendment was bitterly contested . southern states were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in congress . the fourteenth amendment is one of the most litigated parts of the constitution . it forms the basis for landmark decisions such as `` roe v. wade '' ( 1972 ) , and `` bush v. gore '' ( 2000 ) . it remains the most important constitutional amendment since the bill of rights was passed in 1791. at the end of the civil war , abraham lincoln freed the slaves . the problem was , he did not ask congress . congress had not passed a law to free slaves . meanwhile , some states still had slavery . the thirteenth amendment freed the slaves . it became law in late 1865. three years later the fourteenth amendment provided civil rights . radical republicans controlled congress during this period . they wanted to give full citizenship to freed slaves . but they also realized that giving civil rights to blacks , it opened the door for women 's suffrage . it would lead to giving women the right to vote , which congress did not want to do . if only section one was included in the amendment , the wording `` all persons born or naturalized in the united states '' would include women . for this reason , the word `` male '' was inserted in section two so the amendment would be approved by congress .
