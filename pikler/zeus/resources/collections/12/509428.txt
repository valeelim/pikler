Negative temperature     in physics , absolute zero ( 0Â°k ) is the coldest temperatures . at that point , subatomic particles stop moving ( entropy is at its minimum ) . certain things can reach temperatures below absolute zero , known as negative temperatures . this is very difficult to do , and only very small objects can reach negative temperatures . it might seem absurd , but things at negative temperatures are actually `` hotter '' than things at positive temperatures ( above absolute zero ) . if something with a negative temperature comes in contact with a positive-temperature object , heat will go from the negative object to the positive . this is because temperature is a trade-off between energy and entropy . if you add energy to a positive-temperature object , it will `` increase '' in entropy . if you add energy to a negative-temperature object , it will `` decrease '' in entropy . many objects can not achieve negative temperatures , because adding energy to them will increase their entropy . only very small things discussed in quantum mechanics can reach this state .
