Join (SQL)    join ( sql ) a sql join clause is a way to retrieve information from two or more tables in a database . when a database programmer wants to do a join command , they will type about the databases they want to get information from , and the type of join they want to use . there are five types of joins . a normal codice_1 , which is also called an codice_2 , a codice_3 , acodice_4 , acodice_5 and codice_6 . in order for a join to work , there must be information in the tables to be joined that is the same between them . imagine two tables called employee and department . suppose a database administrator wanted to know what employee worked in what department . while someone could just compare the id numbers between the two tables , a way to have the information in one place is by doing a join , also known as an inner join . because they have one type of data in common , the department id , the tables can be joined together . it would make a table that looks like this : because williams in the employee table did not have an department id , williams was not printed in the final result .
