Special Order 191     special order 191 was issued by robert e. lee in early september 1862. it was a handwritten order detailing lee 's planned troop movements during his maryland campaign intended to win the american civil war . the document was recovered by union soldiers and passed on to major general george b. mcclellan . this was a piece of intelligence few battle commanders are ever lucky enough to receive . it gave the details of how lee had weakened his forces by splitting them up into several columns . it also laid out where each part of his army was to be at any given time . mcclellan , usually very slow to act , moved his forces more quickly this time . by the night of september 14 , 1862 , lee was no longer following his plan of attack . he was now reacting to mcclellan 's troop movements . at this point lee 's main problem became how to keep his army from being destroyed . following his success at the second battle of bull run ( also called the second battle of manassas ) , lee made plans to invade the north . lee thought that if he took the civil war to the union states , a major victory might convince great britain and france to support the south . he also thought it would make the north sue for peace . this would insure the confederate states of america could remain an independent country . lee led his army of northern virginia into maryland on september 4 , 1862. he concentrated his army at frederick , maryland , about northwest of washington , d.c. the story of the lost order 191 and the events of early september 1862 revolve around two sheets of paper .
