Neutral particle     in physics , a neutral particle is a particle with no electric charge . long-lived neutral particles do not decay for a very long time . examples of such particles include photons , neutrons , and neutrinos . other neutral particles are very short-lived . they decay before they can be detected by a particle detector . they have been observed only indirectly , such as tracks of ionized particles in a particle accelerator . they include : - z bosons - dozens of heavy neutral hadrons : - neutral mesons such as the pion and kaon - the neutral delta baryon , and other neutral baryons , such as the xi baryon and lambda baryon references . - k. nakamura et al .
