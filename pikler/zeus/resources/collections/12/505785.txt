Lories and lorikeets     lories and lorikeets ( tribe loriini ) are small to medium-sized arboreal parrots . they have special brush-tipped tongues to feed on nectar of blossoms and soft fruits , preferably berries . they are a monophyletic group in the parrot family psittacidae . sequence analysis and morphology show that the group is in the middle of other groups . they are widely distributed throughout the australasian region , including south-eastern asia , polynesia , papua new guinea , timor leste and australia , and the majority have very brightly coloured plumage . those studies show that the lories and lorikeets form a single group , closely related to the budgerigar and the fig parrots .
