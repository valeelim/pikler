Kimberlite     kimberlite is an igneous rock best known for sometimes containing diamonds . it is named after the town of kimberley in south africa . the discovery of a big diamond in 1871 started a `` diamond rush '' . this resulted in the big hole , a large open mine . kimberlite occurs in the earth 's crust in vertical structures known as `` pipes '' as well as igneous dykes and sills . kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined diamonds today . kimberlites form deep with the earth 's mantle . formation occurs at depths between kimberlite material is erupted rapidly and violently , often with considerable carbon dioxide and other volatile components . kimberlite has attracted attention because it serves as a carrier of diamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the earth 's surface . the study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the lower mantle . little is known about melting processes at or near the interface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle .
