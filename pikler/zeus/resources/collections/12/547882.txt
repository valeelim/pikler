Hematopoiesis     hematopoiesis ( or haematopoiesis ; sometimes also haemopoiesis ) is the formation of blood cells . in a healthy adult person , about 10–10 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation . hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells . the process is called hematopoiesis. < ref name= '' birbrair n/a–n/a '' > < /ref > they are in the core ( bone marrow ) of most bones . as a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become . it moves closer to a specific cell type ( cellular differentiation ) . these changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell . each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type . hsc studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding . more recent advances have resulted in the use of hsc transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders .
