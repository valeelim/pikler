Directed evolution     directed evolution ( de ) is a method used to produce enzymes for industrial or medical purposes . the method is protein engineering which mimics natural selection . the basic idea is to put a gene through repeated rounds of mutation , to make a library of variants . selection isolates genes with the desired function . they are a template for the next round . this can be done `` in vivo '' ( in living cells of bacteria or yeast ) , or `` in vitro '' ( free in solution or microdroplets ) . testing more mutants increases the chances of finding one with the desired properties . during `` in vivo '' evolution , each cell ( usually bacteria or yeast ) is transformed with a plasmid containing a different member of the variant library . only the gene of interest differs between the cells , with all other genes being kept the same . the cells express the protein either in their cytoplasm or surface where its function can be tested . this format has the advantage of selecting for properties in a cellular environment , which is useful when the evolved protein or rna is to be used in living organisms .
