Bernoulli distribution     the bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution . it is used in probability theory and statistics . it is named after a swiss scientist jacob bernoulli . a bernoulli distribution is useful because it can be used to approximate the outcomes of an experiment ( such as tossing a coin ) as a range of percentages . it represents a `` yes or no '' type experiment . if the experiment succeeds , it is given value 1. if the experiment does not succeed , it is given value 0. this can be used , for example , in tossing a coin . `` 1 '' means it lands on `` heads '' and `` 0 '' means it lands on `` tails '' ( or the other way around ) . this distribution has only one parameter , the probability of a success ( `` p '' ) . in fact , bernoulli distribution is the binomial distribution with `` n '' =1 . meaning all of the answers are between 0 and 1 ( such as 0.123432345 ) .
