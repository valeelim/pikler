Stock (food)    stock ( food ) stock in cooking ( cuisine ) is a liquid flavoring base for soups and sauces . a flavoured liquid preparation , it forms the basis of many dishes . a stock is made by simmering animal bones and/or meat , fish , or vegetables in water and/or wine , adding mirepoix or other aromatics for more flavour . a newer approach is to use a pressure cooker . the ingredients may include meat , bones , herbs and spices , and mirepoix . mirepoix is a mixture of onions , carrots , celery , and sometimes other vegetables . many use ready-made ingredients like oxo cubes or bouillon cubes . stock lasts for three or four days in the fridge , but can be boiled again , and stored again . the ideas go back to carÃªme , and were simplified by escoffier .
