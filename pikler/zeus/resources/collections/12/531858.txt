Amniotic sac     the amniotic sac holds a fetus while it is developing during pregnancy . the amniotic sac is filled with amniotic fluid , which protects the fetus . the amniotic sac starts to form and fill with amniotic fluid just days after a woman gets pregnant . at first , the amniotic fluid is made from the mother 's plasma ( the liquid part of her blood ) . at first , the amniotic fluid is made mostly of water with electrolytes ( salts ) . however , by the 12th to the 14th week of pregnancy , proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , phospholipids , and urea are all in the amniotic fluid . these things help the fetus grow . as the fetus gets bigger , more amniotic fluid gets created . by the time the baby is born , there is about one liter of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac . the amniotic fluid is very important in protecting the fetus and helping the fetus grow : - it acts like a cushion , so the fetus does not hit the side of the mother 's abdomen - it lets the fetus float and move around , which helps the muscles and bones grow
