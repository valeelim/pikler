Pressurized heavy-water reactor     a pressurized heavy-water reactor ( phwr ) is a nuclear reactor developed by canada . it commonly uses uranium as its fuel . it uses heavy water ( deuterium oxide do ) as its coolant and neutron moderator . the heavy water coolant is kept under pressure . this allows it to be heated to higher temperatures without boiling . while heavy water is a lot more expensive than ordinary water , it creates greatly enhanced neutron economy . this allows the reactor to operate without fuel-enrichment facilities ( offsetting the additional expense of the heavy water ) . < br >
