Productive efficiency     in economics , productive efficiency is a situation in which an economy is not able to produce any more of one good without reducing the production of another good . as resources are limited , it is not possible for more units of a good to be produced without taking away the resources used for producing another good . the concept of productive efficiency can be shown on a production possibility frontier ( ppf ) , where all points on the curve are productively efficient . productive efficiency refers to the maximum amount of output that an economy can produce at a certain point in time . however , if firms in the economy were to improve on their production methods and increase productivity , it is possible for the ppf to shift outwards , thus allowing more goods to be produced than before . productive inefficiency happens when factors of production ( i.e . land , labor , capital or enterprise ) are not used to its maximum . for example , labor in the form of workers may be sitting and not doing any work . if the worker were to be used to produce more output than before , then having the worker not doing any work would be productively inefficient .
