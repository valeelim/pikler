Stephan's Quintet    stephan 's quintet stephan 's quintet is in the constellation pegasus . it is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four are the first compact galaxy group ever discovered . the group is about 280 million light years from earth . the group was discovered by Ã©douard stephan in 1877 at marseille observatory . the group is the most studied of all the compact galaxy groups . the brightest member of the visual grouping is ngc 7320. this has extensive h ii regions , seen here as red blobs , where active star formation is occurring . these galaxies are of interest because of their violent collisions . four of the five galaxies in stephan 's quintet form a physical association , hickson compact group 92. they are involved in a cosmic dance that will probably end with the galaxies merging . radio observations in the early 1970s showed a mysterious emission from the inter-galactic space between the galaxies in the group . this same region also showed faint glow of ionized atomic hydrogen . you can see this in the visible part of the spectrum as the magnificent green-blue arc in the picture to the right . two space telescopes have recently shown something about the nature of the strange filament . it is now believed to be a giant intergalactic shock-wave ( similar to a sonic boom but travelling in intergalactic gas rather than air ) . this is caused by one galaxy ( ngc 7318b ) falling into the center of the group at several million miles per hour .
