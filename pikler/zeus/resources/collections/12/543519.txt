Wallis Simpson     wallis simpson , who later became the duchess of windsor , caused a serious crisis in the mid-1930s . the heir to the throne of the united kingdom , prince edward , had fallen in love with her . however , she was married to another man , and she had already divorced her first husband to marry him . in 1936 she divorced her second husband . on 20 january 1936 george v died and edward became king . edward and mrs simpson had already started an affair . after her divorce , he wanted to marry her . one big problem was that the monarch is the head of the church of england , and at the time the church was still strongly against the idea of divorce . how could the head of the church marry a divorced person ? and their affair was regarded as sin . in november , the king consulted with the british prime minister , stanley baldwin , on a way to marry wallis and keep the throne . the king suggested a morganatic marriage , where he would remain king but wallis would not be queen . this was rejected by baldwin and the prime ministers of australia and south africa . if the king were to marry wallis against baldwin 's advice , the government would be required to resign , causing a constitutional crisis .
