Plain view doctrine     the plain view doctrine allows law enforcement officers to collect evidence or contraband found in plain view while they are lawfully present . it is an exception to items spelled out in a search warrant and to the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures . the doctrine is based on the united states supreme court decision `` horton v. california '' . the court held that the fourth amendment does not prohibit warrantless seizures of any evidence which is in plain view . there are three conditions , all of which must be satisfied , in order to uphold a seizure under the plain view doctrine : 1. the item must be in plain view of the officer , 1. the officer must lawfully be in the place where he discovered the evidence , and 1. the incriminating nature of the evidence must be immediately apparent . in order for an officer to seize an item , the officer must have probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime or is contraband . the police may not move objects to get a better view . in `` arizona v. hicks '' ( 1987 ) , the officer was found to have acted unlawfully . while investigating a shooting , the officer moved—without probable cause—stereo equipment to record the serial numbers . they also seized three weapons and a stocking-cap mask . the court granted the defendants motion to suppress all the evidence that had been seized because his fourth amendment rights had been violated . the plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub doctrines of plain feel , plain smell , and plain hearing .
