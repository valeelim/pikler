Hebridean Terrane     the hebridean terrane is one of the terranes that form part of the caledonian orogenic belt in northwest scotland . its boundary with the neighbouring northern highland terrane is formed by the moine thrust belt . the basement rock is formed by archaean and paleoproterozoic gneisses of the lewisian complex . they are overlaid unconformably overlain by the neoproterozoic torridonian sediments . this in turn is unconformably overlain by a sequence of cambroâ€“ordovician sediments . it formed part of the laurentian foreland during the caledonian continental collision . the hebridean terrane is the westernmost strip of mainland scotland , most of the inner hebrides and all of the outer hebrides . similar rocks are also thought to be present on shetland and have been proved west and north of the outer hebrides by bgs shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells . the full extent of this terrane to the west is obscured by the effects of mesozoic rifting . some similar rocks occur in the shetlands , which are the northern outpost of the caledonian orogeny ,
