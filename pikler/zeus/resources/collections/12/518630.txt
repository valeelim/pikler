Burning of Parliament     the burning of parliament was a great fire in london on 16 october 1834. the palace of westminster , the medieval royal palace used as the home of the british parliament , was largely destroyed . the blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks . they had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the exchequer until 1826. the sticks were disposed of in a careless manner . they were thrown in the two furnaces under the house of lords , which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the lords ' chamber . the fire smoldered under the floor for most of the day . the senile housekeeper and a careless clerk of works ignored all the warning signs of the pending disaster . this led the prime minister to call it `` one of the greatest instances of stupidity upon record '' . the fire spread rapidly throughout the buildings . it became the worst fire to occur in london between the great fire of 1666 and the blitz of the second world war . the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event . the fire lasted for most of the night . the house of lords and the house of commons were destroyed along with most of their libraries , art collections and records .
