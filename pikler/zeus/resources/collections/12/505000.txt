Two-wheel drive     two-wheel drive ( 2wd ) describes vehicles in which , in theory , two wheels receive power from the engine at the same time . usually the two wheels are on the same axle in the drivetrain . most vehicles with two-wheel drive are mainly for use on roads and highways . two-wheel drive cars and trucks are either front- ( fwd ) or rear-wheel drive ( rwd ) . this means either the front or the rear axle is the `` drive axle '' that moves the vehicle forward . when the vehicle begins to accelerate , some of the weight of the vehicle is shifted to the rear giving a rear-wheel drive car or better balance and traction . two-wheel drive systems are simple and rugged . this is why rear-wheel drive is so popular in police cars and other service vehicles . traditional two-wheel drive systems have a differential in the rear axle . this is used for turning the vehicle . if both drive wheels rotated at exactly the same rate , the vehicle would have difficulty going around a corner . in a turn , the outside wheel has to go faster to keep up with the inside wheel ( which turns slower ) . a differential allows one wheel to turn faster under these conditions . this means only one of the two wheels actually has power at any given time . a differential also prevents excessive tire wear .
