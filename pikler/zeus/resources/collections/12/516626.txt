Think of the children     `` think of the children '' ( also `` what about the children ? '' ) is a phrase that became a strategy used when you are in an argument with someone . basically in its simplest use it can mean just children 's rights , like for example talking about child labor problems . but when this phrase is used in the middle of an argument , it can be used to try to make people feel emotional when thinking about the needs of children , and then to try and fool people into doing what they want because they might be scared that they do not want to harm children . the 2002 book `` art , argument , and advocacy '' ( 2002 ) said that using this phrase replaced emotion instead of reason in the middle of an argument with someone . ethicist jack marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase is so popular because it can stop people from behaving rationally especially when they are talking about morals . `` think of the children '' was used by censorship supporters to try to defend children from things they thought were dangerous to these young people . the book `` community , space and online censorship '' ( 2009 ) wrote that calling children just babies in need of protection was a form of focusing too much on the concept of purity . a 2011 article in the `` journal for cultural research '' wrote that `` think of the children '' was caused by people thinking too hard about telling everyone what to do and the difference between right-and-wrong .
