Diaeresis     the diaeresis ( plural : diaereses ) is also spelled diæresis or dieresis . it is a diacritical mark : two dots ( ¨ ) put over a letter , usually a vowel . it is a cousin of the umlaut , in this way : - with a diacritic , one vowel is sounded separately from its neighbour . so , in the word `` zöology '' , it is pronounced as a long 'o ' followed by a short 'o ' . without the diaeresis , it might be pronounced like the word 'zoo ' . it is sometimes described as `` two vowel sounds occurring in adjacent syllables '' . it is often used in names where the last vowel is sounded , as in `` chloë '' or `` brontë '' . - with an umlaut there is a sound shift , but only one sound .
