Co-education     co-educational means education for boys and girls together . it means mixed-sex education . the practice has been different in different countries , and at different times . most primary schools have been co-educational for a long time . there is no reason to educate females separately before the age of puberty . also , the curriculum in primary schools is not controversial . it emphasises reading , writing and arithmetic , with some elementary knowledge of geography and history . in some countries it includes some religious as well as cultural education . however , before the mid-19th century , girls were often educated at home , or were not educated at all . on this point , there were great differences in different parts of the world . in england and wales , universal primary education was set up by the elementary education act of 1870 , and attendance from the ages of 5 to 10 was compulsory . this was extended in another act of 1880. since then . almost all primary education in the united kingdom has been co-educational , and so it is in many other countries .
