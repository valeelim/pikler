Case citation     case citation is a system used by legal professionals to identify past court case decisions . these are found either in series of books called reporters or law reports , or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported . case citations are formatted differently in different jurisdictions , but generally contain the same key information . a legal citation is a `` reference to a legal precedent or authority , such as a case , statute , or work , that either agrees with or contradicts a given position '' . where cases are published on paper , the citation usually contains the following information : - report title - volume number - page , section , or paragraph number - publication year in some report series , for example in england and australia , volumes are not numbered independently of the year . so the year and volume number ( usually no greater than 4 ) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers . in such citations , it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square brackets `` '' to the year ( which may not be the year that the case was decided , for example , a case decided in december 2001 may have been reported in 2002 ) .
