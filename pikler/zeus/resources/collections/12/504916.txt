Australopithecus deyiremeda     australopithecus deyiremeda is an extinct hominin which lived about 3.4 million years ago in northern ethiopia . this was around the same time and place as several previously discovered specimens of `` australopithecus afarensis '' were found . they include the well known lucy . the discovery was in the afar region of ethiopia about ( 520 kilometers ) northeast of the capital addis ababa and north of hadar , ethiopia ( “ lucy ’ s ” site ) . teeth in the fossil jaw suggest that the species had a different diet from `` a. afarensis '' . yohannes haile-selassie , the curator of physical anthropology at the cleveland museum of natural history has said that `` the woranso-mille study area has thus far yielded more than 120 early hominin fossil specimens dated to between 3.4 and 3.8 million years ago '' . haile-selassie told the bbc : `` we had to look at the detailed anatomy and morphology of the teeth and the upper and lower jaws , and we found major differences . this new species has very robust jaws . in addition , we see this new species had smaller teeth . the canine is really small – smaller than all known hominins we have found in the past '' .
