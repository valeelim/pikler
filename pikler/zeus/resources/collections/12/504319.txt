Arch bridge     an arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch . arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust held by the abutments at either side . a viaduct ( a long bridge ) may be made from a series of arches . however other less expensive structures are typically used today . both the etruscans and ancient greeks knew about arches . but the romans were the first to use arches for bridge construction . roman arch bridges were usually semicircular . a number were also segmental arch bridges ( such as alcon√©tar bridge ) , a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle . the advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it . this would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods . also the bridge itself could be more lightweight . generally , roman bridges had wedge-shaped primary arch stones ( called voussoirs ) of the same in size and shape . the romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts . their bridges featured flood openings in the piers .
