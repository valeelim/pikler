Out of Africa     out of africa is about the recent african origin of modern humans . since the 1980s this has been supported by a study of present-day mitochondrial dna , and other sequence analysis . there is also evidence based on the physical anthropology of archaic fossil remains . the idea is very well supported . there are differing theories on whether there was a single exodus or several . a growing number of researchers also suspect that `` long-neglected north africa '' was the original home of the modern humans who first trekked out of the continent . the first truly modern humans seem to have appeared between 200,000 and 130,000 years ago . these early humans later moved out from africa . by about 90,000 years ago they had moved into eurasia and the middle east . this was the area where earlier species of humans , ( such as neanderthals , `` homo neanderthalensis '' ) had been living for a long time ( at least 500,000 years in western europe ) . by about 42 to 44,000 years ago `` homo sapiens '' had reached western europe , including britain . in europe and western asia , `` homo sapiens '' replaced the neanderthals by about 35,000 years ago . the details of this event are not known . at roughly the same time `` homo sapiens '' arrived in australia . their arrival in the americas was much later , about 15,000 years ago . all these earlier groups of modern man were hunter-gatherers .
