Smooth snake     the smooth snake is `` coronella austriaca '' . it is one of the three snakes found in britain , where it lives only on southern heathlands . it is a non-venomous colubrid species found in northern and central europe , and as far east as northern iran . in contrast to many other snakes , their scales are flat ( not keeled ) . this gives the snake a smooth texture to the touch , from which it gets its common name . the smooth snake feeds on smaller animals , especially other reptiles . it subdues larger prey by constriction , although unlike true constrictors it does not actually kill by this method . it reproduces by laying eggs , which are buried in sand in a warm place .
