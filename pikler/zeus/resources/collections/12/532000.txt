Equal Protection Clause     the equal protection clause is part of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution . the clause , which took effect in 1868 , provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction `` the equal protection of the laws '' . a primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the civil rights act of 1866 , which guaranteed that all people would have rights equal to those of all citizens . as a whole , the fourteenth amendment marked a large shift in american constitutionalism . it applied substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the civil war . the meaning of the equal protection clause has been the subject of much debate . it has inspired the well-known phrase `` equal justice under law '' . these words are inscribed on the u.s. supreme court building . this clause was the basis for `` brown v. board of education '' ( 1954 ) . this supreme court decision that helped to dismantle racial segregation , and also the basis for many other decisions rejecting discrimination against people belonging to various groups .
