Public good     in economics , a public good is a kind of common good . public goods have two main properties : - it is not possible to prevent someone from consuming the good . - if a person consumes the good , this does not reduce the availabililty of the good to others . examples for public goods are fresh air , knowledge , street lighting , or a fireworks display . public goods are an example of market failure : if all actors maximize their gain , this does not produce an efficient solution . it is obvious that because the goods are non-excludable , it means that a producer sees no benefit in producing or providing the good on the market , this is because it is impossible to make a profit from it as people who have not paid for the good . for this reason , the government may intervene to provide it . there are relatively few examples of `` purely '' public goods , however some examples are : - flood control - public water supplies - street lighting - lighthouse protection - national defence services - parks and other public recreational areas
