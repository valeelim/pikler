Rus' (people)    rus ' ( people ) the rus ( ) were an early medieval group or people who gave their name to the lands of russia , ruthenia , and belarus . in the mid-800s they were centered around kiev . they dominated the area for over a hundred years . many of the leaders of the rus had scandinavian names , later both scandinavian and slavic names . the rus of kiev , after they intermingled ( mixed ) with the slavs already there , became known as the kievan rus ' . there has been a controversy over where they originally came from . most western scholars believe them to be a group of vikings , specifically from sweden . according to the `` povest vremennykh let '' or russian primary chronicle of rus ' , compiled in about 1113 ad , the rus ' had relocated from sweden . their leader was named rurik . later , rurik 's relative oleg captured kiev , founding kievan rus ' . the descendants of rurik were the ruling dynasty of rus ' ( after 862 ) . in the controversy , this is called the `` normanist '' view . the `` anti-normanist '' view is that the rus ' were slavic people from south of kiev . in support of this theory it has been pointed out that several rivers have similar names . once example is the ros river which is a tributary of the dnieper river . this may have been where the rus ' took their name . the official soviet union history included the `` anti-norman '' viewpoint giving the reason : `` the normanist theory is politically harmful , because it denies the ability of the slavic nations to form an independent state by their own efforts .
