VX     vx is a type of chemical weapon called a nerve agent . it is a very toxic chemical . because it is so toxic , it can not be used as anything other than a chemical weapon . the united nations classifies vx as a weapon of mass destruction . vx is the most toxic nerve agent ever created . the council on foreign relations says : `` a fraction of a drop of vx , absorbed through the skin , can fatally disrupt the nervous system . '' the chemical weapons convention of 1993 , an international law , made it illegal for countries to use chemical weapons like vx . it also made it illegal to make or keep more than 100 grams of vx . it allows some scientists to make and use amounts under 100 grams only if they are trying to create an antidote , or doing medical research . vx is one of the `` v-series nerve agents , '' which were made in the 1950s by the united kingdom 's military researchers . nobody agrees on why these nerve agents are called `` v-series . '' different people say the v stands for `` victory , '' `` venomous '' ( poisonous ) , or `` viscous '' ( thick liquid ) .
