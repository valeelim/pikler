Santa Fe Trail     the santa fe trail was a 19th century transportation route through central north america . it connected independence , missouri with santa fe , new mexico . it was pioneered in 1821 by william becknell . the santa fe trail served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to santa fe in 1880. santa fe was near the end of the el camino real de tierra adentro which carried trade from mexico city . the route skirted the northern edge and crossed the northwestern corner of comancheria , the territory of the comanches . they demanded payment for granting passage to the trail . comanche raiding farther south in mexico isolated new mexico . this made the area more dependent on the american trade . it also provided the comanches with a steady supply of horses . by the 1840s trail traffic along the arkansas river valley was so heavy that bison herds could not reach important seasonal grazing land . this contributed to their decline which in turn hastened the decline of comanche power in the region . the trail was used as the 1846 u.s. invasion route of new mexico during the mexicanâ€“american war .
