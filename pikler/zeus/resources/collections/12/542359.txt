Camel Trophy     the camel trophy was a vehicle-oriented competition that was held every year between 1980 and 1998. it was best known for its use of land rover vehicles over extreme terrain . the camel trophy began in 1980 as a team expedition over the trans-amazonian highway . camel trophy events since then have been informally called `` the olympics of 4Ã—4 '' . they were all about adventure and exploration . over the next eight years , the expeditions crossed sumatra , papua new guinea , zaire , brazil , borneo , australia , madagascar ( the first north-south crossing ) and sulawesi before returning to the amazon . these extreme tests of human endurance brought together teams from around the world . each team hoped they could triumph over some of the worst off-road conditions imaginable . teamwork and mutual trust were crucial . the competition came in a series of `` special tasks , '' such as winching and timed driving routes . in each case national teams competed against each other . in the 1990s , the camel trophy headed to siberia and the ussr , followed by tanzania , burundi , guyana , argentina , paraguay , chile ( the `` road to hell '' event ) , belize , mexico , guatemala , el salvador , honduras ( controversially serving 500 out-of-season lobster at a dinner ) , kalimantan ( a thousand miles and 18 rollovers to celebrate the first crossing of the island 100 years previously ) and mongolia . the camel trophy however , did not simply change venue ; over the years , the event evolved from a mud-plugging expedition to involve elements of adventure sport , such as kayaking , mountain biking and winter sports . teams were selected by each competing nation in competitions held nationally , designed to test the athletic , engineering and driving prowess of potential candidates .
