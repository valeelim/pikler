Charleville musket     the charleville muskets were .69 caliber french smoothbore flintlock muskets used in the 18th and 19th centuries . the charleville was used during the american revolutionary war by the americans and was later copied and manufactured in the us as the springfield model 1795 musket . about 1630 , frenchman marin le bourgeoys ( c.1550–1634 ) created the first `` true '' flintlock , also called the `` french lock '' . bourgeoys was in the service of king louis xiii of france for whom he created the flintlock mechanism . throughout the 17th century , flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models . in 1717 , the original `` charleville '' flintlock musket was made for the french military . this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all troops . while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as `` charleville muskets '' . they were named after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france . the standard french infantry musket was also produced at tulle , st. etienne , maubeuge arsenal , and other sites . while technically not the correct name for these muskets , the use of the name charleville dates back to the u.s. revolutionary war , when americans tended to refer to all of the musket models as charlevilles . it should be noted that the naming of these muskets is not consistent . some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flint lock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville .
