Astrocyte     astrocytes are characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord . they are also known collectively as astroglia . the proportion of astrocytes in the brain varies . studies have found that the astrocyte proportion varies by region from 20 % to 40 % of all glia . astrocytes do many things . they help the endothelial cells of the bloodâ€“brain barrier , provide nutrients to the nervous tissue , keep extracellular ions in balance . they also help repair the brain and spinal cord after traumatic injuries . research since the mid-1990s has shown that astrocytes release ca ions , and adjust brain functions . such discoveries have made astrocytes an important area of research in neuroscience .
