Armorer     a modern armorer is someone whose job is repairing , assembling and testing of small arms . originally , an armorer was a person who created armor for medieval knights and noblemen . today an armorer is someone who belongs to an organization such as the police or military and who maintains guns and weapons belonging to that organization . an armorer keeps these weapons in top working condition always ready for trouble-free use in the field . by doing this an armorer extends the service life of these weapons at minimum cost to the organization . a failure of a weapon in a crucial situation could cost lives . their job is similar ( but not the same ) as that of a civilian gunsmith . the medieval armorer had to be a combination of scientist , toolmaker , chemist , metallurgist , engineer and artist . he was highly skilled and worked with wood and leather as well as metals . an armorer also had to understand mathematics and geometry . much of his work revolved around high-end blacksmithing . because he did custom work and produced high quality armor for nobles and knights , he was paid more money than a blacksmith was . each suit of armor was made to order and would fit that person exactly . if any part of the suit of armor was damaged in battle , the armorer would repair it . in time of war an armorer also made armor for soldiers .
