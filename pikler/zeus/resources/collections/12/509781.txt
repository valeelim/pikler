The Hunting of the Snark     the hunting of the snark ( an agony in 8 fits ) is a nonsense poem written by lewis carroll , the pen name of charles lutwidge dodgson . the poem was written from 1874 to 1876. the setting , some creatures , and eight portmanteau words are taken from carroll 's earlier poem `` jabberwocky '' in his children 's novel `` through the looking-glass '' ( 1871 ) . the eight words are : `` bandersnatch '' , `` beamish '' , `` frumious '' , `` galumphing '' , `` jubjub '' , mimsiest ( which previously appeared as `` mimsy '' in `` jabberwocky '' ) , `` outgrabe '' and `` uffish '' . the first two stanzas contain one of the most famous quotations in nonsense poetry : the bellman refers the mediaeval use of a town crier or bellman . he would ring his bell , and shout `` oyez , oyez , oyez ! '' at set places in a town , and read out proclamations of legal decisions made by courts or the town council . this was necessary because most people were illiterate . another curiosity of the poem is that the crew of ten all have occupations beginning with the letter `` b '' .
