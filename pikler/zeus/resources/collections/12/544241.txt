Agonist     an agonist is a type of chemical known as a ligand . it binds to a receptor . it activates ( switches on ) the receptor to produce a response . an agonist causes an action . there are also antagonists which block the action of the agonists , and there are inverse agonists which cause an action opposite to that of the agonist . this is typical of the systems which regulate the body . being able to control activity is the basis of homeostasis . receptors can be activated by either endogenous or exogenous agonists . both types result in a biological response . endogenous agonists include hormones and neurotransmitters . exogenous agonists include drugs . a substance which causes the same bodily responses , but does `` not '' bind to the same receptor is called a physiological agonist . examples . - the endogenous agonist for serotonin receptors is serotonin , and the endogenous agonist for dopamine receptors is dopamine . - morphine is an exogenous agonist . it mimics the actions of endorphins at certain receptors in the central nervous system .
