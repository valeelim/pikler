MX record     in the domain name system , an mx record is something that a domain uses to tell people and software the ip address of an email server . there can be more than one mx record for a domain . when there is more than one record , dns uses a priority list that tells whatever is looking up the records to try the ip addresses in a certain order . for example , `` example.com '' might have a set of mx records that say for `` mail.example.com '' to try `` 127.0.0.5 '' first . if that try fails , another record will say to try `` 127.0.0.6 '' . this behavior makes email more reliable . related pages . - a record - aaaa record other websites . - the domain name rfc
