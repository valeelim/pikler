South Magnetic Pole     the south magnetic pole is the point on the southern hemisphere where the magnetic lines are directly pointing upward . in other words , if there were a magnet inside the earth axis ( from north to south ) , the south magnetic pole would be at its southern end . because the magnetic field of the earth changes , the exact location of ths pole does as well. , placing it off the coast of antarctica , between adelie land and wilkes land . in 2015 it lies at ( est ) . that point lies outside the antarctic circle . due to polar drift , the pole is moving northwest by about 10 to 15 kilometers per year . its current distance from the actual geographic south pole is approximately 2860 km . the nearest permanent science station is dumont d'urville station . wilkes land contains a large gravitational mass concentration .
