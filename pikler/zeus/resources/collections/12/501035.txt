Smith v. Allwright     smith v. allwright ( 1944 ) , was a landmark decision by the united states supreme court . the decision made it unconstitutional to keep african americans from voting in a democratic party primary in texas . by extension it covered white primaries in all states . it overturned `` grovey v. townsend '' ( 1935 ) which had allowed the democratic party to hold all-white primaries that excluded black voters . the reconstruction amendments to the united states constitution gave african americans freedom from slavery , citizenship and the right to vote . but many former slave states came up with ways to keep blacks from voting . these included poll taxes , literacy tests and complex voter registration laws . while these worked in most southern states , it did not work in texas . the party needed the hispanic vote but wanted to exclude blacks . they needed also to split the black and hispanic vote . texas , like most southern states , was a one-party state . the democratic party controlled politics . the state and local primary elections decided which candidate would ultimately win office in the general election . democrats in texas used the `` white primary '' to serve their purposes . it prohibited non-whites from joining the democratic party and taking part in primary elections . it could be used also to exclude mexican americans in areas of the state where the party did not need them . the reconstruction amendments applied to the state . but in `` grovey v. townsend '' the state of texas was allowed to pass on its responsibility for protecting black voter rights to a private organizationâ€”the democratic party . this allowed texas to use the all-white primary .
