Meridian arc     in geodesy , a meridian arc is the distance between two points with the same longitude . in geometry it is an arc : a segment of a curve . the length of an imaginary rope laid over the globe would be that distance . two or more such measurements at different places get the shape of the reference ellipsoid which is most like the shape of the geoid . this process is called `` the determination of the figure of the earth '' . the earliest determinations of the size of a spherical earth used a single arc . the latest determinations use astro-geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to get the reference ellipsoids . the alexandrian scientist eratosthenes about 240 bc , first calculated a good value for circumference of the earth . he knew that on the summer solstice at local noon the sun goes through the zenith in the ancient egyptian city of syene ( assuan ) . he also knew from his own measurements that , at the same moment in his hometown of alexandria , the zenith distance was 1/50 of a full circle ( 7.2Â° ) . assuming that alexandria was due north of syene , eratosthenes concluded that the distance between alexandria and syene must be 1/50 of earth 's circumference .
