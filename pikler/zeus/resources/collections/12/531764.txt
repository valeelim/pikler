Rank correlation     a rank correlation is any statistic that measures the relationship between rankings . a `` ranking '' is the assignment of `` first '' , `` second '' , `` third '' , etc . to different observations of a variable . a rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings . one might test for `` do colleges with a higher-ranked basketball program tend to have a higher-ranked football program ? '' a quite important question is `` do people with higher-ranked education tend to get higher levels of income ? '' some of the most used rank correlation statistics are 1. spearman 's ρ 1. kendall 's τ 1. goodman and kruskal 's γ an increasing rank correlation coefficient implies increasing agreement between rankings . the coefficient is inside the interval [ −1 , 1 ] and assumes the value : - 1 if the agreement between the two rankings is perfect ; the two rankings are the same . - 0 if the rankings are completely independent . - −1 if the disagreement between the two rankings is perfect ; one ranking is the reverse of the other .
