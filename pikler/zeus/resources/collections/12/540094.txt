Promiscuity     promiscuity is the practice of having casual sex frequently with different partners . in cultures where sexual activity happens only in exclusive committed relationships , promiscuity is criticized as a bad activity . a common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous is a one-night stand . what sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures , as does the frequency of promiscuity . a study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are judged equally harshly . a recent poll showed that both genders tend to express strong preference for sexually conservative partners . however , later studies show evidence for a double standard . promiscuity is common in many animal species . some species have promiscuous mating systems , ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships . many species form stable pair bonds , but still mate with other individuals outside the pair .
