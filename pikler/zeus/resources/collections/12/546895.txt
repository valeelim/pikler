Myco-heterotrophy     myco-heterotrophy is a relationship between certain plants and fungi . the plant gets all or part of its food from parasitism on fungi , not from from photosynthesis . in the past , non-photosynthetic plants were thought to get food by breaking down organic matter like fungi do . such plants were therefore called `` saprophytes '' . this was wrong . it is now known that `` no plant is physiologically capable of direct breakdown of organic matter '' . to get food , non-photosynthetic plants engage in parasitism , by myco-heterotrophy or direct parasitism of other plants . the interface between the plant and fungal partners in this association is between the roots of the plant and the mycelium of the fungus . myco-heterotrophy therefore closely resembles mycorrhiza , and is thought to have evolved from mycorrhiza .
