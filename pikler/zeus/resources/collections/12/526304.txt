Cranial nerve     a cranial nerve is any nerve which is attached directly to the brain or brainstem . this is different from spinal nerves which are attached to segments of the spinal cord . cranial nerves relay information more directly between the brain and body ( mostly parts of the head and neck ) . each cranial nerve exists as a pair and is present on both sides of the central nervous system . all cranial nerves appear above the first vertebra in the neck ( cervical vertebra ) . in humans there are twelve cranial nerves pairs . they are numbered using roman numerals iâ€“xii based on their order from the front of the brain to the back , where the brainstem is . cranial nerves provide motor and sensory stimulation mainly to places within the head and neck . this sensory stimulation includes sensations such as temperature , touch , taste , vision , smell , balance and hearing . the olfactory nerve ( cn i ) transmits information about odors to the brain . the optic nerve ( cn ii ) transmits visual information from the retina to the brain .
