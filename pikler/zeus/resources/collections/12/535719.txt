Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution     validated on december 5 , 1933 , the twenty-first amendment ( amendment xxi ) to the united states constitution canceled the eighteenth amendment to the united states constitution and ended the prohibition era in the united states . it is the only amendment to repeal another amendment . it is also the only amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures . the eighteenth amendment to the constitution had started a period in the us known as prohibition . during this time the manufacture , distribution , and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal . passage of the eighteenth amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement . but it soon proved highly unpopular . crime had soared under prohibition as gangsters , such as chicago 's al capone , became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol . the federal government was unable to enforce the volstead act . in 1932 , wealthy industrialist john d. rockefeller , jr. stated in a letter : as more and more americans opposed the eighteenth amendment , a political movement grew for its repeal . however , repeal was complicated by grassroots politics . although the u.s. constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments , only one method had been used up until that time . this was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states . however , the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby . for that reason , when congress formally proposed the repeal of prohibition on february 20 , 1933 , it chose the `` other '' ratification method established by article v. that is by state conventions .
