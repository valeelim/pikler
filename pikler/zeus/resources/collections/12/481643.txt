Pyramidion     a pyramidion ( plural pyramidia ) is the very top piece of an egyptian pyramid . they were called `` benbenet '' in the ancient egyptian language . in egypt 's old kingdom , pyramidia were made of diorite , granite , or limestone . these were then covered in gold or electrum . the gold would reflect the rays of the sun . in later times they were made from granite which had royal titles and religious symbols cut into them . very few pyramidia have still exist . most of those that have are made of polished black granite , with the name of the pyramid 's owner cut into them . there are four pyramidia on show in the main hall of the egyptian museum in cairo . they include the pyramidia from the black pyramid of amenemhat iii at dahshur and the pyramid of khendjer at saqqara . a badly damaged white tura limestone pyramidion is thought to have been made for the red pyramid of sneferu at dahshur . it has been rebuilt and put on show at the side of the pyramid . however it does not match , as its angles are steeper than that of the sides of the pyramid .
