Vertical-lift bridge     a vertical-lift bridge or lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the road surface . the vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge . they are generally easier to design and easier to build . they usually cost less to build for longer moveable spans . the counterweights in a vertical lift bridges are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck . bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted . as a result , heavier materials can be used in the deck , and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use . although most vertical-lift bridges use towers , each with counterweights . some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck . an example is the span bridge at st paul avenue in milwaukee , wisconsin , usa . another design used balance beams to lift the deck with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers . an example of this kind is the la salle street bridge in chicago , illinois , usa .
