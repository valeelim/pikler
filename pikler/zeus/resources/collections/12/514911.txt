Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor    frederick ii , holy roman emperor frederick ii ( 26 december 1194 â€“ 13 december 1250 ) , was one of the most powerful holy roman emperors of the middle ages and head of the house of hohenstaufen . his political and cultural ambitions , based in sicily and stretching through italy to germany , and even to jerusalem , were enormous . however , his enemies , especially the popes , prevailed , and his dynasty collapsed soon after his death . historians have searched for superlatives to describe him , as in the case of professor donald detwiler , who wrote : viewing himself as a direct successor to the roman emperors of antiquity , he was emperor of the romans from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death ; he was also a claimant to the title of king of the romans from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. as such , he was king of germany , of italy , and of burgundy . at the age of three , he was crowned king of sicily as a co-ruler with his mother , constance of hauteville , the daughter of roger ii of sicily . his other royal title was king of jerusalem by virtue of marriage and his connection with the sixth crusade .
