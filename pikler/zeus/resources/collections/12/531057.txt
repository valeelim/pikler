Sten Mk II     the sten mk ii was the main submachine gun of the british military in world war ii . early in the war , the us lent many weapons to the british to fight german forces , including the thompson submachine gun . however , since the thompson was expensive to make in large numbers , the british made a submachine gun of their own , that would be cheap and quick to make . this was the sten mk ii . the weapon was only made of 47 parts , making it relatively fast to put together and take apart and therefore easy to ship and hide . this feature made it popular among resistance fighters , including the free french . it was also the first smg to have a silencer made for it , making it useful for stealth and surprise . however , due to its low quality , it was not a very reliable weapon as it had the tendency to jam , and to fire entire clips without pulling the trigger . it is stated that british soldiers who captured german mp-40 's would often abandon the sten and fight using the mp-40 instead . the switch was not difficult since both weapons fired the same type of bullet , the 9x19mm parabellum , with the same type of clips ( which meant that they could use the enemy 's ammunition to load their stens or vice versa ) .
