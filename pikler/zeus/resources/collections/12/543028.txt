Internal Revenue Service     the internal revenue service ( irs ) is the part of the federal government of the united states responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws . the irs decides how much tax is owed and collects the revenue on a regular basis . the irs is the largest bureau in the united states department of the treasury . it is one of the world 's most efficient tax collection agencies . the irs processed over 224 million tax forms and collected over $ 2 trillion in revenue in 2004. beginning in 1791 , the federal government was supported by taxes on distilled beverages , tobacco , sugar , corporate bonds and slaves . these were indirect taxes , the only kind permitted by the united states constitution . in 1812 , the cost of the war added the first sales taxes on gold , jewelry , and silverware . in 1817 , the government did away with all these taxes and relied on the funds from tariffs on imported goods . during the american civil war , funds were needed to finance the war . in 1861 , congress drafted a bill for a direct tax on personal and corporate income . this first income tax charged 3 % on incomes over $ 800 . the bill passed both houses of congress but never went into effect . in 1862 , however , abraham lincoln signed a bill that called for a 3 % tax on incomes between $ 600 and $ 5,000 , 7.5 % on incomes between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 and 10 % on incomes over $ 10,000 . there were debates in congress over the constitutionality of the direct income tax , but no action was taken . it was allowed to expire in 1872 when it came up for renewal .
