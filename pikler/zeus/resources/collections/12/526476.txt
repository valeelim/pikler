James Braid     james braid ( 1795 - 1860 ) was a scottish surgeon and hypnotist . braid saw a demonstration of mesmerism by charles lafontaine in 1841 and began to explore and research the subject for himself . he argued that the trance like state that a person went into , which he called hypnotism , was a state of mind . he said it was not caused by the transferring `` mesmeric fluid '' or `` animal magnetism '' . he believed a hypnotic state could be caused by having a person stare at a small bright object . when a person was in a hypnotic state , they could be given suggestions which they did not remember when fully awake . he also noted changes in pulse and blood circulation , which he believed were able to cure some illnesses . he began using hypnotism and suggestion as way of treating some of his patients . braid wrote a book and several articles about his research and his ideas : - `` neurypnology , or , the rationale of nervous sleep '' ( 1843 ) . - the power of the mind over the body ( 1846 ) . - magic , witchcraft , animal magnetism , hypnotism , and electro-biology ( 1852 ) .
