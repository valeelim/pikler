Desert locust     the desert locust ( `` schistocerca gregaria '' ) is a species of locust . plagues of desert locusts threaten agricultural production in africa , the middle east , and asia . they have done so for centuries . the livelihood of one-tenth of the world ’ s human population may be affected by this voracious insect . the destructive swarms of locusts do not form every year , but only when conditions are right for them . the desert locust is potentially the most dangerous of the locust pests because of the ability of swarms to fly rapidly across great distances . it has two to five generations per year . the last major desert locust upsurge in 2004–05 caused crop loss in west africa and reduced food supply in the area . the desert locust alone is not responsible for famines , but it is a contributing factor . the insect does not have complete metamorphosis . its larvae develop in stages called `` instars '' . as the larvae get closer to adulthood , they are called `` nymphs '' or `` hoppers '' . there are two kinds of hopper : solitary and gregarious .
