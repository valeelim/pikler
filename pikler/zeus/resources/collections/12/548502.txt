Mud March     the mud march ( january 20 , 1863 – january 23 , 1863 ) was an attempt by union army major general ambrose burnside to attack lee 's confederate army of northern virginia . after the disastrous defeat of the army of the potomac at the battle of fredericksburg , burnside was anxious to redeem himself . he planned for his army to make a winter march across the rappahannock river on december 30 , 1862. but he had not informed president abraham lincoln of his plan . lincoln called him back . three weeks passed and this time , with lincoln 's implied approval , the army marched southward . however , winter rains made the roads nearly impassable . after four days the attempt ended in failure . on december 15 , 1862 , burnside 's union army withdrew from the battle of fredericksburg back to falmouth , virginia . it was a defeat for burnside and a win for lee . lee suffered 5,300 casualties defending fredericksburg . union losses were more than twice as many . in total burnside lost about 12,600 union soldiers ; killed , wounded , or missing . morale in the union army was very low that winter . there was political pressure from washington to continue the “ on to richmond ” offensive that had failed up that point in time . the northern newspapers reported that 75,000 confederate soldiers from lee 's army had been sent to reinforce the north carolina coast . burnside wanted to move against lee while the army of northern virginia was weakened . he personally scouted the area above falmouth for the best place for his army to cross the rappahannock . as late as january 15 , he was still looking at places to cross . confederate sharpshooters reported seeing burnside near banks ford and wondered what the general was up to . finally , burnside decided on banks ford and u.s. ford . he sent troops to muddy ford to draw attention away from his planned crossing points . on the morning of january 20 the army began to move .
