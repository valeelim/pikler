Article Five of the United States Constitution     article five of the united states constitution outlines how the constitution can be changed . changes to the constitution are called constitutional amendments . article five also says that there are certain clauses , or parts , of article one of the constitution that could not be amended right away . these clauses are explained in the `` protected clauses '' section . before the constitution was approved , the united states was covered by its first constitution , the articles of confederation . under the articles of confederation , amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures . not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment . if a single state senator or representative in the country disagreed with an amendment , the amendment would fail . this made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed . when the founding fathers wrote article five , they were trying to make sure changing the constitution was not too hard , but not too easy either . james madison later explained that the amendment process in the constitution `` guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the constitution too mutable ; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults .
