Ophiolite     an ophiolite is a section of the earth 's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level . the rocks which make up ophiolites are an altered form of basalt . the rocks are often green . they are found in the mountain belts such as the alps or the himalayas . they show where former ocean basins were consumed by subduction . this was one of the discoveries of plate tectonics . ophiolites have always played a central role in plate tectonic theory and the interpretation of ancient mountain belts . the stratigraphic sequence seen in ophiolites is caused by lithosphere-forming processes at mid-oceanic ridges : - sediments : muds ( black shale ) and cherts deposited after the crust formed . - extrusive sequence : basalt `` pillow lavas '' show magma/seawater contact . - vertical , parallel dikes fed lavas above . - gabbros from minerals settling from a magma chamber . - peridotite : mantle rock minerals , heated and pressured in orogeny ( mountain-building ) .
