Interchangeable parts     interchangeable parts is a basic concept of creating identical or nearly identical parts to be mass produced . these parts can then be put together to form a product . for example , cars , computers , furniture , almost all products used today , are made from interchangeable parts . these parts are made with precision machines so each part can fit in any product that uses this part . since it is no longer necessary to make each part one at a time and by hand , assembling products takes fewer workers . this lowers the cost of the product . interchangeability of parts also allows products to be repaired by replacing a broken part with an identical new part . eli whitney was the first to use interchangeable parts in manufacturing . several inventors have had the idea of interchangeable parts in the past . but their version of the idea revolved around parts that had very loose tolerances or were used only for very simple parts . in 1720 a swedish inventor named christopher polhem used interchangeable parts for clocks in his workshop . but the idea was not used outside his shops .
