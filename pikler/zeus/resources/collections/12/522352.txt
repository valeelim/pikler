Principia Mathematica     the principia mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics by alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell . it was published in 1910 , 1912 , and 1913. in 1927 , it appeared in a second edition with an important `` introduction to the second edition '' , and different notes at the end . it is often known as `` pm '' . the book was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proved . this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy . the authors believed that such a project could be done . however , in 1931 , g√∂del 's incompleteness theorem proved that `` pm '' , and any other attempt , could never reach this goal . for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed , either the system must be inconsistent , or there must in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them . one of the main inspirations and motivations for `` pm '' was the earlier work of gottlob frege on logic .
