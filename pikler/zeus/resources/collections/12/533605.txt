Constitutional right     a constitutional right is a right or freedom which is guaranteed to citizens by that country 's constitution . in the united states constitutional rights are guaranteed by the united states constitution . most of these rights are contained in the bill of rights , the first ten amendments to the us constitution . for example , nearly half of all the countries in the world have some form of guaranteed right to health care protected by their country 's constitution . however , a right to health care is not a constitutional right in the united states . besides the us , guatemala , haiti , mexico , bolivia , costa rica , colombia , honduras , nicaragua , and liberia are among those countries where citizens all have a constitutional right to own firearms . but only guatemala 's rights are as broad as the second amendment 's rights in the united states . the constitutions of about 182 countries guarantee some form of freedom of religion . the constitutional rights granted by the first amendment , including freedom of the press , freedom of speech , the right to petition and the freedom of assembly , are almost unique to the united states .
