Xanthophyll     xanthophylls are types of yellow pigments that can be seen in natural objects . they are found in the leaves of most green plants . they are difficult to see in a healthy leaf , because chlorophyll pigments make the leaf green . unlike chlorophyll , however , xanthophylls do not need light for production . therefore , leaves will only show the yellow pigments if the leaf does not get enough light ( etiolation ) . the name comes from the greek words for `` yellow '' ( `` xanthos '' , ) , and `` leaf '' ( `` phyllon '' , ) .
