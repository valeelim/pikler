Itanium     itanium ( ) is a type intel microprocessors with 64-bit chip architecture . itanium processors are sometimes used today for servers . itanium processors have been produced by hp and several other manufacturers . , itanium was the fourth-most deployed chip for business systems . when first released in 2001 , itanium 's speed was disappointing compared to other processor types . using existing x86 applications and operating systems was especially bad , with one test in 2001 showing that it was as fast as a 100 mhz pentium ( 1.1 ghz pentiums were on the market at that time ) . itanium did not have success compared to ia-32 or risc , and was even worse when x86-64 was released , which worked with older x86 applications . in an article from 2009 about the history of itanium — `` how the itanium killed the computer industry '' — journalist john c. dvorak reported `` this continues to be one of the great fiascos [ bad situations ] of the last 50 years '' . technology writer ashlee vance wrote that slowness in speed and release `` turned the product into a joke in the chip industry . '' in an interview , donald knuth said `` the itanium approach ... was supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write . ''
