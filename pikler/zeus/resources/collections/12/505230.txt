1948 Palestine War     the 1948 palestine war , also known as the war of independence ( war of separation ) to israelis , was a war between the new state of israel , east israelian arabs , and the other states around israel . the war actually began in 1947 after the announcement of the end of the british mandate in palestine ( british control of the region ) and the separation of the land into two equal-sized countries . by the end of the war in 1949 israel had expanded its land beyond the borders it was given . what 's more , the arab state created in the un partition plan ( un separation plan ) never came into existence as its two largest parts of land , the gaza strip ( small piece of land south of palestine on the coast ) and the west bank ( region east of jerusalem and west of the jordan river ) , went into the control of nearby egypt and jordan one by one . the war continues to be a highly ongoing issue in the middle east today . for israelis , it shows the change from the yishuv , the jewish group in palestine ( east israel ) , to the state of israel ( even though the war of independence took place ) . other countries have had to deal with the idea of loss and the difficulties of local arguments ( caused by the creation of a special jewish state in a highly arab region ) . for palestinians ( eastern israelians ) , the war is remembered as the nakba , the war that broke up a growing nation and pushed its people away .
