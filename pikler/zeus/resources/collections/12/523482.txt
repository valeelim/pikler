Satellite navigation     a satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly . satnav uses a system of satellites . the system gives exact positioning . it allows small electronic receivers to find their position ( longitude , latitude , and altitude/elevation ) . the position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line ( line of sight ) by radio from satellites . the signals also allow the receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision . a satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) . global positioning system is the biggest and most used gnss . glonass , owned by russia , is the second biggest . china , india , and the european union are working on similar systems of their own .
