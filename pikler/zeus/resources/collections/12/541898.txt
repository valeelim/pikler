Roll cage     a roll cage is a specially designed protective frame built in ( or sometimes around ) the passenger compartment of a vehicle . generally made of welded steel tubing , a roll cage is a safety feature in the event of a rollover or crash . roll cages are used mainly in auto racing and off-road sports such as rockcrawling . the roll cage also stiffens and adds strength to the vehicle which improves handling . when the cage is constructed on the outside of a vehicle it is usually called an `` exo-cage '' . there are many different roll cage designs depending on the application . different racing organizations have differing requirements and regulations for roll cages . a roll bar is a single bar behind the driver that provides some protection . due to the lack of a protective top , some modern convertibles use a strong windshield frame which acts as a roll bar . also , a roll hoop may be placed behind both front headrests . a newer form of rollover protection , pioneered on the mercedes-benz r129 in 1989 , are hidden roll hoops . when sensors detect the vehicle is about to roll over , the roll hoops quickly extend and lock in place . cars that have this kind of `` deployable rollover protection '' system include the peugeot 307 cc , volvo c70 , mercedes-benz sl 500 , and jaguar xk .
