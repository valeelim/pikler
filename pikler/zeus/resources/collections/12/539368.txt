Ben Roy Mottelson     ben roy mottelson ( born july 9 , 1926 ) is an american-born danish nuclear physicist . he won the 1975 nobel prize in physics for his work on the non-spherical geometry of atomic nuclei . mottelson was born in chicago , illinois . he graduated from lyons township high school in lagrange , illinois . he received a bachelor 's degree from purdue university in 1947 , and a ph.d. in nuclear physics from harvard university in 1950. in 1950–51 , james rainwater ( 1917 – 1986 ) and aage bohr ( 1922 – 2009 ) had developed models of the atomic nucleus . it began learn the behaviour of the individual nucleons . mottelson worked with aage bohr to share the theoretical models with experimental data . in three papers which were published in 1952–53 , bohr and mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment , for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum . this work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies . rainwater , bohr and mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 nobel prize in physics `` for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection '' .
