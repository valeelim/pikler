Einherjar     in norse mythology , the einherjar ( lone-fighters ) are warriors who have died in battle and are brought to valhalla by valkyries . in valhalla , the einherjar eat meat from the boar called sæhrímnir . every day he is boiled and every night he becomes whole again . they drink mead provided by a goat named heiðrún . every day they dress for battle and go out and fight each other . this is to prepare for the events of ragnarök ( the end of the world ) . the einherjar are written about in the `` prose edda '' by snorri sturluson . also in the poem written in the 13th century `` hákonarmál '' , by eyvindr skáldaspillir .
