False memory     both perception ( `` experiencing '' ) and remembering are processes which involve the brain . for this reason , errors do sometimes occur . errors in perception are commonly called illusions . emil kraepelin used the term `` erinnerungsverfälschung '' ( memory falsification ) to speak about false memories . perceptions need stimuli to be created . a perception without a stimulus is called hallucination . much like the difference between illusion and hallucination , kraepelin wanted to distinguish between a false memory and memories of something that did not really happen , which he called `` erinnerungsfälschung '' . unfortunately , both german terms translate to the same english term . a false memory is a condition where a person remembers something that did not occur or where the memory does not closely match the occurrence . using suggestion and hypnosis , it is possible to make people believe they experienced something , when they did not . such phenomena also occur spontaneously , for example in a stressful situation , or when someone is not sleeping enough .
