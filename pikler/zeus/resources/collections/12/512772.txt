Seasonal breeder     seasonal breeders are animal species that mate only during certain times of the year . these times of year are usually best for the survival of the young . factors include ambient temperature , food and water availability , and even changes in the predation behaviors of other species . the sexual interest and mating behavior goes on only during this period . female seasonal breeders will have one or more oestrous cycles only when she is `` in season '' or fertile at this time she is naturally ready to mate . at other times of the year they are not sexually interested . male seasonal breeders may have changes in testosterone levels , testes weight , and fertility depending on the time of year . for example , male greater sage-grouse actually gain weight as their bodies get ready for the spring breeding season . seasonal breeders are different than opportunistic breeders . these are species which mate whenever conditions allow it . they are also different from continuous breeders like humans that mate year-round .
