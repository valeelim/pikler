Christmas carol     a christmas carol ( also called a noël , from the french word meaning `` christmas '' ) is a carol ( song or hymn ) whose lyrics are on the theme of christmas . they are traditionally sung on christmas itself or during the surrounding holiday season . carols were first sung thousands of years ago in europe . they were sung by pagans at the celebration of the winter solstice . later , medieval carols were sung in elaborate formal rituals ( such as the catholic mass ) . as they are known today , christmas carols date back to about the 19th century . the tradition of going from house to house was not a part of christmas caroling at first . it dates back further to anglo-saxon traditions . the word `` wassail '' comes from the anglo-saxon toast `` wæs þu hæl '' , meaning `` be in good health '' . wassailing likely predates the norman conquest in 1066. the wishing of good fortune to neighbors produced the song `` here we come-a-wassailing '' . another song , `` we wish you a merry christmas '' , also comes from the wassailing tradition . the two forms , singing and wassailing , came together during the victorian era in england . they produced the modern custom of christmas caroling .
