Rare-earth magnet     rare-earth magnets are strong permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements . developed in the 1970s and '80s , rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets made . they have much stronger magnetic fields than other types such as ferrite or alnico magnets . there are two types : neodymium magnets and samarium-cobalt magnets . some rare-earth magnets such as terfenol-d are magnetostrictive . they also have uses e.g . in speakers . rare earth magnets are extremely brittle and also vulnerable to corrosion , so they are usually plated or coated to protect them from breaking , chipping , or crumbling into powder .
