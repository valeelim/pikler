Flintlock     a flintlock is a general term for firearms that use the flintlock firing mechanism . it can also refer just to the firing mechanism itself . a flintlock uses a piece of flint held in a locking jaw . when the trigger is pulled , a hammer with the flint attached falls , striking a piece of steel called a `` frizzen '' . this causes a spark which causes the gunpowder in the pan ( directly below the flint ) to ignite . through a small hole , this ignites the main powder charge in the breech of the gun causing it to fire the round ball , shot or bullet . the flintlock was a very popular type of musket for over 200 years . flintlocks were available with smoothbore and later rifled gun barrels . the first form of flintlock appeared in 1570 and was called a snaphaunce . about 1630 , frenchman marin le bourgeoys created the first `` true '' flintlock , also called the `` french lock '' . bourgeoys was in the service of king louis xiii of france for whom he created the flintlock mechanism . the french lock simplified the snaphaunce design by creating a one-piece , l-shaped frizzen . this is the style seen on most flintlocks today .
