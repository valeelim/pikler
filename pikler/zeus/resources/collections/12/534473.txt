Probability density function     a probability density function is a function that can be defined for any continuous probability distribution . the integral of the probability density function in the interval formula_1 yields the probability that a given random variable with the given density is contained in the interval provided . the probability density function is necessary to be able to work with continuous distributions . casting a dice will give the numbers 1 to 6 , with a probability of formula_2 , but this is not a continuous function , as only the numbers 1 to 6 are possible . in contrast , two people will not have the same height , or the same weight . using a probability density function , it is possible to determine the probability for people between and , or between and , even though there are infinitely many values between these two bounds .
