Tension pneumothorax     a tension pneumothorax is when air builds up inside the chest . so much air builds up that one or both lungs may collapse . this causes serious breathing problems . also , the air in the chest pushes on the heart and other important parts of the body , and causes other serious problems . if it is not treated quickly , a tension pneumothorax will kill a person . a tension pneumothorax usually happens because of an injury to the chest . for example , a knife or gunshot wound will cause a hole in a person 's chest . air then gets sucked in through that hole . the air starts to build up . it pushes on the lungs . if the knife or gun has also caused a hole in the person 's lung , air will leak out of the lung . that air will also build up in the chest . when enough air is pushing on the lung , the lung will collapse . a tension pneumothorax can also happen because of other kinds of chest injury , like from a car accident or a fall . when a person gets injured this way , there may not be any hole in his chest . but inside the body , the person may be bleeding badly . instead of air , blood builds up in the chest . it pushes on the lung and makes it collapse . this is called a `` hemothorax '' .
