Sulfur cycle     sulfur ( s ) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate . the majority of sulfur is stored underground , for example under the ocean or in rocks . it also occurs naturally in places like swamps ( where organisms have decomposed ) and volcanoes . humans add excess sulfur into this cycle , usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion . steps of the sulfur cycle . - as rocks are worn down by erosion they release sulfur that was once stored , becoming so once it touches the air - plants absorb this sulfur through photosynthesis and make this sulfur organic - animals , specifically herbivores and omnivores consume the sulfur when they eat the plants - sulfur moves through the food chain as secondary consumers and tertiary consumers eat the primary consumers - when animals and plants die , the sulfur dissipates into the atmosphere as sulfate and also through the body of the decomposers - the sulfur in the atmosphere is returned to the soil and water cycle when it rains
