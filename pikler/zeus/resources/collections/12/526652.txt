Pulmonary edema     pulmonary edema ( pulmonary oedema in british english ) is fluid in the lungs ( `` pulmonary '' means `` lungs '' ; `` edema '' means `` swelling '' or `` fluid '' ) . normally , the lungs fill with air when a person breathes in . from the alveoli in the lungs , oxygen goes into the blood . the blood then carries oxygen to the entire body . every part of the body needs oxygen to survive . when a person has fluid in their lungs ( pulmonary edema ) , there is not enough space left for air to get into the lungs . the person will not be able to breathe in as much air . this means not as much oxygen will get into the blood , and the body will not get the oxygen it needs . the most common cause of pulmonary edema is heart failure on the left side of the heart . the left side of the heart is supposed to pump blood to the entire body . if the left side of the heart is too weak to do this , blood will back up into the lungs . this is called `` cardiogenic pulmonary edema '' . ( `` cardiogenic '' means `` caused by the heart . '' ) other , `` non-cardiogenic '' causes of pulmonary edema include :
