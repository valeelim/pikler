' you ca n't draw the line like that . whether he agrees with it or not , he did n't write it — i wrote it . so you have to say , 'well , it 's just a part of being in this band . ' now jeff and i , we do n't give a fuck . if jeff wrote something i had a problem with , i would never even raise a fucking finger . i 'd be like , 'fuck yeah , let 's do it ! gon na piss someone off ? alright !
