Peremptory challenge     a peremptory challenge is a right during voir dire ( the process of selecting a jury ) to reject a certain number of potential jurors without having to give a reason . the word `` peremptory '' means without a reason given ; allowing no contradiction or refusal . peremptory challenges may be made by either party to the proceedings . this kind of challenge has been more difficult to use because the supreme court of the united states has prohibited peremptory challenges ( also called peremptory strikes ) based on gender or race . different jurisdictions allow different numbers of peremptory challenges to each side . some jurisdictions allow additional peremptory challenges . in united states federal courts each side is allowed three peremptory challenges . also , if there are more than two parties involved in the proceeding the court may allow additional challenges or restrict the number for all parties . to insure an impartial jury , during voir dire , prospective jurors are questioned by the lawyers and the court . either lawyer may challenge a juror for cause . reasons may include the prospective juror 's opinions on issues , personal knowledge of the case , their occupation or any reason to believe the juror may not be able to be fair . unlike peremptory challenges , challenges for cause may not be limited to a certain number in most jurisdictions . the reason for either type of challenge is that each lawyer is trying to find jurors who are sympathetic to their case .
