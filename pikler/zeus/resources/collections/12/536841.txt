Mamba     mambas are fast-moving venomous snakes of the genus `` dendroaspis '' ( means `` tree asp '' ) . it belongs to the elapidae family . they are native to africa . the black mamba is one of the well-known species and is also the most feared . other members include the eastern green mamba , western green mamba and jameson 's mamba . most mambas are arboreal , meaning they live in trees . the only exception is the black mamba , which lives on land . all mamba species hunt during the day . they prey on birds , lizards and small mammals . there are many stories of mambas chasing humans , but these snakes usually prefer to avoid contact with humans . humans are actually their main predators , rather than prey . because mambas and cobras are in the same family , they share some similarities . like the cobra , a mamba might display a hood when threatened . however , a mamba 's hood is more narrow and is longer . a mamba usually opens its mouth when threatened , so they lean forward unlike the cobra which usually stands erect .
