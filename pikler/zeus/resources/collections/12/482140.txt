Single nucleotide polymorphism     a single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp , pronounced `` snip '' ; plural `` snips '' ) is a dna sequence variation in a population . a snp is just a single nucleotide difference in the genome . for example , sequenced dna fragments from two people , aagccta to aagctta , is different in a single nucleotide . in this case we say that there are two `` alleles '' . almost all common snps have only two alleles . snps occur most often in regions of the dna which do not affect the survival of the organism : otherwise they would be weeded out by natural selection . other factors , like genetic recombination and mutation rate , can also affect snp density . there are variations between human populations , so a snp allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another . these genetic variations between individuals ( particularly in non-coding parts of the genome ) are sometimes exploited in dna fingerprinting , which is used in forensic science . also , these genetic variations cause differences in our susceptibility to disease . the severity of illness and the way our body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations . for example , a single base mutation in the apoe ( apolipoprotein e ) gene is associated with a higher risk for alzheimer 's disease .
