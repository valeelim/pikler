Coffin ship     coffin ships transported irish immigrants to america and other colonies during the great irish famine ( 1845-1852 ) . they were the cheapest way to cross the atlantic but it was a miserable and dangerous journey . the conditions on board were horrible because the ships were so crowded . also , there was little food and water . there were often diseases on board . one third ( 30 % ) of the passengers died before the arrival in canada or the usa . legend says sharks liked to follow coffin ships because the crew threw the dead bodies overboard .
