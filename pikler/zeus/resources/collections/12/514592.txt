DNA methylation     dna methylation is the main way gene activity is adjusted during life , especially during early development . it is a process by which methyl groups are added to dna . this suppresses gene transcription . two of dna 's four nucleotides , cytosine and adenine , can be methylated . since adenine methylation is restricted to prokaryotes , all eukaryote transcription is regulated by suppressing cytosine . suppressing genes is the basis of epigenetics , the study of changes in gene activity which are `` not '' caused by changes in the dna sequence . it is the study of gene expression , the way genes bring about their phenotypic effects . the changes in gene activity by methylation may last for the rest of the cell 's life , and for many generations of cells through cell divisions . however , there is no change in the underlying dna sequence of the organism . instead , non-hereditary factors cause the organism 's genes to behave ( express themselves ) differently .
