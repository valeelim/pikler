Essential fatty acid     essential fatty acids , or efas , are fatty acids that humans and other animals must eat . the body needs them for good health but can not make them . only two fatty acids are essential for humans . when the two efas were discovered in 1923 , they were called `` vitamin f '' , but in 1929 , research on rats showed that the two efas are fats rather than vitamins . some other fatty acids are `` conditionally essential '' , meaning that they may become essential under some circumstances .
