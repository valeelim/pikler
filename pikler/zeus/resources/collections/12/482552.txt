Predicate (grammar)    predicate ( grammar ) the predicate in traditional grammar is the second part of a clause or sentence , the first being the subject . a predicate completes an idea about the subject , such as what it does or what it is like . the predicate provides information about the subject . the subject np is shown in green , and the predicate vp in blue . there is a quite different theory of sentence structure , called dependency structure grammar . this puts the finite verb ( = conjugated verb ) as the root of all sentence structure . it rejects the binary np-vp division .
