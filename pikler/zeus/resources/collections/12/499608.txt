Georg Simon Ohm     georg simon ohm ( 16 march 1789 - 6 july 1854 ) was a german physicist and mathematician . during part of the time in his life , ohm worked as a school teacher . some of his research focused on the new electrochemical cell , invented by italian scientist alessandro volta . using equipment he had created himself , ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference ( voltage ) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current . this relationship is known as ohm 's law . in 1881 , after his death , the si unit for electrical resistance was named `` ohm '' in his honour . the uppercase greek letter omega ( Ï‰ ) is used for the unit .
