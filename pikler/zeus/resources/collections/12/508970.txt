Hybrid vigour     hybrid vigour ( or hybrid vigor ) is the improved activity and survival of hybrid offspring . the technical term in genetics is heterosis . inbreeding in a normal population leads to the offspring getting worse , less fit , less fertile and usually not living as long as the parents . the opposite , outbreeding , leads to fit , healthy , fertile offspring . this effect has been known for a long time . animal breeders have known it since the 18th century , and darwin investigated it in detail with plants . on the other hand , when two parents are from widely different populations , such as different subspecies , this usually does not apply . in that case it is more usual for the hybrids to have lower fitness . mules are usually not fertile , and that automatically makes then of lower fitness , as that term is used in biology . they are very hardy animals , but they leave few offspring . the puzzle for scientists has been to explain these facts . when a population is small or inbred , it tends to lose genetic diversity . the loss of fitness is due to loss of genetic diversity . inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles . recessive alleles tend to be mildly harmful . heterosis or hybrid vigor , on the other hand , is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness .
