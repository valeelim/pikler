Madame de Montespan     françoise de rochechouart , marquise of montespan ( 5 october 1640 – 27 may 1707 ) , better known as madame de montespan , was the most celebrated mistress of king louis xiv of france , by whom she had seven children . she came to public notice having spent several years in fashionable parisian `` salons '' where it quickly became clear she was an intelligent , witty and very attractive woman . she eventually gave herself the nickname athénaïs in honour of the ancient greek goddess athena . as a result of this she is also referred to as `` athénaïs de montespan '' . she lived at the same time as barbara palmer , 1st duchess of cleveland , the mistress of charles ii of england . due to the marriages of her descendants she is an ancestress of several royal houses in europe , including those of spain , italy , bulgaria and portugal . she was also responsible for the creation of the now destroyed `` trianon de porcelaine '' as well as the larger and grander château de clagny . the latter building has often been likened to the palace of versailles , just on a smaller scale . she was also called `` the real queen of france '' in her lifetime due to her strong influence over the king and royal court .
