Results of the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016    results of the democratic party presidential primaries , 2016 < noinclude > this article will show the current results of the democratic party presidential primaries , 2016. the democratic party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates , or people that represent someone , to go to the 2016 democratic national convention . people in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency , and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive . the primaries began on 1 february 2016 in iowa . the remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders . on june 6 , 2016 , the associated press reported that senator hillary clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive democratic nominee . however , their count includes some superdelegates . since superdelegates can vote however they want at the democratic convention , their votes could change at any time before then , so it is possible ( but only remotely possible ) that clinton will not get the nomination . bernie sanders endorsed clinton on 12 july 2016 .
