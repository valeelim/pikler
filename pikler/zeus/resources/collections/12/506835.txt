Kantō Plain     the is the largest plain in japan . it is in the kanto region of central honshū . the total area 17,000 km covers more than half of the region . it extends over tokyo , saitama prefecture , kanagawa prefecture , chiba prefecture , gunma prefecture , and tochigi prefecture . a number of plateaus make up a large part of the plain . these large plateaus are divided into smaller ones by shallow river valleys . volcanic ash from surrounding volcanoes are thought to have been deposited on these plateaus . what is unusual is the overall tilt of the plateaus and hills . the entire area is slightly bent or slanted and forms a basin centered in the tone river and tokyo bay . tectonic changes are still happening , as the plain ’ s central region gradually sinks lower towards sea level .
