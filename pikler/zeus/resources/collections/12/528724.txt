Tobacco mosaic virus     the tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) was the first virus to be discovered . that is to say , it was the first to be known as a virus . it is a single stranded rna virus which infects many plants , especially tobacco and other members of the family solanaceae . the infection causes `` mosaic '' -like discolouration on the leaves . although it was known from the late 19th century that an infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops , it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was known to be a virus . in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections . in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent . he that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through finest filters . in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant . beijerinck coined the term of `` virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature .
