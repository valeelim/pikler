Stotting     stotting ( or pronking ) is a behaviour of some bovines , particularly gazelles . they spring into the air , and lift all four feet off the ground simultaneously . usually , the legs are held in a relatively stiff position and the back may be arched with the head pointing downward . many explanations of stotting have been proposed . at least in some cases it is an honest signal to predators that the stotting animal is not worth pursuing . stotting makes a prey animal more visible and uses up energy and time that could be spent escaping . therefore , it is assumed that it must bring some benefit to the stotting animal . a number of possible explanations have been proposed . stotting may be : 1. a good means of rapid escape or jumping over obstructions . this can not be true in thomson 's gazelles because they do not stot when a predator is less than about 40 m away . 1. an anti-ambush behaviour : animals in tall grass may leap into the air to detect potential predators . 1. an alarm signal to other members of the herd that a predator is hazardously close thereby increasing the survival rate of the herd .
