Tax deduction     a tax deduction is a way to reduce the amount of income that is subject to a tax . tax deductions and tax credits both lower the amount of money a person has to pay in taxes . but they do it differently . a tax deduction is subtracted from a the gross income of a taxpayer . for example , if a couple had an income of $ 60,000 for the year , and they had paid $ 10,000 in interest on their mortgage , their taxable income would be reduced to $ 50,000 . the value of a tax deduction depends on a person 's tax rate , which rises with income . a tax credit , by comparison , has the same value for all taxpayers . in the us there are hundreds of different tax deductions . some are only available to taxpayers in certain income brackets . some are available to businesses in particular industries .
