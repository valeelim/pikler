Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution     ratified on april 8 , 1913 , the seventeenth amendment ( amendment xvii ) to the united states constitution changed the method by which united states senators were elected . for the first 125 years of the constitution required us senators to be elected by the state legislatures . a number of problems in the united states senate created the need to change how senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the united states . when the constitution was adopted in 1788 , senators were to be elected by the state legislatures . this remained in effect for 125 years . by the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure . in addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years , political machines had gained control over state legislatures . this corrupted the process and the senate was seen as a `` millionaire 's club '' who served private interests instead of the people . beginning in the 1890s , the house of representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed senators be elected by direct election . the senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals .
