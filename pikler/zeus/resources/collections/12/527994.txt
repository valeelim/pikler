Doping (semiconductor)    doping ( semiconductor ) in electronics , doping is the process of adding certain chemical elements to a semiconductor in order to change its electrical properties . these elements are tiny impurities . this is done to create diodes that make electricity go in one direction , or to make transistors and semiconductor switches . when an element called boron is added to silicon , the boron `` dopant '' is called an `` acceptor '' because it likes accepting electrons . when a chemical called phosphorous is added to silicon , the phosphorous is called a `` donor '' because it does not like electrons .
