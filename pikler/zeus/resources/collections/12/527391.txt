Mustafa al-Maraghi     muhammad mustafa al-maraghi ( 1881â€“1945 ; ) was an egyptian modernist reformer and rector of al-azhar in the 1930s . he was one of the students of muhammad 'abduh . he called for social , legal and educational changes and pursued a strong campaign - begun by muhammad 'abduh and finished by mahmoud shaltout - to include the modern sciences in al-azhar 's curriculum . to that end he organised committees to reform the university 's regulations and curriculum and created a supervisory department for research whose responsibilities included publishing and translation . mustafa al-maraghi was the link between the reforms of his mentor muhammad abduh and such subsequent leaders of al-azhar as mustafa abd al-raziq , abdel-halim mahmoud and mahmoud shaltout . as a reformer , al-maraghi believed in islam 's flexibility and ability to adapt to the needs of modernity . he called for the exercise of ijtihad ( independent reasoning/interpretation ) , reinterpretation , and opposed taqlid ( imitation or emulation ) , the blind following of tradition . and he attributed the religious , moral , intellectual , and political decline of islamic peoples to the adherence to taqlid and the lack of ijtihad . he said that after the first three centuries , ijma ' ( consensus of the muslim community or scholars for resolving legal questions ) was impossible , because scholars were so scattered in the east and west that usually it was not possible to collect their opinions .
