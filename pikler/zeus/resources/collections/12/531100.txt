Hui people     the hui people ( ) are one of the 56 recognized ethnic groups in china . even though they are ethnically related to the han chinese ( being from the central plains ) they are considered distinct from them because the majority practice islam and speak arabic , unlike most of the han chinese . they are called the hui ( which translates into `` return '' in chinese ) because the chinese recognize that one of the five pillars of faith in islam is the hajj , or pilgrimage to mecca . a traditional name for islam in chinese is `` huíjiào '' ( ) for the same reason .
