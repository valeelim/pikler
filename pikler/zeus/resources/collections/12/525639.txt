Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory     eulerâ€“bernoulli beam theory ( also known as engineer 's beam theory or classical beam theory ) is a simple method to calculate bending of beams when a load is applied . this applies to small deflections ( how far something moves ) of a beam without considering effects of shear deformations . therefore , it can be considered a special case of the timoshenko beam theory . it was first introduced around 1750. it gained popularity during the development of the eiffel tower and the ferris wheel in the late 19th century . after that , it was used in many engineering fields including mechanical engineering and civil engineering . although other advanced methods have been developed , the euler-bernoulli beam theory is still widely used because of its simplicity . leonhard euler and daniel bernoulli were the first to put together the theory in 1750. at the time , science and engineering were viewed differently than today . mathematical theories such as the euler-bernoulli beam theory were not trusted for practical engineering use . bridges and buildings continued to be designed using the same methods until the late 19th century . this is when the eiffel tower and ferris wheel showed the validity of the theory on a larger scale .
