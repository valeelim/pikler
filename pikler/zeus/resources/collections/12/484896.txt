Independence (mathematical logic)    independence ( mathematical logic ) in mathematical logic , a sentence is independent from a first-order theory , if that theory can not be used to prove the sentence as true or false . sometimes , people also talk about the sentence being `` undecidable '' , but this has nothing to do with the notion of decidability as in solving a decison problem .
