Structural load     structural loads or actions are forces , deformations , or accelerations applied to a structure or its components . a load is the amount of weight a structure has to carry . loads cause stresses , deformations , and displacements in structures . structural analysis is the calculation of the effects of loads on physical structures . excess load or overloading may cause structural failure . this is a consideration in the design and construction of a structure . mechanical structures , such as aircraft , satellites , rockets , space stations , ships and submarines , have their own particular structural loads and actions . in a vehicle , especially trucks , the chassis is designed to carry the structural load . in many cars unibody construction is used where the metal skin ( or other materials ) is designed to carry the load . gravity on earth is an attractive force that affects all objects . a gravity load is one that the downward force of gravity affects . the following are typical loads exerted against most structures :
