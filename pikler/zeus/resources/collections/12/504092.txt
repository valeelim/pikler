Automeris io     automeris io is the north american io moth . it has anti-predator defences common in the lepidoptera . the adults have a two-stage defence system : first they are cryptic with their wings closed . if predators get too near , they flash their vivid eye markings . this startles the predator , and the moth has time to fly off and hide . the adults are nocturnal , they only fly at night , and during the day they sit on tree trunks or branches . very widespread , the moth ranges from southern canada to mexico and costa rica . in between , it is found widely in the usa . they do not eat , and live only about a week : all they do is reproduce . this is typical of saturniid moths . they have sexual dimorphism as can be seen from the illustrations , and fly at night . the females come out of the cocoon with ready-made eggs , and the males pick up the female pheromones with their extra-big antennae . the caterpillars live together ( are gregarious ) , and travel in single file all over the food plant . they start off orange in colour , and eventually turn bright green . as they grow in size they become covered with stinging spines . the spines deliver a very painful venom which is released at the slightest touch .
