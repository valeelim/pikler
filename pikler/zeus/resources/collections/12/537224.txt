Address bus     an address bus is a computer bus architecture . it is used to transfer data between devices . the devices are identified by the hardware address of the physical memory ( the physical address ) . the address is stored in the form of binary numbers to enable the data bus to access memory storage . a collection of wires connecting the cpu with main memory that is used to identify particular locations ( addresses ) in main memory . the width of the address bus ( that is , the number of wires ) determines how many unique memory locations can be addressed . modern personal computers and macintoshes have as many as 36 address lines . that lets them , which enables them theoretically to access 64 gigabytes of main memory . however , the actual amount of memory that can be accessed is usually much less than this theoretical limit due to chipset and motherboard limitations . an address bus is part of the system bus architecture , which was developed to decrease costs and enhance modular integration . however , most modern computers use a variety of individual buses for specific tasks .
