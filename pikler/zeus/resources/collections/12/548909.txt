The end justifies the means     the end justifies the means is a phrase of sergey nechayev , the 19th century russian revolutionary . it means that if a goal is morally important enough , any method of getting it is acceptable . it was later picked up and used to justify murderous acts by lenin and stalin . the idea is ancient , but it was not meant to justify unnecessary cruelty . it was part of a political philosophy called consequentialism . the basic idea is that a policy can be judged by its outcome . all modern versions of consequentialism have to deal with the limitations necessary to prevent tyrants abusing this sensible idea .
