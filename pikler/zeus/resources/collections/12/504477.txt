Turin King List     the turin king list , also called the turin royal canon , is a list of the kings of egypt . it was written in egyptian hieratic script on papyrus . it is thought to date from the rule of pharaoh ramesses ii . the list is now in the egyptian museum in turin . the papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the egyptians . it is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of ramesses ii . the papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of ramesses ii , during the middle of the new kingdom , or the 19th dynasty . the beginning and ending of the list are lost . there is no introduction , and the list stops after the 19th dynasty . it may have been written at any later time , from ramesses ii to as late as the 20th dynasty . the papyrus lists the names of rulers , the lengths of their rule in years , with months and days for some kings . in some cases they are grouped together by family . this grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of manetho â€™ s book . the list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time , or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources .
