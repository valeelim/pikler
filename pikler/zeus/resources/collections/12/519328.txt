French American     french americans ( french : `` américain français '' ) , also called franco-americans ( french : `` franco-américain '' ) are americans who identify themselves to be of french or french canadian descent . about 11.8 million u.s. residents are of french or french canadian descent . about 2 million speak french at home . an additional 750,000 u.s. residents speak a french-based creole language , according to the 2011 census . americans of french descent make up a substantial percentage of the american population . however french americans are less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups . this is due in part to the high degree of assimilation among huguenot ( french protestant ) settlers . also , there is a tendency of french american groups to identify more strongly with `` new world '' regional identities . these include québécois , french canadian , acadian , cajun , or louisiana creole . this has prevented the development of a wider french american identity . other websites . - extensive studies , documents , statistics and resources of franco american history
