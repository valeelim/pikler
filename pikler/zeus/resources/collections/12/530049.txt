Slave ship     slave ships were large cargo ships specially converted for the purpose of taking slaves , especially newly captured african slaves to the americas . living conditions for slaves on these ships was inhuman . men , women and children were crowded into every possible space leaving no room to move or even breathe . there was little food and the smell could not be described . between 1526 and 1867 about 12.5 million slaves were sent by slave ships from africa to the americas . but only about 10.7 million slaves actually arrived . of all human migrations it was the most costly in terms of human lives lost . the average time to sail across the atlantic took from 60 to 90 days . sometimes the trips took up to four months . ship captains were under orders by slavers to deliver only saleable slaves . starving , sick or troublesome slaves were often thrown overboard into the ocean to drown . sometimes africans were kept on deck chained together with long chains . there were times when they would jump overboard , taking every other chained slave with them , to avoid their unknown fate . many ships kept extra crew members on deck to prevent this from happening . at other times crew members would throw slaves overboard as a warning to other slaves . if the ship was running out of food or water , all the slaves would be killed to save the crew from starving .
