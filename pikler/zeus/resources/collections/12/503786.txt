Hinge teeth     hinge teeth are part of the inner surface of the shell of a bivalve mollusc . bivalves by definition have two valves ( parts of the shell ) . they are joined together by a strong and flexible ligament on the hinge line at the dorsal ( top ) edge of the shell . in life , the shell needs to be able to open slightly to allow the foot and siphons to protrude , and then close again , `` without the valves moving out of alignment with one another '' . to make this possible , the two valves usually have hinge teeth ( the `` dentition '' ) . like the ligament , the hinge teeth are along the hinge line of the shell . in most families , the two valves of the shell are almost perfectly symmetrical with one another along the hinge line , though the placement and shape of the teeth may differ slightly in the left valve and right valve so the two valves fit together properly . each group of bivalves tends to have distinctive hinge teeth . because of this , examining the arrangement of the hinge teeth in a bivalve shell is often essential for identification and classification .
