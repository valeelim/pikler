Gunshot residue     gunshot residue ( gsr ) is one of the results of firing a gun . when a bullet leaves the barrel of a firearm , it is accompanied by gases that include both burned and unburned particles of gunpowder . it also includes traces of metal from the firearm , the ammunition and the primer including the signature components of gunshot residue : lead , barium and antimony . gsr is usually found on the skin and clothing of the person who fired the gun . it may also be found in the entrance wound of the victim . this depends on how close the victim was to the gun when it was fired . when a gun is fired , a plume of gas—including gsr particles—is ejected from the barrel and any other openings in the gun . the gunshot residue is deposited on objects that are close to the fired gun including the gun itself . crime scene specialists collect gsr from people and objects when there is reason to believe it may be there . the collected samples are then taken to a laboratory where they are examined . forensic scientists can also use gsr residue to determine the distance between the barrel of the fired weapon and the target . the farther from the weapon the less the gunshot residue . collection of gsr is time sensitive in many cases . after 4 to 8 hours it may wear off people 's hands . it can remain for longer periods on a dead body or other objects . a number of advancements have been made in gunshot residue examinations in recent years . one improvement is in the use of scanning electron microscopes .
