Logistic Regression     logistic regression , also known as `` logit regression '' or `` logit model '' , is a mathematical model used in statistics to estimate ( guess ) the probability of an event occurring having been given some previous data . logistic regression works with binary data , where either the event happens ( 1 ) or the event does not happen ( 0 ) . so given some feature x it tries to find out whether some event y happens or not . so y can either be 0 or 1. in the case where the event happens , y is given the value 1. if the event does not happen , then y is given the value of 0. for example , if y represents whether a sports team wins a match , then y will be 1 if they win the match or y will be 0 if they do not . this is known as `` binomial logistic regression '' . there is also another form of logistic regression which uses multiple values for the variable y. this form of logistic regression is known as `` multinomial logistic regression '' . logistic regression uses the logistic function to find a model that fits with the data points . the function gives an 's ' shaped curve to model the data . the curve is restricted between 0 and 1 , so it is easy to apply when y is binary . logistic regression can then model events better than linear regression , as it shows the probability for y being 1 for a given x value . logistic regression is used in statistics and machine learning to predict values of an input from previous test data .
