New England Emigrant Aid Company     the new england emigrant aid company ( est.1854 ) , originally the massachusetts emigrant aid company , was a transportation company in boston , massachusetts . it was created to transport immigrants to the kansas territory . this was intended to make sure kansas would become a free state . the company was created by eli thayer , a member of the massachusetts house of representatives , over a month before the kansas-nebraska act was passed in 1854. this act allowed the population of kansas territory to choose for themselves whether or not slavery would be legal . the concept was called popular sovereignty . the company was chartered in massachusetts and started with a capital of $ 5 million . thayer 's plan was to play on antislavery sentiment in the northern united states . at the time there was a very delicate balance between slave states and free states . the company send settlers to kansas to buy land and build houses , shops and mills . the settlers could then sell the land at a significant profit and send the money back to thayer and his investors . because several investors found the idea of profiting from the antislavery cause unpleasant , the company 's model was shifted to that of a benevolent society . the name was changed to the new england emigrant aid company in 1855. the company never achieved a profit or made a significant impact on the population of kansas . but , it caused border ruffians from nearby missouri , where slavery was legal , to move to kansas in order to ensure its admission to the union as a slave state . this in turn further galvanized free-staters and abolitionists to act . to protect the settlers they sent , the company secretly sent armed men and sharps rifles to kansas . the rifles were sent in crates marked `` books '' and `` bibles '' . this played a part in what would become bleeding kansas .
