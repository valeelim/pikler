Traction (engineering)    traction ( engineering ) traction , or tractive force , is the force used to generate motion between a body and a surface . this is usually due to friction , though the use of shear force of the surface is also commonly used . traction can also mean the maximum tractive force between a body and a surface , as limited by available friction . when this is the case , traction is often expressed as the ratio of the maximum tractive force to the normal force and is termed the `` coefficient of traction '' ( similar to coefficient of friction ) . traction is an important force to motor vehicles . tires , usually made of rubber , depend on traction to move a vehicle forward . in manual transmission cars and trucks , a clutch is a friction device that connects the engine to the drivetrain of the vehicle . to work properly , the clutch must have traction .
