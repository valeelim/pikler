Crossbill     the crossbills are a genus , `` loxia '' , of birds in the finch family ( fringillidae ) . there are three to five ( or possibly many more ) species . these birds have mandibles with crossed tips , which gives the group its english name . adult males tend to be red or orange in colour , and females green or yellow , but there is much variation . crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones . the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones . these birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes , where their food sources grow . they move ( `` erupt '' ) out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails . crossbills breed very early in the year , often in winter months . this is the time to get the most cones . they put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones . then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart . this lets them get at the seed ( usually two seeds per scale ) . the point is that , as cones mature , they tend to open when dry and close when wet .
