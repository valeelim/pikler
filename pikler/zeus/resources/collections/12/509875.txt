Messerschmitt Bf 110     the messerschmitt bf 110 is a twin-engine fighter aircraft . it used two daimler-benz db 600 engines . it was designed as a long-range 3-seat escort fighter in 1935. the first prototype flew on may 12 , 1936. the plane was used by the german `` luftwaffe '' in the world war ii . in germany it was called `` zerst√∂rer '' ( the destroyer ) . early in the war germany had great success with the plane until they attacked great britain . in the battle of britain the bf 110c was no match for britain 's supermarine spitfire and hawker hurricane fighters . the planes designed as escorts ( to bombers ) had to be escorted themselves . they were slow in turns which was a major flaw in the design . the hurricane 's could out-turn them and the spitfires could out-run them . after very heavy losses they were withdrawn from the battle . the bf 110s were reassigned to other duties . one role they were well suited for was as night fighters . major heinz-wolfgang schnaufer , germany 's top night fighter ace , claimed 121 victories flying a bf 110 .
