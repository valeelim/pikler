Easter Jeep Safari     the easter jeep safari is an annual event hosted by the red rock 4-wheelers off-road club . four-wheelers come from all parts of the united states and other countries to challenge the rough terrain of the backcountry in the moab , utah area . while the title does say it is a festival of jeeps , there are no restrictions on vehicle make or models used . however , all vehicles are expected to have high ground clearance four-wheel drive vehicles with two-speed transfer cases . no atv 's or utv 's are allowed . the easter weekend safari lasts for nine days , going through easter sunday . when going 4-wheeling , people can either go alone , or join up in a group . groups usually meet up early in the day , at a certain location in the city . first waivers are signed and collected , then the drivers are given instruction and told to comply with any and all bureau of land management regulations ( i.e . stay on the trail , avoid walking on protected soil , etc. ) . groups will then head out to the trails for the day . once a group arrives at a trail , they will partially deflate ( `` air down '' ) their tires to get better traction on sand or slick rock . once the air down is completed they will begin through the trail and depending on the trail and the number of stops , it can take anywhere from a few hours to all day .
