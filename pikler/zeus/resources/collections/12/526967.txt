Esperanto alphabet     esperanto alphabet is the alphabet , which they use to write the esperanto language . it has 28 ( twenty-eight ) letters . esperanto alphabet is based on roman alphabet ( as well as english alphabet is ) . contrary to english it has not got the letters `` q '' , `` w '' and `` y '' but it has got 6 ( six ) letters with diacritic ( special mark above the letter ) `` ĉ '' , `` ĝ '' , `` ĥ '' , `` ĵ '' , `` ŝ '' and `` ŭ '' . because esperanto uses letters with diacritic , there was ( and sometimes still is ) need to write text in esperanto even if the special letters are not available . ludovic lazarus zamenhof , the creator of esperanto , proposed so called `` h-system '' ( in esperanto : `` h-sistemo '' ) . they write instead of diacritic letter an letter without diacritic after witch they put the letter `` h '' , only with exception of `` ŭ '' , which does not follow this rule . for example `` ĝ '' becomes `` gh '' , `` ĥ '' becomes `` hh '' and `` ŭ '' becomes `` u '' . in cases when they write an word which contains letters appearing to be a diacritic letter , but it does not stand for a diacritic letter , they can `` break '' it by an apostrophe . for example `` flughaveno '' ( an airport ) becomes `` flug'haveno '' .
