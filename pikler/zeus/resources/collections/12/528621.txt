Tau Ceti     tau ceti ( τ cet , τ ceti ) is a star in the constellation cetus . it can be seen with the unaided eye as a third-magnitude star . it has a spectrum similar to the sun , but is only 78 % of the sun 's mass . it is just under 12 light-years from the solar system , a relatively nearby star . it is the closest solitary g-class star . the star appears stable , and is `` metal-deficient '' because ( like the sun ) it is mostly made of hydrogen and helium . there is more than ten times as much dust surrounding tau ceti as in the solar system . there are probably five planets orbiting tau ceti , two in the habitable zone . because of its debris disk , any planet orbiting tau ceti would get far more impact events than earth . despite this , its sun-like characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star . tau ceti is consistently listed as a target for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( seti ) , and it appears in some science fiction literature . project ozma searched for intelligent life ( seti ) by examining selected stars for artificial radio signals . it was run by the astronomer frank drake , who selected tau ceti and epsilon eridani as the first targets . both are near the solar system and are similar to the sun . no artificial signals were found after 200 hours of observations . subsequent radio searches of this star system have also turned up negative .
