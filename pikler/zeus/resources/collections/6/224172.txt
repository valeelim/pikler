Chelicerata     the chelicerata are a sub-phylum of the arthropods . the sub-phylum consists of only two classes : the arachnids and the merostomata . the merostomata are the extinct eurypterids and the horseshoe crabs ( xiphosura ) . the horseshoe crabs are a small , ancient group which has survived relatively unchanged for millions of years . groups like this are often called living fossils . the arachnida is the huge and successful terrestrial ( air-breathing ) group of spiders and their relatives . the chelicerates originated as marine animals . the first confirmed chelicerate fossils , the eurypterids , date from 445 million years ago in the late ordovician period . although only four marine species survive , all of them horseshoe crabs , there are over 77,000 species of air-breathing chelicerates , and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species . the pycnogonids may or may not be chelicerates . this is in dispute , as genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods . there are 1,300 species of these 'sea spiders ' .
