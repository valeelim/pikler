Mesonychid     mesonychids were the first mammalian carnivores after the extinction of the dinosaurs . these `` wolves on hooves '' are an extinct order of carnivorous mammals , closely related to artiodactyls . mesonychids first appeared in the early palaeocene with the genus `` dissacus '' . they went in decline at the end of the eocene , and became extinct in the early oligocene . at the start of the palaeocene , there were ( so far as we know ) no large carnivores on land . the surviving mammals and birds evolved into many of the ecological niches previously occupied by dinosaurs and pterosaurs . this process is called adaptive radiation . the mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores . they soon had competition . by the later palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores . the giant flightless bird `` gastornis '' appeared in the upper palaeocene , and the creodonts had also evolved . the creodonts became an important order , and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids .
