Cutscene     a cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen . usually cutscenes tell part of the story , such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on . sometimes , however , a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game , like a boss showing up , a ship taking off , or a building falling down . there are many different types of cutscene . some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow . others may be animated like a cartoon . sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine . many new games use prerendered scenes , meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file . prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine , but some use computer-generated imagery ( cgi ) , which is separately made 3d graphics which are usually fancier than the game 's normal graphics . prerendered scenes with cgi are often used for a game 's intro video .
