Dew     dew is a thin film of water that has condensed on the surface of objects near the ground in the morning or evening . these objects cool in the night . when they cool , the thin layer of air around them cools too . this makes some water vapor condense on the object . the condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled . the temperature when condensation begins is called the `` dew point '' . if the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 °f ( 0 °c ) , the dew turns into frost . most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the atmosphere . however , some studies suggest that it also comes up through the soil and then condenses on the ground . this happens , though , only when conditions are right . dew forms best when the atmosphere is clean , the air is calm , and there is not much wind . it does not always form in the night and outdoors , though . they also work when eyeglasses get steamy in warm , wet rooms . dew may also happen in industrial processes . however , people use the word condensation more often than dew .
