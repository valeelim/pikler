Decision theory     decision theory is a mathematical theory about how to best reach a decision . this is done using probability theory , statistics and logical reasoning . a decision can be made in different ways . decision theory usually picks the best decision by looking at the consequences each way to decide might have . in most cases , decision theory is normative and prescriptive . most of the time , it assumes the decision maker has `` perfect knowledge '' . decision makers know all the consequences , and case take the best pick . there are three branches of decision theory : 1. normative decision theory : the decision makers take rational choices . there is also a set of axioms that describe the decision process . this allows to reach a decision through the use of logic . this describes how to reach a decision . 1. prescriptive decision theory : this tries to help people reach better decisions , through the use of models to follow . humans have only limited capabilities to reach a decision . this is taken into account .
