Fair catch     a fair catch is part of american football . a receiver of a punt may signal for a `` fair catch '' when the ball is in the air . to signal for it , the receiver must wave one arm over his head from side to side . once he signals for it , no one from the other team is allowed to touch him . when the receiver catches the ball , he may not run with it . the play ends at that spot , and his team takes possession where he caught it .
