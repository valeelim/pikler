Haploid     haploid is the term used when a cell has half the usual number of chromosomes . a normal eukaryote organism is composed of diploid cells , one set of chromosomes from each parent . however , after meiosis , the number of chromosomes in gametes is halved . that is the haploid condition . in humans , the diploid number of chromosomes is 46 ( 2x23 ) . the number in haploid cells ( sperm and eggs ) is 23. some types of animals are haploid , such as male hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) . this is a special genetic system called haplodiploidy . some plants and animals are polyploid , with more than two sets of chromosomes . for example , one species of wheat is hexaploid , with six sets of chromosomes , although other species of wheat have only two sets . because so many organisms are diploid , it can become confusing whether haploid refers to one set of chromosomes or more than one . the special term monoploid can be used ; it means one set of chromosomes . related pages . - cell division - meiosis - karyotype
