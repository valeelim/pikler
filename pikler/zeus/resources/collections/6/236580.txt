Hypermodern     the hypermoderns were a school of chess players who set out to rethink some of the principles of chess openings . the name was given to them by the polish-french grandmaster tartakower . the key idea was , in reaction to the older ideas of siegbert tarrasch , to dispute control of the centre by more subtle methods . whereas old theory was to occupy the centre with two or three pawns immediately , the hypermoderns concentrated more on attacking the opponent 's centre . a characteristic first move was 1nf3 with white , or 1 ... nf6 with black , especially in reply to 1d4 . to 1e4 they favoured an asymmetric defence such as 1 ... e6 or 1 ... c5 rather than the classical reply 1 ... e5 . nimzovich was the founder , and alekhine , tartakower , réti , grünfeld , and bogolyubov all took part . all were top grandmasters of the 1920s and 30s . several modern openings owe their popularity to this group : alekhine 's defence ( 1e4 nf6 ) ; réti 's opening ( 1nf3 ) ; the king 's indian defence ( 1d4 nf6 2c4 g6 3nc3 bg7 ) ; the grünfeld defence ( 1d4 bf6 2c4 g6 3nc3 d5 ) and the modern defence ( 1 ... g6 ) .
