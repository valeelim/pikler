Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion     the sonata for two pianos and percussion is a musical composition by the hungarian composer béla bartók . it was written for a very unusual combination of players . four players are needed to perform this sonata : two pianists and two percussion players . the two pianists each have a piano , and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them : three timpani , xylophone , one side drum with snares and one without , a suspended cymbal , a pair of cymbals , a bass drum , a triangle and a tam-tam . in the introduction to the score bartók gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played , the kinds of beaters to be used , and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage . there are three movements : a fast movement , a slow movement and a fast movement . the first movement starts with a slow introduction . there are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music . for example , in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos . this means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down . the player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this . this movement is in sonata form .
