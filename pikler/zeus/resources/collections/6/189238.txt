Ponzi scheme     a ponzi scheme is a special kind of fraud . it is based on a fake investment that one schemer ( or group of schemers ) gets other people to give money to . in ponzi schemes , the schemer basically says , `` i found a great way to make money fast . the more you give me , the more i can invest in that cause , and the more i can earn for us all '' . but a ponzi scheme does n't actually `` earn money '' . instead , `` all '' of the scheme 's money comes from the investors . once a ponzi scheme gets too many investors , the system will always crash . this is because the investors all expect more money than they invested , and they will get impatient . these schemes always stop one of three ways : 1. the schemer runs away with the money they got . this is what schemers try to do . 1. the schemer runs out of money ; they will be unable to promise money back right away . this is called `` liquidity '' , and makes investors panic and demand their money back , often all at once . 1. authorities find out about the scheme and stop it .
