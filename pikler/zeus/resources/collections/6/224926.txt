Sentience     sentience is being capable of feeling , consciousness or having some form of mind . eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think ( `` reason '' ) from the ability to feel ( `` sentience '' ) . in simple english , to be sentient means displaying and/or having the ability to : 1. feel 1. perceive 1. desire 1. possibly will , though this goes beyond some definitions . in the philosophy of consciousness , `` sentience '' can refer to the ability of any thing to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , `` qualia '' . thinking about sentience is important when studying animal rights . this is because feeling is needed in order to suffer . the basis of animal rights is that some animals have emotions , can feel pain and also feel happy and well .
