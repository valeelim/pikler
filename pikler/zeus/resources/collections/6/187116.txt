System requirements     system requirements refer to a checklist of minimum necessary items for a computer to have . these items would be requirements in order for an operating system to work , such as windows xp . if the system did not have these things , the computer or operating system might crash or cause problems . if it exceeds minimum expectations , you could check the recommended system requirements , and see if it also meets those . if it does not , it is not bad . but if it does meet the recommended requirements , that is very good to know .
