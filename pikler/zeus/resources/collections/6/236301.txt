Emperor Kōan     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' ruled from the palace of `` akitsushima-no-miya '' at muro in what will come to be known as yamato province . kōan is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes kōan as the fifth of . emperor kōan was the second son of emperor kōshō . `` jinnō shōtōki '' records that his mother was yosotarashi-no-hime , who was the daughter of okitsuyoso , and ancestress of the owari . the absence of information about kōan does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . this emperor 's official name after his death ( his posthumous name ) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to kōan .
