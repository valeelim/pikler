Wilhelm Roux     wilhelm roux ( jena , germany , 9 june 1850 – 15 september 1924 ) was a german zoologist and pioneer of experimental embryology . for ten years he worked in breslau ( now wroclaw ) , becoming director of his own institute of embryology in 1879. he was professor at innsbruck , austria from 1889–95 , then accepted a professorial chair at the anatomical institute of the university of halle , a post he retained until 1921. roux 's research was based upon the notion of `` entwicklungsmechanik '' or developmental mechanics . his methodology was to interfere with developing embryos and observe the outcome . roux 's investigations were performed mainly on frogs ' eggs to research the earliest structures in amphibian development . his goal was to show darwinian processes at work on the cellular level . in 1888 , roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle . he reported that they grew into half-embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined . this led him to propose his `` mosaic '' theory : after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic , each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design .
