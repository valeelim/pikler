Intel Core i7     intel core i7 is a name that the company intel uses for the computer processors it makes for high-end desktop and laptop computers and tablets . intel uses this name for the fastest processors that they think will be used to build the most powerful consumer devices . the 'core ' part of the name , which refers to the processor 's core , has been used by intel since 2006 , but the first core i7 processor was released 3 years later in 2009. there are different types of core i7 processor . the name does not name a type . instead , it is the name for all of the fast processors that intel thinks should be sold to consumers . intel uses two other `` core i- '' names for its processors for consumers : `` core i5 '' and `` core i3 . '' the `` core i5 '' processors are mostly as fast as i7 processors , but lack the hyper threading technology which allows each core to be used twice simultaneously giving the impression of doubling the cores . intel uses a different name , xeon , for processors that intel makes for `` server '' computers for businesses ( and some rare laptops ) . some of the `` core i7 '' processors are almost the same as some of the `` xeon '' processors , but each of the xeon processors is a little bit different than the `` core i7 '' processor , because a `` server '' computer is not the same as a consumer computer . intel also makes other `` xeon '' processors that are not the same as any `` core i7 '' processor . unlike the core i7 , xeon processors support ecc ( error corrected ) memory , and multiple cpus on the same motherboard .
