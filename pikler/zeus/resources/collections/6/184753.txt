Aisha     aisha bint abu bakr ( 604-678 ; ) was the third wife of prophet muhammad . aisha is given honour in islam , especially in the sunni branch . she is often called by muslims `` umm-al-mu'minin '' which means `` the mother of the believers '' . aisha was the daughter of um ruman and abu bakr of mecca . aisha was six or seven years old when she was betrothed to muhammad . ( marriage under the age of 21 was common at the time worldwide ) she was not muhammad 's only wife . the reason for her young age may have been to make sure she was a virgin . her ten-year marriage to muhammad ended when he died . aisha lived fifty more years in and around medina . much of her time was spent learning the quran , and the sunnah of muhammad .
