Wannsee Conference     the wannsee conference was a meeting of senior members of the nazi german government . it was held in the berlin suburb of wannsee on 20 january 1942. the conference was to tell leaders of government departments that dealt with jews , that adolf eichmann had been put in charge of the `` final solution to the jewish question '' ( in german : 'die endl√∂sung der judenfrage ' ) . they were expected to give the plan their full support . heydrich presented a plan for removing the jewish population of europe and french north africa ( morocco , algeria , and tunisia ) to german-occupied areas in eastern europe . those people that were fit , would be put to work on road building projects . it was expected that they would be worked to death . the survivors would be executed when the projects were finished . the plan was never carried out as planned , as it was based on the continued german occupation of polish and soviet lands . instead , as the soviet army gradually pushed back the german lines , most of the jews of german-occupied europe were sent to concentration or death camps , or killed where they lived . because of the effort of historian joseph wulf , the wannsee house , where the conference was held , is now a holocaust memorial .
