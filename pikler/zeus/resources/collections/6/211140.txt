Degenerate art     degenerate art ( ) was the term used by the nazi regime in germany to describe nearly all modern art . the nazis banned the art because they said it was un-german or was jewish or bolshevist in nature . artists who were labeled as degenerate were punished by the laws . they were not allowed to teach , they could not show or sell their art , and some were even forbidden from creating any art at all . `` degenerate art '' was also used as the name for an exhibition put on by the nazis in munich in 1937. the exhibition was made up of modern artworks , displayed badly , with text labels making fun of the art . this was meant to make people hate modernism . the show traveled to several other cities in germany and austria . while modern styles of art were not allowed , the nazis liked paintings and sculptures that were very traditional and old fashioned . they thought art should glorify nazi ideas of the `` blood and soil '' values of racial purity , militarism , and obedience . music was also expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences ; movies and plays were censored . the censorship was done by the ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda .
