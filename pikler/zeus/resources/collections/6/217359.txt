Carmichael number     in number theory a carmichael number is a composite positive integer formula_1 , which satisfies the congruence formula_2 for all integers formula_3 which are relatively prime to formula_1 . being relatively prime means that they do not have common divisors , other than 1. such numbers are named after robert carmichael . all prime numbers formula_5 satisfy formula_6 for all integers formula_3 which are relatively prime to formula_5 . this has been proven by the famous mathematician pierre de fermat . in most cases if a number formula_1 is composite , it does not satisfy this congruence equation . so , there exist not so many carmichael numbers . we can say that carmichael numbers are composite numbers that behave a little bit like they would be a prime number .
