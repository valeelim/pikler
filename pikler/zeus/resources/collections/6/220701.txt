Airbus A310     the airbus a310 is a jet airliner made by airbus . it was announced in july 1978 and it was the second aircraft to be made by airbus . the a310 is a shorter version of the airbus a300 , which was airbus ' first plane . when the airbus a300 was being designed , airbus studied many different sizes of plane . the airbus a300b was chosen , and it was one of the smaller designs . when the a300b prototypes were made , many airlines asked for a plane which could hold more passengers . airbus then changed to the a300b2 version , which was the first type to be made . airbus noticed that many airlines also wanted smaller planes . some airlines did not have enough passengers to use the a300 . airbus wanted to keep the cost of designing a smaller a300 as low as possible . airbus decided that the plane would hold 220 passengers , which was what many airlines wanted . another problem was the rate of inflation . in the uk during 1979â€“1980 , it was 35 % . this would mean that the designing costs would be very high , and so would the price of the plane .
