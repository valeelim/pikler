Soap made from human corpses     during world war ii , many people thought that the nazis were making soap from the bodies of jewish people who died in the concentration camps . the yad vashem memorial has said that the nazis did not make a lot of soap from jewish bodies . yad vashem says that the nazis used rumors about making soap from bodies to frighten camp inmates . however , there is evidence that research facilities had come up with a way for large amounts of soap to be made from human bodies . during world war i , the british had already accused germany of using the fat from human bodies to make things . in april 1917 , an important newspaper in london , england called `` the times '' wrote that the germans were using the bodies of their own dead soldiers to make soap and other products . it was not until 1925 that the british foreign secretary , sir austen chamberlain , officially said that the `` corpse factory '' story had been an error . stories that the nazis made soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were common during the war . germany did not have enough fats to make soap during world war ii . because of this , the government took control of making soap .
