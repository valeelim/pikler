Toroidal inductors and transformers     toroidal inductors and transformers are a kind of electronic component . they typically consist of a circular , ring-shaped magnetic centre . the magnet is usually considered a monopole , although the central axis will have a dipole , and have the advantage of being wound continuously in a single direction , thus there is no inductive interference between windings as in a solenoid that is wound back and forth . other websites . - approximate inductance of a toroid includes formula , but assumes circular windings
