Harry Patch     henry `` harry '' patch ( born 17 june 1898 - 25 july 2009 ) was an ordinary man for most of his life . patch fought bravely in the trenches in world war i. he became a plumber and firefighter . he never talked to anybody about his terrible experiences in the trenches . when he was 100 years old he decided he should tell people about what he had seen in the war . he still had 11 more years to live after that . when he died at the age of 111 he was the last british person who had fought in the first world war . this is why he was known as `` the last tommy '' . for the last seven days of his life he was the oldest man in europe . he did not want to have a state funeral . the funeral was at wells cathedral . a very large number of people came . they were mostly ordinary people , but there were also some important people including the camilla , duchess of cornwall . for many of the people there it was a last opportunity to pay respects to the people who fought in the war . harry decided to talk about his experiences because he wanted everyone to realize how terrible wars are . when he talked to the bbc he said : `` ... if any man tells you he went over the top and he was n't scared , he 's a damn liar . '' in the same series , he talked about his friends who were killed , and about the moment when he came face to face with a german soldier . he remembered the bible story about moses coming down from mount sinai with god 's commandment , 'thou shalt not kill ' . he could not bring himself to kill the german . instead , he shot him in the shoulder , which made him drop his rifle . but the german carried on running towards patch 's gun , so he then shot him above the knee , and in the ankle . patch said , `` i had about five seconds to make the decision . i brought him down , but i did n't kill him .
