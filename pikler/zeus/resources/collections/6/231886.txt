Organic farms     organic farms grow foods without using man-made chemicals ( like pesticides or herbicides ) which can harm the environment or wildlife . organic farmers usually use animal manure rather than man-made chemical fertilizers which add extra nutrients to the soil . organic foods are unique to the way other foods are produced as they can cause a lot of harm to the environment by decreasing the quality of soil and increasing energy use , carbon emissions , pesticides and nitrate pollution . flower growers and ordinary home gardens can use organic methods too . an example of organic farming which is often used in the garden is biological control . biological control means using natural methods to get rid of pests , instead of using poisons . for example by encouraging ladybirds ( ladybugs ) into the garden as they eat aphids ( greenfly ) .
