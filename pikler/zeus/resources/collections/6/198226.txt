Mass number     the mass number ( symbol : a ) of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus . the mass number is different for each isotope of a chemical element . we write a mass number after an element 's name or as a superscript to the left of an element 's symbol . for example , the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . we write it as carbon-12 or c. mass number is not the same as : - atomic number ( symbol : z ) , which is the number of protons in a nucleus of an atom - atomic mass ( symbol : `` m '' ) , which is the mass of a single atom , commonly expressed in unified atomic mass units - relative atomic mass ( symbol : `` a '' , also called `` atomic weight '' ) , which is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom . the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( `` n '' ) in a given nucleus : `` n `` = `` a `` âˆ’ `` z '' . the mass number is not shown on the periodic table . for each element , what is shown is the `` standard atomic weight '' and the `` atomic number '' .
