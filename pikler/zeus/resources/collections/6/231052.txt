Radiolaria     radiolaria are amoeboid protists which produce mineral skeletons . the skeletons , usually of silica ( sio ) , have a central capsule . this divides the cell into inner and outer portions , called `` endoplasm '' and `` ectoplasm '' . radiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean , and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze . radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the palaeozoic era . they take their name from the radial symmetry of most species . they are valuable markers or diagnostic fossils , because they have a rapid turn-over of species . this helps to identify strata , and to correlate strata at different sites . radiolaria are heterotrophs ( eat other things ) , but also may include protist algae as endosymbionts . the skeletons of radiolarians are generally organized around spicules , or spines , which extend from the main skeletal mass . formed from the fusion of many of these spines is the outermost skeleton , the shell or `` test '' . connecting this shell to the many concentrically organized inner shells are bars or beams , which strengthen and support the structure .
