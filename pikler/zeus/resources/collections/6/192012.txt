Three-body problem     the three-body problem is a problem in the field of physics that experts find interesting . when a thing is moving , it has energy of movement . scientists use a short-cut when they talk about this energy , they call it 'e . ' the energy `` e '' of movement is assumed by scientists to be small compared to their mass , allowing such experts to describe the bodies with non-relativistic mechanics . this implies that all the movement refers to velocities small compared to the speed of light `` c '' . in a field called classical mechanics , experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves . under this discipline , the system can not be considered `` conservative '' . experts in another field called quantum mechanics , say , in addition , at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible , so , it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant . the three-body problem also happens in astronomy . the problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies , that influence each other with gravitation . the first to state the problem was isaac newton , in `` principia '' . usually , two of the bodies are large , and the third is small . in the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force , and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly . if this is not the case , the problem is solved through iteration and approximation .
