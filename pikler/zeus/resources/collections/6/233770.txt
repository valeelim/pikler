D major     d major is a major scale based on d. its key signature has two sharps . its relative minor is b minor . d major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument , which has its four strings tuned to g d a e. the open strings resonate with the d string , producing a special rich sound . because of this , many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in d major . examples include mozart 's ( no . 2 , 1775 , no . 4 , 1775 ) ; ludwig van beethoven 's ( 1806 ) ; paganini 's ( no . 1 , 1817 ) ; brahms 's ( 1878 ) ; tchaikovsky 's ( 1878 ) ; prokofiev 's ( no . 1 , 1917 ) ; stravinsky 's ( 1931 ) ; and korngold 's ( 1945 ) . it is also suitable for guitar music , with drop tuning for the lowest string making two ds as open strings . for some beginning wind instrument students , however , d major is not a very good key , because it transposes to e major for b flat instruments . e major has four sharps , which is harder for new learners to play . still , the clarinet in b-flat is often used for music in d major . it is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well . however , when some composers write a piece in d minor with b-flat clarinets , they change to clarinets in a if the music changes to d major .
