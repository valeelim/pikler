Binary form     binary form ( or ab form ) is a type of form of music pieces . the term binary means `` in two parts '' , while form in music acts as a kind of guideline for composers to design or shape a piece of music . when `` binary '' and `` form '' join together , you will get a basic definition of `` an outline in two parts '' . a musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections . binary form was popular in the baroque period and often used to structure movements from sonatas for keyboard instruments . generally , a piece in binary form will compose of two parts , which are roughly the same in duration and tones . there are only a few differences between the first part ( a ) and the second part ( b ) . the second section is longer than the first section and both often repeat . binary form was most commonly used in the baroque era for short dances called minuets . the minuet 's two parts are usually labeled as `` a '' and `` b . '' in the a section of a minuet , the exposition is stated . this section almost always is repeated a couple times . the beginning part of the b section develops a slightly new musical idea , usually going to the dominant key , to add variation . then it returns to the home key for the finish . some famous composers of minuets include johann sebastian bach and george frideric handel .
