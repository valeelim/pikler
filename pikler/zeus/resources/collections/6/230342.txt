Colony (biology)    colony ( biology ) a colony in biology refers to a life-style or habit where members of the same species live together . usually the members of a colony are genetically linked by common heredity . sometimes , as in bryozoa , they are genetically identical clones , sometimes as in eusociality , they are members of an extended family . sometimes , as with the portuguese man o ' war , the members of the colony are joined together as one individual , which operates as a single unit . most of the colonies in the groups listed below build a common structure or nest . sometimes they are linked only by their behaviour . the close integration of termites , ants , bees and wasps is called eusocial . the term applies mostly to animals , though there are some protists and prokaryotes which live as colonies . groups with colonial species . - bryozoa - choanoflagellata - cnidaria - corals - portuguese man o ' war - entoprocta - graptolites - insecta - isoptera - hymenoptera - ants - bees - wasps - phoronida - sponges - tunicates
