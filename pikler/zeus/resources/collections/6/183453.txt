Celtic Christianity     celtic christianity refers to the early medieval christian practice that came about in 4th century ireland . before christianity they practiced a religion as as the romans with many gods . it grew during the 5th and 6th centuries one of the most churches in the world . roman christianity was late arriving in ireland because the roman armies never invaded the island . consequently , roman culture , and its brand of roman christianity , had little influence on early irish christianity . because the educated class of the celts , the druids , had a long history of educational excellence and philosophic curiosity , they welcomed the new religion into ireland as they did all new information . the ancient greeks did student exchanges with the druids , whom they considered the other great philosophers in europe . perhaps the most famous greek scholar to study under the druids was pythagoras . ireland is the one country that had no martyrs when christianity came into its territory . this prompted the irish christians of later years to develop the `` white martyrdom '' of monks who lived austere lives as `` living martyrs . '' christian worship had reached ireland around 400 ad . ireland at this time was still a celtic nation , which the roman church called pagan . contrary to common myth , the irish did not abandon their celtic culture in favor of christianity . rather , christianity was woven into their culture . the celtic cross reflects this mxture of the two . celtic culture , unlike the very linear philosophy of rome and greece , was built upon a very cyclically minded philosophy , patterning itself after the seasonal cycles and life cycles they observed in their beloved natural world . the celtic cross includes the cross to represent christianity and the circle to represent the celtic world view .
