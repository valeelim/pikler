Turing complete     a computer is turing complete if it can solve any problem that a turing machine can , given an appropriate algorithm and the necessary time and memory . when applied to a programming language , this phrase means that it can fully exploit the capabilities of a turing complete computer . actual computers have to operate on limited memory and are not turing complete in the mathematical sense . if they can run any program they are equivalent to linear bounded automata , a weaker theoretical machine . informally , however , calling a computer turing complete means that it can execute any algorithm . the ability to run any algorithm is a necessary condition for a computer to be called turing complete . for this reason , a basic calculator is not turing complete and neither is a scientific calculator that only evaluates specific functions .
