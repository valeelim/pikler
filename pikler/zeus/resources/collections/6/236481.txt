Emperor Keikō     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . keikō is almost certainly a legend ; but the `` kojiki '' and `` nihonshoki '' record his name . the limited information about keikō does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . in `` kojiki '' , keikō sent his one of his sons to kyūshū to fight battles on his behalf . in `` nihonshoki '' , keikō fought and won these battles against local tribes . according to both sources , he sent yamatotakeru to izumo province and eastern provinces to expand his territory . this emperor 's official name after his death ( his posthumous name ) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to keikō . the actual site of his grave is not known . according to the imperial household agency , this emperor is venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( `` misasagi '' ) at nara . the `` kami '' of emperor keikō is also venerated at anaho jinja in anaho , ōmi province .
