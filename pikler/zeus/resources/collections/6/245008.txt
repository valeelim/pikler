Context (computing)    context ( computing ) in computer science , a task context ( process , thread ... ) is the minimal set of data used by this task that must be saved to allow a task interruption at a given date , and a continuation of this task at the point it has been interrupted and at an arbitrary future date . the concept of context assumes significance in the case of interruptible tasks , wherein upon being interrupted the processor saves the context and proceeds to serve the interrupt service routine . thus the smaller the context the smaller is the latency . these data are located in : - processor registers - memory used by the task - on some operating systems , control registers used by the system to manage the task the storage memory ( files ) is not concerned by the `` task context '' in the case of a context switch ; even if this can be stored for some uses ( checkpointing ) .
