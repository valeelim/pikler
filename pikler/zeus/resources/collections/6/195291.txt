Bisexual pornography     bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography which generally shows one woman and two men , all perform sex acts with each other . bisexual pornography is separate from threesome pornography , which shows one man and two women . as most pornography is marketed to men , most bisexual porn is advertised to straight or bisexual men . very few customers of bi-porn say they are gay . producers who use the term `` bisexual porn '' are usually showing what a bisexual or bi-curious man might wish to see . sex acts between a man and a woman , as well as between two men . a common way that these are shown in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together . images and videos showing male bisexuality have been more popular since the start of internet pornography . however the area is still a very small grouping of the pornographic dvd market . for example , at porn seller hotmovies.com , there are only 655 bisexual movies out of a showing of more than 90,000 movies . bisexual dvds sell much better online than in adult video stores . this may be because customers in stores feel embarrassed to buy them . most bisexual porn is made by small companies rather than the major studios . actors are mostly new at porn . any well-known actors in bisexual porn usually are from the gay pornography industry , although they may not be gay or even bisexual in their personal life .
