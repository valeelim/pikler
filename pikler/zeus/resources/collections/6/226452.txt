Art history     art history is the study of art . an art historian is a person who studies the history of art , and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well . the first person to become an art historian was giorgio vasari . he lived in florence during the renaissance , at a time when there were many famous artists alive . vasari was an artist himself . he decided to write down all the stories that were told in florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous . he included biographies of several other artists from northern italy as well . when all the information was collected and the biographies written , he published them in 1568 in a book called `` lives of the artists '' . because of this book , art students today have a lot of information about artists such as leonardo , michelangelo , titian and their works .
