Seismic analysis     seismic performance analysis or seismic analysis is an intellectual tool of earthquake engineering which breaks the complex topic into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and non-building structures or their models . in general , seismic analysis is based on the methods of `` structural dynamics '' . for decades , the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake `` response spectrum method '' which , also , contributed to the proposed building code 's concept of today . however , those `` response spectra '' are good , mostly , for single-degree-of-freedom systems . numerical `` step-by-step integration '' , applied with the `` charts of seismic performance '' , seems to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom structural systems at severe process of earthquake excitation . the design of structures rests on authorized engineering procedures , principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure . those criteria are consistent just with the contemporary state of the knowledge about building structures . therefore , the building design which blindly follows some seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage .
