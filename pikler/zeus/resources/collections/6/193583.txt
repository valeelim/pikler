Les noces     les noces ( ) is a ballet in four scenes , originally for the `` ballets russes '' of sergei diaghilev . the ballet was choreographed by bronislava nijinska and the music and words were written by igor stravinsky . the music is written for voices , four pianos , and percussion . the ballet was first presented on 13 june 1923 at the théâtre gaîte-lyrîqué in paris . the ballet is sometimes called a `` dance cantata '' , and the music is sometimes performed as a concert piece . in 1915 ballet producer sergei diaghilev wanted to create a ballet called `` la liturgie '' . its background would be the greek orthodox church . stravinsky was a strong christian , and did not want to write this ballet . he turned instead to russian folk songs for `` les noces '' . he had started to think about this in 1913. michel fokine started the choreography but vaslav nijinsky took over . leonide massine stepped in for nijinsky . when massine left , bronislava nijinska designed the dancing . design for the ballet ( sets and clothing ) was done by natalia goncharova . goncharova , an outstanding artist , made two complete designs before her third was accepted . the first two designs were rejected because they did not suit either the dancing or the musical score . the ballet , though based on a folk tale , was modernist in style : stravinsky and nijinska thought it was important for its design to be in sympathy with this .
