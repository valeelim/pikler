Flynn effect     there is a rise in average iq scores since the beginning of measurements . it is called the flynn effect . the rise in most industrialized countries is about three iq points per decade . james r. flynn described this phenomenon in 1984. others supported the claims . they found the rise was mostly due to the test scores of those who scored an iq below 100. the number of those who were classified as `` mentally handicapped '' reduced from year to year . in contrast , the scores of those who got more than 100 did not seem to be affected . iq tests are re-normalized every so often to hold the average score for an age group at 100. this gave a first hint to flynn that the iq was changing over time . the revised versions are standardized on new samples and scored with respect to those samples only . the only way to compare the difficulty of two versions is to have a group of people take both tests . this confirms iq gains over time . the average rate of rise seems to be around three iq points per decade . today , children go to school for a longer time . they have also become more familiar with testing . it might therefore be expected that the biggest gains occur with school-related content , such as vocabulary , arithmetic or general information . just the opposite is the case : abilities such as these have had small gains and occasional declines over the years . the largest changes appear on general intelligence factor loaded ( g-loaded ) tests such as raven 's progressive matrices , instead . for example , dutch soldiers gained 21 points in only 30 years , or 7 points per decade , between 1952 and 1982 .
