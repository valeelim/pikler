Birefringence     birefringence ( or double refraction ) happens when light is passed through a special material and it splits into two different rays of light . calcite crystals and boron nitride are two good examples of materials that cause birefringence . just as a prism splits light into a large number of colors , birefringence splits light into two images of the same color . you see this as a `` double image '' .
