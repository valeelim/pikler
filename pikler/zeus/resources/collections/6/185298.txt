Pioneer plaque     the pioneer plaques were a pair of plaques that were launched into deep space on pioneer 10 and pioneer 11. the same image is on both plaques . the image is made up of many parts . there is a drawing of a nude human female and a nude human male . there is a diagram of the change in spin of the electron of a hydrogen particle . this diagram is meant to set up a universal unit of length and a universal unit of time for the rest of the image . there is a crude map of our solar system showing a spacecraft leaving the third planet , earth . there have been negative reactions about the arrow showing the trajectory of the spacescraft . alien species may not understand the human concept of a line and arrow . there is pattern of lines that looks like a star burst design . this is a map . there are 15 lines . 14 of the lines have a long binary number engraved along it . the binary numbers are distances . the distances are not in meters or kilometers , but in the universal unit of distance given by the hydrogen particle diagram . the 14 lines give the distance from the sun to 14 pulsars . the 15th line gives the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy .
