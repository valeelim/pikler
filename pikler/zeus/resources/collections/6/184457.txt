Kol people     the kols , also known as kolarians , are the original inhabitants of modern-day west bengal and north-east india . the term kol has been corrupted by the aryan-sanskritic speakers to the word `` kalu '' , meaning both `` black '' and `` ugly '' , in almost all of the 16 major languages of the subcontinent . the kolarians are a dravidian peoples stock group , whose descendant communities can be found also in west bengal and elsewhere in the eastern part of the east india . most geological scholars will contend that most of bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the tertiary era . semi-recent excavations in the deolpota village of western bengal seem to suggest that a paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago . a 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in rangamati is the primary evidence of paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the feni district . this neo-stone age began 3,000 bc lasting almost 1500 years . similar tools were found in sitakunda of the eastern region chittagong , and near comilla district . the sparsely forested hills in eastern bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for neolithic settlements .
