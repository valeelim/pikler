Pungmul     pungmul is a korean traditional music . it includes drumming , dancing , and singing . most performances are outside , with tens of players , all in constant motion . pungmul is rooted in the dure farming culture . it was originally played as part of farm work , on rural holidays , at other village community-building events , and in shamanistic and buddhistic rituals . pungmul performers wear very gorgeous costumes . a flowery version of the buddhist kkokkal is the most common headdress . advanced performers sometimes wear sangmo , which are hats with long ribbons attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns by moving their heads . drumming is the most important element of pungmul . each group is led by a kkwaenggwari ( small handheld gong ) player , and includes at least one person playing janggu ( hourglass drum ) , buk ( barrel drum ) , and jing ( gong ) . wind instruments ( t'aepyongso and nabal ) are sometimes played along with the drummers . following the drummers are dancers , who often play the sogo ( a small drum that makes almost no sound ) and tend to have more elaborate choreography . finally , japsaek ( actors ) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators , blurring the boundary between performers and audience . minyo ( korean traditional chants ) are performed in pungmul sometimes , and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along . most minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan ( rhythmic patterns ) that are common to pungmul , sanjo , p'ansori , and other traditional korean musical genres .
