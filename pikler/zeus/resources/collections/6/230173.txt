Placoderm     the placoderms ( `` placodermi '' : greek = `` plated skin '' ) were a class of armoured prehistoric fish , which lived from the mid silurian to the end of the devonian period . their head and thorax were covered by armoured plates ; the rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species . placoderms were among the first jawed fish , the gnathostomata . a 380 million year old fossil of one species is the oldest-known example of live birth . the placoderms were hugely successful in the devonian period , which is sometimes called the 'age of fish ' . in the upper devonian , a series of extinction events devastated the marine fauna . as the placoderms were predators , this caused a swift decline in their numbers , and the class was entirely extinct by the end of the devonian . the main source of placoderm fossils is the old red sandstone continent . this , in the devonian , was a united north america and western europe and the continental shelf areas around it . fossils from these strata in scotland were collected since the 18th century , and louis agassiz wrote the first survey of fossil fish . a century later , eric stensi√∂ showed that placoderms were genuine jawed fish .
