Silurian     the silurian was the period from the end of the ordovician , about 443.4 million years ago ( mya ) to the beginning of the devonian period , about 419 mya . as with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period 's start and end are well identified , but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years . the base of the silurian is set at a major extinction when 60 % of marine species were wiped out , the ordovician-silurian extinction events . the silurian was the first period to see macrofossils of biota on land , in the form of moss forests along lakes and streams as well as millipedes and scorpions colonizing the land later in the period . the fossil record of sea scorpions reached it 's greatest extent in the middle silurian , about 430 million years ago . the first fossil records of vascular plants , that is , land plants with tissues that carry food , appeared in the second half of the silurian period . the earliest known representatives of this group are the `` cooksonia '' ( mostly from the northern hemisphere ) and `` baragwanathia '' ( from australia ) . a primitive silurian land plant with xylem and phloem but no differentiation in root , stem or leaf , was much-branched `` psilophyton '' . this plant reproducied by spores and respired through stomata on every surface , and probably photosynthesizing in every tissue exposed to light .
