Thames Embankment     the thames embankment is a major feat of 19th century civil engineering . it reclaimed marshy land next to the river thames in central london . the embankment now runs on the northern side of the river from parliament in westminster to the city of london . it is a continuous four-lane road ( mostly a double carriageway ) . it connects with all the bridges along the route from westminster bridge to blackfriars bridge . it was built in two parts , the victoria and the chelsea embankment , but it is now unified . londoners regard it as a single road , the embankment . there is a much smaller road on the south side of the river , called the albert embankment .
