Dynamic and formal equivalence     dynamic and formal equivalence are concepts from linguistics . when a language is translated into another one , there is a problem : the meaning of a word or a phrase in the first language is not the same as that of the word or phrase in the second language . the first language may also have grammatical structures that do not exist in the second language . this is a problem for translation . there are two possible ways to solve this problem : 1. the translator can look at what the text means . he or she can then try to find expressions in the target language that mean very similar things . with this approach , the translation will sound more natural , and may be easier to read . this is known as `` dynamic '' or `` functional '' equivalence . 1. it is possible to make a literal translation . this will be harder to read , but it will be `` closer '' to what is written in the source text . a literal translation may mean that the text is translated word for word - some expressions that are there in the source language may not be there in the target language . such translations are called `` formal '' equivalence .
