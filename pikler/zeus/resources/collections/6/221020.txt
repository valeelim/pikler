Box jellyfish     the cubozoa , the box jellies , contain some of the most dangerous jellyfish in the phylum cnidaria . they make up a small class of cnidarians , with only 19 species . it is their powerful venom which makes them noteworthy . all cubozoans have four 'legs ' ( pedalia ) hanging from the corners , from which hang tentacles . they have a rudimentary neural network . the cubozoans can move through the water to actively hunt prey , and have a degree of sight as they have up to 24 eyes . cubozoans have two main eyes on each of the four pedalia , each with a lens , retina and cornea ; and some species also have eye-spots as well . the box jellies are found in tropical oceanic waters round the world . their venom is delivered by stinging nematocysts , which cluster on tentacles , each with half a million stinging cells . the largest species , `` chironex fleckeri '' , has caused many human deaths . the pain of an attack is agonising , and heart failure is a danger . the attack can be treated : first with vinegar , then remove stingers , then apply anti-venom .
