Latent autoimmune diabetes     latent autoimmune diabetes of adults ( lada ) is similar to both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes . like type 1 diabetes , lada is an autoimmune disease of the pancreas . this means the body 's immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that are supposed to make insulin . but lada is also like type 2 diabetes , because it causes insulin resistance . this means that insulin does not work as well as it should in a person 's body . most people with latent autoimmune diabetes are thin or skinny or have a normal bmi , although some are overweight to slightly obese . the biggest difference between lada and type 1 diabetes is that lada has a gradual onset ( it comes on slowly ) . also , people with type 1 diabetes can not make insulin . but if they are given a shot of insulin , the insulin works and does its job in their bodies . but in people with lada , even if they are given insulin , the insulin may not work as well as it should . most people with lada become insulin-dependent ( have to inject insulin ) within 3-15 years . this is very different from type 2 diabetes . only 20 % -30 % of type 2 diabetics end up being insulin-dependent .
