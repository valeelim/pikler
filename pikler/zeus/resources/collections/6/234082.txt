Heterochrony     heterochrony ( = `` different time '' ) is any change in the timing of development in an animal or plant . it is a key concept in developmental biology and evolution , introduced by ernst haeckel in 1875. it applies to the time a trait appears in the growth of an organism , or to the timing of gene expression in development . its importance in biology is to explain the way closely related animals may come to have quite large differences in shape , and size , whilst nevetheless having a rather similar genome . the main components are the time a process starts and stops in development , and the rate at which the process works . in his book `` embryos and evolution '' ( 1930 ) gavin de beer stressed the importance of heterochrony , and especially paedomorphosis , in evolution . changes to the genes which control timing in development can produce quite striking changes in the adult . de beer also conceived the idea of `` clandestine evolution '' , which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with darwin 's gradual theory of evolution . if a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal 's juvenile form , then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all . then , if the species were to undergo neoteny , the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record , despite having evolved gradually . stephen jay gould commented on this book :
