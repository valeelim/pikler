Check and checkmate     check is a term in chess when a player 's king is attacked . if the king is in check , the player `` must '' find a way to stop the threat ; he can not just ignore it . the player must do one of these things : - `` capture '' the checking piece ( with the king or another piece ) . - `` interpose '' : put a piece between the checking piece and the king . this only works if the checking piece is a long-distance piece ( bishop , rook or queen ) . - `` move '' the king to a square which is not threatened . if none of these works , then it is not a check but `` checkmate '' . checkmate ( often called mate ) is when a player 's king is attacked ( in check ) and there is no way to meet that attack . or , simply put , the king is under attack and can not get out of being captured . giving checkmate is the main goal in chess : a player who is mated loses the game . these rules have been part of chess since its beginning . until the early 20th century is was customary to announce `` check ! '' verbally when making the move . it would be regarded as strange today ; players do not address each other in competitive chess except where necessary .
