Random sample     a random sample is a sample taken at random from a population of data . in a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected . for instance , to do an election poll , calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention . a page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting , so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected . but neither sample is really random because for one thing , some people do not have phones . other websites . - simple random sampling -citizendium
