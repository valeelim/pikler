Compiled language     a compiled programming language is a programming language which is compiled . when a program is compiled , the compiler will change it from a programming language that a person can read , to a set of instructions that a computer can follow . these instructions ( written in machine code ) are then stored as an executable in a file . this file can be run quickly by the computer . the other kind of language is an interpreted language . a program , or even single lines , will be interpreted one line at a time by the computer . this is slower for a computer than following compiled instructions . but it can be faster to write and test programs that are interpreted . scripting languages are often interpreted . some languages can be either compiled or interpreted . java , lisp , python and autoit are examples .
