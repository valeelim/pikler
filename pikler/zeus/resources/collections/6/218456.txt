Hypothetical imperative     a hypothetical imperative is a rule of the form `` if you want x , then do y '' . moral theories may generally have this structure . this means that only those who want x , must do y. another view is that moral values are not relative to some objective , but are the same for all , that is they are unconditional , or categorical . the term was coined by immanuel kant . kant said that moral values had to be unconditional , categorical ; he wrote a categorical imperative .
