Samlesbury witches     the samlesbury witches were three women who were said to be witches , murderers and cannibals . they were tried in the village of samlesbury in lancashire . their trial on 19 august 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days . it is among the most famous in english history . the trials were unusual for england at that time for two reasons . first , thomas potts , the clerk to the court , wrote about it in his `` the wonderfull discoverie of witches in the countie of lancaster '' . secondly , the number of people found guilty and hanged was high , ten at lancaster and another at york . however , the three samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraft.some of the accused were burned alive and hung . the three women were jane southworth , jennet bierley , and ellen bierley . a 14 year old girl , grace sowerbutts , had said they used witchcraft . the women were accused of murdering children , and of cannibalism , amongst other things . in contrast , other people tried at the same time were accused of `` maleficium '' , that is causing harm by witchcraft . this included the pendle witches . the case against the three women collapsed `` spectacularly '' when the main witness , grace sowerbutts , was shown by the trial judge to be `` the perjuring tool of a catholic priest '' .
