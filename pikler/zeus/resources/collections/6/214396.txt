Crossing over     crossing over is a basic concept of genetics and cell biology , often called recombination . it occurs during meiosis . crossing over involves the exchange of chromosome segments between non-sister chromatids during the production of gametes . the effect is to assort ( shuffle ) the alleles on parental chromosomes , so that the gametes carry `` combinations '' of genes different from either parent . this has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population . by suitable means , the process can be observed directly in stained cells , and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes . the visible crossovers are called chiasma ( plural : chiasmata ) , which is greek for a cross . f.a . janssens was the first to suggest what chiasmata meant . the large-scale effect of crossing over is to spread variation through a population . this is the main consequence of sexual reproduction compared to non-sexual modes of reproduction . the main advantage to the parents is the greater variety in their offspring . this , it is thought , increases the likelihood that some of the offspring will survive and reproduce . this has been the subject of much investigation and discussion .
