Control of fire by early humans     when humans first learned how to control fire , it was an important step in their culture . it allowed humans to cook food and get warmth and protection . making fire also allowed activity into the dark , and gave some protection from predators and insects . the cooking of food was probably the most useful effect of fire . there are foods like meat and fruits which do not need cooking , but others , such as root vegetables , mostly need cooking . we do not know for sure when this step was taken . `` fire was first controlled by humans anywhere from about 230,000 years ago to 1.4 or 1.5 million years ago , depending on which evidence you accept as definitive '' . evidence for the use of fire by `` homo erectus '' beginning some 400,000 years ago has wide scholarly support . claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of `` homo '' range from 0.2 to 1.7 million years ago ( mya ) . the earliest evidence of humans using fire comes from many archaeological sites in east africa , like chesowanja near lake baringo , koobi fora , and olorgesailie in kenya . the evidence at chesowanja is red clay shards that scientists are 1.42 million years old . scientists reheated some of the shards at the site , and found that the clay must have been heated to 400 Â°c to harden .
