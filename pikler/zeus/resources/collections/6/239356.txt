Leyden jar     the leyden jar ( or leiden jar ) is a device for storing static electricity . it is large glass bottle , usually lined on both the inside and the outside with some type of metal foil . some of the early ones had water inside . they allow the experimenter to collect a large amount of charge . they are the first form of electrical storage . these methods are known today as 'condensers ' or 'capacitors ' . the first electrical storage jar was created by dean edwald von kleist on 11 october 1745. he was the dean of the cathedral of cammin in pomerania , on the north coast of germany ( at that time a separate country ) . he was interested to find whether static electricity could be stored in a bottle , because he knew that electricity could not pass through glass . he thought he might be able to capture and hold a small amount . he only had a small experimental friction generator . he underestimated how much electricity a small medicine bottle could hold by thousands of times . a peculiarity of electricity allows it to continue flowing into the bottle provided the outside of the bottle has an electrically conductive surface connected to the earth . this neutralises the pressure from the charge trying to flow back out .
