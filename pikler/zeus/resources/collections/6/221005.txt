Scyphozoa     the scyphozoa is a class of the phylum cnidaria , sometimes referred to as the `` true jellyfish '' . there are 200 species . the name scyphozoa comes from a greek word which refers to the cup shape of the jellyfish . the medusa form is the dominant life form , as opposed to the polyp . they eat plankton , small crustaceans and fish larvae , which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts . the nematocysts are attached to the tentacles that hang down from the edge of the umbrella dome . scyphozoans have an internal jelly-like material . they have no hard parts , no head , and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion . unlike other types of jellyfish , scyphozoans lack a `` velum '' , a circular membrane which propels other jellyfish through the water . scyphozoans move through the water by contracting and relaxing the muscles of their umbrella .
