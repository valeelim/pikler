John Ray     john ray ( 29 november 1627 â€“ 17 january 1705 ) was an english naturalist , sometimes referred to as the father of english natural history . ray was a protestant dissenter who had accepted the return of charles ii . he was ordained in london in 1660 , but refused to sign the act of uniformity of 1662. the act of uniformity made the book of common prayer compulsory in religious services , which was opposed by those of puritan beliefs . so ray was forced to resign his fellowship of trinity college , cambridge ; he returned to his native village of black notley , near braintree in essex . after this , his most important scientific works were supported financially by the royal society , whose president at a critical time in the 1680s was samuel pepys . ray published important works on plants , animals , and natural theology . his classification of plants in his `` historia plantarum '' , was an important step towards modern taxonomy . ray rejected the system by which species were classified according to an either/or type system . instead he classified plants by observation according to similarities and differences . thus he advanced scientific empiricism against the deductive rationalism of the scholastics . he was the first person to give a biological definition of the term `` species '' .
