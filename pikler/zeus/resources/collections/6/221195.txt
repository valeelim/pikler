Lambeosaurus     lambeosaurus was a crested , duck-billed dinosaur . its large hollow , bony crest was as big as the rest of its skull . its function has been much discussed . `` lambeosaurus '' lived during the later cretaceous period , about 76 to 75 million years ago ( mya ) . fossils of it have been found in alberta ( canada ) , montana ( usa ) , and baja california ( mexico ) , but only the two canadian species have been described in detail . apparently , the mexican species , `` lambeosaurus laticaudus '' , grew to be about 50 feet long ( 15 m ) , weighing 5.6 tons . it is the longest-known ornithischian dinosaur . the other species were smaller . `` lambeosaurus '' was described by dr. william a. parks in 1923 , 20 years after lawrence lambe ( an early canadian fossil hunter ) had studied it . the genus ranged over much of north america , and into mexico . as a hadrosaurid , `` lambeosaurus '' was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore , eating plants . it had a sophisticated skull that allowed a grinding motion like mammalian chewing . its teeth were continually replaced and were packed into dental batteries that each contained over 100 teeth , only a relative handful of which were in use at any time .
