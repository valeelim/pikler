Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In    delgadillo 's snow cap drive-in delgadillo 's snow cap drive-in is a historic small restaurant and roadside attraction along a part of what used to be route 66 in seligman , arizona usa . the drive-in was built in 1953 by a man who lived in the town , juan delgadillo ( may 17 , 1916 - june 2 , 2004 ) . delgadillo had very little money , so he built the restaurant mostly from scrap lumber he found at the nearby santa fe railroad yard . delgadillo thought of a fun way to bring attention to his new restaurant . he cut the roof off of a 1936 chevrolet , put paint , horns and emblems from other cars all over it and placed an artificial christmas tree in the rear of the car . delgadillo 's had a sense of humor which could be seen both on his car and on his menu . that menu still has such choices as a `` cheeseburger with cheese '' and `` dead chicken . '' `` juan 's garden '' at the rear of the restaurant is just as funny . that is the place mr. delgadillo kept his collection of old cars and other strange things . even the building itself has strange and funny things written on it . hand-painted signs in the parking area warn drivers that they are `` parking at their own risk . '' a neon sign in the window tells people , `` sorry , we 're open . '' the door which leads inside has two knobs , one on the right and one on the left . the knob on the right is fake ; the one on the left opens the door . delgadillo would have fun with his customers by asking , for example , if they wanted cheese on their cheeseburgers .
