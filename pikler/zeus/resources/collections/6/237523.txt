Motion blindness     motion blindness ( also called akinetopsia ) is a medical condition where a person can not see objects that are moving even though they can see the objects that do not move . the condition seems to be very rare , and related to the nerves . it may also be psychological . there is currently no treatment for this condition . a lot of information about this condition comes from different case studies done between 1913 and 2003. most of what is known is from a single patient , called lm . lm was a 43 year old woman who was treated in a hospital in 1978 , after she had suffered a stroke . currently , motion blindness is thought to be caused by a change to the regions of the brain that are responsible for sight . this change is usually a result of damage done to the brain , and affects the way the brain `` decodes '' visual information . it is possible that only `` visual '' motion processing is affected because this is done in a separate area of the brain , which is different from the area that does motion processing in general . the same can happen to the perception of color , that is the patient can have a form of color blindness , which is known as achromatopsia . unlike most other forms of color blindness , which are caused by changes in the eye , this one is caused by changes in the brain .
