Na'vi     the na'vi are a fictional indigenous species that live on the fictional world of pandora in the movie avatar . they look like humans , having pairs of eyes , ears , arms , and legs , as well as a nose , a mouth , and expressions that are similar to humans . the na'vi differ by having blue skin , pointed ears , huge eyes , and tails . they are also taller but also have more narrow proportions in body frame . the na'vi were meant to be more alien in their looks . director james cameron said that when one of the main characters , `` neytiri '' , was first drawn , she had fins , gills , and cat-like features . the species was redesigned to look more like humans , so audiences could relate to them better . cameron said that `` avatar '' was more `` science fantasy '' than true science fiction , and said that he would explain in the novel why the na'vi look like humans . according to `` entertainment weekly '' , `` the na'vi can commune with animals on their planet by literally plugging their ponytails into the creatures ' nerve systems . to become a warrior , a na'vi must tame and ride a creature known as ikran . '' the na'vi also use this neural bonding system to mate with a `` life partner '' - a bond that , when made , can not be broken in the na'vi 's lifetime .
