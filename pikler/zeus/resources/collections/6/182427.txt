Macro photography     macro photography is a kind of photography . macro photography is about photographing objects that are very close to the lens , the film or the sensor . using the classic definition , in macro photography the image shown on the film plane ( or sensor ) is nearly as big as the object photographed . there are different ways to achieve this . the most common one is to use a specialised `` macro '' lens . such lenses are good at focussing sharply on a small area approaching the size of the film frame . most 35mm format macro lenses achieve at least 1:2 , that is to say , the image on the film is half the size of the object being photographed . many 35mm macro lenses are 1:1 , meaning the image on the 135 film is the same size as the object being photographed . another important difference is that lenses designed for macro are usually at their sharpest at macro focus distances and are not quite as sharp at other focus distances . in recent years , the term `` macro '' has been used in marketing material to mean being able to focus on a subject close enough so that when a regular 6×4 inch ( 15×10 cm ) print is made , the image is life-size or larger . with 35mm film this requires a magnification ratio of only approximately 1:4 , which demands less of lens quality than 1:1. with digital cameras the actual image size is rarely stated , so that the magnification ratio is largely irrelevant ; cameras instead advertise their closest focussing distance .
