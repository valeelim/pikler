Shake-table     shake-table in earthquake engineering is a very effective experimental equipment to verify seismic performance associated with the direct damage to individual buildings or their models under specified ground shaking . the best way to do it is to put a structure on a shake-table that simulates the earth shaking and to watch what may happen next ( if you have no time to stand out in the field and wait for a real earthquake to strike ) . the earliest shake-table experiments were performed more than a century ago other websites . - earthquake vibration control videos
