Blood diamond     a blood diamond , also known as a conflict diamond , is a diamond that came from an area which is controlled by armed groups which oppose the rules and regulations of governments . these diamonds are mined by civilians who have been ordered by the armed groups to do so ( most of them are children ) , and typically if they refuse to do the work they may be possibly raped , abused , or even murdered . the diamonds are then sold and used to buy weapons to help the armed groups fight against the government . because of this , most of the blood diamond mining happens in war zones . this is a form of exploitation . there have been 3.7 million deaths over diamonds .
