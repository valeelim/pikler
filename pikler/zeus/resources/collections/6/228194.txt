Boomslang     a boomslang is a small , venomous snake found in africa . its name means `` tree snake '' in dutch and afrikaans . boomslangs eat small animals like chameleons , frogs , and birds , but they also eat eggs . like all snakes , boomslangs do not chew they swallow everything whole . the venom ( poison ) of boomslangs disrupts the clotting of your blood , and this can kill you . after a bite , you can sometimes feel a headache , nausea and sleepiness . if you think you may have been bitten by a boomslang , you should get an antidote . this does not happen often , as boomslangs only bite humans when they feel attacked .
