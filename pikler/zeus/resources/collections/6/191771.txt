Bowler     a bowler is a person who bowls a ball to the batsman in the game of cricket . unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball , a bowler delivers with a straight arm ( see photo ) . a ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw , and that is illegal . a bowler who can also bat well , is called an all rounder . there are different types of bowler , and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types . a fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman . they can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h . they take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed . shoaib akhtar of pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h . another famous fast bowler is australian brett lee . a medium pace bowler bowls more slowly . they often use other tricks to defeat the batsman . they can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length ( where the ball hits the ground ) to fool the batsman . some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs . others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam ; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable .
