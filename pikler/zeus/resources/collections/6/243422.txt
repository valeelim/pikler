Pointe du Hoc     pointe du hoc is on the coast of normandy in the north of france . in 1944 it was part of the biggest sea invasion in history . during world war ii , allied military commanders were planning how to attack france , which had been captured by the nazis . while planning , the allied commanders noticed the massive coastal guns at pointe du hoc . there were six 155mm cannons in heavily armoured bunkers that could be very dangerous to allied ships . allied planes , flying from english airstrips , bombed pointe du hoc . however , the heavy artillery guns at pointe du hoc were moved and there was no damage inflicted to them . pointe du hoc was surrounded by steep cliffs that dropped down into the sea . a very narrow beach would appear at the bottom of the cliffs , but only at a certain part of the day . for about five months , the u.s. rangers had been training with british commandos to prepare for their attack on france . they had been climbing british coastal cliffs for training . once the allied commanders decided to attack france , they used flat-bottomed landing boats made to carry troops onto the beach at the french coastal cliffs . these special landing boats were called lca and lcvp 's or higgins boats , and were driven british navy sailors . the boats were lowered into the sea a few kilometers away from the cliffs . the british had added some extra armour to the sides of the landing crafts to protect them . this meant that the boats were better protected , but not as fast or easily moved in different directions .
