Kikuyu     kikuyu is the largest tribe in kenya . they are 22 % of kenya 's population and are of bantu ethnicity . there are two theories explaining where the kikuyu came from . first , it is believed the kikuyus came from central africa , where all the bantus once lived . they then moved south towards present day tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the kikuyus moved towards mount kenya , where they settled . the second theory is that they came from a mythical place called shungwaya , which is present day somalia . according to kikuyu creation stories , ngai ( their god ) made a man , called gikuyu , and his wife , mumbi , and settled them on mount kenya . gikuyu and mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the kikuyu people . due to the fertile soil on mount kenya and the hard work of the kikuyu people , they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours , the maasai ( a nilotic tribe ) . the kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the maasai , who kept livestock . it is also believed that the maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of gikuyu and mumbi .
