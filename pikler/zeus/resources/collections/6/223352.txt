Acarina     the acarina , or acari , are the mites and ticks . they are an order of arachnids . their fossil history goes back to the devonian era . most acarines are tiny : less than a millimetre . it is estimated that over 50,000 species have been described , but a million or more species may be currently living . the study of mites and ticks is called acarology . acarines live in practically every habitat , and include aquatic ( freshwater and sea water ) and terrestrial species . they outnumber other arthropods in the soil and detritus . many are parasitic , and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates . most parasitic forms are external parasites , while the free living forms are generally predators and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods . others help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells . others still are herbivorous and may damage crops . damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites , especially by the spider mites and their relatives , earth mites , thread-footed mites and the gall and rust mites .
