Minimum spanning tree     a number of problems from graph theory are called minimum spanning tree . in graph theory , a tree is a way of connecting all the vertices together , so that there is exactly one path from any one vertex , to any other vertex of the tree . if the graph represents a number of cities connected by roads , one could select a number of roads , so that each city can be reached from every other , but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another . a graph can have more than one spanning tree , just like there may be more than one way to select the roads between the cities . most of the time , graphs are weighted ; each connection between two cities has a weight : it might cost something to travel on a given road , or one connection may be longer than the other , this means it takes more time to travel on that connection . in the language of graph theory , the connections are called `` edges '' . a minimum spanning tree is a tree . it is different from other trees in that it minimizes the total of the `` weights '' attached to the edges . depending on what the graph looks like , there may be more than one minimum spanning tree . in a graph where all the edges have the same weight , every tree is a minimum spanning tree . if all the edges have different weights ( that is : there are no two edges with the same weight ) , there is exactly one minimal spanning tree .
