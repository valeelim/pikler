Order of St Michael and St George     the most distinguished order of saint michael and saint george is an order of chivalry . it was started on 28 april 1818 by george , prince regent , who became king george iv of the united kingdom . it started when he was prince regent for his father , king george iii . it is named in honour of two military saints , saint michael and saint george . the order has three classes , listed below from highest to lowest : - `` knight grand cross '' or `` dame grand cross '' ( gcmg ) - `` knight commander '' ( kcmg ) or `` dame commander '' ( dcmg ) - `` companion '' ( cmg ) it is used to honour people who have done important things for the commonwealth or foreign nations . people are `` appointed '' to the order rather than given it . british ambassadors to foreign nations are often appointed as kcmgs or cmgs . for example , the british ambassador to the united states , sir david manning , was appointed a cmg when he worked for the british foreign and commonwealth office ( fco ) . after his appointment as british ambassador to the united states , he was promoted to a knight commander ( kcmg ) . often , when the queen visits a nation , the british ambassador to that nation automatically becomes a knight commander of the order , and afterwards they may use the title `` sir '' , before their name .
