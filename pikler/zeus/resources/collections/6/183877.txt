J. J. Thomson     sir joseph john `` j.j. '' thomson , om , frs ( 18 december 1856 â€“ 30 august 1940 ) was a british physicist and nobel laureate . he discovered the electron and isotopes , and invented the mass spectrometer . he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases . john joseph thomson in 1893 said : `` there is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity . '' in 1897 , thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle of very small mass compared to its electric charge . it was later called the electron and was the first subatomic particle to be found . thomson also found the first evidence for isotopes of a stable ( non-radioactive ) element in 1913 , while studying anode rays ( positive cations ) . in atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge , where an individual negatively charged electron resided . he later concluded there was more than one negatively charged particle in an atom .
