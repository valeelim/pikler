Recapitulation theory     the theory of recapitulation is often known as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . it was an idea of étienne serres in 1824–26 . in 1886 ernst haekel proposed that the embryonic development of an individual organism ( its ontogeny ) followed the same path as the evolutionary history of its species ( its phylogeny ) . it is also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism it was a theory ( idea ) that tied evolution ( the change in organisms over time ) with embryology ( the way organisms develop before they are born ) . the theory basically stated that before they are born , organisms pass through developmental stages that look like adult animals of other species , in roughly the same order that these other species split off during evolution . although there is something to this idea , it is no longer thought to be such a useful way to look at development . haeckel formulated his theory as `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . ontogeny is the steps an organism takes in its development before it is born , starting as a single cell and ending as a baby . phylogeny is the steps a species takes in its development , starting as a very simple organism and evolving into the current organism . `` recapitulates '' is a synonym for `` reflects '' and implies that the ontogeny of an organism is similar to the phylogeny of its species .
