Nemertea     nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as `` ribbon worms '' or `` proboscis worms '' . most of the 1,400 or so species are marine , with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms . they live in all marine habitats , and throughout the world 's oceans . alternative spellings for the phylum have included `` nemertini '' and `` nemertinea '' . `` rhynchocoela '' is a name used primarily in north america but gradually abandoned since the 1980s . nemertean worms are long , thin , animals without segments . they have no true head , although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body . they are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis . this is kept inside the body , but pushed out to catch prey . nemerteans collect food with their proboscis , which is closely associated with the digestive system . at rest , the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm 's length , lying just above the gut . it is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding . at the anterior end , the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain , and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal .
