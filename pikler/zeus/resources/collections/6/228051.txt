Continuous function     in mathematics a function is said to be continuous if , roughly said , a `` small change '' in the input only causes a `` small change '' in the output . if this is not the case , the function is said to be discontinuous . functions defined on the real numbers , with one input and one output variable , will show as an `` uninterrupted line ( or curve ) '' . they can be drawn `` without lifting the pen '' . the definition given above was made by augustin-louis cauchy . karl weierstra√ü gave another definition of continuity : suppose that there is a function `` f '' , defined on the real numbers . at the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2 . if the function is continuous at formula_1 , then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is , there is a value of formula_5 , so that whenever formula_6 , that makes formula_7 . intuitively : given a point close to formula_1 ( called x ) , the `` absolute value '' of the difference between the two values of the function can be made arbitrarily small , if the point x is `` close enough '' to formula_1 .
