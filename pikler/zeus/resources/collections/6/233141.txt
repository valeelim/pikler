Computer Algebra System     a computer algebra system ( cas ) is a large computer program that helps people with mathematics and algebra . it changes and moves around ( manipulates ) mathematical equations and expressions containing numbers and symbols called variables . variables can stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for , or can be replaced with any value . it always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression , unless it is being transformed , by a transformation algorithm . a cas might be used for integration or differentiation ( and other calculus transformations ) , simplification of an expression ( making it smaller and/or simpler ) , optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables , etc . most have the ability to plot functions and expressions for visualization , which can be helpful and educational too . computer algebra systems can be special purpose , focusing on only a few types of symbolic math , to very large , general purpose programs that do almost everything ( for example , the free cas maxima , which is the oldest cas that is still under development ) . the results output by a good computer algebra system are often exact , simple , and generalized to work in all possible cases . computer programs do have bugs , so important results should always be verified for correctness .
