Strata     strata are layers of rock , or sometimes soil . in nature , strata come in many layers . it is a term in sedimentary and historical geology ; the singular is stratum . the study of strata is called stratigraphy . these layers are laid down as sediment , often in the sea , and are slowly changed by pressure , heat and chemical action into rocks . the strata are often typical of a particular time and place , and allow geologists to relate rocks in different places . for instance , chalk was laid down in the upper cretaceous period , and consists mainly of the remains of microscopic algae called coccoliths . in normal strata , the later strata are laid down on earlier strata in horizontal layers . in the long passage of time , sedimentary rocks may get `` deformed '' by huge forces in the earth : volcanism , orogeny ( mountain building ) or other causes . then it requires research to work out what has happened to the strata . when strata rise above sea level they get worn down by erosion , such as weather . this causes gaps in the sequence of strata , which may have risen and sunk many times in earth history . these gaps are called unconformities in geological jargon .
