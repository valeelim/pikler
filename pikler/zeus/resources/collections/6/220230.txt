Orthoptera     orthoptera are an order of insects . the order contains grasshoppers , katydids , and crickets . `` ortho '' means `` straight '' , so `` orthoptera '' means `` straight wings '' . this means the front wings , called `` tegmina '' , are stiff , straight , and not used for flying . the back wings are membranous and are folded like a fan under the front wings when the insect is not flying . many species use their wings to make sounds , which we usually call `` chirping '' noises . orthopteran insects start life in an egg case . after three weeks – or when spring comes – the tiny nymphs come out from the egg case . after four or five molts , they have wings . this shows that they are adults and are ready to reproduce . their sounds are produced by using file-like edges to their wings , or wing veins . in some groups the wing edges are rubbed together , in others the hind limb is rubbed against a wing edge . each sound is unique to the species , and its function is identification for mating purposes . it is males which make the sound , and females move towards it .
