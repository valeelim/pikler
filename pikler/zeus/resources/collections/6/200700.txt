Argument from inconsistent revelations     the argument from inconsistent revelations ( also known as avoiding the wrong hell problem ) is an argument that says that god probably does not exist . there are many religions which are based on revelations . the problem with these revelations is that they contradict each other . a person must either accept or reject at least one of these revelations in order to be part of a religious group . that way , accepting one means rejecting some ( if not all ) of the others . unless the revelation is personal , the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others . assuming the revelation is personal , the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him . christians believe that jesus is the savior of the world and the son of god ; jews believe just as strongly that he is not . similarly , muslims believe that the qur'an was divinely authored , while jews and christians do not . there are many examples of such contrasting views . positions where one religion contradicts another , or where one group of people contradicts another are common . there are many denominations in christianity who do not agree about many things .
