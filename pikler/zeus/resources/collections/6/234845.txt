Détente     détente ( pronounced day-tont ) is a word that means less tension and a better relationship between two countries . the main example of a détente was during the cold war . in the 1970 's , the united states and the soviet union improved relations . both signed several treaties which made less amount of nuclear weapons each country had . during this time period , as china began to dislike the soviet union , the united states tried to make friends with china , giving the soviet union a disadvantage during the cold war . détente primarily was concerned with relation between usa and ussr but other countries like china , west germany and most of the european states also played their role in developing it . their motives were mixed . the us proposed this because they did not want to have to go to war with ussr which would lead to all out nuclear warfare . the literal and original use of the word , meant to undo a crossbow , the detention of the cord that launched the arrow . which is why this old word was so appropriate in the above description .
