Intonation (linguistics)    intonation ( linguistics ) in linguistics , intonation is variation of pitch while speaking which is not used to distinguish words . ( compare tone . ) intonation and stress are two main elements of linguistic prosody . all languages use pitch semantically , that is , as intonation , for instance for emphasis , to convey surprise or irony , or to pose a question . tonal languages such as chinese and hausa use pitch to distinguish words in addition to intonation . `` rising intonation '' means the pitch of the voice increases over time ; `` falling intonation '' means that the pitch decreases with time . a `` dipping intonation '' falls and then rises , whereas a `` peaking intonation '' rises and then falls . the classic example of intonation is the question-statement distinction . for example , northeastern american english , like very many languages ( hirst & dicristo , eds . 1998 ) , has a rising intonation for echo or declarative questions ( `` he found it on the street ? `` ) , and a falling intonation for `` wh- '' questions ( `` where did he find it ? '' ) and statements ( `` he found it on the street. '' ) . yes or no questions ( `` did he find it on the street ? '' ) often have a rising end , but not always . some languages like chikasaw and kalaallisut have the opposite pattern : rising for statements and falling with questions .
