Speech recognition     speech recognition ( also known as voice recognition ) is the process of converting spoken words into computer text . the user speaks into a microphone and the computer creates a text file of the words they have spoken . although the of these systems has improved in recent years they are still far from perfect . if you only need them to recognise a few words , for example the words `` one , two , three '' etc. , then speech recognition software can be very accurate . this is why this feature has started to appear on modern mobile phones . but systems that can recognise any word spoken by any person in any language are still a few years away . you can greatly improve the accuracy of these systems by `` training '' them to recognise just one voice . this is usually done by getting the user to read a short set piece of text into the microphone . the user looks at the text which has been created and corrects any mistakes the software has made . by repeating this a number of times the computer 's accuracy increases a great deal .
