Intensity (physics)    intensity ( physics ) in physics , intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light . to figure out ( i.e. , compute ) the exact intensity of a beam of light or a fire hose spraying water , we need to know how many units of light or water are coming to some area in some period of time . a factory might have an `` intensity '' of 100 cars per day delivered to the loading dock . a fire hose might have an intensity of 100 buckets of water per minute per open window of a certain size in a burning building . usually when talking about intensity , we are talking about the amount or energy of particles or radiation per unit area . since each particle spreads out from the source in a sphere , the area is measured as the surface area of this sphere , or 4*pi*r^2 , where r is the distance from the source to the observer .
