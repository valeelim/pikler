Parazoa     the parazoa are an ancestral subkingdom of animals , literally translated as `` beside the animals '' . parazoans differ from their choanoflagellate ancestors in that they are macroscopic and have differentiated cells , but unlike `` true animals '' ( eumetazoa ) , they do not have tissues . most people put placozoa in parazoa , but placozoa can also be placed in the subkingdom agnotozoa .
