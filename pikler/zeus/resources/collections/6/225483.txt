Chiton     chitons are primitive marine molluscs in the class polyplacophora ( formerly the class amphineura ) . there are 900 to 1,000 living species of chitons . their size ranges from 0.5 to 30 cm in length ; most are quite small . all the living species are in the subclass neoloricata , and so may be called 'loricates ' . popular names are `` sea cradles '' or `` coat-of-mail shells '' . they have a single shell that sticks to rocks , like a limpet . the shell is made of hard plates that fit tightly together , overlapping one another . the shell plates are surrounded by a structure known as a 'girdle ' . polyplacophora means `` many plates '' . the plates refer to the shell , which is made of aragonite , a calcium carbonate mineral . the shell is quite flexible , and the chiton can even roll into a ball . the chiton has eight plates , and underneath the plates is a muscular foot that moves the chiton over rocks and other structures , both in and out of the water . it also has a tongue-shaped structure called the radula , which has many rows of 17 teeth each . some use it to scrape algae off rocks , while others are carnivorous , catching tiny zooplankton and other small animals that live in shallow water .
