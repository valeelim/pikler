Serpopard     a serpopard is a mythological animal , often seen carved on cosmetic palettes ( used for mixing antimony as eye shadow ) , during the old kingdom of egypt . these palettes were made in the earliest days of history , before the pharaohs . a serpopard looks like a leopard ; however it has a very long neck unlike a leopard . in the carved pictures , they are seen being led by ropes and harnesses while they serve the egyptians as domesticated animals . skilled egyptian artists always carved real animals in exactly the right shape , but the serpopard is thought to be only a mythological creature . in a later time , a similar creature would be shown in the art of sumer and elam . further reading . - o ’ connor , david 2002. context , function and program : understanding ceremonial slate palettes . `` journal of the american research center in egypt '' 39 : 5–25 . other pages . - images of narmer palette
