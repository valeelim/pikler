Francis Crick     francis harry compton crick om frs ( 8 june 1916 â€“ 28 july 2004 ) was a british physicist and biologist . he is one of those who worked out the structure of dna . using x-ray crystallography results from maurice wilkins ' biophysics team at king 's college london , crick and james watson discovered that dna has what is called a `` double helix structure '' . this means that dna is made of two chains wound round each other to make a spiral . only one of the chains carries information , but the two chains together makes the molecule more stable . dna is the basis of heredity for almost all forms of life today . crick , watson and wilkins won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 1962. their work sparked a huge amount of research in molecular and cell biology and , as a result , many subsequent nobel awards have been made . during the mid-to-late 1950s crick helped sort out the way proteins are synthesized . in 1958 , crick 's listed all the key features of the protein synthesis process : - genetic information stored in the sequence of dna molecules
