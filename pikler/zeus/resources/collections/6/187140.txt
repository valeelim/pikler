Canon EOS     the canon eos ( electro-optical system ) is an autofocus 35 mm film and digital slr camera system that was introduced in 1987 with the canon eos 650 and is still in production as canon 's current dslr system . the acronym eos was chosen for eos in greek mythology , and is often pronounced as a word ( i.e. , `` ee-oss '' ) , although some spell out the letters , reading it as an initialism . both pronunciations are acceptable as there is no official pronunciation . it competes primarily with the nikon f series and its successors , as well as autofocus slr systems from olympus corporation , pentax , sony/minolta , and panasonic/leica . in most countries , eos cameras have the largest market share of slr cameras .
