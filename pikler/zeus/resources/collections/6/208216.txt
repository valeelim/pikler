Quantum computer     a quantum computer is a model of how to build a computer . the idea is that quantum computers can use certain phenomena from quantum mechanics , such as superposition and entanglement , to perform operations on data . the basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on it . a theoretical model is the quantum turing machine , also known as the universal quantum computer . the idea of quantum computing is still very new . experiments have been done . in these , a very small number of operations were done on qubits ( quantum bit ) . both practical and theoretical research continues with interest , and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and military purposes , such as cryptanalysis . today 's computers , called `` classical '' computers , store information in binary ; each bit is either on or off . quantum computation use qubits , which , in addition to being possibly on or off , can be both on and off , which is a way of describing superposition , until a measurement is made . the state of a piece of data on a normal computer is known with certainty , but quantum computation uses probabilities . only very simple quantum computers have been built , although larger designs have been invented . quantum computation uses a special type of physics , quantum physics .
