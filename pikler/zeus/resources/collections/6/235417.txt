Seismic load     seismic load is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake-generated agitation to a building structure or its model . it happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground , or with adjacent structures , or with gravity waves from tsunami . seismic loading depends , primarily , on : - anticipated earthquake ’ s parameters at the site - geotechnical parameters of the site - building structure ’ s parameters - characteristics of the anticipated gravity waves from tsunami ( if applicable ) . sometimes , seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken , partially or completely . due to their mutual interaction , seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related . other websites . - earthquake performance evaluation tool online
