Strike zone     the strike zone is the area over home plate through which a pitch must pass to be called a strike , roughly between the batter 's armpits and knees . the strike zone shall be determined from the batter 's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball . the strike zone in baseball is a tricky subject as the strike zone changes with each batter . accordingly , there is no `` automatic '' strike zone and much of what is a strike or not a strike is left to the judgement of the home plate umpire . in short , the strike zone extends from the batters ' knees to the letters across the front of his uniform . to be called a strike , the pitcher must throw the baseball across home plate , an area 17 inches wide ( 0.4318 meters ) , and between the knees and letters as indicated . in professional baseball , a player who stands 5 ' 6 '' tall ( 1.67 meters ) , for example , will have a much smaller strike zone that will a 6 ' 4 '' ( 1.93 meters ) homerun hitter . moreover , the focus is not on where the ball is caught by the catcher , but rather where the ball is as it passes the front of home plate .
