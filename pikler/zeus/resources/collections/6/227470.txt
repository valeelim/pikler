Velcro     velcro is a brandname and trademark owned by the velcro companies for `` hook-and-loop fasteners '' . hook-and-loop fasteners have a `` hook '' side , which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks , and a `` loop '' side , which is covered with even smaller and `` hairier '' loops . when the two sides are pressed together , the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together . when they are separated , they make a special `` ripping '' sound . the person who invented hook-and-loop was a scientist named george de mestral . during a hunting vacation in switzerland , de mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog 's fur . he was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove . that night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like hands . de mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers . by copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs , he made hook-and-loop !
