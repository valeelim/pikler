Arrangement (music)    arrangement ( music ) an arrangement of a musical composition is a reworking of a piece of music so that it can be played by a different instrument or combination of instruments from the original . for example , a song written for one voice with piano accompaniment might be arranged so that it can be sung in parts by a choir , or a piece for violin might be arranged so that it can be played on a clarinet instead . the person who does the arrangement may be the composer themself , or it may be someone else . in music history , composers often published their compositions , saying that the music could be played or sung by various instruments . for example , when english composers published madrigals in the late 16th century they often stated that they could be sung by singers or played on viols ( “ apt for voices as for viols ” ) . in the classical music period a composer might publish a sonata , stating that it could be played on the violin or flute or recorder . this helped to sell more copies , because violinists , flautists and recorder players might all want to buy the music . in a sense this is not really an arrangement , because no changes have been made to the music .
