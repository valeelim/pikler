Warning colouration     animals that are dangerous , or foul to eat , usually advertise the fact . this is called warning colouration or aposematism . it is the exact opposite of camouflage . warning colours tend to be some combination of red , yellow , black and white . alfred russel wallace , a british naturalist , explained it this way , in 1889 : wallace predicted that birds and other predators would reject conspicuous prey whilst accepting cryptic prey . later reports confirmed this . animals with warning colours move slowly and expose themselves to sight . the sluggishness and exposure helps to advertise their defence . along with the colour and behaviour often goes the foul smell of their chemical weapons . noxious caterpillars often have thick , leathery cuticles which help them to resist young birds making a 'test ' . when the bird takes a peck , disgusting fluid seeps out from special glands on its back . the caterpillar ( or other larva ) will often survive such an attack , and the young bird has learnt a lesson it will never forget . all in all , the predator is given good warning . tests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators .
