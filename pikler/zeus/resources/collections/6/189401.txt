The Barber of Seville     the barber of seville ( in italian : il barbiere di siviglia ) is a comic opera ( opera buffa ) in two acts by the composer gioachino rossini . the libretto ( words ) are based on a comedy by pierre beaumarchais called `` the barber of seville '' . it is rossini ’ s most famous opera , containing some very well known tunes . the first performance took place on 20 february , 1816 in rome rossini ’ s opera was not the first one to be based on beaumarchais ' play . the composer giovanni paisiello had written one with the same title , and another was composed in 1796 by nicolas isouard . paisiello ’ s opera was popular for a time , but soon rossini ’ s opera became famous and paisiello ’ s opera was forgotten . mozart 's opera `` le nozze di figaro , '' composed in 1786 is also based on the same play , but it deals with the second part of the play ( the play was in three parts ) . rossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly . he composed all the music for `` the barber of seville '' in less than three weeks . he borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier .
