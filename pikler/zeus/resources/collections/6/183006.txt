Light-independent reaction     light-independent reactions take place in plant chloroplasts . in this process sugars are made from carbon dioxide . the process , known as the calvin cycle , uses products of the light-dependent reactions ( atp and nadph ) and various enzymes . therefore , the light-independent reaction can not happen without the light-dependent reaction . sugars made in the light-independent reactions are then moved around the plant by translocation . takes places in the grana region of the chloroplast . the calvin cycle . 1. a sugar ( ribulose biphosphate or rubp ) made of 5 carbon atoms combines with carbon dioxide to form a 6-carbon sugar ( phosphoglycerate ) . an enzyme called rubisco speeds this reaction up . 1. phosphoglycerate is reduced with hydrogen atoms from the light-dependent reaction to form two molecules of triose phosphate ( each has 3 carbon atoms ) . atp is needed for this to happen . 1. some triose phosphate is converted ( using atp ) back into ribulose biphosphate ( which is why this is called a `` cycle '' ) .
