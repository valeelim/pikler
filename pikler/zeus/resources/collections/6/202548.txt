Love's Philosophy    love 's philosophy `` love 's philosophy '' is a poem written by percy bysshe shelley in 1820 . < poem > the fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean , the winds of heaven mix for ever with a sweet emotion ; nothing in the world is single ; all things by a law divine in one spirit meet and mingle . why not i with thine ? -- see the mountains kiss high heaven and the waves clasp one another ; no sister-flower would be forgiven if it disdained its brother ; and the sunlight clasps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea : what is all this sweet work worth if thou kiss not me ? < /poem >
