Cosmic ray     cosmic rays are very high-energy radiation , mostly from outside the solar system . the term `` ray '' is a historical accident , as cosmic rays were at first , and wrongly , thought to be mostly electromagnetic radiation . they are particles . most are protons and alpha particles , which are the nuclei of helium atoms . some are electrons ( beta particles ) , gamma rays or photons and a tiny fraction are even heavier particles . their origin is not exactly known . there is evidence that many primary cosmic rays come from the supernovae of massive stars . however , this is not thought to be their only source . active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays . ... cosmic rays can have as much energy as 10 ev , far higher than the 10 to 10 ev that man-made particle accelerators can produce . when cosmic ray particles enter the earth 's atmosphere they hit other particles , like molecules of oxygen and nitrogen . this causes a shower of lighter particles , a so-called 'air shower ' . the number of particles made in an air shower event can reach billions . all of the particles in the shower stay within about one degree of the first particle 's path . in a shower are x-rays , muons , protons , alpha particles , pions , electrons , and neutrons .
