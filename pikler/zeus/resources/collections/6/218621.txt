List of extinction events     an extinction event is a relatively fast drop in the number of species living on earth . it occurs when the rate of extinction increases more than the rate of speciation . this is a list of the largest . major extinction events are important to both geology and evolution . there are five major extinction events in the phanerozoic eon , and many smaller events . in order of time , latest first : 1. k/t extinction event . the cretaceous/tertiary extinction event ended the mesozoic era and started the cainozoic era . 2. end–triassic extinction event . 3. p/tr extinction event . the permian/triassic extinction event ended the palaeozoic era and started the mesozoic era . 4. late devonian extinctions , at the frasnian/famennian junction . 5. end–ordovician extinction event . after a series of lesser events , the end-ordovician extinction resulted in an estimated 84 % species loss . other extinction events in the phanerozoic also had significant impact on the evolution of the biota . 1. eoceneoligocene transition . from the middle of the eocene to early in the oligocene there were a number of events . the climate became much cooler , ice formed on antarctica , and there was a turnover in aquatic and terrestrial groups .
