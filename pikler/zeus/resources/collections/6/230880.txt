Sawfly     a sawfly is an insect belonging to suborder symphyta of the order hymenoptera . the sawflies are a group of largely plant-eating ( herbivorous ) insects . the group is less specialised than the ants , bees and wasps . sawflies are distinguishable from most other hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax , and by their caterpillar-like larvae . the common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor , which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs . large populations of certain sawfly species can cause substantial economic damage to forests and cultivated plants . the xyelidae is a small family of sawflies known from fewer than 50 extant species in 5 genera , with an extensive fossil record . they are the oldest fossil hymenoptera , dating back to the triassic , some 200 million years ago . most species occur in the northern hemisphere , especially in boreal regions , though there are a few neotropical species . most are associated with conifers ( esp . `` pinus '' and `` abies '' ) , where the larvae feed on pollen or within buds , though larvae of a few species feed on the leaves of deciduous trees .
