Epistaxis     epistaxis is when blood comes out of the nose . it is more commonly known as a nosebleed . even though nosebleeds can seem scary , they are usually not serious or life threatening . most nosebleeds happen in the front of the nose , and these are called `` anterior nosebleeds '' . sometimes , people get nosebleeds in the back of their noses , called `` posterior nosebleeds '' . these are more serious , and somebody who has one may have to go to the hospital . nosebleeds are more frequent during the winter months . during this time , more upper respiratory infections occur and changes in temperature and humidity are larger . most nosebleeds are caused by one of the following : - blunt trauma ( usually a punch to the nose ) - nose-picking they can also be caused by a reaction to something in the environment . many people tilt their heads back during a nosebleed , but this is actually not safe because it can make blood go down their throats and make them choke or get sick . instead , the best way to deal with a nosebleed is to tilt one 's head forward and pinch the bottom of their nose between one 's nostrils with a wet piece of tissue paper .
