Nikolai Vavilov     nikolai ivanovich vavilov ( 25 november 1887 â€“ 26 january 1943 ) was a russian botanist and geneticist . he is best known for showing how and where crop plants evolved . he devoted his life to agriculture : the study and improvement of wheat , corn , and other cereal crops . by 1940 , vavilov had accumulated a collection of 200,000 plant seeds from the soviet union and from abroad . he was widely admired , but his life came to a terrible end . vavilov repeatedly criticised a powerful but poor scientist , trofim lysenko . as a result , vavilov was arrested , and died of starvation in a prison in 1943. today vavilov 's name stands high . the `` vavilov institute of plant industry '' in st. petersburg is named after him . it maintains one of the world 's largest collections of plant genetic material . this is mimicry in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant . before herbicides , weeds were plucked by hand . this has been done for thousands of years . the weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different . vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans . the weeds that survive pass on their genes . gradually , all the weeds look more like the crop plant .
