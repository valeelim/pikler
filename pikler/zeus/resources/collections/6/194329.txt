Deep-throating     deep throating is a form of fellatio , when all of an erect penis is placed inside a man or woman 's mouth . the penis will enter the throat . the person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner , and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner . it is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating , because of the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched . different people have different sensitivities to the reflex , but some people learn to suppress the reflex . usually , the giving partner 's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck . the position of both partners is important in performing deep throat . for deep-throating , the giving partner 's mouth and throat will need to be aligned ( made into ) into a straight line , and he or she will need to respirate through the nose . it is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating , to be able to pull the penis out if needed ; and for the receiving partner not to thrust , as during irrumatio .
