G-Force     the g-force of an object is its acceleration relative to free fall . on earth the force is 1g , or 9.8 meters per second squared ( m/s2 ) , but astronauts experience unusually high and low g-forces . g-force can also be seen on rollercoasters . when the coaster goes down the drop , you are pushed back into your seat because of g-force .
