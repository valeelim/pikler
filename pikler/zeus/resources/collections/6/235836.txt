Weight training     weight training is a common type of strength training . it uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars , dumbbells or weight stacks to oppose the force generated by muscles . weight training uses many different special things to help certain areas of muscle and different kinds of body motions . `` weight training '' is not bodybuilding , olympic weightlifting , or `` powerlifting '' ; these are sports and not training . weight training is a part of these sports ' training . weight training has many similarities with other kinds of strength training . each uses the ideas of repetitions ( or reps ) , sets , tempo , and rest in different kinds of body motions to increase strength . for a certain body motion or exercise , `` reps '' are doing the motion again and again with no rest between . a `` set '' is a number of reps and a time of rest . 3 sets of 10 reps would be doing the motion 10 times , resting , doing it again 10 times , resting , and doing it ten more times , then resting . the `` tempo '' of an exercise means the speed one motion is done . a particular exercise may require you to move down then up , but one person may go down and come up in 2 seconds , while someone else may move slower and take 10 seconds . so 10 reps will take 20 seconds for the first person , but 100 seconds for the second . most times slower motion is more difficult .
