Natural units     natural units are ways of measuring things that depend on some basic characteristics of nature that do not change . which of these basic quantities to choose can depend on the physics problems being investigated , and sometimes choosing one thing as a natural unit means that the size of something else does not become used as a natural unit in that system . the old system of english measurements such as the pound are based on convenient objects in the natural world . the `` grain '' is the smallest of these objects , and originally it meant the weight of a grain of wheat or barley . each individual grain might be slightly larger or smaller than the next , but the more grains were added together to make a larger measure , the more these little differences would even out . even so , these measures were not entirely precise and did not relate to other measures such as the inch or the foot . in order to make calculations simpler and units more precise , it turned out that the mass of an electron or the mass of a proton were more useful standards to use for weight . all electrons are believed to have the same mass , and all protons are believed to have their own standard mass . but there is no simple mathematical relationship between the two masses .
