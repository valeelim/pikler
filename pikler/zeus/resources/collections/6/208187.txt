Trichome     trichomes are structures on a plant 's leaves . they look like tiny hairs sticking out from the surface of the leaf . trichomes are made of living cells , which can look very different . some trichomes have one long cell . other trichomes are a long chain of cells . they may have branches which make them look like a star . trichomes help to shade the leaf from the sun . they block too much wind from moving across the leaf surface . this stops too much water from leaving the leaf . animals might not eat leaves with trichomes because they do not like the taste . glandular trichomes have chemicals in them . they break when the leaf is touched , and then the chemicals come out .
