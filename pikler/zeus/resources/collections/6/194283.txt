Gresham's law    gresham 's law gresham 's law is commonly written : `` bad money drives out good . '' if people want one thing ( `` good '' money ) more than the other ( `` bad '' money ) , they will always offer the bad money in trade before the good money . over time , the good money will be kept in pocket , and only the bad money will be found in the market . the law is named after sir thomas gresham ( 1519-1579 ) . gresham founded the royal exchange in 1565. silver coins were widely circulated in canada ( until 1968 ) and in the united states ( until 1964 for dimes ( ten cents ) and quarters and 1970 for half dollars ) . however , these countries made their coins cheaper to make by switching to cheaper metals . the silver coins disappeared from circulation as people kept them for the value of their metal . the new coins had value as coins , but less value as metal . the same process happens now with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 canadian penny ( one cent ) , the pre-1982 united states penny and the pre-1992 uk copper pennies and two pence .
