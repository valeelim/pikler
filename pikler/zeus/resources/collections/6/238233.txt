Pheromone     a pheromone is a scent given off by some animals . the scent causes a social response in members of the same species . there are many types of pheromone , such as : - sex pheromones ( to attract a partner ) : e.g . butterflies and moths - alarm pheromones ( to warn the group ) : e.g . wasps - food trail pheromomes ( to let others know what has been found ) : e.g . ants - territorial pheromones : e.g . cats and dogs - various 'short-term ' pheromones cause a rapid but brief behaviour : e.g . releasing a cluster of nymphs , or positioning the body for sex . all pheromones work by inherited instinct , not by learning . they occur in most animals , but are especially obvious in insects .
