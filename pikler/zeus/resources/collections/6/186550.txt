Ashkenazi Jews     ashkenazi jews / `` ashkenazic jews '' / `` ashkenazim '' are jews who originally lived in northern and eastern europe . they once lived in the area of rhineland and france and after the crusades they moved to poland , lithuania and russia . in the 17th century , avoiding persecution , many jews moved to and settled in western europe . scientists believe that ashkenazi jews originally came from the land of israel and initially went to italy , france , and germany . later , during pogroms in the middle ages , mainly in germany , they fled to poland and lithuania , and from there they spread over the rest of eastern europe . they then adopted the yiddish language . after that , two terms , ashkenazi and sephardi , became commonly used : the former indicates the jews who worshiped in the german way and spoke yiddish , the latter indicates the jews who worshiped in the spanish way and spoke the ladino language . they differ in language ( pronunciation ) , cultural tradition and worship style . during world war ii , about 6 million jews , 5 million of whom were ashkenazi , were killed in the holocaust . the holocaust destroyed or greatly reduced the large jewish communities and the yiddish language in europe . many of the surviving ashkenazi jews emigrated to countries such as israel , canada , argentina , australia , and the united states after the war .
