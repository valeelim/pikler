Vector subspace     a vector subspace is a subset of a vector space that also is a vector space . this means that all the properties of the vector space are satisfied . let w be a non empty subset of a vector space v , then , w is a vector subspace if and only if the next 3 conditions are satisfied : 1. the element 0 is an element of w. 2. if x and y are elements of w , then x+y are also in w. 3. if c is an element of a field k and x is in w , then cx is on w .
