Speed reading     speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be read , so that the important facts of the text can still be understood . there are different ways to improve reading speed , but they are all similar . a trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute , for a text that is not very difficult to understand . better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute . using a lot of exercise , it is possible to increase reading speed further . the best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute , and understand about 80 % of them . in general , only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly . the brain guesses what the rest of the word is , based on a small part of the word . this also applies to groups of words , which are treated the same way . known groups are handled faster , because the reader knows them , and also has an `` image '' for them . what is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups . the reader will then add the known image to the context . a known font can help this .
