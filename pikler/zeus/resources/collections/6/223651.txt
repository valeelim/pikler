Pachycephalosaur     the pachycephalosaurs are a group of ornithopod dinosaurs in the suborder cerapoda . their thick round skulls were used for defence and , probably , for mating contests . in some species , the skull roof is domed and several inches thick ; in others it is flat or wedge-shaped.the flat-headed pachycephalosaurs are usually regarded as distinct species or even families , but they may be juveniles of dome-headed adults . the domes were often surrounded by nodes and/or spikes . there is evidence of head-butting in pachycephalosaurs . of 100 domes studied , 20 percent showed signs of healed injuries , all consistent with combative behavior . the pathologies included pitting where the bone had become infected from wounds that originated in the skin . these findings suggest that pachycephalosaurids may have been using their heads for both display and defence as many modern animals do . genera . family pachycephalosauridae . - `` amtocephale '' - `` dracorex '' - `` gravitholus '' - `` micropachycephalosaurus ''
