Subset sum problem     the subset sum problem is an important problem of computer science . it can be stated as follows : given a set of integers , does any subset of them sum to zero ? for example , given the set { -7 , -3 , -2 , 5 , 8 } , the answer is `` yes '' because the subset { -3 , -2 , 5 } sums to zero . the problem is np-complete . it can be reformulated to the 3sat . an alternative statement of this problem is , given a set of numbers and an integer x determine whether or not there exist a subset that sums up to x. eg . given a set { 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 } and x = 10 the answer is `` yes '' because { 4 , 6 } sums to 10. remember that the subsequence need not to be contiguous . for instance if x = 8 in above example the answer is still yes because { 1 , 7 } sums to 8 .
