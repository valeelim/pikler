Pollen tube     the pollen tube is the tube through which sperm from the pollen reaches the egg cell , and fertilises the plant to form seeds . the pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a passageway . it transports sperm cells from the pollen grain , from the stigma ( in flowering plants ) to the ovules at the base of the pistil . like ferns , other basal land plants , and many algae , some gymnosperms have flagellate sperm , which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells . in angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma , style , ovary and ovules to reach the eggs . in maize , this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil . the sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube . as the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a `` double fertilization '' . one sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant , while a second sperm unites with the central cell ( polar nuclei ) to produce the endosperm of the seed . the endosperm is rich in starch , proteins and oils and is a major source of human food ( e.g. , wheat , barley , rye , oats , corn )
