British Home Guard     the british home guard was a defence organisation of the british army during world war ii . it was a secondary defence line . it was meant to stop invasion by nazi forces . the home guard existed from 1940 to 1944. it was composed of one and a half million volunteers who were otherwise not allowed to go into military service . the main reason for this was old age . this led to the nickname `` dad 's army '' . the home guard guarded the coastal areas of britain from enemy threats , like paratroopers . they also helped guard some industrial areas , such as factories and airfields . it was widely popularised after the war by the comedy show `` dad 's army '' . the beginning of the home guard are usually traced back to captain tom wintringham . when returning from the spanish civil war , wintringham wrote a book called `` how to reform the army '' . in it , he writes about how britain could make something similar to the spanish international brigades in the civil war . although the book was well received , many of its suggestions were ignored at the time . this was because the tensions in europe did not seem likely to escalate into war .
