The Musical Offering     the musical offering ( german title musikalisches opfer or das musikalische opfer ) , bwv 1079 , is a collection of several pieces of music by johann sebastian bach . it consists of canons , fugues , ricercars and a trio sonata . all the music is based on a tune made up by king frederick ii of prussia ( frederick the great ) . bach dedicated the work to him . the idea for this music started at a meeting between bach and frederick ii on 7 may 1747. one of bach ’ s sons , carl philipp emanuel , was one of the king ’ s court musicians . the king wanted to show johann sebastian bach a new instrument that had recently been invented . this was the piano . the king invited bach to his palace at potsdam . during the visit the king gave bach a theme and asked him to write a 3 part fugue based on it . bach was good at improvisation so he made up a 3 part fugue . the king wondered whether he could make up a 6 part fugue . that would be very difficult , and people thought he was joking , but bach said he would think about it .
