Epicureanism     epicureanism is a philosophy based on the teachings of epicurus . it started about 307 bc . epicurus was a materialist who believed there were atoms . the teaching about atoms was first started by democritus . epicurus was a materialist , and fiercely attacked superstition . according to epicurus , the gods are passive : they do not intervene in the world . according to aristippus , epicurus believed that the greatest good was to have certain pleasures , and to reach a state of mind where there is no fear and no pain . epicureanism is a form of hedonism , because it declares that pleasure is the only good there is . epicureanism says that the absence of pain is the greatest pleasure ; it also advocates a simple life . these ideas make it sufficiently different from `` hedonism '' as it is usually defined . in the epicurean view , the highest pleasure ( tranquility and freedom from fear ) was obtained by knowledge , friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life . epicurus spoke favorably about the enjoyment of simple pleasures ; he also meant abstaining from bodily desires , such as sex and appetites , almost like asceticism .
