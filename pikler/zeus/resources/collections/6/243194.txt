Sipuncula     the sipuncula ( or sipunculida , or peanut worms ) are a small phylum of marine worms , or they may be a class in the annelida . the phylum has 144–320 species ( estimates vary ) of these bilaterally symmetrical , unsegmented worms . sipunculans are worm-like animals ranging from in length , with most species being under . the body consists of a narrow front section , called the `` introvert '' and a larger trunk section . the introvert is retractable into the trunk . sipunculans have a coelom ( body cavity ) , and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids . the body wall is strong and muscular . when threatened , sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel – a practice that has given rise to the name `` peanut worm '' . the most recognizable part of sipunculan worms is their mouth , which is surrounded by a mass of 18–24 ciliated tentacles , all of which may be inverted into the body . the tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate , and are probably also function as gills . the mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert , which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules . in contrast , the trunk tends to be relatively smooth .
