916 America     < /div > 916 america is a minor planet that is orbiting the sun in the main belt between mars and jupiter . it was discovered on 7 august 1915 by the soviet astronomer grigory nikolaevich neujmin at simeis , ukraine . it was originally called 916i , but was renamed `` 916 america '' on 24 february 1923 after the council of astronomers at pulkovo observatory decided to pay tribute to `` the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers '' . another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in crimea by the american relief administration under president herbert hoover . in 1986 , believing that the asteroid was of s-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km , the length of 916 america 's day was thought to be 38 hours . observations by the infrared astronomical satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3 km , with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo ( the extent to which it reflects light ) of 0.053±0.004 .
