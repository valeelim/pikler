Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram     the hertzsprung-russell diagram is a graph of many stars . it shows the relation between stars ' luminosity ( that is , how bright they are ) and their temperature ( how hot they are ) . these diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars . rather , hertzsprung-russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the star 's brightness versus its temperature . hertzsprung-russell diagrams are also called h-r diagrams or hrds . you can see an example of a hertzsprung-russell diagram to the right . this diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our milky way galaxy . the hertzsprung-russell diagram is named after its creators , astronomers ejnar hertzsprung and henry norris russell . the vertical axis of a hertzsprung-russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars , as if they were all measured from the same distance . another term for this is absolute magnitude . the brighter a star is , the higher its plot will be on this chart . the horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars . however , the temperatures go `` down '' , not up , as you move to the right . that is , the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots ( greater than 30,000 kelvins ) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000k .
