All-America     in sports , an all-america `` team '' is a group of amateur athletes who are honored for being the best in the sport . the players who are on these teams are usually selected by members of the media or companies who sponsor the team . in other cases , players become an all-american by achieving a standard such as placing in the top 40 of the ncaa cross country race . sometimes these teams play in games against other all-american teams , but most all-american teams never actually compete in events .
