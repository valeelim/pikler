Cypripedioideae     lady 's slipper orchids are the orchids in the subfamily cypripedioideae . they are special because of their slipper-shaped pouches on their flowers . the pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the modified stamens , where they get or give pollen , fertilizing the flower . some people think this subfamily should be different from the orchidaceae as a family cypripediaceae . a lady slipper orchid has a deep pocket that is actually a bee trap . when a bee crawls down into the flower to get the nectar , the pocket on the flower closes shut . because of this , the bee is stuck for a while , wiggling and squirming , getting pollen all over itself . the bee finally finds a small opening near the top of the orchid , and it gets out so that it can get trapped inside another lady slipper , where it will give that pollen to the other lady slipper 's stigma . the lady 's slipper is also known in the united states of america as the `` moccasin flower '' , because it looks like a shoe or moccasin .
