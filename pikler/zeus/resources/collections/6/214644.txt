Clever Hans     clever hans ( in german , der kluge hans ) was a horse that was supposed to be able to do lots of difficult mathematical sums and solve complicated problems . later it was discovered that the horse was giving the right answers by watching the reactions of the people who were watching him . hans was a horse that lived in germany in the early 20th century . he belonged to a man called herr wilhelm von osten . van osten was a teacher who taught maths at a school . he was an amateur horse trainer . this was a time when people were becoming interested in how intelligent animals were . this was largely because of what charles darwin had been writing about . von osten taught hans to add , subtract , multiply , divide , work with fractions , tell the time and date , read and spell and to understand german . if he asked the horse a question such as : `` what is 12 plus 12 '' , the horse would tap its hoof 24 times . von osten travelled round the country with hans , showing off his clever horse to the public .
