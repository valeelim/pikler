Theory     a theory is a group of linked ideas intended to explain something . a theory provides a framework for explaining observations . the explanations are based on assumptions . from the assumptions follows a number of possible hypotheses . they can be tested to provide support for , or challenge , the theory . the word 'theory ' has several meanings : 1. a guess or speculation 1. a law about things which can not be seen directly , such as electrons or evolution 1. a whole system of laws and hypotheses which explain many things . 1. a field of study these meanings can `` shade into each other '' . another source offers : 1. hypothesis , but not verified 1. systematically organised knowledge 1. explanation a theory in science ( in contrast to a theory in layman 's terms ) is `` a logical , systematic set of principles or explanation that has been verifiedâ€”has stood up against attempts to prove it false '' . for example , darwin 's theory of evolution is a system of ideas that points to humans and apes having evolved from a common ancestor . this conclusion is based on evidence that supports it .
