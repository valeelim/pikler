Fulgurite     fulgurites are a rare type of natural glass made when lightning hits silica-rich minerals that are commonly in sand , soil , and some rocks . `` tubular fulgurites '' are found in places with a lot of silica , like beaches or deserts . lightning makes a tubular fulgurite when a bolt goes through the sand and melts silica into a liquid . the liquid silica cools and hardens quickly , leaving behind a thin glassy tube , usually with a rough outer surface and a smooth inner surface . underground , a fulgurite may be shaped like the roots of a tree , branching out with many arms that trace the zigzagging path of the lightning bolt . they are quite delicate , with walls no thicker than 1-2 mm . some of the largest fulgurites are removed from the ground in many pieces and then glued back into their original shape .
