Risotto     risotto risotto ( plural : `` risotti '' ) is a typical italian dish based on rice . originally it comes from piedmont , where rice is commonly grown . it is very important for the cuisine of milan . common ingredients of the base recipe are white wine , and onions . risotto is a class of italian rice dishes cooked in broth to a creamy consistency . the broth may be meat- , fish- , or vegetable-based . many types of risotto contain parmesan cheese , butter , and onion . it is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in italy . risotto is normally a `` primo '' ( first course ) , served on its own before the main course , but `` risotto alla milanese '' is often served together with ossobuco alla milanese . a high-starch ( amylopectin ) , low-amylose round medium- or short-grain rice is usually used to make risotto . such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties . the principal varieties used in italy are arborio , baldo , carnaroli , maratelli , padano , roma , and vialone nano . carnaroli , maratelli and vialone nano are considered to be the best ( and most expensive ) varieties , with different users preferring one over the other . they have slightly different properties . for example , carnaroli is less likely than vialone nano to get overcooked , but the latter , being smaller , cooks faster and absorbs condiments better . other varieties like roma , baldo , ribe and originario may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish . these varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and for making sweet rice desserts . rice designations of superfino , semifino and fino refer to the size and shape ( specifically the length and the narrowness ) of the grains , and not the quality .
