All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference     the all jammu and kashmir muslim conference is a major political party of azad jammu and kashmir . in 1932 pro-congress sheikh abdullah formed kashmir 's first political party , the all jammu & kashmir muslim conference , with a demand for merger of kashmir and jammu with british india . his party was renamed the national conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of kashmiri culture . the all jammu and kashmir national conference , led by sheikh mohammed abdullah , espoused a secular ideology and wished to create a secular , democratic but independent kashmir with close ties to british india . when the all jammu and kashmir muslim conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939 , the muslim leaders amended the constitution of the muslim conference , renamed it as the all jammu and kashmir national conference , modified its objectives and threw its membership open to all the people of the state . on 13 june 1941 , the breakaway factions of the national conference revived the erstwhile muslim conference under the leadership of choudry ghualm abbas .
