Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis     bach-werke-verzeichnis ( bwv ) is a list of all the pieces of music by johann sebastian bach that are known . in english it means bach works catalogue . the catalogue was made by wolfgang schmieder in 1950. he took all the music that is known by johann sebastian bach ( some of bach 's music has been lost ) and gave each piece a number . each piece of music by bach therefore has a bwv number . for example , the `` mass in b minor '' is bwv 232. giving each piece a number helps us to know exactly which piece of music we are talking about . for example , there are several preludes and fugues in g major , but putting `` prelude and fugue in g major bwv550 '' makes it clear which one it is . the bwv numbers are not listed chronologically ( in the order they were written ) . they are grouped according to what kind of music it is : all the cantatas together , all the concertos together , etc . some pieces of music may be written by bach , but we are not sure . those doubtful pieces of music are listed separately as `` bwv anhang '' ( bwv appendix ) . some of what schmieder wrote in 1950 has been updated because some new music by bach has been discovered . other pieces of music have now been proved not to be by bach .
