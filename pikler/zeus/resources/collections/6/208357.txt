Pedernales, Dominican Republic    pedernales , dominican republic pedernales is a dominican city and the capital of the pedernales province , in the southwest of the country close to the border with haiti . the name of `` pedernales '' was given to the town when it was founded because that was the name of the river that now is the border between haiti and the dominican republic . `` pedernales '' or `` silex '' ( `` flint '' ) is the name of a hard mineral that is common in the region . before the conquest of the island by european people , some native groups lived around the place where the city of pedernales is now . but soon those groups disappeared and very few people came to live here because it is a very dry region . when the french colony of `` saint-domingue '' ( present haiti ) was created , the pedernales river was the southern border between that colony and the spanish colony of `` santo domingo '' ( present dominican republic ) . during those colonial times , some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time . in 1927 , the dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them ; the new town was given the name of pedernales and its first administrator was s√≥crates nolasco who later became a well-known writer .
