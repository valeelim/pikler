Southern corroboree frog     there are two species of corroboree frog , the southern corroboree frog , `` pseudophryne corroboree '' , and the northern corroboree frog , `` pseudophryne pengilleyi '' . the southern corroboree frog is a very small frog with warning colouration . it has black and yellow stripes , sometimes with a greenish tinge . it is one of the brightest frogs in the world . it only lives in an area of about in the kosciusko national park in south east australia . scientists believe that the total population of corroboree frogs is less than 250. numbers of the frog have dropped by 80 % in the last ten years , and so the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources ( iucn ) have listed the southern corroboree frog as being a critically endangered species . the southern corroboree frog only lives in a small area in the kosciusko national park . it mainly lives in snow gum ( `` eucalyptus pauciflora '' ) forest , and sphagnum ( a type of moss ) swamps . these places are very cold , because the corroboree frog only lives in areas higher than above sea level . they breed in small ponds and wetlands during the summer months .
