Gastrulation     gastrulation is a phase early in the development of most animal embryos . in it the embryo is dramatically restructured by cell migration . gastrulation varies in different phyla . it is followed by `` organogenesis '' , when individual organs develop within the newly formed `` germ layers '' . the gastrula is the double-walled stage of the embryo . during gastrulation , some of the cells of the blastula migrate inwards to make an inner layer , the `` endoderm '' . in some animals another cell layer forms , the `` mesoderm '' , between the endoderm and the `` ectoderm '' . among animals , sponges show the simplest organization , having a single germ layer . cnidaria and ctenophores show an increase in complexity , having two germ layers , the `` endoderm '' and `` ectoderm '' . all higher animals ( from flatworms to humans ) possess a `` mesoderm '' as well as ectoderm and endoderm . the purpose of gastrulation is to position the 3 embryonic germ layers , the endoderm , ectoderm and mesoderm . these layers later develop into certain bodily systems .
