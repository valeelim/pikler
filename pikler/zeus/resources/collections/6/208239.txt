Wavelet transform     the wavelet transform is a time-frequency representation of a signal . for example , we use it for noise reduction , feature extraction or signal compression . wavelet transform of continuous signal is defined as where - formula_2 is so called mother wavelet , - formula_3 denotes wavelet dilation , - formula_4 denotes time shift of wavelet and - formula_5 symbol denotes complex conjugate . in case of formula_6 and formula_7 , where formula_8 , formula_9 and formula_10 and formula_11 are integer constants , the wavelet transform is called discrete wavelet transform ( of continuous signal ) . in case of formula_12 and formula_13 , where formula_14 , the discrete wavelet transform is called dyadic . it is defined as where - formula_10 is frequency scale , - formula_11 is time scale and - formula_18 is constant which depends on mother wavelet . it is possible to rewrite dyadic discrete wavelet transform as where formula_20 is impulse characteristic of continuous filter which is identical to formula_21 for given formula_10 .
