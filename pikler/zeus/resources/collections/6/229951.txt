Viral life cycle     viruses are near the same to living organisms , however there are differences . one of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves . a virus can not survive on its own . it is only active when reproducing within a host , using a hosts ' resources and food . once inside a host , a virus 's main purpose is to make as many copies of itself , and infect other host cells ; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring . the viral life cycle is dependent on a host cell . a virus is not able to replicate on its own or use `` raw '' materials on which to survive . a virus will remain dormant until it is able to infect the next host , activate and replicate . some viruses can live in an open place for a short time , in some cases , only a few hours . viruses use the most efficient method to locate a host , create copies , and spread to other hosts . usually viral infections occur when a virus enters the host : - through a physical breach ( a cut in the skin )
