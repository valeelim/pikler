Alexander Alekhine     alexander alekhine ( 31 october 1892 â€“ 24 march 1946 ) was the fourth world chess champion , and the only one to die holding the title . by the age of twenty-two , he was already one of the strongest grandmasters . during the 1920s , he was one of the hypermoderns , and won many tournaments . in 1927 , he became world champion by beating capablanca . the match of 34 games was the longest world championship match held until 1985. in the early 1930s alekhine dominated tournament play , and won top-class tournaments by large margins . he also played first board for france in four chess olympiads , winning prizes in each . his tournament record became less good from the mid-1930s onwards ; alcoholism is often blamed for this . although alekhine offered capablanca a rematch on the same terms that capablanca had set for him , negotiations dragged on for years . it became clear that alekhine would never let the match take place . meanwhile , he defended his title with ease against bogolyubov in 1929 and 1934 .
