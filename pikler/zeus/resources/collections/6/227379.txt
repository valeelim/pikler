Swift     the swift is a bird in the family apodidae . it is in the order apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds . the swift is very good at flying . it spends all of its time in the air . the scientific name for the swift ( `` apus '' ) comes from the ancient greek word απους , `` apous '' which means `` without feet '' . this is because swifts have very small , weak feet . swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places ( for example , the wall of a house , or a cliff ) . swifts do not want to land on the ground . if they land on ground , they can not fly up again . some people say if you see a swift on the ground , you should pick it up and throw it up in the air so it can fly again . swifts are small birds . they can fly very well and very fast . some swifts can fly at 514m per second . if a swift needs to fly very fast , it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time . when catching insects , they fly in a series of swoops , changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey . swifts have long , curved wings . the wings are in the same of a sickle or boomerang . they have a forked tail . this means it looks like a v shape .
