Italian conquest of British Somaliland     the italian conquest of british somaliland was an italian campaign during world war ii against the british empire . it was the only italian victory against the allies that was won without help from germany . when italy declared war in may 1940 , the italian troops were not prepared for a prolonged war in eastern africa . as a consequence , mussolini ordered only some limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of kenya , egypt and sudan . some skirmishes happened even in french somalia , with an invasion of the western half of djibouti . in june 1940 , amedeo , duke of aosta , the governor-general of `` italian east africa '' , convinced the italian supreme command ( `` commando supremo '' ) to plan a campaign to conquer a british colony : british somaliland . the king of italy victor emmanuel iii and mussolini agreed and at the beginning of august the campaign was ready to start . the italian force attacking british somaliland in august 1940 was commanded by general guglielmo nasi and included five colonial brigades , three `` blackshirt '' battalions , and three bands ( `` bande '' ) of native troops . the italians had the 2nd light tank company and the 322nd medium tank company ( 13 l3/35 light and 12 m11/39 medium tanks ) , artillery , and , most important , superior air support . the italians numbered about 4,800 and about 30,000 native troops .
