Plurality voting     plurality voting is the most common method for electing representatives in the united states and some other countries . voters vote for one candidate , and the candidate with the most votes wins . political parties often use a primary in order to avoid splitting their party vote in a general election . for example , if 60 % of the voters are republican , and 40 % democrat , but two republicans run for the same office and each get 30 % of the vote , the democrat would win with 40 % , since that is the most votes , even if 60 % of voters least preferred the democrat . if more than two candidates are on the general election ballot , voters often compromise vote an acceptable candidate whom they think has a chance of winning . opponents of plurality voting argue that the media has too much power since they tell people which of the two has a chance and that voting for a third candidate is in effect voting for the worse of the two strong candidates . it is theoretically possible that the two `` front runner '' candidates not to be not centrist and not to represent the people .
