Haber process     the haber process or the haber-bosch process is a chemical reaction that uses nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to create the chemical compound ammonia . the haber process uses temperatures ranging from 400°c to 450°c under a pressure of 200 atm . the haber process uses a catalyst mostly made up of iron . the haber process is named after the german scientist . haber was the first person to successfully complete the process . in 1909 , haber 's process could produce about one cup of ammonia every two hours . carl bosch helped to develop the haber process for industry . in 1913 , the german company basf started using the haber process to make ammonia . during world war i , the haber process was used to make explosives . the germans kept this a secret until after the war . in 1918 , haber won the nobel prize in chemistry , and in 1931 , bosch also shared a nobel prize . the haber process is still important today because it produces ammonia , which is needed for fertilizer and for many other purposes . the haber process produces about 500 million tons ( 453 billion kilograms ) of fertilizer every year . this fertilizer helps to feed about 40 % of the world 's population .
