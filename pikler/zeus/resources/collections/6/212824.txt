Kingsway tramway subway     the kingsway tramway subway is a cut-and-cover tunnel in central london . it was built for the london county council to join two tramway systems called the `` north side '' and `` south side '' . used by single deck tramcars only , but an upgrade between 1928 and 1931 meant that double deck trams could use it . the subway was closed in 1952. part of the subway is now the strand underpass , but the rest has not been changed very much and still has tram tracks inside it . it is now a grade ii listed structure . the london county council had two tramway systems called the `` north side '' and `` south side '' . for a long time they wanted to join the two together . this would allow them to send trams from the `` north side '' to the central repair depot in charlton in south east london for overhauls . in 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the holborn area and rebuild them . this gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway . in 1902 , the council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground ( subway ) . the subway went from theobalds road in the north to the embankment underneath waterloo bridge to the south . from there a line that was not underground would continue over waterloo bridge .
