Manchester code     the manchester code is a binary encoding which also encodes the clock signal . this is very useful , because an external clock signal is no longer needed . a sequence of bits modulates the phase of the signal . this is a form of phase shift keying , often shortened to psk . otherwise put , the information about the signal is in its signal flanks , that is when the signal changes . manchester codes are widely used , for example for ethernet or for rfid . there are two ways to represent a manchester code : 1. a falling signal flank represents a logical `` 1 '' and ascending flank is a logical `` 0 '' . this is the original definition given by g.e . thomas 1. a falling signal flank is a logical `` 0 '' , the ascending one a logical `` 1 '' . this is the definition used by the original ethernet standard . to rule out ambiguities , manchester codes use a `` preamble '' . a preamble is a fixed sequence that is known beforehand . one of the advantages of manchester code is that the dc component of the signal carries no information . this makes it possible that standards that usually do not carry power can transmit this information . one of the drawbacks of the encoding is that it needs more bandwidth than other encodings , such as nrz .
