Oblast     oblast is a type of administrative division in slavic countries and some countries of the former soviet union . the word `` oblast '' is used in english as well , but it is often translated as `` area '' , `` zone '' , `` province '' , or `` region '' . the last translation may lead to confusion , because the subdivision of `` oblast '' is called `` raion '' which can be translated as `` region '' or `` district '' as well . oblasts are a type of administrative division of belarus , bulgaria , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , russia , ukraine , and the no longer existing soviet union . official terms in successor states of the soviet union differ , but some still use a cognate of the russian term , e.g . voblast ( voblasts , voblasts ' , ) is used for provinces of belarus , and oblys ( plural : oblystar ) for provinces of kazakhstan . since 1997 , bulgaria has been divided into 28 `` oblasti '' , usually translated as `` provinces '' . before , the country was divided into nine bigger units , also called `` oblast '' . ukraine is divided into 24 oblasts . in the russian empire , oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of governorates general or krais . the majority of then-existing oblasts were on the periphery of the country or covered the areas where cossacks lived .
