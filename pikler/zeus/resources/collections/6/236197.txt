Marie Byrd Land     marie byrd land is a part of antarctica . it is between the ross ice shelf and the ross sea to the west and the pacific ocean to the north . it goes towards the east to a line between the head of the ross ice shelf and eights coast . it stretches between 158°w and 103°24'w . the area between the rockefeller plateau and eights coast is included . this is because rear admiral richard e. byrd had an important role in its exploration . admiral byrd named the territory in 1929. it was in honour of his wife . he applied the name to the territory that was explored in that year . the area is very , even for antarctica . because of this , most of it ( the east part of 150°w ) has not been claimed by any country . the territory is not a nation itself . because of this , it is the largest single unclaimed territory on earth . together with eights coast , immediately to the east of marie byrd land , it has an area of 1,610,000 km² . in 1939 , us president franklin d. roosevelt told members of an antarctic expedition to claim some antarctic territory . members of this expedition and later ones seemed to do so , but no official claims were made before 1959 , when the antarctic treaty system was set up . some maps in the united states have shown this as us territory . the defense department of the us government has also said that there was a solid basis for a claim for the territory . this was because of the activities there before 1959 .
