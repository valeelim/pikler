Linguistic reduction     linguistic reductions are lost sounds in words . this happens in spoken english . for instance , `` going to '' changes to `` gon na '' . the most widely known reductions are contractions . most contractions are reductions of 'not ' . for instance , `` can not '' becomes `` ca n't '' . many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb . for instance , `` he is ... '' becomes `` he 's ... '' some reductions are well known to language learners ; for instance the reduction of a verb and `` to '' . examples are `` going to '' becoming `` gon na '' and `` want to '' becoming `` wan na '' . linguistic reductions are part of natural english . they can not be considered slang , or improper . there are several basic categories of reductions : - elision is one or more sounds left out of a word . a common example is `` and '' . it frequently changes to `` an '' or sometimes even `` n '' . another example is the `` ba '' sound in `` probably '' . this leads to the pronunciation , `` probly '' . - word stress is a weaker stress on a word . the other words around it are stressed more by comparison . the weakly stressed word may be blended , linked or even deleted .
