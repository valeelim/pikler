Peterloo Massacre     the peterloo massacre ( or battle of peterloo ) happened at st peter 's field , manchester , england , on 16 august 1819. it was when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 gathered at a meeting to demand the reform of parliamentary representation . the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 had resulted in a time of famine and chronic unemployment . this was exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the corn laws . by the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions and the lack of suffrage in northern england , had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism . in response , the manchester patriotic union organised a demonstration to be addressed by the radical orator henry hunt . the manchester patriotic union was a group agitating for parliamentary reform . shortly after the meeting began , local magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest henry hunt and several others with him , and to the men . cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn . in the resulting confusion , 15 people were killed and 400 to 700 were injured . the massacre was given the name peterloo in ironic comparison to the battle of waterloo , which had taken place four years earlier .
