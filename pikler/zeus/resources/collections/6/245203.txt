Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder     obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality disorder ( ocpd ) is a personality disorder . people with ocpd are with rules and order , and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right . this can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things , for themselves and the people around them . people with ocpd pay an unusual amount of attention to details , rules , lists , order , organization , and schedules . it is very hard to get them to change their minds . they are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right . because of this , they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong . some people with ocpd , but not all of them , have a strong need to be clean . those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean , but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other `` more important '' things . for example , the need to finish a project at work might cause the ocpd person to have a quite unorganized home . but if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things , they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time .
