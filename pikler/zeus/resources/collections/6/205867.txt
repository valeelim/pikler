Tenure     tenure is normally used for jobs , usually academic high-ranking jobs like professors . it is to protect professors who are teaching something that their employer , the university , might not agree with . tenure means that these people can not be fired without a very good reason- the job is for life . the reason for tenure is to help professors be bold about what they teach and research , so that new ideas will be developed . or a teacher can also have a tenure . it depends how long their term has to be . sometimes judges also get tenure . this is so that they can make decisions based on the evidence , even if this means saying that the government , which is their employer , is wrong .
