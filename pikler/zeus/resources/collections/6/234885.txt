Mount Mitchell     mount mitchell is a mountain in north carolina . it is tall , the tallest in the blue ridge mountains . the top of the mountain is the highest point in the united states east of the black hills in south dakota . the mountain was named after elisha mitchell , a professor at the university of north carolina , who determined its height in 1835 , and fell to his death at nearby mitchell falls in 1857 , having returned to verify his earlier measurements . the ascent of mount mitchell is now rather easy , since a 4.6 miles ( 7.4 km ) road ( nc 128 ) off the historic and scenic blue ridge parkway runs nearby , and a 980-foot ( 300 m ) trail leads through a conifer forest to the summit . the 40-foot ( 12 m ) stone observation tower on the summit was torn down in late 2006. a new observation deck was constructed and opened to visitors in january 2009 .
