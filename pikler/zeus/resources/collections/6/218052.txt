Mesozoic     the mesozoic was the geological era in which dinosaurs lived , among with other animals . it lasted around 186 million years , starting 252.2 mya ( million years ago ) with the p/tr extinction and ending 66 mya with the k/t extinction ( the one that killed dinosaurs ) . dinosaurs appeared around 231 mya ( 21 million years after the beginning of the mesozoic ) . they evolved from early reptiles called the archosaurs ( a group of which modern birds and crocodiles are still part ) . the mesozoic is the middle of the three eras that make up the phanerozoic eon . before the mesozoic was the palaeozoic era . the k/t extinction in 66 mya also marks the beginning of the cenozoic era , the one we live in . the three mesozoic periods were : - triassic ( 252–201 mya ) - lower triassic ( 252–247 mya ) - middle triassic ( 247–237 mya ) - upper triassic ( 237–201 mya ) - jurassic ( 201–145 mya ) - lower jurassic ( 201–176 mya ) - middle jurassic ( 176–161 mya ) - upper jurassic ( 161–145 mya ) - cretaceous ( 145–66 mya ) - lower cretaceous ( 145–100 mya )
