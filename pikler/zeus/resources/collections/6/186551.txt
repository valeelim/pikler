Dilation and evacuation     dilation and evacuation ( or `` d & e '' ) is a medical procedure . it may be used as a method of abortion when a woman is in her second trimester ( between 12â€“32 weeks pregnant ) . this procedure also may be used after a woman has a miscarriage , to make sure that the uterus is emptied out completely . if tissue is left behind in a woman 's uterus after a miscarriage , she can get an infection . a dilation and evacuation involves two major steps . first , the cervix ( the bottom part of the uterus ) is dilated , or made bigger . this is often done about a day before the actual procedure . to dilate the cervix , a doctor may put special tools into the cervix . the cervix needs to be made larger so that medical tools , like forceps ( surgical tongs ) or a curette ( a tool that is used to scrape away the lining of the uterus ) can be put into the cervix . the second step of the d & e procedure is to evacuate , or remove , everything inside of the uterus . the woman is given a local anesthetic to numb part of her body or a general anesthetic to put her to sleep . the doctor will then put a cannula ( a medical tube ) into the uterus , through the vagina . the cannula is attached to a bottle and a pump that create a vacuum . the cannula is used to vacuum ( or suction ) out everything that is in the uterus , including the fetus . the doctor may use forceps to take out any tissue that is still in the uterus . the doctor may also use a curette to scrape out the lining of the uterus . the vacuum can then be used again to make sure that the uterus is completely empty . this is to prevent infection from tissue left behind by accident .
