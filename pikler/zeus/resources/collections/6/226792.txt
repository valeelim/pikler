Atari 5200     the atari 5200 supersystem , or simply the atari 5200 , was a video game console which came out in 1982. it was made by atari inc. and was supposed to replace the popular atari 2600. atari wanted the 5200 to compete with the intellivision , but it competed more closely with the colecovision . the 5200 was based on atari inc. 's 400/800 computers . even though the internal hardware was almost identical , the software was not . design mistakes meant that the 5200 had problems with its use . these problems made it a poor seller . the game 's atari 400-based design made for a design which atari inc. could quickly build and sell . while it was being designed , the atari 5200 called the `` atari video system x - advanced video computer system . '' atari protected the design with a codename , `` pam , '' after a female employee at atari . a rumor said that `` pam '' or `` pam '' actually stood for `` personal arcade machine . '' this was because most games for the system were based on existing arcade games . actual working `` atari video system x '' machines , whose hardware is 100 % identical to the atari 5200 do exist , but they are extremely rare .
