Cathode ray     a cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes . it is called a `` cathode ray '' because the electrons are being emitted from the positive charged element in the vacuum tube called the cathode . a cathode ray tube aims the ray at a point on its screen . they were first observed in 1869 by german physicist johann hittorf , and were named in 1876 by eugen goldstein `` kathodenstrahlen '' , or cathode rays . electrons were discovered as the constituents of cathode rays in 1897 by british physicist j. j. thomson . he showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle , which was later called the `` electron '' . cathode ray tubes ( crts ) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set . some properties of cathode rays : - they travel linearly - they have a negative electric charge - they have particle property - magnets can deflect them - charge/mass ratio of the rays is constant
