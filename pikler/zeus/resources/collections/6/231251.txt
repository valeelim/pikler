Molecular clock     the molecular clock is a technique which estimates when two taxa diverged in evolution . it is based on comparing the detailed structure of key molecules . the method may be done for species , or any high data used for such calculations is often nucleotide sequences in genome analysis , or amino acid sequences for proteins such as haemoglobin . it is sometimes called a `` gene clock '' or `` evolutionary clock '' . the key assumption behind the technique is that , in the long run , changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate . researchers such as ayala have challenged this assumption . according to ayala , these factors combine to limit the application of molecular clock models : - changing generation times : a mutation generally becomes fixed only from one generation to another . the shorter this timespan is , the more mutations can become fixed . - population size : apart from effects of small population size , genetic diversity will `` bottom out '' as populations become larger , and the fitness advantage of any one mutation becomes smaller .
