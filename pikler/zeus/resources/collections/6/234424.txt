Numerical weather prediction     numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made . this is done using computer models of the atmosphere . such models describe the current weather conditions , and how they change over time using equations . using the current weather conditions , the equations can be solved , or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future . the relevant physical parameters , such as pressure , temperature , the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time . these are modelled with a system of partial differential equations . this is a dynamic system that is solved numerically . most of these equations are implemented using fortran . the equations are approximated . since this takes a lot of computing power or time , supercomputers are used for this task , most of the time . the atmosphere is modelled as a fluid . the basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time . the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future .
