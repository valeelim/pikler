Two-source hypothesis     the two-source hypothesis is a hypothesis that was made in the 19th century . it tries to explain what is called the synoptic problem in christian theology . this problem is that certain parts of the gospels of mark , matthew and luke have texts that are very similar . the hypothesis claims that the gospels of matthew and luke were written based on the gospel of mark , and lost source text , called q. the q is for german `` quelle '' , and means source . the lost document was likely a collection of jesus ' sayings , very probably written in ancient greek . the hypothesis is widely accepted among christian scholars . there are two major problems with this hypothesis : - there is something that is called `` minor agreements '' . these are parts of the text , where both matthew and luke agree , but where mark does not . to explain this , many people believe that matthew and luke did not use the text of mark as it was included in the new testament , but rather an earlier version . some people even say that they did not use the same version of this earlier text . this could also explain why the text in mk 6,45-8,26 is missing from luke .
