Bacchus     bacchus was the roman god of agriculture , wine and fertility copied from the greek god dionysus . he was the last god to join the twelve olympians ; hestia gave up her seat for him . his plants were vines and twirling ivy . he often carried a pinecone-topped staff , and his followers were goat-footed satyrs and maenads , wild women who danced energetically during his festivals . bacchus was the child of jupiter ( whose greek name is zeus ) and semele , a human whom juno ( whose greek name is hera ) had tricked into asking to see jupiter as he really was . since she was a mortal , she was burned up by the sight of jupiter in his divine form . so jupiter sewed the infant bacchus into his thigh , and gave birth to him nine months later . as a child , bacchus was tutored by silenus , who was a great lover of wine and often had to be carried on the back of a donkey . before he took his place at olympus , bacchus wandered the world for many years , going as far as india to teach people how to grow vines . further reading .
