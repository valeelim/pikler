Natural sciences     there are some sciences that are used to study nature . according to these sciences , the things that can be observed in nature follow certain rules . these rules are often unknown , and natural sciences are about finding them . they often use what is called the scientific method to do this . - physics looks at how nature is made , and how different fields of nature relate to each other . - chemistry is about the elements , their combinations , and their reactions . - biology looks at living organisms , their development , and how they interact with each other . - geology looks at how the earth developed and what it looks like . some sciences , like mathematics , can help in all of the above . they make it easier to talk about rules and models . other sciences that mainly look at how humans think and behave , and about their society are called social sciences . the natural sciences are used to make new things ( applied science ) . the natural sciences are guides to test new ideas . they are used to solve engineering problems and technology problems . math helps the natural sciences to solve problems and make new things . computers do this too . computers and math are tools for the natural sciences .
