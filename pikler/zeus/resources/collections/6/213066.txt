Polyurethane     polyurethane is a polymer . its name is often shortened to `` pu '' or `` pur '' . polyurethane is made of organic units , which are joined by urethane . polyurethane polymers are formed through step-growth polymerization . in this process , a monomer containing at least two isocyanate functional groups reacts with another monomer containing at least two hydroxyl ( alcohol ) groups in the presence of a catalyst . polyurethane is available with different levels of stiffness , hardness or densities . examples for such materials are : - low-density flexible foam used in upholstery , bedding , and automotive and truck seating - low-density rigid foam used for thermal insulation and rtm cores - soft solid elastomers used for gel pads and print rollers - low density elastomers used in footwear - hard solid plastics used as electronic instrument bezels and structural parts polyurethanes are widely used in high resiliency flexible foam seating , rigid foam insulation panels , microcellular foam seals and gaskets , durable elastomeric wheels and tires , automotive suspension bushings , electrical potting compounds , high performance adhesives and sealants , spandex fibers , seals , gaskets , carpet underlay , and hard plastic parts .
