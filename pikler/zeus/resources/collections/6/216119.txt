Epistle of James     the epistle of james is a book inclused in the christian bible , the twentieth in the new testament . according to its opening verse , this epistle was written by james ( often identified with the “ brother of the lord ” who leaded the jerusalem church about 20 years and was killed around 62 ad ) . the title “ servant of god and of the lord jesus christ ” ( which suggest a church official ) , the courage to address “ the twelve tribes in the dispersion ” ( i.e . jewish christian communities outside palestine , or all faithful living in a non-christian environment ) , and the tone of authority throughout the letter , all indicate someone well known and respected . the writer appears concerned in clarifying paul ’ s teaching on faith/action , against christians who deform it . this indicates that the letter was written after those of paul had begun to circulate diffusely , in the last decades of the 1st century . this late dating , together with the quite elegant greek style and the lack of any real emphasis on the jewish legalism which was part of james ’ approach to religion , have persuaded a growing majority of contemporary scholars that a christian versed in both hellenism and judaism wrote using james ’ name .
