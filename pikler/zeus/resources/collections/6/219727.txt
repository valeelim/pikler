Jacopo Peri     jacopo peri ( born rome , 20 august 1561 ; died florence , 12 august 1633 ) was an italian composer and singer . he composed the first opera ever written . peri was born in rome , but studied in florence . he had several church jobs , playing the organ and singing . he also worked at the court of the medici family , playing instruments and composing incidental music for plays and madrigals . in the 1590s , peri worked for jacopo corsi , the most important patron of music in florence . they felt that art at that time ( music , drama , painting etc . ) was not as good as the classical art that had been produced 2000 years ago in ancient greece and ancient rome . they wanted to write drama like the old greek tragedies . in music they started to write `` monody '' , which meant a solo song with a continuo bass accompaniment . they soon started to realize that just monody on its own could become boring , so they developed it into recitative ( where the story could be told ) and aria ( where the singers could express their feelings in song ) . peri and corsi asked the poet ottavio rinuccini to write some words for them and together they produced the opera `` dafne '' . it was probably nothing like what the ancient greeks would have done , but it was the first opera in modern times .
