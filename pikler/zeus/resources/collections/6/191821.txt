Adaptation     adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat . this process takes place over many generations . it is one of the basic phenomena of biology . when people speak about adaptation , they often mean a 'feature ' ( a trait ) which helps an animal or plant survive . an example is the adaptation of horses ' teeth to grinding grass . grass is their usual food ; it wears the teeth down , but horses ' teeth continue to grow during life . horses also have adapted to run fast , which helps them to escape their predators , such as lions . these features are the `` product '' of the process of adaptation . the illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life . however , eating a different food also means having a different digestive system , gut , claws , wings and above all , different inherited behaviour . for the major adaptations , what changes is not a single trait , but a whole group of features . adaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive , and to reproduce successfully . this process is known as natural selection ; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change .
