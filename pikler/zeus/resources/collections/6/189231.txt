Markup language     a markup language is a computer language . it is made up of a set of instructions , and of data . it is not the same as a programming language , as only programming languages can have if statements and other conditional statements . the first markup languages were used for printing ; there was the text , and there were instructions how the text should be printed . the source code is generally done in ascii . then there are tags . that way , latex ( and with that , wikipedia ) , uses the instruction \mu to get the symbol formula_1 , the greek letter `` mu '' . html uses & micro ; to get the same symbol .
