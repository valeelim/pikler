Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales    henry frederick , prince of wales henry frederick , prince of wales ( 19 february 1594 â€“ 6 november 1612 ) was the oldest son of king james i & vi and anne of denmark . his name comes from grandfathers henry stuart , lord darnley and frederick ii of denmark . prince henry was widely seen as a bright heir to his father 's throne . however , he died before his father because of typhoid fever . because of this , the english and scottish thrones ' power went to his younger brother charles . several places in virginia colony were named in honor of prince henry before and after his death . he was born at stirling castle and became duke of rothesay , earl of carrick , baron of renfrew , lord of the isles and prince and great steward of scotland when he was born . his father made alexander erskine , earl of mar , take care of him . he did not let his mother take care of him . this was because james worried that the mother 's slight liking for catholicism might have some effect on the son . although this made lots of fights between anna and james , henry was kept under the care of mar 's family until 1603. this was when james became king of england and his family moved south .
