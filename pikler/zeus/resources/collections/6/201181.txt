Patent troll     a patent troll is an unkind phrase used to describe a company or person that owns a patent and tries to get other people to pay a lot of money for the right to use the patent . the patent troll usually asks for an amount of money that is less than defending a lawsuit . a patent troll is different from other patent owners for two reasons . first , the patent troll usually does not make or sell any products itself . second , a patent troll is also not usually the inventor . the patent troll instead buys the patent from other companies , and , usually , very cheap because the other company was going out of business . patent trolls make a lot of people unhappy because the money paid is a lot like a tax . the term troll itself is meant to invoke the image from fairy tales of a mean monster living under a bridge that makes people pay to cross the bridge .
