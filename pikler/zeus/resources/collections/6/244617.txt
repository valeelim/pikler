Cook–Levin theorem     the cook–levin theorem is a theorem from theoretical computer science , which says that the boolean satisfiability problem is np-complete . a deterministic turing machine can change a problem in np in polynomial time to the problem of determining whether a boolean formula is satisfiable . an important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving boolean satisfiability , then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving `` all '' problems in np . the same follows for any np-complete problem . the question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the p versus np problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science . the theorem is named after stephen cook and leonid levin , who first described it in the 1970s .
