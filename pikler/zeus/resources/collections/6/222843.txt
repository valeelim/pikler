Seed plants     seed plants are a group of plants . gymnosperms and angiosperms form the group . their seeds have three parts : ( 1 ) an embryo , ( 2 ) a supply of nutrients for the embryo , and ( 3 ) a seed coat . they are also called spermatophytes or phanerogams . the seed plants dominate almost all the environments on land . the living spermatophytes form five groups : - cycads , a subtropical and tropical group of plants with a large crown of compound leaves and a stout trunk - `` ginkgo '' , a single living species of tree - conifers , cone-bearing trees and shrubs - gnetophyta , woody plants in the genera `` gnetum '' , `` welwitschia '' , and `` ephedra '' - angiosperms , the flowering plants , a large group including many familiar plants in a wide variety of habitats the fossil seed ferns ( pteridospermatophyta ) were one of the earliest successful groups of land plants , and forests dominated by seed ferns were prevalent in the permian . `` glossopteris '' was the most prominent tree genus in the ancient southern supercontinent of gondwana during the permian period . by the triassic period , seed ferns had declined , ( perhaps were extinct ) and modern gymnosperm groups were abundant and dominant to the upper cretaceous , when angiosperms radiated .
