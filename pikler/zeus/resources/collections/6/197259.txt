Pitcher plant     a pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant ( also called as insectivorous plant ) . carnivorous plants are plants that eat insects and other small animals . carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen . all living things must have nitrogen . carnivorous plants get nitrogen from the insects they eat . pitcher of the pitcher plant is actually a modified leaf . the apex of the leaf is the lid . pitcher plants catch ( get ) insects in a cup of liquid . the walls of the cup make nectar ( sweet liquid ) . the nectar attracts insects . when an insect lands on the wall , it falls down into the liquid . the insect can not get out of the cup because the walls are smooth and slippery and the walls have hairs pointing down . after the insect is dead , its body rots . rotting releases ( lets loose ) the nitrogen from the insect 's body . the nitrogen then goes into the liquid and the plant takes in the nitrogen from the liquid .
