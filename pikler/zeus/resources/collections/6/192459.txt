Ja zuster, nee zuster    ja zuster , nee zuster ja zuster , nee zuster ( in english : yes nurse , no nurse ) was a very popular comedy series on dutch television in the late 1960s . it was set in a home for old people . the dutch title literally means , `` yes , sister ; no , sister '' ; because in the netherlands , as in britain and many other countries , nurses of a certain rank are called `` sister '' . the series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes . the script was written by annie m.g . schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes . the songs were written by harry bannink . dutch people today , especially those who remember the original series , are very disappointed that , apart from one programme , the whole series has been lost . this is because it was recorded on ampex tape which was very expensive so , after the episodes had been shown on television , other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it . some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved . 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved . they were made into a gramophone record ( lp ) and later into a cd .
