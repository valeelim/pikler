Transcription (music)    transcription ( music ) a musical transcription is an arrangement of a piece of music for a different instrument or instruments . this use of the word “ transcription ” is almost the same as `` arrangement '' , ( the word `` transcription '' literally means : `` writing across '' ) . musicians often disagree about what should be called a “ transcription ” and what is an “ arrangement ” . usually transcriptions are almost like the original , whereas a musician who makes an arrangement may put some ideas of his own into the music . another meaning of “ transcription ” is : writing down music which existed before but had not yet been written down . this could be because it is jazz ( which is usually improvised ) , or because it is folk music , which traditionally is taught from one generation to another by listening and imitating . in the early 20th century some composers became interested in writing down the traditional folksongs of their countries . béla bartók and zoltan kodaly in hungary and cecil sharpe and ralph vaughan williams in england transcribed folk songs they heard being sung in the villages of their countries..
