Invariable plane     the invariable plane of a planetary system is the plane passing through its barycenter ( center of mass ) . this is perpendicular to its angular momentum vector . in the solar system , about 98 % of this effect is contributed by the orbital angular momenta of the four gas giants ( jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune ) . the invariable plane is within 0.5Â° of the orbital plane of jupiter . it is the weighted average of all planetary orbital and rotational planes . the invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta , and is almost `` invariable '' ( unchanging ) over the entire system . in contrast , the `` laplace plane '' may be different for different orbiting objects within a system . the sun forms a counterbalance to all of the planets , so it is near the barycenter when jupiter is on one side and the other three jovian planets ( gas giants ) are diametrically opposite on the other side , but the sun moves to 2.17 solar radii away from the barycenter when all jovian planets are in line on other side . the orbital angular momenta of the sun and all non-jovian planets , moons , and minor solar system bodies , as well as the axial rotation momenta of all bodies , including the sun , total only about 2 % .
