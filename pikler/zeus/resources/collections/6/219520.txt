Clone     a clone is any cell or individual which is identical to another . in biology , cloning is the process of producing one or more genetically-identical individuals . with whole individuals , it usually means the deliberate production of an identical copy . this was first achieved in mammals with the famous dolly the sheep . human identical twins are `` natural clones '' . so are the offspring of asexual reproduction , and any parthenogenetic reproduction which does not involve meiosis . cloning is natural to some animals , but rare in mammals . an exception is the nine-banded armadillo , which normally gives birth to identical quadruplets . in genetics and cell biology , cloning refers especially to the dna sequence , and by implication all the other macromolecules . clones in cell lines occur , but there are some obvious provisos . changes to the dna in any shape or form means the daughter cells are not identical with the mother cells . typically during development genes are switched on and off , and the daughter cells gradually become differentiated into mature tissue cells . these are not identical with the original stem cells , so they are clones only in the sense of being `` derived '' from the same mother cell .
