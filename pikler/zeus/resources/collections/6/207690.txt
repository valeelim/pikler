Navier–Stokes equations     the navier–stokes equations are mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids . the equations are named after claude-louis navier and george gabriel stokes . the equations result from applying newton 's second law to fluid dynamics with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term ( in relation to the gradient of velocity ) , plus a pressure term . they are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest . they may be used to model the weather , ocean currents , water flow in a pipe , the air 's flow around a wing , and motion of stars inside a galaxy . the navier–stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars , the study of blood flow , the design of power stations , the analysis of pollution , and many other things . together with maxwell 's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics . the navier–stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense . somewhat surprisingly , given their wide range of practical uses , mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist ( existence ) , or that if they do exist , then they do not contain any singularity ( or infinity or ) ( smoothness ) . these are called the navier–stokes existence and smoothness problems . the clay mathematics institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics , and offered a us $ 1,000,000 prize ( approx . €0.7m or £0.6m as of september 2009 ) for a solution or a counter-example .
