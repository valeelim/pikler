Myriapoda     the myriapoda is a subphylum of arthropods . it contains the millipedes , centipedes , and others . the group has 13,000 species , all of which are terrestrial . their name suggests they have many legs . in fact one has over 750 legs ( `` illacme plenipes '' ) , but some have fewer than ten legs . the fossil record of myriapods goes back into the late silurian , though molecular evidence suggests they diversified in the cambrian period . cambrian fossils do exist which look like myriapods . myriapods have a single pair of antennae and , in most cases , simple eyes . the mouthparts lie on the underside of the head , . there is an `` epistome '' and labrum forming the upper lip , and a pair of maxillae forming the lower lip . a pair of mandibles lie inside the mouth . myriapods breathe through spiracles that connect to a tracheal system similar to that of insects . there has been much debate as to which arthropod group is most closely related to the myriapoda . under the mandibulata hypothesis , myriapoda is the sister taxon to pancrustacea , a group comprising the crustacea and hexapoda . under the atelocerata hypothesis , hexapoda is the closest , whereas under the paradoxopoda hypothesis , chelicerata is the closest . this last hypothesis , although supported by few morphological characters , is supported by a number of molecular studies .
