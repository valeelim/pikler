Photomask     in electronics manufacturing , a photomask is a special stencil which is used in photolithography to create a printed circuit board or integrated circuit . when light is shone through the photomask , certain parts where the light hits the unused circuit board are strengthened , much like what toothpaste does to the hard surfaces your teeth . when a circuit board is put through an acid bath , the parts where the light shone through the photomask stay in place , while the parts that were covered by the shadow of the photomask are eaten away by the acid .
