Amargasaurus     amargasaurus was a sauropod from the early cretaceous period . it grew to 10 meters ( 33 feet ) length , which was relatively small for a sauropod . it was a quadrupedal herbivore with a long , low skull on the end of a long neck , much like its relative `` dicraeosaurus '' . `` amargasaurus '' was found in la amarga , a canyon in neuqu√©n province , argentina . `` amargasaurus '' had two tall rows of spines on top of its backbone along the neck and back . the function of the spines is not known . they may have operated as a defence from theropod attack from above . another idea is that they supported a sail-like structure . the neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length , forming a double row . they were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips . the tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck , where they reached 60 cm on the 8th cervical . on the neck , they were bowed backwards , projecting above the adjacent vertebra . greatly elongated spines continue along the last two dorsal vertebrae , the hip and foremost tail . however , in these regions the spines were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle-shaped upper end .
