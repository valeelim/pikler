Joey Scarbury     joey scarbury ( born june 7 , 1955 ) is an adult contemporary singer best known for his hit song , `` theme from `` the greatest american hero '' ( believe it or not ) '' , in 1981. growing up in thousand oaks , california , scarbury was continually encouraged in his ambition to sing by his mother . at the age of 14 , after being spotted by songwriter jimmy webb 's father , he was signed to a recording contract , and seemed to be destined for stardom . scarbury 's first single , `` she never smiles anymore , '' flopped , and he was soon without a record label . scarbury , undaunted by what happened , stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like loretta lynn , and occasionally recording his own material . although he had a minor chart single with `` mixed up guy '' in 1971 , real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade . this was to change when he started working for record producer and composer mike post . post was hired along with stephen geyer to write the theme tune for a new tv series dubbed `` the greatest american hero '' , about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit , and scarbury was chosen to record it . an extended version of the song ( 3:15 compared to the television theme 's minute-long length ) , released by elektra records , shot up to # 2 on the billboard hot 100 .
