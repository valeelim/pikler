Ethernet switch     an ethernet switch is a device used to build a network connection between the attached computers ( allows computers to talk to each other ) . it differs from an ethernet hub : while a hub will send incoming data packets to all ports , a switch understands the packets ' addressing scheme and will send any data packet only to its destination port , thus limiting the number of collisions ( data sent at the same time ) .
