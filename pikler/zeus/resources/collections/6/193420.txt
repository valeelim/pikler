Clay animation     clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation . each animated piece , either character or background , can be formed and reformed into different shapes . people making a clay animation usually use something soft , like plasticine clay . most animation is made the same way , whether it is cel animation or stop motion . each frame , or still picture , is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly . when played back at a frame rate of more than 10â€“12 frames per second , the human mind sees the series of slightly changing , rapidly playing images as movement . to us it seems as if the object is moving by itself . this way of tricking the mind into seeing `` movement '' is the way that all moving images work , from zoetrope to movies to videogames . the way cgi animations are made is different from the frame by frame method . in clay animation , each object is made in clay , usually around a wire skeleton called an armature . the object is put on the set ( background ) and a still picture ( one frame of film ) is taken . the object or character is then moved slightly by hand . another picture is taken , and the object is moved slightly again . this is repeated over and over . to get the best results , special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before . for example , the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place . the only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object .
