Concepción     concepción is the second city in importance of the republic of chile with 889,725 inhabitants ( 2002 census ) . concepción was founded by pedro de valdivia in 1550 north of the bío-bío river , at the site which is today known as penco . at that time it was given the name `` concepción del nuevo extremo '' . the new settlement of concepción was just a few kilometers north of la frontera ( the frontier ) , the boundary between spanish territory and the land of the mapuche , an american indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s . the settlement was formally recognized by the spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree . it was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today . earthquakes and tsunamis , which razed the town in 1570 , 1657 , 1687 , 1730 and 1751 , led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the valle de la mocha , alongside the bío-bío river . on february 27 , 2010 , an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the city of concepción , killing more than 700 people and injuring thousands nationwide . following the earthquake , geologists relying on global positioning satellite ( gps ) data concluded that the city had been displaced roughly 3 meters ( 10 feet ) to the west as a result of the event . fortunately , the city avoided the tsunami that followed the earthquake .
