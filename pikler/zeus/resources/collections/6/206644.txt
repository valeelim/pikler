Ichthyophthirius multifiliis     ichthyophthirius multifiliis , also called `` white spot disease '' , `` ick '' or `` ich '' is a disease that causes little white spots on fresh water fish . it is one of the most common parasites of fish . it often affects pet fish in tanks and ponds , as well as farm-raised food fish species . wild fish populations can also get the parasite . the `` i. multifiliis '' life cycle from birth to death depends on the temperature of the water . in warm water , 25 째c ( 77 째f ) , the parasite 's whole life cycle can take place in seven days . in cold water , 6 째c ( 43 째f ) , it can take up to eight weeks . the disease starts when the parasite digs into the skin of the fish . this causes swelling and white spots to form . after a few days , the parasite turns into a trophozoite , a jelly-like substance . this falls off the fish and lives on the bottom of the tank . inside the jelly are hundreds of baby parasites called tomites . these eventually can swim by themselves and go looking for another fish to live in .
