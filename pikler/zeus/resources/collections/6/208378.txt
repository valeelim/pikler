Heaviside Function     the heaviside function , `` h '' is a non-continuous function whose value is zero for negative argument and one for positive argument . the function is used in the mathematics of control theory to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time and stays switched on indefinitely . it was named after the englishman oliver heaviside . the heaviside function is the integral of the dirac delta function : `` h '' ′ = `` δ '' . this is sometimes written as we can also define an alternative form of the heaviside step function as a function of a discrete variable `` n '' : where `` n '' is an integer . or the discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step this function is the cumulative summation of the kronecker delta : where is the discrete unit impulse function . often an integral representation of the heaviside step function is useful : the value of the function at 0 can be defined as `` h '' ( 0 ) = 0 , `` h '' ( 0 ) = ½ or `` h '' ( 0 ) = 1. other pages . - laplace transform
