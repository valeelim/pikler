Race (sociology)    race ( sociology ) the term race or racial group refers to dividing the human species according to physical characteristics that are inherited . the most widely used human racial types are those based on visual traits ( such as skin colour , cranial , facial features , or type of hair ) . when classifications of human races were first done , there were relatively few inter-racial marriages . since then the number of mixed-race people has increased greatly . for them , the old structure does not work well . official forms , such as the census , usually ask people to describe their ethnic origin . this is a way of saying `` what racial group do you think you are ? '' some scientists argue that although race is a safe taxonomic concept in other species , it can not be applied to humans . more recent genetic studies show that skin colour may change a lot over as few as 100 generations , or about 2,500 years . johann friedrich blumenbach 's classification , first proposed in 1779 , was widely used in the 19th century , with many variations .
