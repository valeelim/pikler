Airbus A330     the airbus a330 is a two engine , wide-body passenger aeroplane made by airbus . it was designed at the same time as the airbus a340 , so it has the same body and wings . it first flew in 1992 and the first one was delivered to air inter in 1994. it was a 300 series . just after this , airbus made the shorter 200 series . now , airbus has made a freighter version and a tanker version ( which carries additional fuel so it can give some to other planes ) . there are also 394 a330s that need to be made and given to airlines . most of these are the smaller 200 series version . airlines wanted a new aeroplane to replace their mcdonnell douglas dc-10 aeroplanes which were getting old . so , airbus started a new project in november 1987 : the a330 and a340 programs . in the end , it was found that the a330 is almost 38 % more fuel efficient than the dc-10 . airbus designed the a330 to be in the market for etops aeroplanes . this market already had planes like the boeing 767. in november 2009 , the a330 was the first aeroplane to get the etops-240 approval , which means that the plane is allowed to fly up to 240 minutes away from any airport . this means it can fly over large oceans or places like the antarctic where there are no airports nearby .
