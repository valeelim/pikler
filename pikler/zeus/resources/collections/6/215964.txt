Typography     typography is the practical art of arranging how the printed word appears on the page . typography was born when print was born . early types were based on the letterforms of scribes , and the letters cut into trajan 's column ( `` monumental inscriptions '' ) . later , gradually , type designs were based on the special needs of books , pamphlets , newspapers and advertisements . typography includes not only letters , but all the set of symbols in a font , and it includes the overall design of a page or document . it applies to any medium which may be read ; therefore it includes text on computer screens . a typographer may design type , select fonts , and design the layout of pages and books . the term does not cover the act of printing itself , though many of the early printers were themselves typographers . typography in the 20th century was greatly influenced by three things : 1. modernism and the modern art movement . 1. information about the effectiveness of typography and design . some of this comes from formal 'scientific ' experiments , but most comes from commercial sources . naturally , sales results before and after a book or magazine redesign are compared . a redesign of the typography on the jacket of a book ( `` roget 's thesaurus '' ) `` nearly doubled the sales '' . typographers themselves carry out mini-experiments to test alternatives . this is an extension of scientific method to what is , at heart , an artistic process .
