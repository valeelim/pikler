Malus     malus is a genus of about 30–35 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the family rosaceae . other studies say it includes 55 species , including the domesticated orchard apple , or table apple as it used to be called . the other species and subspecies are generally known as `` wild apples '' , `` crab apples '' , `` crabapples '' or `` crabs '' . the genus is native to the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere , in europe , asia and north america . apple trees are small , usually 4–12 m tall when full grown . the leaves are 3–10 cm long , positioned opposite from each other . they have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge . the flowers come from corymbs , and have five petals , which may be white , pink or red , with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen , and an ovary which is below them . flowering takes place in the spring and pollination is by insects ( typically bees , which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen ) . the fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and ( in some species ) very like wood , and are rarely eaten raw for this reason . however , crabapples are an excellent source of pectin , and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly . some kinds of crab apples make good applesauce .
