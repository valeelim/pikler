Mohammed Omar     mullah mohammed omar ( 1959 - 23 april 2013 ) was the leader of the taliban in afghanistan . he was usually called 'mullah omar ' . between 1996 and 2001 , he was afghanistan 's de facto head of state . three states officially recognised him under the title of 'head of the supreme council ' . he was born around the year 1959 in nodeh , near kandahar . he held the title commander of the faithful from the islamic emirate of afghanistan . the united states put him on their most wanted list . they believe he sheltered osama bin laden , and some of his al-quaeda group , directly before and after they committed the september 11 attacks . he was believed to be directing the taliban in their war against hamid karzai 's government and foreign nato troops in afghanistan from pakistan . many people considered him to be a major terrorist . despite his political rank , and his high status on the fbi 's wanted list , not much is publicly known about omar . there are very few photos of him . none of these photos are official . a picture that was used by the media in 2002 , shows another taliban official , but not omar . it is also debated how authoritative the images that exist really are .
