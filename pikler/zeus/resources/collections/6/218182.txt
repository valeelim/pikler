Hadean     the hadean is the geological eon before the archaean . it began at the earth 's formation about 4.6 billion years ago , and ended 4 billion years ago . the name `` hadean '' comes from hades , greek for `` underworld '' , due to the conditions on the earth at the time . the geologist preston cloud first used the term in 1972. meteorite bombardment , volcanism and high temperatures were very widespread on the early earth . there are no sedimentary rocks from the hadean at all . the earliest geological objects on earth are some zircons , dated to about 4,400 million years ago ( mya ) . oceans would probably have formed as soon as the temperature allowed . it is thought that constant bombardment kept the earth in a molten state until about the end of the eon . early in earth history , the moon was torn out by a massive collision with a proto-planet . the evidence for this giant impact hypothesis is : 1. the remarkable similarity between the earth 's crust and the moon 's composition , 1. the low iron concentration in the moon 's centre , and
