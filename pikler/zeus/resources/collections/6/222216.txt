Arduino     arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible , easy-to-use hardware and software . it 's intended for artists , designers , hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments . arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights , motors , and other actuators . the microcontroller on the board is programmed using the arduino programming language ( based on wiring ) and the arduino development environment ( based on processing ) . arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software running on a computer ( e.g . flash , processing , maxmsp ) . the boards can be built by hand or purchased preassembled ; the software can be downloaded for free . the hardware reference designs ( cad files ) are available under an open-source license , you are free to adapt them to your needs . arduino received an honorary mention in the digital communities section of the 2006 ars electronica prix . the arduino founders are : massimo banzi , david cuartielles , tom igoe , gianluca martino , and david mellis . credits
