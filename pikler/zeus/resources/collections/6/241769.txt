Italian irredentism in Istria     italian irredentism in istria was the political movement dedicated to the unification of istria to italy . when napoleon defeated venice in 1797 he found that istria was populated by italians on the coast and in the main cities , but the interior was populated mainly by croats and slovenians . this dual ethnicity in the same peninsula created a situation of antagonism ( hostility ) between slavs and italians for the supremacy of istria , which started the first nationalisms after napoleon 's fall . since 1815 istria was a part of the austrian monarchy , and croats/slovenians and italians engaged in a nationalistic fight with each other . as a consequence istria has been the theater of an ethnic struggle between them , with bloody nationalistic wars , during the xix and xx centuries . the italian irredentism was actively followed by many italians in istria ( called istrian italians ) , like the italian hero nazario sauro of capodistria ( actual koper ) . indeed , between 1918 and 1947 istria was part of the kingdom of italy , but after wwii was part of yugoslavia . now the istrian italians are reduced to a small minority , who has survived the istrian exodus and the foibe massacres during and after wwii .
