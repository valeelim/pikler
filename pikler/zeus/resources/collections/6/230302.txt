Enthalpy     enthalpy is a concept used in science and engineering when heat and work need to be calculated . when a substance changes at constant pressure , enthalpy tells how much heat and work were added to ( or removed from ) the substance . enthalpy is similar to energy , but not the same . when a substance grows or shrinks , energy is used up or released . enthalpy accounts for this energy . because of this , scientists often calculate the change in enthalpy , rather than the change in energy . the name comes from the greek word `` enthalpos '' ( ενθαλπος ) , meaning `` to put heat into '' . the idea and the word was made up by the dutch scientist heike kamerlingh onnes in 1909. when a chemical reaction happens , a substance can become warmer or colder . as a result , heat will flow to things around it , or from things around it , until its temperature is the same again . if the pressure stays the same , this amount of heat tells how much the enthalpy changed . for example , if gasoline is burned in the open air , heat is released by the gasoline . if we suppose 100 kilojoules of heat were released , then the enthalpy of the gasoline was reduced by 100 kilojoules . therefore the change in enthalpy for this reaction was ∆ '' h '' = –100 kj .
