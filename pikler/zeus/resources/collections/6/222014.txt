Medical Renaissance     renaissance medicine is the term used for the development of medicine at the time of the renaissance in europe . scientists began to study the body and treat its diseases . one scientist said that the body is mostly chemicals , so it should be healed by chemicals . other scientists studied anatomy . by learning the positions of bones , muscles , and organs , they were able to give better treatment . the englishman william harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart , travels through the body in blood vessels , and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system . this made medical research in the 1600s much better and easy to understand . in the renaissance , a very important theory in medicine was the four humours or four temperaments . this theory began with the ancient greeks , and influenced medical development until the 19th century . according to the theory , the body was filled with four different substances , called `` humours '' . when a person is healthy , these substances are in balance . when there is an imbalance between the humours , the person will be sick . the sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance . the four substances are , phlegm and blood . galen still supported that theory , but refined it in many ways .
