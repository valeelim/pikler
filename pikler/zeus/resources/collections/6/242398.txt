Radiometric dating     radiometric dating ( often called radioactive dating ) is a way to find out how old something is . the method compares the amount of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope and its decay products , in samples . the method uses known decay rates . it is the main way to learn the age of rocks and other geological features , including the age of the earth itself . it may be used to date a wide range of natural and man-made materials . fossils may be dated by taking samples of rocks from above and below the fossil 's original position . radiometric dating is also used to date archaeological materials , including ancient artifacts . radiometric dating methods are used to establish the geological time scale . among the best-known techniques are radiocarbon dating , potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating . all ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements , each with its own atomic number , indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus . elements exist in different isotopes , with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus . a particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide . some nuclides are naturally unstable . that is , at some point in time , an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously change into a different nuclide by radioactive decay . the decay may happen by emission of particles ( usually electrons ( beta decay ) , positrons or alpha particles ) or by spontaneous nuclear fission , and electron capture .
