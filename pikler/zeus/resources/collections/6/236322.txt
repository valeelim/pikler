Emperor Kaika     no certain dates can be assigned to the emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that kaika ruled from the palace of `` isakawa-no-miya '' at kasuga in what will come to be known as yamato province . kaika is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes kaika as the eighth of . kaika was the second son of emperor kōgen . some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors . these critics consider kōgen 's son ( suijin ) to be the earliest to have actually existed . the absence of information about kaika does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . this emperor 's official name after his death ( his posthumous name ) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to kaika .
