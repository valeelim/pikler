Gneiss     gneiss is a type of metamorphic rock . the minerals in gneiss may come from rocks which were originally either igneous or sedimentary . they were heated and squeezed , and the minerals recrystallized . in gneisses , minerals tend to be foliated : layered and segregated into bands . thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist , very thin , but consisting essentially of one mineral . the lewisian complex or lewisian gneiss is a suite of precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of scotland , forming part of the hebridean terrane . these rocks are of archaean and palaeoproterozoic age , ranging from 3.0â€“1.7 ga .
