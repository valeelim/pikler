Gravitational lensing     gravitational lensing is caused by a massive body between a distant object and ourselves . it can create the appearance of two or more objects where there is really only one . the light from the object gets bent round the massive body in between . the massive body , such as a galaxy or black hole , creates a very strong gravitational field in space . the exact nature of the effect depends on : - relative distance and position between observer , lens and lightsource - size of the lens - mass inside the lens albert einstein predicted the possibility of gravitational lensing . the discovery that our sun bends the light of distant objects when their light passes close to it was evidence that the general theory of relativity was correct . there are three types of lensing : - strong lensing - weak lensing - microlensing strong lensing betrays itself by producing multiple images from the same object . a well-known example is `` einstein 's cross '' ( q2237+0305 ) at a distance of 8 billion lightyears . here , the gravitational lens produces four images from the same object ( a quasar ) , although it is only one object . the light of the quasar does not travel in a straight line to earth . instead , it is bent along the gravitational field of a galaxy in front of it . this galaxy is at a distance of 400 million lightyears .
