Mammal-like reptile     mammal-like reptile is an old term for the therapsids : those synapsids which gave rise to the true mammals . the term is both outmoded and a mistake , because mammals did not descend from reptiles . both groups descended from early amniotes ( egg-laying tetrapods ) , probably in the lower or middle carboniferous . the precursors of reptiles are called sauropsids , and the precursors of mammals are called synapsids . the immediate ancestors of the mammals came from a group of therapsids called the cynodonts . there are a number of characteristics which can not be seen on fossils , but which are of great importance . mammals are distinguished from reptiles by fundamental differences in the development of the blood system . these differences are such that it would be almost impossible for mammals to be derived from reptiles . this supports the division of amniotes into sauropsida and synapsida .
