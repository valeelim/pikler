Viscosity index     viscosity index or vi is measure of the temperature at which a lubricating oil works properly . the vi scale goes from 0 to 100 , with 0 being the worst , and 100 being the best . new products are now better than when the scale was first made , so some new products have scores as high as 400. lubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces . if it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving . if the oil is too thin , then the parts will rub together and create friction . what is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart . oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up . in an automobile engine , the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures . it needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold , and keep working when the engine gets very hot , perhaps as much as 200 Â°c . the best oils , with a high viscosity index score , will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range .
