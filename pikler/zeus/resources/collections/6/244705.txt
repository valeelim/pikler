Gnathostomulida     gnathostomulids , or jaw worms , are a small phylum of marine invertebrates which were discovered in 1956. they are tiny worm-like marine animals . they inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments . most gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre ( 0.02 to 0.04 in ) in length . they are slender to thread-like worms , with a transparent body . the neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body , giving them a distinct head . like flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis , but are unique in having but one cilium per cell . the cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains , although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract . they have no circulatory or respiratory system . the nervous system is very simple , and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall . the only sense organs are modified cilia , which are especially common in the head region . the mouth is just behind the head , on the underside of the body . it has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth , and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat . the mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places ; there is no anus .
