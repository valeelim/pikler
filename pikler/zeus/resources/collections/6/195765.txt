Human Development Index     the human development index ( hdi ) is a number from 0 to 1 ( higher is better ) used to compare different countries . it is published by united nations development programme . it is used to rank countries into different groups for example developed and developing countries . the human development index uses different measurements of a population : - life expectancy at birth . this is used to see how healthy the people in one country are . it assumes that healthier people live longer on average . - literacy is used to look at how educated people are , for example how many adults can read and write . one third of this is the `` gross enrollment ratio '' , which measures how many of children of schooling age attend school . - standard of living . this is measured by calculating the gross domestic product with the total population so that it becomes comparable . the human development index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called `` western models of development '' , failure to include any ecological considerations , lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization , focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking , lack of attention to development from a global perspective , measurement error of the underlying statistics , and on the undp 's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low ' , 'medium ' , 'high ' or 'very high ' human development countries .
