Vibration control     in earthquake engineering , vibration control is a set of technical means for decreasing seismic loads and improving seismic performance of building structures . all vibration control devices may be classified as `` passive '' , `` active '' or `` hybrid '' . the first kind is the simplest one and , therefore , widespread . passive control devices represent different types of `` base isolators '' and `` seismic dampers '' . `` base isolators '' restrict penetration of potentially damaging seismic waves into a building structure while `` dampers '' decrease destructive effect of those waves .
