Leadbeater's possum    leadbeater 's possum leadbeater 's possum ( `` gymnobelideus leadbeateri '' ) is an endangered species of australian possum . once thought to be extinct , it is now only found in small areas of surviving old and mixed age mountain ash forest in the central highlands of victoria , australia , north-east of melbourne . about half this area was burnt out in the disastrous black saturday bushfire in 2009. large areas of the forest around marysville , narbethong and healesville were destroyed . they need food all year , and trees with holes where they can hide during the day . this limits them to mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with a thick mid-story of `` acacia '' . it is the only species in the gymnobelideus genus . it was named after john leadbeater , a taxidermist at the museum of victoria . it is the only mammal that is only found in victoria , so in 1968 , the state of victoria made leadbeater 's possum its faunal emblem . the possum was first discovered by europeans in 1867. only five possums were found , the last one in 1909. it was thought the species was extinct , because its habitat around bass river in south-west gippsland was cleared for farming in the early 1900s .
