Complex sentence     a complex sentence is a sentence with two or more of dependent sentences and independent sentences mixed together by subordinating conjunctions , such as `` although , '' `` after , '' `` until , '' `` while , '' or `` when ' '' . for example : `` before the curtain rose , nick came out and took a bow . '' in this sentence , `` before '' is a subordinating conjunction . `` before the curtain rose '' is a dependent sentence . with its subordinating conjunction , it joins the independent sentence by being smoothly contacted by its meaning . but without this independent sentence , '' nick came and took a bow '' , the dependent sentence can not stay by itself . `` before the curtain rose '' can not stay by it self without an independent sentence joined together .
