Emperor Richū     some scholars identify him with king san in the book of song . king san sent messengers to the song dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425 ; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother . no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . according to `` nihonshoki '' and `` kojiki '' , he was the first son of emperor nintoku . richū had two sons ; but he was followed on the throne by his brother , who would become known as emperor hanzei . the enthronement of hanzei by-passed richū 's two sons . few other details have survived . two of richū 's grandsons would attain the throne as emperor kenzō and as emperor ninken . very little is known about the events of richū 's life and reign . only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei .
