Bumblebee     bumblebees ( or `` bumble bees '' , or `` humble bees '' ) are a group of social and semi-social bees , of the genus bombus . the genus contains about 250 different species , mostly in the northern hemisphere , though they are common in new zealand and tasmania . they occur practically everywhere on the eurasian landmass . most bumblebees live in small groups , which generally last only for a year . they collect pollen as protein for their young , and themselves eat nectar . they are extremely hairy , with a covering of soft hairs called a `` pile '' . most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do , there is a `` queen '' , and there are `` workers '' and `` drones '' . the usual size of a colony is under 50 members , though some tropical species live in larger colonies . bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours , usually some combination of black , red , yellow and white . this is the usual m√ºllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps . fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state . they start a nest in the spring . the queen stores sperm from her mating , and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina . the females are diploid , the males are haploid . this is the common method of sex determination throughout the hymenoptera .
