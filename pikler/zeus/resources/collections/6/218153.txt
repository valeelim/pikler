Token passing     token passing is a communication protocol used in telecommunications . the system uses a signal called a `` token '' to limit when a device can transmit on the network . only the device with the token can transmit . when that device is done , the token is sent to the next device . with large transmissions , the token may move to the next station before the transmission is finished . the device has to wait until it gets the token back before it can continue to send data . the most well known examples of token passing are token ring and arcnet . the rules of the system say how long a device may keep the token , how long it can transmit for and how to create a new token if there is not one in use .
