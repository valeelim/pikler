Network model (database)    network model ( database ) database systems use a network model to store their data in a graph . much like the hierarchical database model , the nodes of the graph contain information . the information is stored in a graph , so one parent can have many children , and one child can relate to several parents . the model is also known as codasyl model , because it was originally proposed by the codasyl consortium ( who also developed cobol ) . in a network model , the defining feature is that each record has a link to another record .
