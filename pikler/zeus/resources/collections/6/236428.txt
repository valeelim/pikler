Title role     the title role in a play or an opera is the role ( the part ) which is also the title of the play or opera . we say that the actor , singer or dancer who performs that part has the `` title role '' . for example : in the opera `` carmen '' by georges bizet the part played by the girl called carmen is the `` title role '' . we may say that a singer took the title role in the opera `` carmen '' . that means that she sang the part of carmen in the opera . the title role is not necessarily the most important role in the play or opera , although it often is . a few other well-known examples in which the performance is named after one of the characters include the operas `` aida '' ( by giuseppe verdi ) , `` madame butterfly '' ( by giacomo puccini ) and `` peter grimes '' ( by benjamin britten ) , the ballets `` coppélia '' ( by léo delibes ) or `` petrushka '' ( by stravinsky ) , or the plays `` othello '' or `` hamlet '' ( by william shakespeare ) . the title character in fiction is the fictional character whose name is in the title ( or suggested in the title ) , such as `` harry potter '' in harry potter books by j.k. rowling , or simba in disney 's `` the lion king '' ( simba is the lion king ) .
