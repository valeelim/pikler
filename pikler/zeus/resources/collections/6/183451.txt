Sopwith Camel     the sopwith camel was a british world war i fighter biplane , it was famous for not flying very well . the sopwith camel entered service in june 1917. unlike many biplanes , the camel was unpleasant to fly . the camel could manoeuvre well because of the placement of the engine , pilot , guns , and fuel tank , but controlling the engine torque made flying it difficult and dangerous . the camel soon had a bad reputation with pilots . the engine was sensitive to fuel mixture control , and wrong settings caused the engine to cut out during takeoff . many crashed due to mishandling on takeoff when a full fuel tank affected the center of gravity . as well as this , the camel was also known for its bad spinning characteristics , where any stall resulted in an uncontrollable spin . the camel had better guns and better performance compared to other biplanes . its controls were light and sensitive . the camel was one of the best-remembered allied aircraft of the first world war . the camel was credited with shooting down 1,294 enemy aircraft , more than any other allied fighter .
