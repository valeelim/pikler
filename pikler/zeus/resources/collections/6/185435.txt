Radiant heating     radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it . radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the romans and the koreans , and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building . underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings , but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used . radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas . the romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems . these systems were based on hypocausts , and used warm air for heat . the floor was set on top of many brick piles , leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor . the hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls , so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms . these systems were very expensive to build and maintain , so only the rich could afford them . in korea , radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years . ondol , which means `` warm stone , '' involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house . most homes and buildings in korea still use ondol , although they now use hot water and electric systems . the american architect frank lloyd wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs . wright also invented hot water underfloor systems .
