Collaboration     collaboration is when people work with each other to complete a task . it involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas , knowledge and skills to reach the same objective . the objective is usually creative in nature . most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination , although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group . each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration . for instance , to make a movie a writer , director , producer and actors are needed . there may also be a need for a costumer , a cameraman ( if the director can not do it all ) , an audio engineer , and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough . related pages . - critical thinking
