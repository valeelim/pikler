Saint Germaine     sainte germaine lived from 1579 to 1601. she was born in a village in france called pibrac , which is about ten miles from toulouse , france . she was born with a disfigured hand and a disease called scrofula . when she was a baby , her mother died . germaine 's father married again , but she was cruel to germaine . germaine 's stepmother did not want the other children to contract scrofula , so she talked her husband into keeping germaine away from the house . when she was very young she started to be a shepherdess . at night she slept in the stable or on vine branches in a roof space . in early ages she learned to practice humility and patience . she was not lonely because she had a gift with a sense of presence of god and other spiritual things . her daily food was bread and water . she loved jesus and the blessed virgin mary . she went to church every day . when she heard the church bell ring , she fixed her staff on the ground and left the sheep in the care of jesus while she was in mass . even though the flock was near a forest filled with wolves , the sheep were never harmed . after heavy rains or the snow melted , it was hard to cross to go to church . her only book was the rosary , and she had great devotion to the angelus . several times people saw the water make a passageway for germaine to cross without wetting her cloths . she helped the poor by sharing her bread with them . one day germaine 's father forbade her wife to treat germaine cruelly , and gave germaine a place in the house . germaine begged to be allowed to keep her humbler way of life . now , when everyone began to realize germaine 's holiness , she died . she had not awoken at her usual hour one early summer morning of 1601 , so her father went to look for her . he found her dead on the vine branches . she was 22 years old . she was buried in front of the stand in the church of pibrac .
