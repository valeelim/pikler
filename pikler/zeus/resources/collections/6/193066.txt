Developing country     different people have tried to classify countries into different groups . this is usually done either by looking at how rich people are , on average , in different countries , or how well-developed the political system is . most of the time there are two groups , namely developing countries and developed ones . sometimes there are three groups , in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries , and is usually called emerging countries . these definitions are problematic , because a high standard of living does not just mean that people make a lot of money . the main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries . just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off ; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher . this means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day . for this reason , there are different definitions of developing countries . the level of economic development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another . there are developing countries that have a high standard of living .
