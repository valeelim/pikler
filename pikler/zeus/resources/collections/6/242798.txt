Bible version debate     the bible is a collection of texts . the original of these texts were written in different languages . today , the collection of texts that is called `` the bible '' is written in one language only . for this reason , at least some texts need to be translated . versions of the bible are also different in the texts they include , some texts are not part of some bible versions . one of the first such translations is the septuagint , which is ancient greek . another well-known translation is the vulgate , which is latin . from about the 14th century , the bible was also translated into other languages . translating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning , and to interpreting it . a word in one language can not be translated into a word in a different language , with exactly the same meaning . one such method of translation is called `` literal translation '' or `` formal equivalence '' . literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language . often this means translating each word separately . there are a number of problems with literal translations : first , words must be added , to get a valid grammar in the target language . these words are not in the source text . the second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject , to understand some of the translation .
