Astrocytoma     an astroctytoma is a form of a brain tumor that comes from astrocytes ( a type of brain cell ) . there are many kinds of astrocytomas . they are separated into two categories . low-grade astrocytomas usually grow slowly and stay in one place . because of this , many of them can be treated just with surgery . once the tumor is taken out , often no other treatment is needed . as long as they get treatment , after five years , 90 % of people with these astrocytomas are still alive . one example of a low-grade astrocytoma is `` pilocytic astrocytoma . '' high-grade astrocytomas grow much more quickly and tend to spread throughout the body . because of this , they are harder to treat and have worse prognoses than low-grade astrocytomas . one example of a high-grade astrocytoma is `` anaplastic astrocytoma '' . this type of tumor has to be treated with a chemotherapy called temozolomide .
