Sequence analysis     sequence analysis in molecular biology involves identifying the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid , or amino acids in a peptide or protein . once a sample has been obtained , dna sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer . interpreting those results is still a task for humans . information from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology . it gives information on the relationship between individual organisms , or between groups of organisms . it shows how closely related they are . a dna sequence is the sequence of nucleotides in a dna molecule . it is written as a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a dna molecule or strand . if functional , such a sequence carries information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule . the possible letters are a , c , g , and t , representing the four nucleotide bases of a dna strand â€” adenine , cytosine , guanine , thymine . the sequences are printed next to one another , without gaps , as in the sequence aaagtctgac .
