Comet Hale–Bopp     comet hale–bopp ( formerly called c/1995 o1 ) is the biggest and brightest comet that has come by earth in the last century . it was called the great comet of 1997. it is probably the most-seen comet in history - even more than the famous halley 's comet . hale-bopp was discovered by two astronomers , alan hale and thomas bopp . this is a long-period comet ( it will not return to earth for a long time ) . it is so big that its coma ( the steam burning off of it ) is as big as the sun . it did n't come close enough to the sun to cross earth 's orbital path , so we could not see a meteor shower from the dust trail . scientists found lots of organic chemicals in hale-bopp which they never saw before . it was also the first comet that had the gas argon in it . it also has a sodium tail . see the picture on the left . a person named chuck shramek saw a not very bright , `` saturn-like '' thing following hale-bopp and called the art bell radio program and told them about it . lots of people thought a ufo was following behind the comet , even though many astronomers , including alan hale , tried to tell them it was just a star..
