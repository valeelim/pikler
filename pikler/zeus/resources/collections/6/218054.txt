Palaeozoic     the palaeozoic ( or paleozoic ) era is the earliest of the three eras of the phanerozoic . its name means `` early life '' . it lasted from about 541 to 252 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended with the greatest extinction event , the permianâ€“triassic extinction event . the palaeozoic began with an explosion of life forms . the cambrian explosion marks the era with thousands of new life forms in the ancient seas . the era saw many important events , including the development of most invertebrate groups , life 's conquest of land , the evolution of fish , reptiles , insects , and plants , the formation of the supercontinent of pangea , and at least two distinct ice ages . the earth rotated faster than it does today so days were shorter , and the nearer moon caused stronger tides . the six periods of the palaeozoic : - permian - carboniferous - pennsylvanian - mississippian - devonian - silurian - ordovician - cambrian
