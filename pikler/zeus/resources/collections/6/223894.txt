Conservation of mass     the law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction . thus , the amount of matter can not change . antoine lavoisier promoted this idea . this law says that when a chemical reaction rearranges atoms into a new product , the mass of the reactants ( chemicals before the chemical reaction ) is the same as the mass of the products ( the new chemicals made ) . more simply , whatever you do , you will still have the same amount of stuff . broader account : in any chemical reaction , nuclear reaction , or radioactive decay in an isolated system , the total mass of the starting materials must be equal to the mass of the products . the principle of conservation of mass was first outlined by mikhail lomonosov ( 1711–1765 ) in 1748. he proved it by experiments—though this is sometimes challenged . antoine lavoisier ( 1743–1794 ) had expressed these ideas in 1774. others whose ideas pre-dated the work of lavoisier include joseph black ( 1728–1799 ) , henry cavendish ( 1731–1810 ) , and jean rey ( 1583–1645 ) .
