Black Sea     the black sea is a sea in eurasia between europe , caucasus , and anatolia . many big rivers connect to the black sea , like don , danube , and dnieper rivers . it is connected to the atlantic ocean through the mediterranean sea , aegean sea , and many straits . 90 % of the sea has no oxygen . the water is saltwater but less salty than the ocean . during the last ice age , the black sea was a freshwater lake . in greek mythology , the argonauts traveled on the sea . greeks set up colonies around the sea because it was important to trade for many countries in ancient history . the gallipoli campaign during world war i was a fight for access to the black sea . it was also important in world war ii . the black sea sits on continental plates which have subsided . it is a geologic basin , and therefore is a genuine inland sea . its maximum depth is about 2000 metres . the black sea is the world â€™ s largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere . as a result , over 90 % of the deeper black sea volume is anoxic water . the upper layers are generally cooler , less dense and less salty than the deeper waters , as they are fed by large river systems , whereas the deep waters come from the warm , salty waters of the mediterranean .
