Stegoceras     stegoceras was a small , plant-eating dinosaur that had a large , thick-skulled head . this dinosaur may have butted heads with others of its kind in bone-shaking contests . many `` stegoceras '' and other pachycephalosaur fossils have been found in alberta , canada , and montana , usa . `` stegoceras '' was a herding dinosaur that lived in small groups in coastal and upland regions . running was probably its first line of defense . `` stegoceras '' lived during the late cretaceous period , toward the end of the mesozoic era , the age of reptiles , about 76-65 million years ago . `` stegoceras '' was first found in 1889. images of the insides of `` stegoceras '' ' fossilised skull showed two layers of dense bone that encase a spongy sinus held apart by tiny struts , has led some scientists to doubt this interpretation . computer tomographic ( ct ) scans on the skulls of `` stegoceras '' , along with a variety of modern animals were used to create 3d models of the animals ' heads . the team was then able to exert virtual stresses to test how the different skulls held up .
