Octet rule     the octet rule is a general rule of thumb that applies to most atoms . basically , it states that every atom wants to have eight valence electrons in its outermost electron shell . according to the bohr model , an atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons orbited by a number of electrons . in an ordinary atom , the number of electrons equals the number of protons . if it has more or fewer electrons , it is an ion . in addition , the electrons orbit in electron shells . each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons before new electrons must migrate to the next shell or `` energy level . '' starting with the third energy level , however , electrons sometimes move up a level even before the current one is full . every atom tries to have 8 electrons in its outermost ( or valence ) shell . this may require them to give up , share , or take electrons . as stated above , the number of electrons normally equals the number of protons . this means that some atoms are `` happier '' than others . for example , neon , as with other noble gases , naturally has 8 valence electrons . ( 10 total - 2 in the 1st energy level=8 in the 2nd ) not surprisingly , neon hardly ever reacts with anything . ( neon lights require high voltages to work . ) by contrast , the atoms in the alkaline metals column , such as sodium , have one valence electron , with a layer containing 8 electrons in the shell below . that means that if sodium only has to give up that one electron in order to complete the octet rule , and does so if given the chance . this is why sodium is so chemically reactive .
