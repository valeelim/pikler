Alfred Russel Wallace     alfred russel wallace om , frs ( 8 january 1823 â€“ 7 november 1913 ) was a british naturalist , explorer , biologist and social activist . he is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection . this was published in 1858 together with charles darwin 's idea . wallace did extensive natural history exploring . he went first to the amazon river basin with henry walter bates , and later to malaya and indonesia . he wrote books on both these adventures . while in indonesia he drew the `` wallace line '' which divides indonesia into two parts . on one side are animals of australasia . on the other side are species mostly of asian origin . he wrote a wonderful book on biogeography ( the distribution of animals ) . after a few years of working as a railway surveyor with his brother , wallace 's life was changed by meeting henry walter bates in leicester in 1847. wallace and bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the amazon . the plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to london , where an agent would sell them for a commission . also , for the travellers to `` '' gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species '' '' , as wallace put it in a letter to bates . the two friends , who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists , met in london to prepare themselves by viewing south american plants and animals in the main collections .
