Earthship     an earthship is a type of house that is built with natural and recycled materials with energy conservation in mind . designed by the architect michael reynolds and his company `` earthship biotecture '' , it is built to produce water and electricity for its own use . mainly made of earth-filled tires it takes advantage of thermal mass , natural heat insulation and ventilation to maintain its temperature . since it does not require any public utilities such as gas , electricity , water or sewage it can be considered as an off-the-grid housing , meaning that it can live away from public utilities . an earthship does not require external support to sustain itself . instead , it is built to use resources available from its natural surroundings . for example , windows are placed so that sunlight is shone inside the house to be used for heating . electricity is generated by solar panels and stored in batteries . the roofing collects rainwater that is filtered and used for drinking and various household activities such as cooking and washing . used water from sinks and showers is reused to water indoor plants and after that for toilet flushing .
