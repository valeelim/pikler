Survivor: The Australian Outback    survivor : the australian outback survivor : the australian outback was the second season of the united states reality show `` survivor '' . it was filmed at goshen station in northern queensland during 2000 and was shown on tv from january 28 , 2001 to may 3 , 2001 on cbs . the location used was within a three hour drive from the city of cairns and was in a wet , sub-tropical area . nielsen ratings says it was the highest rated show of 2001. fourteen episode were shown , one every week . the winner , tina wesson , was announced on may 3 , 2001 where she won against colby donaldson by a vote of 4-3. the entire season was made available on dvd on april 26 , 2005. although the first episode was shown right after super bowl xxxv , the late hour made cbs want to show the first episode again later that week . the elimination of player michael skupin during the sixth episode is well known for being the first case where a `` survivor '' player has had to be removed because of an injury . while trying to start a fire , skupin breathed in smoke and fainted , falling into the fire getting really bad burns to his hands . after being cared for by medical personnel , a helicopter was brought in and skupin was removed from the game . because of his removal , there was no immunity challenge , so there was no tribal council . because of this , the ogakor and kucha tribes merged ( combined ) with the same number of tribe members , instead of the possible six to four ( which would have happened if ogakor lost the immunity challenge and gone to tribal council ) . at the first merged tribal council , jeff varner was voted off after a tie vote between the two old tribes .
