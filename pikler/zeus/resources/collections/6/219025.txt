Elf     an elf is a mythical creature of various origins that is usually regarded as a good being that helps to make trees and nature good . it is therefore commonly associated with paganism and witchcraft ( many modern witches today believe that elves are real creatures ) . elves are usually described as a taller human but with more firmer touch to them . in the lord of the rings , however , elves were described as human sized ( and if anything taller ) , hence changing the description of elves . they are sometimes known to have long , pointy ears . in most modern fantasy scenarios , elves are one of the 3 main races ( elves , dwarves and humans ) , although if these 3 are described as the good races , they then become one of 6 races , including orcs , goblins and trolls and/or giants .
