Colossal squid     the colossal squid , `` mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni '' , is the biggest squid in the world , 12–14 metres ( 39–46 feet ) long . the colossal squid is bigger than a giant squid . its body is reddish brown and it lives up to 2000m below the surface of the southern ocean . it is the main food eaten by sperm whales . the colossal squid has ammonium chloride in its body , so it tastes bad for humans . it is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha , large fish like the patagonian toothfish and other squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence . the colossal squid is thought to have a slow metabolic rate , requiring only around 30 g of prey daily . estimates of its energetic demands suggest that it is a slow-moving ambush predator , using its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting . the eye is 27 cm ( 10.63 in ) wide , with a lens 12 cm across . this is the largest eye of any known animal . these measurements are of the partly collapsed specimen : when living the eye was probably 30 to 40 cm ( 12 to 16 in ) across .
