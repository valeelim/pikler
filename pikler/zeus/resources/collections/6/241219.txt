Rockhopper penguin     the rockhopper penguins are three closely related crested penguins that were thought to be a single species . they are now usually split into two or three species . not all experts agree on the classification of these penguins . some think all three are distinct species . some split the western and eastern forms into the southern rockhopper penguin and keeping the northern rockhopper as distinct , while other experts lump all three , calling it simply 'rockhopper penguin ' . - western rockhopper penguin , `` eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome '' - eastern rockhopper penguin , `` eudyptes chrysocome filholi '' - northern rockhopper penguin , `` eudyptes moseleyi '' they have a crest of feathers on their heads . they are called rockhopper because they hop from rock to rock to their nesting places . they keep both feet together so they can jump up more than a metre . although the rockhopper penguin is one of the world â€™ s most numerous penguins , the population has dropped almost 90 % since the early 20th century . the cause of this decline is mainly unknown . scientists speculate that humans are involved , mostly by commercial overfishing , oil exploitation , and pollution .
