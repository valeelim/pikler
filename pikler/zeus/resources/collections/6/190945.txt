Dignitas (euthanasia group)    dignitas ( euthanasia group ) dignitas is a swiss group that helps people with assisted suicide . this means that , if a person is very ill and wants to die , the doctors and nurses help them to end their life . only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped . the patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want . dignitas was started in 1998 by ludwig minelli , a swiss lawyer . the law in switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest ( for example , so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies ) . the doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die . there must be evidence for this , i.e . the patient has to sign a paper , and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing . if the patient is too ill to sign , a video film can be made . the patient is asked several times whether that is what they want . if everyone is absolutely sure , then he or she is given a drug which will kill them .
