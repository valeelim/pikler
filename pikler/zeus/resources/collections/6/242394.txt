NBA draft     the nba draft happens every year in june . it is where teams in the national basketball association ( nba ) choose players who have never played in the nba before . if a team chooses a player , that player can not sign a contract to play for any teams other than that team . players must be at least 19 years old at some point during the year of the draft . if the player 's 19th birthday will be the next year , they are too young . if a player is from the united states , it must be at least one year after the graduation of his high school class . some players who are star players go to college and play college basketball for just one year ( because they can not enter the draft right out of high school ) , then enter the nba draft . these players are called `` one and dones '' . other players enter the draft after two or three years in college , and other players are drafted after playing in college for all four years that they can . if a player has not played in college for four years , they must enter the nba draft by declaring themselves eligible .
