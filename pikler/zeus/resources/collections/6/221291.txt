Diffusion     diffusion is a physical process where molecules of a material move from an area of high concentration ( where there are many molecules ) to an area of low concentration ( where there are fewer molecules ) . diffusion usually happens in a solution in gas or in a liquid . it is possible to see diffusion happening when two liquids are mixed in a transparent container . it describes the constant movement of particles in all liquids and gases . these particles move in all directions bumping into each other . diffusion can only work with gases and liquids . here are some examples of diffusion : - a sugar cube is left in a beaker of water for a while . - the smell of ammonia spreads from the front of the classroom to the back of the room . - fumes of perfume rise from the bottle when the top is removed . - food coloring dropped on the beaker spreads out . - the smell of food spread in the whole house molecules tend to move from places of high concentration to places of low concentration , just by moving randomly . for example , there is more oxygen in a lung than there is oxygen in the blood so oxygen molecules will tend to move into the blood . similarly , there is more carbon dioxide molecules in the blood than in the lung so carbon dioxide molecules will tend to move into the lung . it happens in cell biology , where small molecules simply diffuse through the cell membrane , but larger molecules only get through by using energy : see active transport .
