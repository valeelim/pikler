Emperor Kōgen     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that kōgen ruled from the palace of `` sakaihara-no-miya '' at karu in what will come to be known as yamato province . kōgen is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes kōgen as the seventh of . kōgen was the eldest son of emperor kōrei . some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors . these critics consider kōgen 's grandson ( emperor sujin ) to be the earliest to have actually existed . the absence of information about kōgen does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . the abe clan are said to have descended from a son of emperor kōgen .
