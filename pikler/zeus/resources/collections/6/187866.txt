Spearman's rank correlation coefficient    spearman 's rank correlation coefficient in mathematics and statistics , spearman 's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of correlation , named after its maker , charles spearman . it is written in short as the greek letter `` rho '' ( formula_1 ) or sometimes as formula_2 . it is a number that shows how closely two sets of data are linked . it only can be used for data which can be put in order , such as highest to lowest . the general formula for formula_2 is formula_4 . for example , if you have data for how expensive different computers are , and data for how fast the computers are , you could see if they are linked , and how closely they are linked , using formula_2 . to work out formula_2 you first have to `` rank '' each piece of data . we are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed . so , the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1. the one higher than that would have 2. then , it goes up until it is all ranked . you have to do this to both sets of data . next , we have to find the `` difference '' between the two ranks . then , you multiply the difference by itself , which is called squaring . the difference is called formula_7 , and the number you get when you square formula_7 is called formula_9 .
