Repetitive strain injury     repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) , also known as occupational overuse syndrome , is a medical condition . it causes pain in the muscles , nerves , or tendons after a person uses the same part of the body over and over again , or without taking breaks . it is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks . using a computer for long periods of time is a common cause of this problem . repetitive strain injury is described as a sudden , intense pain in affected parts of the body , often the wrists , neck , back or hands , that keeps coming back . it is different from more specific diagnoses , because there are many possible causes for rsi . the pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually can not show any differences from that of a healthy person . because of this , treatment for rsi is usually limited to rest and exercises , and sometimes wearing a brace .
