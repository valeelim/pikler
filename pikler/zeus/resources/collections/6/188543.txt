Weak interaction     weak interaction , also called the weak force or weak nuclear force , is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe . it is carried by particles known as the w and z bosons , which are gauge bosons . the weak force causes beta decay , a form of radioactivity . at extremely high energy levels , the force of weak interaction and electromagnetism begin to act the same , and this is called electroweak interaction . beta decay is what scientists call a neutron breaking down , in contrast with alpha decay where an atom breaks down . these types of breaking down are more commonly known as radioactive decay . in a beta decay a neutron breaks into a proton , an electron and a neutrino . however , this is not completely true . beta decay begins with a neutron , which is made of one up quark and two down quarks . since up quarks have a charge of +2/3 , and each down quark has a charge of -1/3 this results as giving 2/3 -1/3 -1/3 = 0 charge . due to weak force , if there are too many neutrons in an atom nucleus , one of the down quarks in one of the neutrons turns into an up quark . this would change the charge of the neutron from 0 to ( 2/3 +2/3 -1/3 ) = 1. from this , the neutron is no longer a neutron , but actually a proton ( particle with a charge of +1 ) .
