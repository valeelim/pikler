Fashion design     fashion design is the art and profession of designing clothes and related items like hats , purses , bags and shoes . fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as attractive . they consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn . they have a range of materials to work with and a wide range of colors , patterns and styles to choose from . some clothes are made specifically for an individual , as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring . today , most clothing is designed for the mass market , especially casual and every-day wear . fashion design started in the 19th century with charles frederick worth , who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created . worth 's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear , instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done . the term `` couturier '' was in fact first created in order to describe him . while all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design , only clothing created after 1858 is considered fashion design .
