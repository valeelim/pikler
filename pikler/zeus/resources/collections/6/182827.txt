Warlord     a warlord is a ruler whose status is based solely on power of violence without any legitimacy ( that is : right by law ) . a warlord is a military commander , usually a militant leader , rebel or militia , who has a private army . the condottieri of middle ages italy are well known examples . many warlords lived in china and mongolia . warlordism is also known in afghanistan and somalia . while feudal lords may have private armies and wage private wars , they are not considered as warlords as their status is based on legitimacy . warlords appear when a state collapses . for example feudal lords took over in europe when the roman empire fell . warlordism is the inevitable consequence of anarchy . many warlords are former officers , clan leaders , mafia bosses or gang leaders . a warlord may attempt to build a state at the area where he is in power , or he may simply plunder and rob his subjects . a state which has collapsed into warlordism is in continuous civil war . such countries have few industries except agriculture , mining and contraband , such as drugs and weapons .
