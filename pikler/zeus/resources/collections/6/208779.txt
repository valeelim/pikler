Nuclear chain-reaction     a nuclear chain reaction is a nuclear reaction in which a heavy isotope atom such as uranium or plutonium splits and the neutrons released by the fissioning of that atom strike and split other heavy atoms which , as a result , hit others one after another after another . chain reactions are the main way of getting nuclear energy . power plants use a slow chain reaction to make steam . fast reactions can make a nuclear explosion . nuclear reactions make ionizing radiation that is harmful to life .
