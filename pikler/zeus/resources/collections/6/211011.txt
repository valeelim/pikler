Bowie knife     a bowie knife is a large hunting knife . it is named after colonel jim bowie . the knife was probably designed by his brother , rezin p. bowie . rezin ( pronounced `` reason '' ) gave his younger brother ( jim ) the knife so he would always have a backup weapon . it became history after the `` sandbar fight '' on the banks of the mississippi river in september 1827. this started as a duel but quickly became a fight between the two seconds , judge crane and jim bowie . crane pulled out a pistol and shot at bowie twice . one bullet hit bowie in the leg the other killed an onlooker . friends on both sides began shooting and slashing with knives . bowie was wounded several times but managed to kill one assailant and wound another with what witnesses called a `` big butcher knife '' . this made both bowie , the knife-fighter , and his knife famous . more than a dozen knifemakers of the time claim to have made the first bowie knife . but no one knows who made the first one or exactly what it looked like .
