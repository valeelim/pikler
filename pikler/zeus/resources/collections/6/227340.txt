Mangrove     mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics . mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat , called a `` mangrove swamp '' , `` mangrove forest '' , `` mangrove '' or `` mangal '' . mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores . they are also found in sub-tropical africa , asia , and the southwest pacific . their twisted , tangled roots collect dirt , which often become islands . mangroves live right in the sea . their seeds fall from the tree and will grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil . during low tide , they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fell . if the water level is high , though , they can be carried far away from where they fell . mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island . as dirt and other things collect in their roots , little bodies of land are formed â€“ just the right place for other island vegetation to grow . this is an example of seed dispersal by water . sometimes , mangrove trees grow on a coral reef and keep them healthy . smaller roots with air passages and breathing pores ( holes ) move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater . mangrove roots give clear water to the coral by trapping dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants . the tree also protects the shoreline ( and , through this , the coral reefs ) from being eroded by storm waves . mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish , shrimp , and crabs to grow .
