Confederation     a confederation is a group of countries that , by treaty , have given some of their powers to a central government . they do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas . this is like a federation , but without the association being a new country . a confederation is not the same as a federation , but they have a similarity . a confederation is a group of countries , a federation is a country . the only example today is the european union . switzerland has the latin name `` conf≈ìderatio helvetica '' , although it is not a confederation in this sense , but a federation .
