Signed number representations     signed number representations are used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary . the problem of trying to store the negative sign ( âˆ’ ) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment . it is not possible to just use 'off ' for minus and 'on ' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign . to overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers : sign-and-magnitude and 2 's complement . these produce alternative representations for signed numbers . sign and magnitude works by changing the most significant bit ( msb - the first digit ) to a 1 if the number is negative , and reduce the number by one , for example : will become ... this method of storing negative binary numbers does not work because : - binary arithmetic wo n't work . - we must first know which storage mechanism the compiler of a particular language uses .
