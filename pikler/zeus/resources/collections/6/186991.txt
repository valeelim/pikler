Galen     galen of pergamum ( ad 129 â€“ 199/217 ) was a prominent roman physician and philosopher from greece . he was an important medical researcher during the time of the roman empire . his theories influenced western medical science for over a thousand years . he came up with the 'theory of opposites ' based upon hippocrates ' four humours ' theory , which helped develop medicine in the roman and again in the middle ages to include more natural based medicine ( rather that just religious medicine ) . some of his observations in his books were wrong , as he could only dissect animals and compare them to humans , because he was not allowed to dissect human corpses . later on in the renaissance period people such as vesalius challenged his theories and observations with his own books . galen was vital in the beginnings of natural medicine , and is often known as the 'father of anatomy ' .
