Ocean pollution     ocean pollution is pollution in the sea . it is a form of water pollution . marine pollution occurs when harmful , or potentially harmful , effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals , particles , industrial , agricultural and residential waste , noise , or the spread of invasive organisms . most sources of marine pollution are land based . the pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff , wind-blown debris and dust . nutrient pollution , a form of water pollution , refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients . it is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters , in which excess nutrients , usually nitrogen or phosphorus , stimulate algae growth . many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthos animals , most of which are either deposit or filter feeders . in this way , the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains . when pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem , they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs . once in the food webs , these pesticides can cause mutations , as well as diseases , which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web .
