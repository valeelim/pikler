Fiddler crab     a fiddler crab , also called a calling crab , is a land crab that lives in mud or sand flats near the beach . the reason this crab is called a fiddler crab is because it holds its large in front of its body and moves it back and forth as if it is playing a fiddle . the male fiddler crab has one huge cheliped and another smaller cheliped . sometimes it 's the right cheliped that 's the big one and sometimes it 's the left . if a male loses its large cheliped , the smaller one will grow large to replace it . this huge cheliped is so large that it is sometimes bigger than the whole crab . it is this cheliped they wave back and forth . the fiddler crab eats by first opening its mouth , then using its maxillipeds ( a part of its mouth ) , it scoops in a small amount of mud or sand , depending on where it lives . then , it uses its other mouthparts to scrape any food matter ( algae , decaying animals or plants ) it can from the dirt it has just put into its mouth . after this , it forms the mud or sand into a little , which is called a `` feeding pellet '' . it then drops the feeding pellet and starts all over again .
