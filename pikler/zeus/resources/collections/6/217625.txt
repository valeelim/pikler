History of the alphabet     the history of the alphabet begins in ancient egypt , more than a millennium into the history of writing . the first pure alphabet emerged around 2000 bce to represent the language of semitic workers in egypt , and was derived from the alphabetic principles of the egyptian hieroglyphs . most alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development , for example the greek and latin alphabets , or were inspired by its design . by 2700 bce the ancient egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the consonants of their language , plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels . the first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 2000 bce for semitic workers in central egypt . over the next 500 years it spread north , and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it , or been inspired by one of its descendants , with the possible exception of the meroitic alphabet , a 3rd century bce adaptation of hieroglyphs in nubia to the south of egypt .
