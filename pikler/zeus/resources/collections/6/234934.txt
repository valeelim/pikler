Seismic performance     seismic performance is an execution of a building structure 's ability to sustain its due functions , such as safety and serviceability , `` at '' and `` after '' a particular earthquake . a structure is , normally , considered `` safe '' if it does not endanger the lives and wellbeing of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing . a structure may be considered `` serviceable '' if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed . ancient builders believed that earthquakes were a result of wrath of gods ( in greek mythology , e.g. , the main `` earth-shaker '' was poseidon ) and , therefore , could not be resisted by humans . nowadays , the people 's attitude has changed dramatically though seismic loads , sometimes , exceed ability of a structure to resist them without being broken , partially or completely . other pages . - richter scale - tsunami - volcano
