Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event     the permian/triassic extinction event ( p/tr for short ) was the largest extinction event in the phanerozoic eon . 96 % of all marine species and 70 % of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct . it ended the palaeozoic era , and began the mesozoic era . the event forms the boundary between the permian and triassic periods , at about 252 million years ago . because so much biodiversity was lost , the recovery of life on earth took much longer than after other extinction events . this event has been described as the `` mother of all mass extinctions '' . the pattern of extinction is still unclear , as different studies suggest one to three different pulses . there are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions . these include : large or multiple meteorite impacts , increased volcanism , sudden release of methane hydrates from the sea floor . gradual changes include sea level change , oceanic anoxic events , increasing aridity , and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change .
