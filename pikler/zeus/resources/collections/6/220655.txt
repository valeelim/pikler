Route availability     route availability ( ra ) is the system by which the permanent way and supporting works ( bridges , embankments , etc . ) of the national rail network of great britain are graded . all routes are given an ra number between 1 and 10. rolling stock is also given an ra ( again between 1 and 10 ) and the ra of a train is the highest ra of any of the supporting elements . the ra is mainly about the axle load of the vehicle , although axle spacing is also taken into thought . in practice it is the locomotive which decides where trains may operate , although many high capacity four axle wagons have high ras when fully loaded . ( when considering the operation of trains the loading gauge must also be considered . )
