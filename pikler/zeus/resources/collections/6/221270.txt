Map lichen     the map lichen is a species of lichen , rhizocarpon geographicum . it grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution . each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores . these patches grow next to each other . this makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field . map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine the relative age of deposits . as an example , they might use it in a moraine systems , to tell how long a rock has been exposed . with this they can also tell about glacial advances . the process is called lichenometry . lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual . if the growth rate is known , the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited . growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age , such as gravestones , historic or prehistoric rock buildings , or moraines of known age ( e.g . those deposited during the little ice age ) .
