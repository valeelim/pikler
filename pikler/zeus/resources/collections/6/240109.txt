Aftershock     an aftershock is a smaller earthquake which comes after a large earthquake ( called the main shock ) in the same area . an aftershock is the opposite of a foreshock , which a small earthquake comes before the large earthquake . there are many laws which aftershocks meet , but the most famous is omori 's law . in 1894 , fusakichi omori did some works on aftershocks , and firstly he came up with this rule : formula_1 - `` t '' is time . - `` n ( t ) '' is the rate of earthquakes in a time after the main shock - `` c '' is a constant - `` k '' is the size of the earthquake . by 1961 , utsu wanted to change the rule . his rule looked like this : formula_2 where `` p '' changes the rate , this mainly has a number between 0.7 and 1.5 .
