Sparkling wine     sparkling wine is the name for a number of wines which have a lot of carbon dioxide in them . this will make the wine fizzy . the carbon dioxide may be the result of the fermentation process , or it may have been added later . one of the best-known examples is probably champagne , but there are many other such wines . in spain such wines are called `` cava '' , in italy `` asti '' or `` spumante '' and in german `` sekt '' . in french the terms `` mousseux '' or `` crémant '' are used for such wines , as well , especially for those which are not produced in the champagne . crémant d'alsace , blanquette de limoux and clairette de die are examples of sparkling wines made in france outside the champagne region . most sparkling wines are made from white wine or rosé .
