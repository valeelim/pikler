Chicxulub crater     the chicxulub crater is a very big crater . some scientists believe that the chicxulub crater was made by the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs , and many other animals . it is near the yucat√°n peninsula in mexico . the chicxulub crater is more than 180 km ( 110 mi ) in diameter , making it the third largest confirmed impact crater . the bolide which formed the crater was at least 10 km ( 6 mi ) in diameter . evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz , a gravity anomaly , and tektites in surrounding areas . the age of the rocks and isotope analysis show that this impact structure dates from the end of the cretaceous period , roughly 65 million years ago . the impact associated with the crater is implicated in causing the extinction of the dinosaurs . a 2007 study suggests that the impactor may have been a piece of a much larger asteroid that broke up in a collision and also produced 298 baptistina , 160 million years ago . in march 2010 , following analysis of the available evidence covering 20 years ' worth of data in the fields of palaeontology , geochemistry , climate modelling , geophysics and sedimentology , 41 international experts from 33 institutions reviewed available evidence and concluded that the impact at chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions during k-t boundary including those of dinosaurs .
