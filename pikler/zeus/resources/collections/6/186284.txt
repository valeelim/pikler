Exclusive Economic Zone     exclusive economic zone ( eez ) is an area in the ocean where only one country gets to look into and do economic activity , such as mining underwater resources and fishing . in the case of islands far from the mainland , eez starts at the coasts of the islands . normally , eez goes out to 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) , unless eezs of two or more countries overlap . many eezs actually overlap ; countries argue over where their outermost boundaries of eez should be . it is different from territorial waters in that ships and submarines from other countries can freely travel without any permission . however , this is under the condition that they are just passing by and not taking any resources home . see . - cod wars
