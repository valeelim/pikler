Swing vote     swing voters are people who vote who do not always vote for the same party . their vote is called a swing vote . the swing vote is often closely studied when there are elections because it often decides who wins the election . in many elections parties try to convince the swing voters and the people who vote for the first time to vote for them . in contrast to the swing voters , there are other voters who have always voted for the same party in the past . a campaign for a vote therefore often focuses less on keeping the people who will always vote for their party ; the parties spend more effort and money on convincing new people to vote for them .
