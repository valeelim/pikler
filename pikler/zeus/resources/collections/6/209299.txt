Immunosuppressant drugs     immunosuppressant drugs are simply drugs which suppress the immune system . in other words , they reduce the effect of the tiny germs that protect your body from dangerous germs . this makes the body open to disease but it is useful in other ways : when someone receives an organ transplant , the body thinks the new organ is dangerous and tries to get rid of it . this is called organ rejection . if immunosuppressant drugs are taken the body usually accepts the new organ .
