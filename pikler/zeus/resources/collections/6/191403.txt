Epping Ongar Railway     the epping ongar railway is a preserved railway . it runs along the last section of the old great eastern railway and london underground central line branch line . the line runs between epping and ongar . there is also an intermediate stop at north weald . the line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed . it runs a sunday and bank holiday service using a class 117 diesel multiple unit . the service runs between ongar and coopersale . the service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains . the land and infrastructure are owned by epping ongar railway ltd. the branch line to ongar was built in 1865 by the eastern counties/great eastern railway . the eastern section of the line , between epping and ongar , was single track . there was one passing loop at north weald station . around 14 trains went as far as ongar station each day . the rest finished at epping or loughton . the trains continued to finish at epping or loughton until 1949. at this time the london passenger transport board 's new works project extended the central line to epping using electric trains . the central line would take over the railway from british rail . as part of this change , the epping-ongar branch line had its through trains to london removed . instead , a shuttle service between epping ( to connect with trains to london ) and ongar was used . at one stage , it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and london underground electric multiple units side-by-side at epping . the steam shuttle was hired by the london transport executive from british rail . this was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch .
