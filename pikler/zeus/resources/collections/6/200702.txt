Deadlock     a deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish . as a consequence , neither ever does . it is often seen in a paradox like the `` chicken or the egg . '' in computer science , deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource . it can also be that more than two processes are waiting for a number of resources . deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a `` software lock '' or `` soft lock '' . computers intended for the `` time-sharing '' or `` real-time '' markets often have a `` hardware lock '' ( or `` hard lock '' ) which guarantees `` exclusive access '' to processes . this forces the prforcing serialized access . deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no `` general '' solution to avoid ( soft ) deadlocks . this situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams , with only one pencil and one ruler between them . if one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler , a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler . both requests ca n't be satisfied , so a deadlock occurs .
