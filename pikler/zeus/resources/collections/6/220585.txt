Edmontosaurus     edmontosaurus was a large , plant-eating , duck-billed dinosaur from the latest cretaceous stage . it had short arms , a long , pointed tail , three-toed , hoofed feet , and mitten-like hands . its head was flat and sloping with a wide , toothless beak , cheek pouches , and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground up its food . it is the same animal as `` anatotitan '' . there are two species , and the animal has been called by several other names in the past . `` edmontosaurus '' was named from a fossil found in the horseshoe canyon formation , in alberta , canada . many `` edmontosaurus '' fossils have been found , in alberta , and alaska , wyoming , montana and new jersey in the usa . two mummified `` edmontosaurus '' fossils were found in wyoming . the distribution of its fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and coastal plains . it could move on two legs and on four . because it is known from several bone beds , `` edmontosaurus '' is thought to have lived in groups . it may have been migratory . most of the back and tail was lined by bony tendons arranged in a lattice along the neural spines of the vertebrae . this made the back and part of the tail `` ramrod '' straight . the ossified tendons strengthened the vertebral column against gravitational stress . it was a large animal with a horizontal vertebral column otherwise supported mostly by the hind legs and hips .
