Papal conclave     a papal conclave is a meeting of cardinals . the cardinals meet to elect the next bishop of rome , to become pope . this becomes necessary when the old pope dies or resigns . usually , popes do not resign , though . the last pope to resign was pope benedict xvi . on 11 february 2013 , the vatican confirmed pope benedict would resign the papacy and on 13 march it announced the new and current pope as pope francis . the word `` conclave '' is from latin . it refers to the fact that the cardinals are locked up together , until they have agreed on a new pope . today , this happens in the sistine chapel . originally , the conclave was started in italian city states , in the 12th century . these cities needed to elect officeholders , and the election needed to be free of party politics . events such as the investiture controversy in medieval europe led to people wanting `` free '' elections , with a medieval understanding of free . methods were often combined , the elements used were acclamation , naming of candidates by predecessors , or by univolved people , and using `` electrors '' who would agree on the successor , behind closed doors . earliest examples are that of genua , in 1157 , pisa , in 1162-64 , or pistoia .
