D-sharp minor     d-sharp minor is a minor scale based on d . for the harmonic minor , the c is raised to c. its key signature has six sharps . e-flat minor is its enharmonic equivalent . its relative major is f-sharp major , and its parallel major is d-sharp major . this is usually replaced by e-flat major , because d-sharp major 's two double sharps make it impractical to use . since d-sharp minor and its enharmonic equivalent both have key signatures of six accidentals , neither one is clearly used instead of the other . for example , using the melodic minor version of d-sharp minor on the harp is very difficult . the b-pedal can be set to the sharp position , but there is no double-sharp position to set the c-pedal at . in book i of `` the well-tempered clavier '' , bach chose to write the eighth prelude in e-flat minor but the accompanying fugue in d-sharp minor . ( in book ii , bach wrote both the eighth prelude and fugue in d-sharp minor . ) music written in this key is considered very difficult to read , which means that little music was written mainly in this key in the classical era . e-flat minor is easier for many brass instruments and woodwinds .
