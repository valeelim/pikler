Ediacaran biota     the ediacaran biota are the somewhat puzzling fauna of the ediacaran period . this geological period was from 635–542 million years ago ( mya ) , but the fossil biota was only from 575–542 mya . this was after a series of ice ages and just before the cambrian period . the biota consists of soft-bodied multicellular organisms , probably animals , which left trace fossils in rocks of ediacaran age . the biota is quite unusual , and there is no sign of it in the preceding marinoan glaciation . the biota appears to suffer a fairly severe extinction event at the boundary with the cambrian . some of the biota may have survived into the early cambrian . there have been several different interpretations of the biota . the standard view is that the traces are fossils of well-known phyla ( cnidaria , annelids , early arthropods ) with body plans that disappeared before the cambrian . quite different ideas have been put forward . seilacher thought few if any of the forms belonged to living phyla . conway morris opposed this idea . rentallak suggested the biota might be lichens .
