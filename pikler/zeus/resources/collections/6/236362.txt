Myoglobin     myoglobin is a protein that is able to bind oxygen . myoglobin , which is similar to haemoglobin , is the main oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues . like haemoglobin , it has a porphyrin ring with an iron atom at its centre . it is in the muscle tissue of most mammals . seals and other marine mammals have more myoglobin in their muscles than land animals . in humans , increased level of myoglobin in the serum of the blood can be an indication of myocardial infarction . other factors for a higher level can be damage to the muscles , epileptic seizures , polytrauma . if the value is much too high , this can lead to kidney failure .
