Herrerasaurus     herrerasaurus was one of the earliest dinosaurs . all known fossils of this carnivore have been discovered in upper triassic strata dated to 231.4 million years ago ( mya ) in northwestern argentina . it is a member of the herrerasauridae , a family of similar genera that were among the earliest dinosaurs . `` herrerasaurus '' was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head . its length is estimated at 3 to 6 meters ( 10 to 20 ft ) , and its hip height at more than 1.1 meters ( 3.3 ft ) . it may have weighed around 210–350 kilograms ( 463–772 lb ) . in a large specimen the skull measured 56 centimeters ( 1.8 ft ) in length . smaller specimens had skulls about 30 centimeters ( 1 ft ) long . the tail , partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections , balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed . the paleoenvironment of the ischigualasto formation ( where it was found ) was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests with strong seasonal rainfall . the climate was moist and warm , with seasonal variations . vegetation consisted of ferns ( `` cladophlebis '' ) , horsetails , and giant conifers ( `` protojuniperoxylon '' ) . these plants formed lowland forests along the banks of rivers . `` herrerasaurus '' remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the ischigualasto formation .
