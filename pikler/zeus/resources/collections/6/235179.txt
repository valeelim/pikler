Mass versus weight     in the physical sciences , mass and weight are different . the mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object . weight is a measure of the force on the object caused by a gravitational field . in other words , weight is how hard gravity pulls on an object . this means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earth 's surface , but if it is moved from the equator to the north pole , its weight will grow by 0.5 % because of the increase in the earth 's gravitational field . mass is measured in kilograms or pounds . a one-liter volume of water has a mass of one kilogram . weight is measured in newtons , the standard unit for force . a one-kilogram mass placed on a bench presses down on the bench with almost ten newtons of force . the weight of something is the value measured at the earth 's surface . unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds . for almost all of human history weight has been measured on the surface of the earth . here , the weight is proportional to the mass . objects which have the same mass have the same weight . an object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight . as a consequence it is common practice to use the two words , mass and weight , as if they mean the same thing , and to use kilograms or pounds as the units for both mass and weight . using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties , mass and weight . mass and weight are not the same thing .
