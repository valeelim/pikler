Histone     histones are proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei , which package the dna into structural units called nucleosomes . they are the chief protein components of chromatin , the active component of chromosomes . histones act as spools around which dna winds , and play a role in gene regulation . without histones , the unwound dna in chromosomes would be very long . for example , each human cell has about 1.8 meters of dna , but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin , which , when duplicated and condensed during mitosis , result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes . histones act as spools around which dna winds . this packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei . the compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule . histones undergo changes which alter their interaction with dna and nuclear proteins . long-term changes in histone/dna interaction cause epigenetic effects . combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code , the so-called `` histone code '' . histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation , dna repair and chromosome condensation ( mitosis ) .
