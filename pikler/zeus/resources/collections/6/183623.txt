River Trent     the river trent is one of the major rivers of england . it is the third longest river in the united kingdom . it starts in staffordshire . it flows through the centre of england until it joins the river ouse to form the river humber ( estuary ) which empties into the north sea . the name `` trent '' comes from a celtic word possibly meaning `` strongly flooding '' . more specifically , the name may be a contraction of two celtic words , `` tros '' ( `` over '' ) and `` hynt '' ( `` way '' ) . it is unusual amongst english rivers in that it flows north ( for the second half of its route ) , and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore , the `` aegir '' . the area drained by the river includes most of the northern midlands . the river is legally navigable for some below burton upon trent . however for practical purposes , navigation above the southern terminus of the trent and mersey canal ( at shardlow ) is conducted on the canal , rather than on the river itself . at certain times of the year , the lower tidal reaches of the trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to five feet ( 1.5m ) high .
