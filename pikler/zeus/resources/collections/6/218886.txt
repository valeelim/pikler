Pliocene     the pliocene ( pleiocene in older texts ) was a short geological epoch at the end of the neogene . it began 5.3 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended 2.6 mya . the pliocene follows the miocene and is followed by the pleistocene . the world continued to get cooler and drier in the pliocene . tropical rain forests and deciduous forests shrank . grasslands grew , and many herbivorous mammals became grazers instead of browsers . hominid evolution took a new turn as some apes started to live on the savannah instead of the forests ( australopithecines ) .
