Germination     germination occurs when a spore or seed starts to grow . it is a term used in botany . when a spore or seed germinates , it produces a shoot or seedling , or ( in the case of fungi ) a hypha . the biology of spores is different from seeds . a `` spore '' germinates if and when conditions are right . it has a very limited lifespan . the method of spore-bearers , which are lower plants such as mosses , ferns and also fungi , is to produce vast numbers of spores , of which only a small percentage germinate . `` seeds '' contain an embryo , a store of food ( the endosperm ) , and a protective coat . seed plants include gymnosperms ( such as conifers ) and angiosperms ( such as flowering plants ) . seeds can survive much longer than spores , sometimes for hundreds of years . the strategy of seed-bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds , and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just wind . seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met , and these needs differ from species to species .
