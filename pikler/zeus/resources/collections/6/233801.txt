Theoretical key     in music theory , theoretical keys or impossible keys are keys with key signatures that contain at least one double-flats or double-sharps . double-flats and double-sharps are used in music as accidentals , but they are rarely placed in the key signature ( in music that uses equal temperament ) , because it would make reading the key signature very difficult . for example , the key of g major is rarely used to write music down , because its key signature has an f. an equal-tempered scale of g major has exactly the same notes as the a major scale . key pairs like this are called enharmonically equivalent . so the theoretical key of g major is usually written with the key signature of a major . a piece of western music usually has a home key , and a passage within it may modulate to another key , which is usually closely related to the home key . ( usually , close to the original around the circle of fifths . ) when the key is near the top of the circle ( a key signature of zero or few accidentals ) , the writing of both keys is easy- a small number of extra sharps or flats is added . but if the home key is near the bottom of the circle ( a key signature with many accidentals ) , enharmonic equivalence may need to be used because simply adding accidentals will result in a key with too many accidentals to be easy to play or write in .
