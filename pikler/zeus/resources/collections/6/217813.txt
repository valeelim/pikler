Cuboid     a cuboid is a 3d shape . cuboids have six faces , which form a convex polyhedron . simply speaking , cuboids are made from 6 rectangles , which are placed at right angles . a cuboid that uses all square faces is a cube ; if the faces are rectangles , other than squares , it looks like a shoe box . properties of a cuboid are : - it has 12 edges - it has 8 corners or vertices - it has 6 faces . the basic difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that one is a 2d shape and the other is a 3d shape . the basic difference between a cube and cuboid is that a cube has equal length , height and breadth whereas in cuboids these three may not be the same .
