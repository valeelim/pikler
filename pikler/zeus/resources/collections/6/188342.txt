Naked mole rat     the naked mole rat ( `` heterocephalus glaber '' ) , ( or sand puppy ) is a burrowing rodent . the species is native to parts of east africa . it is one of only two known eusocial mammals ( the other is the damaraland mole rat ) . the animal has unusual features , adapted to its harsh underground environment . the animals do not feel pain in their skin . they also have a very low metabolism . typically , the animals are between eight and ten centimetres long , and weigh about 30 grams . their eyes are quite small , and they do not see very well . their legs are thin and short . nevertheless , they are very good at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward . they have large , protruding teeth , which they use to dig . their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging . they have little hair and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin . the naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat : its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen , increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake . it has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size , about two thirds that of a mouse of the same size . it only uses very little oxygen . in long periods of hunger , such as a drought , its metabolic rate can reduce by up to twenty-five percent .
