Eddie Irvine     edmund `` eddie '' irvine , jr. ( born 10 november 1965 , newtownards , county down ) is a former racing driver from northern ireland . he raced under a british driving license . irvine spent time in the 1980s and early 1990 's in formula ford and f3000 . he joined formula one in 1993 , scoring a point on his debut as he replaced emanuele naspetti . he stayed on for jordan in 1994 and 1995 , before going on to drive for scuderia ferrari in 1996. his results were not as successful as michael schumacher 's , including eight straight dnf 's ( did not finish ) in a row in 1996. he eventually improved , scoring more podiums as he went along with the team . in 1999 michael schumacher , the `` # 1 driver '' for ferrari was injured during a race at silverstone . irvine was made the # 1 driver . the team put all their efforts towards irvine winning a driver 's championship . it was n't successful , but irvine did place second in the championship . irvine left ferrari after that season because he was frustrated with ferrari 's policy on team orders , which meant that one driver was labelled as `` being # 1 . '' so , irvine joined the new jaguar racing team in 2000 , where he finally became the lead driver . however , the car was not competitive and reliable , so jaguar , despite having lots of experience with irvine , had little results . irvine obtained the only two podiums jaguar would ever see , and irvine retired from formula one after 2002 .
