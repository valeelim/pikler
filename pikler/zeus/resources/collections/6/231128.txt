Bundeswehr     the bundeswehr ( german for `` federal defence force '' ; ) are the german armed forces . the german armed forces are for the unified germany itself and do not have several parts for the states of germany . there are five sections : three bigger ones : heer ( army ) , marine ( navy ) and luftwaffe ( air force ) form one unified force , not three separate fighting forces . and two smaller ones : `` joint support service '' ( streitkräftebasis ) and `` central medical services '' ( zentraler sanitätsdienst ) . in peace-time the commander-in-chief is the federal minister of defence , and in wartime the chancellor of germany . this is unlike most countries where the head of state is commander in chief . in march 2012 , there were about 207,000 soldiers serving in the bundeswehr ; there are another 200,000 in reserve . conscription for the bundeswehr has been abolished in july 2011. related pages . - nato - luftwaffe - wehrmacht
