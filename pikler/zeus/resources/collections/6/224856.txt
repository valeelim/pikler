Sooty Barbthroat     the sooty barbthroat ( `` threnetes niger '' ) is a species of hummingbird . it is found in french guiana and far north-eastern brazil . its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest . though normally restricted in range , it is common enough to be thought a species of least concern by the iucn . the taxonomy and systematics of the sooty barbthroat complex has made much confusion . some authors thought the sooty barbthroat to be a `` melanistic variant '' of the pale-tailed barbthroat ( `` t. leucurus '' ) . not only that , but some suggest that the bronze-tailed barbthroat ( `` t. n. loehkeni '' ) should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful christina 's barbthroat ( `` t. n. christinae '' ) as a subspecies . freire 's sooty barbthroat ( t. n. freirei ) is average between the sooty and bronze-tailed barbthroats however , and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed .
