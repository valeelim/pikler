Albert Goldfield     the albert goldfield is an area of 1300 square kilometres ( 500 square miles ) where gold was discovered in the outback of new south wales in 1880. gold was found at mount browne , which is south west of tibooburra . there were other finds at good friday , easter monday , nuggerty , pioneer reef and warratta creek . this is a very hot and dry area of australia . because of the shortage of water , towns were started at milparinka and tibooburra where there was water available . towns at albert and mount browne did not last for long because of the lack of water . by 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns . geologist william henry john slee was appointed resident goldfield warden . the miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for the gold , or use a method called dry blowing . dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind . life on the goldfields was hard , water was scarce , fresh fruit and vegetables were not available , and basics like flour were very expensive . disease , including dysentery and typhoid were common .
