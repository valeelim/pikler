Hardy–Weinberg law     the hardy–weinberg law was developed independently by an english mathematician , g.h . hardy , and a german doctor , wilhelm weinberg . this concept is also known as the `` hardy–weinberg equilibrium '' , `` hardy–weinberg theorem '' or `` hardy–weinberg principle '' . sometimes weinberg 's name is placed first . the law is a foundation of population genetics , and it is still taught to students today . it states that the proportions of alleles of all genes in any population will remain the same unless perturbed ( disturbed ) . that applies to all loci on all chromosomes in the population . possible perturbations are : it follows that any systematic change in the frequency of alleles in a population `` must '' be due to the effect of one or more of these causes . of course , like all aspects of mendelian inheritance , the expected proportions of alleles are probabilities . it was for that reason that statistical tests of significance , such as standard errors , were developed . although all changes must be due to perturbations , not all perturbations lead to changes . the classic case is balancing selection , such as heterozygote advantage : `` heterosis : the heterozygote at a locus is fitter than either homozygote '' . balancing selection leads to an equilibrium population with hardy–weinberg proportions
