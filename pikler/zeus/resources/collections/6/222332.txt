Grand Cross     the phrase grand cross is used to describe the highest grade in many types of knighthood . sometimes the person with the highest grade are called `` knights grand cross '' or just `` grand crosses '' . sometimes the actual medallion or ribbon is called `` the grand cross '' and not the person . in some orders , the highest grade may be called the `` grand cordon '' , `` grand collar '' or something like this . in those cases the rank of grand cross may come after another rank , but before the highest grade . as an example : - for the portuguese order of saint james of the sword , the grand cross is the 5th highest award , with the `` grand collar '' being a higher award above the grand cross .
