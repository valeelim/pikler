Monoplacophora     monoplacophora is a class of molluscs . they have a cap-like shell and live on the bottom of the sea . they were well-known as a fossil group from the cambrian to the devonian . one species was dredged up from the pacific ocean off mexico in 1952. it was found to be a monoplacophoran , and given the genus of `` neopilina '' . this was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a 'living fossil ' , and a lazarus taxon . more than that , they are the most extreme example of the `` pull of the recent '' , which is a term in palaeontology . all fossil groups have a first and last appearance in the fossil record but , for living species , their last appearance is the present day . this may be very much later than their last appearance as a fossil . the discovery of the living monoplacs extended their time range by 400 million years . the anatomy of `` neopilina '' shows `` serially repeated structures '' such as gills . serial repetition of anatomical structures such as gills and muscles may have evolved once in the common ancestor of chitons and monoplacophorans . it suggests the ancient ancestor of molluscs had bilateral symmetry , and segments .
