Screwdriver     a screwdriver is a tool used to turn ( or `` drive '' ) screws into something . it has an axial shaft with a tip of a certain shape that fits into the head of a screw . on the other end of the screwdriver is a cylindrical handle to be held by a person 's hand . as the handle is rotated , it creates a torque that turns the tip via the screwdriver 's shaft . there are many different sizes and kinds of screwdrivers . a screwdriver is usually identified by the shape of its tip . the tip is shaped in a certain way to match the groove cut into the head of a screw . a screwdriver is , therefore , a mechanism to apply torque to a screw and turn it in tight spaces . screwdrivers come in a large variety of shapes and sizes to match those of screws . if a screwdriver that is not the right size and type for the screw is used , it is likely that the screw will be damaged in the process of tightening it . many screwdriver designs have a handle that can be used with different tips . the shaft and the tip can be removed from the handle , and a different one can be attached instead . the shaft and the tip are together called a `` bit '' ( as with a drill bit ) . this allows a set of one handle and several heads to be used for a variety of screw sizes and types .
