Twin paradox     the twin paradox in physics is a thought experiment in special relativity . it involves identical twins , one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on earth has aged more . the paradox depends upon the unspoken idea that the passage of time is the same in all circumstances . but this is not correct . time is relative and the speed of light through a vacuum is the only constant . and the universe is relativistic , not newtonian . every single test which has been made has shown this . related pages . - special relativity
