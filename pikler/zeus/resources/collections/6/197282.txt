Race condition     a race condition ( also called race hazard ) is a problem with the design of a system . with a race condition , the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes , or when it is started . race conditions occur in logic circuits and computer software , especially with multi-threaded or distributed systems . it is often difficult to explain what a race condition is , but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation . a computer program is like a horse race . the computer program does several things at the same time , similarly to how several horses run at the same time in a horse race . each horse represents what is usually called a `` thread of execution '' . that way , one such thread may handle network communication , another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface . in the case of a race condition , the application works properly if a given horse `` wins the race '' . for example , the application may work if horse number five wins , but it will crash if any other horse wins the race . one solution to the problem is to use synchronization . this is like several jockeys teaming up , to make sure horse number five is ahead .
