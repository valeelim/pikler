Baked Alaska     baked alaska is a dessert made of ice cream on top of slices of sponge cake or christmas pudding and covered with meringue . the whole dessert is then baked in a very hot oven for just long enough to cook the meringue . the meringue is a good insulator , and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream . its name , but not the recipe , was made at delmonico 's restaurant in 1876 to honour the new american territory . february 1 is baked alaska day . a slightly changed dessert called bombe alaska came from noel , alaska . some dark rum is splashed over the baked alaska , and the whole dessert is flamb√©ed while being served .
