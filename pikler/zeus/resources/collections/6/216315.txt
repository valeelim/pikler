Carriage return     a carriage return , sometimes known as a cartridge return and often shortened to cr , < cr > or return , is a control character or mechanism used to reset a device 's position to the beginning of a line of text . it is closely associated with the line feed and newline concepts , although it can be considered separately in its own right . in computing , the carriage return is the name of a computer character that directs a printer or screen display to return to the start of a line when printing or displaying text . the origin of its name is as you 'd expect : it told a teletype that its print carriage ( the cylinder that held the paper ) should return to the beginning of a line . on some systems , such as older macintoshes , it also creates a new line , like the line feed character .
