Bernhard Rensch     bernhard rensch ( 21 january 1900â€“4 april 1990 ) was a german evolutionary biologist , and ornithologist who did field work in indonesia and india . he is probably best known as one of the architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis , which he popularised in germany . his work on the evolution of geographically isolated populations , and on evolution above the species level , contributed to the modern synthesis . he also worked extensively on animal behavior ( ethology ) . rensch 's education and scientific work was interrupted by service in the german military during both world war i and world war ii . his autobiography , published later in life , translates as 'life of a biologist in a turbulent century ' . in 1929 he published a classic book on species and speciation in which he proposed ideas which later were to become basic principles of taxonomy . he recognised the significance of moritz wagner 's idea of geographical species-splitting . in 1947 , rensch published `` neuere probleme der abstammungslehre : die transspezifische evolution '' . this looked at how the evolutionary mechanisms involved in speciation might be extended to explain the origins of the differences between the higher level taxa . his work contributed to the rapid acceptance of the synthesis in germany .
