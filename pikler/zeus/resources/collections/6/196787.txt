Albania veneta     albania veneta ( english : `` venetian albania '' ) was the name for the possessions of the republic of venice in southern dalmatia from 1420 to 1797. it originally covered the coastal area of what is now northern albania and the coast of montenegro , but the albanian and southern montenegrin parts were lost to the ottomans in 1571. the word `` veneta '' in `` albania veneta '' was used to differentiate the area from the ottoman albania ( called `` albania ottomana '' in those centuries ) , an area stretching from kosovo to southern albania . these venetian possessions stretched from the southern borders of the `` republic of ragusa '' ( modern-day dubrovnik ) to durazzo ( durrÃ«s ) in coastal albania . the venetian territories never reached more than 20 km from the adriatic sea . after 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of confin ( kufin ) near budua ( budva ) , because of the ottoman conquests of antivari ( bar ) , and dulcigno ( ulcinj ) in the balkans . the dominions of venice were centered around the `` bocche di cattaro '' ( bay of kotor ) and included the small cities of cattaro ( kotor ) , risano ( risan ) , perasto ( perast ) , teodo ( tivat ) , castelnuovo ( herceg novi ) , budua ( budva ) and spizza ( sutomore ) .
