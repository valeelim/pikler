Foraging     foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food . for example , cattle forage grass to eat . the idea of animals foraging is called `` forage theory '' , and was first proposed in 1966. humans that forage are often called hunter-gatherers , who find and eat ( wild ) animals and plants without domestication of them ( people who farm plants are not hunter-gatherers , as they have grown them themselves ) .
