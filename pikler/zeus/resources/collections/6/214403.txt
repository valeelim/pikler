Chromatid     chromatids are the daughter strands of a duplicated chromosome which are joined by a single centromere . when the centromere divides , the chromatids become separate chromosomes . each of the two daughter chromatids contains the same dna and chromatin protein as its original chromosome . but in meiosis , crossing over ( exchanges ) take place between two of the non-sister chromatids . this has profound consequences : it produces genetic recombination , and increases the variability of gametes .
