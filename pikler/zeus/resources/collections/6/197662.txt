Star cluster     a star cluster is a group of stars . they are held together by the gravitational attraction of the stars , which are all related through common origin . there are two major types of clusters : 1. open star clusters . open clusters are loose , and they have less than a few hundred stars , which are often very young . a famous star cluster is the pleiades , which is an open cluster . 1. globular clusters . globular clusters are tight groups of hundreds and thousands of stars . every large galaxy has hundreds or thousands of globulars revolving round it at great distances , usually outside the disk of the galaxy . super star clusters of very young large stars are known . they are thought to be precursors of globular clusters . the short-lived huge blue stars emit lots of uv radiation which ionises the surrounding gas . examples are westerlund 1 and 2 in the milky way , and r136 in the larger magellanic cloud .
