WWE European Championship     the wwe european championship is a former championship for world wrestling entertainment . it was first established as the 'wwf european championship ' . the first and longest reigning champion , the british bulldog became the first champion after winning a tournament that was held over several shows in germany , culminating in a finals victory over owen hart . when shawn michaels won the belt , it made him the first grand slam champion in wwe . michaels was and still is the only wrestler to have held both the wwf championship and the european title at the same time . the title was on a brief hiatus in 1999 due to then-champion shane mcmahon 's wanting to retire an `` undefeated champion '' . the wwe european championship was retired in a ladder match on july 22 , 2002 when rob van dam put his wwe intercontinental championship on the line , along with jeff hardy 's european championship in a winner-take-all type match . when rvd won the match he merged the two titles together , and continued to hold the intercontinental title . rvd 's title reign is not listed in the official european title history on wwe 's official website , and therefore he is not credited with being a eurocontinental champion , but is mentioned in rvd 's profile .
