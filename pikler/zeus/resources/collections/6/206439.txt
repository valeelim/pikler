Solar panel     solar panels get energy from the sun for people to use . there are two types of solar panels , those that collect heat ( thermal ) , and those that produce electricity ( photovoltaic ) . heat from solar panels is often used for space heating and for hot water . solar panels collect renewable energy . in the 20th century some used the heat of the sun to make steam for a steam engine to turn a generator . nowadays producing electricity from the sun 's light is cheaper . this is a solid state way of producing electricity , meaning that it has no moving parts . solar panels are often mounted on rooftops . commercial or industrial installations are often on trackers mounted on the ground . the trackers point the panel towards the sun as the sun moves across the sky . solar panels are also commonly used in outer space , where they are one of the few power sources available . solar panels for heat are usually made from a box with a clear window on top . pipes run through the box . the pipes and the box are usually painted black because black absorbs more heat than other colors . the pipes are filled with a heat transfer fluid such as water or oil . a pump circulates the fluid , which heats up as it is exposed to the sun . when the hot fluid leaves the panel , it goes into a heat exchanger , which transfers the heat into water or air . after the now cool fluid leaves the heat exchanger , it is pumped back up into the panel to collect heat again .
