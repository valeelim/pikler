Permian     the permian is a geological period which started about 299 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended about 252 mya . it is the last period of the paleozoic era , and ended in the largest mass extinction known to science . data . - oxygen content of atmosphere : 23 % ( 115 % of modern level ) . - average co content : 900 ppm ( 3 times pre-industrial level ) - average surface temperature : ~16c ( 2c above modern level ) - sea level : 60 metres above present day level ; plummeting during the middle permian to a constant minus 20 m in the late permian . the climate in the permian was quite varied . at the start of the permian , the earth was still at the grip of an ice age from the carboniferous . glaciers receded around the mid-permian period as the climate gradually warmed , drying the continent 's interiors . in the late permian period , the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles . during the permian tetrapod life , ( amphibians , sauropsids and synapsids ) which evolved in the carboniferous , became widespread and diverse . the first modern trees ( conifers , ginkgos and cycads ) appeared in the permian .
