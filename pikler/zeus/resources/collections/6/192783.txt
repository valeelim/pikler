Alaskan Klee Kai     the alaskan klee kai is a northern breed of dog of the spitz type . the term `` klee kai '' was derived from alaskan athabaskan ( eskimo ) words meaning `` small dog '' . the breed was developed to create a pet sized version of the alaskan husky , but it more closely resembles the siberian husky . this result makes it an energetic , intelligent , apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage . these dogs can come in a variety of different coat colors : black and white , gray and white , red and white and all white . they have a double coat , which means it is thicker . in 1997 , the united kennel club recognized the alaskan klee kai . it is a rare breed with not very many dogs . other websites . - dog breed info.com
