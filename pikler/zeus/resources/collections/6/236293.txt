Emperor Kōshō     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that kōshō ruled from the palace of `` ikekokoro-no-miya '' at waki-no-kami in what will come to be known as yamato province . kōshō is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes kōshō as the fourth of . emperor kōshō was the oldest son of emperor itoku . `` jinnō shōtōki '' records that his mother was amanotoyototsu-hime , and his grandmother by his mother 's side was okishimimi-no-kami . the absence of information about kōshō does not show that he was not real . very little information is available for study before the rule of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei ( 509 ? -571 ) . this emperor 's official name after his death ( his posthumous name ) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to kōshō .
