Photorespiration     photorespiration , or `` 'photo-respiration ' '' , is a process in plant metabolism . a sugar has oxygen added to it by the enzyme ( rubisco ) , instead of carbon dioxide during normal photosynthesis . this process reduces efficiency of photosynthesis . photorespiration can occur when carbon dioxide levels are low , for example , when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during drought . in most plants , photorespiration increases as temperature increases . photorespiration produces no atp and leads to a net loss of carbon and nitrogen ( as ammonia ) , slowing plant growth .
