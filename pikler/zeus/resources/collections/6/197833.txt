Main sequence     the main sequence is a region on a hertzsprung-russell diagram where most stars appear . any star that is plotted within that area is a main-sequence star . the sun is a main-sequence star . most of the stars in the milky way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main-sequence stars . hertzsprung-russell diagrams are graphs that measure each star 's brightness against its temperature or color . the main sequence appears as a band going from the upper-left ( hot and bright ) to the lower-right ( cooler and less bright ) . you can see an example of the band of main-sequence stars to the right . stars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence . they stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years . when a star begins to run out of fuel , it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant . after this happens , the star is no longer on the main sequence . in general , the hottest and brightest stars ( in the upper-left of the hertzsprung-russell diagram ) also have the most mass . the main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts . any star that has a mass greater than 1.5 times the sun 's mass is grouped into the `` upper main sequence '' ; any star with a mass lower than 1.5 solar masses belongs to the `` lower main sequence '' .
