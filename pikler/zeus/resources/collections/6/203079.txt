Adriaen Coorte     adriaen coorte ( about 1665 â€“ 1707 ) was a dutch painter . he mainly painted 'still life ' . he signed works between 1683 and 1707. most of his paintings are small . his style is typical of dutch 17th century still life painting . other dutch painters who lived at the same time had a different style of painting . coorte was `` one of the last practitioners of this intimate category '' . very little is known about his life . he was probably born in middelburg and also died there . he became a pupil of melchior d'hondecoeter around 1680 in amsterdam . from 1683 he seems to have returned to middelburg , where he set up a workshop and signed his small , carefully balanced minimalist still lifes . he often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel . about 80 signed works by him have been catalogued , and nearly all of them follow the same pattern ; small arrangements of fruits , vegetables , or shells on a stone slab , lit from above , with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century . instead of the chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries , his tableware is very basic pottery . `` objects and light are studied intensely , and are painted with a wondrous tenderness '' . neither his birth nor death date is certain , and archival evidence only exists in middelburg for his membership in the guild of st. luke there from 1695 onwards , when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild . his works appear frequently in contemporary middelburg taxation inventories
