Digital media     digital media ( compared to analog media ) is electronic media that works on digital codes . today , computing is based on the binary numeral system , so the `` digital '' refers to the use of `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' to show data . computers are machines that use binary digital data as information . digital media ( `` formats for presenting information '' according to media ) like digital audio , digital video and other digital `` content '' can be created , referred to and distributed by digital information processing machines . digital media is a big change from ( analog ) media . the transformation of an analog signal to digital information by an analog-to-digital converter is called sampling . according to information theory , sampling is a reduction of information . most digital media are based on turning analog data into digital data and vice-versa ( see digital recording , digital video , television versus digital television ) . compared to analog data , digital data is easier to control and can be made into many copies without losing any quality . mathematical operations can be made of digital information regardless of its meaning ( you can add `` 2 '' to the data `` 65 '' and view the result either as the hexadecimal number `` 43 '' or the letter `` c '' ) . thus , it is possible to use the same compression operation onto a text file or an image file or a sound file .
