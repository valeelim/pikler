Pluto     pluto is a dwarf planet in the solar system . its formal name is 134340 pluto . the dwarf planet is the ninth-largest body that moves around the sun . at first , pluto was called a planet . now , it is the largest body in the kuiper belt . like other members of the kuiper belt , pluto is mainly made of rock and ice . it is quite small . it is about a fifth ( ⅕ ) of the weight of the earth 's moon . it is only a third ( ⅓ ) its volume . it has an odd orbit and this orbit is very sloped . it takes pluto to 30 to 49 au ( 4.4–7.4 billion km ) from the sun . this causes pluto to sometimes go closer to the sun than neptune . since it was discovered in 1930 , pluto was thought to be the solar system 's ninth planet . in the late 1970s , the minor planet 2060 chiron was found and people learned that pluto had a small size . later , in the early 21st century , the scattered disc object eris and other objects like pluto were discovered . eris was initially believed to be 27 % larger than pluto , but was later found to be slightly smaller . on august 24 , 2006 , the international astronomical union ( iau ) gave a definition to the word `` planet '' for the first time . by this definition , pluto was not a planet anymore . it became a `` dwarf planet '' along with eris and ceres . after this , pluto was put on the list of minor planets . it was given the number 134340. a number of scientists continue to hold that pluto should be classified as a planet .
