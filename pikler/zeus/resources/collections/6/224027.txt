Alveolus     an alveolus ( plural : alveoli ) is a word used in anatomy for hollow cavities , which are empty areas within a body . although there are many different types of alveoli in the body , the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacks in the lungs of mammals . these are also called `` pulmonary alveoli '' . these alveoli are located at the ends of the air passageways in the lungs . they have very thin ( one cell thick ) , wet walls and are surrounded with a network of small blood vessels , or capillaries . this allows gases to diffuse , or move across , the surface of the alveolus . when a mammal breathes in , the concentration of oxygen is higher in the alveolus than in the red blood cells . therefore , oxygen leaves the alveolus and enters the red blood cells . when a mammal breathes out , the opposite happens . the concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells , so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells , enters the alveolus , and is exhaled . in an average human lung , there are 480 million alveoli . their total surface area is around 75 square meters .
