Whip (instrument)    whip ( instrument ) in music , a whip or slapstick is a percussion instrument . it consists of two pieces of wood joined by a hinge . the pieces of wood are slapped together . this makes a noise like a whip . there is a handle on each of the pieces of wood so that the player can hold it and slap them together without trapping his fingers . the whip is often heard in modern orchestras , bands and percussion groups . examples of a whip in classical music can be heard near the beginning of ravel 's `` piano concerto '' ( 3rd movement ) , and in britten 's `` young person 's guide to the orchestra '' . there is another type of whip , in which one plank is longer than the other . it can be played with one hand . the player shakes the instrument quickly and the small plank moves away from the large one , then slaps back onto it . it makes a different kind of sound from the whip , and is properly called a slapstick . it has been used by several composers including mahler , richard strauss , ravel , mussorgsky and hindemith . the first whip was designed in the 14th century .
