Genetic linkage     genetic linkage occurs when alleles at different loci do not segregate at random . mendel 's second law is thus broken . genes are linked when they are on the same chromosome . they then tend to stay together during meiosis . alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked , due to independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis . there is some crossing over of dna during meiosis when the chromosomes segregate . so , alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells . there is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apart on the chromosome , as it is more likely that a cross-over will occur between them . the relative distance between two genes can be calculated using the offspring of an organism showing two linked genetic traits . the percentage of offspring where the two traits do not run together is noted . the higher the percentage of offspring showing both traits , the closer on the chromosome the two genes are .
