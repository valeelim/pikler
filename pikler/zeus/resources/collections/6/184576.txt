Bengali people     the bengali people are the main ethnic group in the region of bengal ( now divided between bangladesh and the union of india ) in south asia . they speak bengali ( বাংলা bangla ) , a language of the eastern branch of the indo-aryan languages . they are natively concentrated in the nation of bangladesh and in the indian states of west bengal and tripura . some of the most well established bengali communities are in the middle east , japan , malaysia , united kingdom and united states . remnants of civilisation in the greater bengal region date back 4,000 years , when the region was settled by dravidian , tibeto-burman and austroasiatic peoples . the origin of the word `` bangla ~ bengal '' is unknown , but it is believed to be derived from the dravidian-speaking tribe `` bang '' that settled in the area around the year 1000 bc . after the arrival of indo-aryans , the kingdoms around bengal were first described in the `` atharvaveda '' about 1000 bc . from the 6th century bc , magadha expanded to include most of the bihar and bengal regions . it was one of the four main kingdoms of india at the time of buddha . magadha extended over nearly all of south asia , including parts of persia and afghanistan , reaching its greatest extent under the buddhist emperor ashoka the great in the 3rd century bc . one of the earliest foreign references to bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king xandrammes named gangaridai by the greeks around 100 bc . the word is speculated to have come from `` gangahrd '' ( land with the ganges in its heart ) in reference to an area in bengal . later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries ad , the kingdom of magadha served as the seat of the gupta empire .
