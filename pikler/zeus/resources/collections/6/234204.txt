Pázmánd     pázmánd is in the easternmost part of velencei hills , at the foot of zsidó hill ( 202m ) . archaeological artefacts prove that the village was already been populated the in iron age . the name of the village comes from the period when the state was founded ; the area was probably awarded as a gift to knight pázmány to function as a summer residence . little is known about the history of the settlement in the middle ages . one thing is sure : when the turks were expelled from hungary the fleeing troops slaughtered the families living here , destroyed the romanesque church and set the village on fire . at the beginning of the 18 century tót people ( slovakians ) were settled in the area , the village was even called tót-pázmánd for some time . the inhabitants of the village declared themselves hungarians already in the 19 century but their slovakian roots are still noticeable in their conventions ( sibálás - easter lashing ) . other website . - pázmánd.hu
