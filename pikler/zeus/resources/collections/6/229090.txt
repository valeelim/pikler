Holodomor     the holodomor ( , which means `` murder by hunger '' ) was a man-made famine and possibly a genocide that happened in ukraine in 1932 and in 1933. at that time , ukraine was a part of the soviet union . about seven million people starved to death in the holodomor . joseph stalin was the leader and dictator of the soviet union , which was a communist country . he made farmers in the soviet union change the way they farmed , then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the government-owned farms , for less money . many people in the ukraine did not want to go along with this . when the ukraine had a famine , stalin refused to help the people in the ukraine . instead , the government took food away from people . it became illegal ( against the law ) to pick up food from the ground of fields . the government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food . scholars and politicians using the word holodomor say the man-made aspects of the famine , was a genocide ; some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the holocaust . they argue that the soviet policies were an attack on the rise of ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide .
