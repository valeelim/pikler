Placozoa     the placozoa are an animal phylum , a primitive form of invertebrate . they are the simplest in structure of all metazoa . the placozoa is usually considered to have only one species , trichoplax adhaerens , but there is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple , morphologically similar species . although they were first discovered in 1883 , a common name does not exist for the taxon . the scientific name literally means `` flat animals '' . `` trichoplax '' is a small , flattened , animal around a millimetre across . like an amoeba , it has no regular outline , although the upper surface is always flattened . the body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells . the epithelial cells bear flagella , which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor . between these layers is the fiber syncytium , a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers . `` trichoplax '' feed by absorbing food particles—mainly microbes—with their underside . they generally reproduce asexually , by dividing or budding , but can also reproduce sexually . though `` trichoplax '' has a small genome in comparison to other animals , nearly 87 % of its 11,514 protein-coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals .
