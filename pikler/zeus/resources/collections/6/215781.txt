Antoine Lavoisier     antoine-laurent de lavoisier ( 26 august 1743 – 8 may 1794 ) was a french nobleman , chemist and biologist . he is often called the `` father of modern chemistry '' . his work is an important part of the histories of chemistry and biology . it also contributed to the beginnings of atomic theory . he was the first scientist to recognise and name the elements hydrogen and oxygen . he was executed , as were hundreds of other nobles , during the french revolution . antoine de lavoisier began studying at the collège mazarin in paris in 1754 , when he was 11 years old . this was one of the best secondary schools in france then . he studied to be a lawyer like his father and his grandfather . he got his degree in 1763 and practised law at the parliament . but he really preferred scientific research to law . so he also studied chemistry , botany , astronomy , and mathematics . he got his law degree in 1763 , but never practised as a lawyer . he started a career as a scientist instead . during his career , lavoisier brought major changes to the study of chemistry . much of his research was done on combustion . he is the person who explained combustion by oxidation . to prove this , lavoisier studied the air . in order to do this , in 1776 , he burned mercury in an enclosed vase . his conclusion : the air is a combination of oxygen and is not a chemical element .
