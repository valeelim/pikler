Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing     orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is a technology related to frequency division multiplexing . with it , many different signals can be sent over the same medium , at the same time . each signal uses a different basis function . by using the basis function given , the sender and recipient will then see `` their '' signal better , the other signals will be clearly separated . advantages and disadvantages . advantages . - can adapt easily to bad channels ( noisy , etc . ) - robust against crosstalk between channels that are close together . - robust against intersymbol interference ( isi ) and fading caused by multipath propagation - high spectral efficiency - there are good implementations available - few problems with errors that come from time synchornization - tuned sub-channel receiver filters are not required ( unlike conventional fdm ) - facilitates single frequency networks , `` i.e . '' transmitter macrodiversity . disadvantages . - problems with doppler shift .
