IMSAI 8080     the imsai 8080 was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975 , based on the intel 8080 and later 8085 and the s-100 bus . it was compatible with its main competitor , the earlier mits altair 8800 , by which it was inspired . the imsai is largely thought of as the first `` clone '' computer . the imsai machine used a highly modified version of the cp/m operating system called imdos . it was designed , made and sold by ims associates , inc. ( later renamed `` imsai manufacturing corp '' ) . in total , between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978. in may 1972 , william millard began business as `` ims associates '' ( ims ) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering , using his home as an office . by 1973 , millard began ims associates , inc. millard soon found capital for his business , and received several contracts , all for software . in 1974 , ims was contacted by a client which wanted a `` workstation system '' that could do jobs for any general motors new-car dealership . ims planned a system including a terminal , small computer , printer , and special software . five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk , which would be controlled by a small computer . eventually product development was stopped . millard and his chief engineer joe killian turned to the microprocessor . intel had the 8080 chip , and compared to the 4004 to which ims associates had first used , the 8080 looked like a better idea . full scale development of the imsai 8080 was begun , and by october 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine `` popular electronics '' , receiving positive reactions .
