Janeite     the word janeite has been used by people who love the works of jane austen . however , it can also be used to show disapproval . claudia johnson says that `` janeitism '' is `` the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm ( love ) for 'jane ' and every detail relative to her ( about her ) '' . janeitism did not begin until after j. e. austen-leigh published `` a memoir of jane austen '' in 1870. when this was published , jane austen became much more popular . this worried the literary elite . they felt they had to separate their liking of austen from the `` masses '' . the word `` janeite '' was first begun by the literary scholar george saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of `` pride and prejudice '' . austen scholar deidre lynch explains , `` he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly ( triumphantly , happily ) pin '' . in the early twentieth century , janeitism was `` principally ( mostly ) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers , professors , and literati '' . rudyard kipling even printed a short story called `` janeites '' about a group of world war i soldiers who were fans of austen 's novels .
