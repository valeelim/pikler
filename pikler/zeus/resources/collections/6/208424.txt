Daubechies wavelet     daubechies wavelets are a family of orthogonal wavelets named after belgian physicist and mathematician ingrid daubechies . they are used in discrete wavelet transform . scale function coefficients ( low pass filter in orthogonal filter banks ) must satisfy following conditions ( formula_1 is length of filter ) . - normalization which implies - orthogonality - vanishing moments there is more than one solution ( except case of formula_12 ) . however , it is necessary to distinguish between low pass and high pass filter . wavelets are denoted like d '' x '' , where `` x '' is either number of coefficients ( formula_1 ) or number of vanishing moments ( formula_14 ) . first case of notation ( number of coefficients ) is more recent and more frequented ( e.g . d8 is wavelet with 8 coefficients ) . matlab code for enumeration of wavelet with 4 coefficients ( denoted as d4 ) . solutions ( low pass filters only ) : related pages . - wavelet transform - quadrature mirror filter
