Sea spider     sea spiders are marine arthropods of the class pycnogonida . there are about 1,300 species of sea spiders , which are found around the world . sea spiders are found in all oceans , including the mediterranean sea , caribbean sea , and the arctic ocean . species found in coastal waters are usually small and have a leg span of about 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) , those living at great depths , up to 24 inches ( 60 cm ) . sea spiders are not true spiders , or even arachnids . their traditional classification as chelicerates would put them closer to true spiders than to other well-known arthropod groups , such as insects or crustaceans . however , recent genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods . the sea spider has a small , narrow body . it usually has four pairs of long , thin legs attached to the abdomen . attached to the head there are usually three other pairs of appendagesâ€”a pair called chelicerae , used for grasping food ; a pair of sensory projections called palps ; and a pair of egg-carrying legs ( sometimes underdeveloped or absent in the female ) . the female lays round masses of eggs on the egg-carrying legs of the male , which carries the eggs until they hatch .
