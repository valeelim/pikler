Earmuffs     earmuffs are that are made to cover and protect a person 's ears . a plastic or metal band fits over the top of the head , and there are two pads at the ends that cover the ears warmly . chester greenwood invented the earmuffs when he was 15. his ears would turn into unusual colors like red , white , purple , or blue and begin to hurt when it was cold ( he lived in maine ) . because of this , he could not try the new ice skates he got for his fifteenth birthday . chester had tried wrapping a scarf around his head , but it was too bulky . so chester twisted some wire so that it went across the top of his head , and made a loop on each end near his ears . then he asked his grandmother to sew some material on the end of each loop . she put black velvet on the inside of the ears , and beaver fur on the outside of each loop , then sewed the wire across chester 's hat to make it stay.soon lots of people in his town wanted ear warmers like chester 's , and he opened a factory when he was 19 to make them . each year , his home town ( farmington ) celebrates his invention with a parade on `` chester greenwood day .
