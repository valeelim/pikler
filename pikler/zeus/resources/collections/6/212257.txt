Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire    étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire ( 15 april 1772 – 19 june 1844 ) was a french naturalist who established the principle of `` unity of composition '' . he was a colleague of jean-baptiste lamarck and believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the change of species in time . he collected evidence for his claims in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology . geoffroy was a deist , which is to say that he believed in a god , but also in a law-like universe , with no supernatural interference in the details of existence . this kind of opinion was common in the enlightenment , and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles , and does not interpret the bible as the literal word of god . geoffroy 's theory was not a theory of common descent , but a working-out of existing potential in a given type . for him , the environment causes a direct induction of organic change . this opinion ernst mayr labels as 'geoffroyism ' . it is definitely not what lamarck believed ( for lamarck , a change in `` habits '' is what changes the animal ) . the `` direct '' effect of environment is not believed today by any main-stream evolutionist ; even sir william lawrence knew by 1816 that climate does not directly cause the differences between human races .
