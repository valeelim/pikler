Seven-arm octopus     the seven-arm octopus ( `` haliphron atlanticus '' ) , also known as the septopus or the heptopus , is claimed to be the largest octopus . the claim is based on a partial specimen , and the estimation is of a 4 metre length and a weight of 75 kg . the north pacific giant octopus is its rival in size . in 2002 , a single specimen of giant proportions was caught by fisheries trawling off the eastern chatham rise , new zealand . this specimen , the largest of this species and of all octopuses , was the first validated record of haliphron from the south pacific . it had a mantle length of 0.69 m , total length of 2.90 m , and weight of 61.0 kg , although it was incomplete . the seven-arm octopus gets its name because the male 's hectocotylus ( a specially modified arm used in egg fertilization ) is coiled in a sac beneath the right eye .
