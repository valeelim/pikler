Lock (water transport)    lock ( water transport ) a lock is a place where boats that are travelling up or down a river or canal can be raised higher or lower . locks are built in places where the level of the water in the river or canal suddenly changes . this may be because there is a waterfall there , or because a dam or a weir has been built , or because there is some other thing in the way . the lock is like a big chamber with gates at each end . they have lock gears which empty or fill the chamber with water . locks help a river to be more easily navigable ( easier for boats to travel up and down ) , or for canals to be built across country that is not level . if a boat that is travelling downstream ( in the same direction that the water is flowing ) arrives at a lock , this is what happens : - the boat waits until the lock is full of water . if a boat going the other way has just come out of the lock , the water level will be right and the gates will be open . this will save time . - the entrance gates ( if shut ) are opened and the boat sails in .
