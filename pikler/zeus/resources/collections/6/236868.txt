Chess and computers     chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer . in the 19th century charles babbage had thought of the idea , and in modern times alan turing , the mathematician and bletchley park codebreaker , put some thought into the idea . he was not a very good chess player , but was one of the creators of the first british computer . he is also credited with the creation of computer science . there are two types of chess programs . one plays against a human opponent ; the other helps the user become a better player . the two types can be made to work together , though they have different functions and work in different ways . chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents . many have been created ; they can play at master level , though their processes are quite different from those of a human being. < ref name= '' h/w '' > hooper d. and whyld k. 1992 . `` the oxford companion to chess '' . 2nd ed , oxford university press. < /ref > the best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both kasparov and kramnik , but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner .
