Shale     shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock formed from mud . the mud is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments ( silt-sized particles ) of other minerals , especially quartz and calcite . the ratio of clay to other minerals is variable . shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness , called `` fissility '' ( = ~splitting ) . mudstones , on the other hand , are similar in composition but do not show the fissility . shales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks . however , this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale . black shales form in anoxic ( without oxygen ) conditions . they contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite . this produces the black colouration . shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits , in river deltas , on floodplains and offshore from beach sands . they can also be deposited on the continental shelf , in relatively deep , quiet water . this process could have taken millions of years to complete .
