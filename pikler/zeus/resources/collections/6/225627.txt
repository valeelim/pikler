Korean magpie     the korean magpie '' pica ( pica ) sericea '' is a subspecies , or perhaps species , of east asian magpie . it is a common symbol of korea , and has been adopted as the `` official bird '' of many south korean cities and counties . it is similar to the european magpie , with a shorter tail and longer wings . it has black and purple colors , but very little green . the korean magpie has the same chattering call as european magpies , though it is much softer . koreans believed that magpies delivered good news , and when they saw a magpie chattering , they believed that visitors were coming.the most famous painting related to a magpie is the one with striped tiger ( ggach'i wha horangi minhwa ) : the magpie is chirping to a tiger . the magpie represented good news and the tiger symbolized good luck , since its pronunciation in chinese sounds similar to good luck ( bok ) . there are many folktales about magpies . the chinese called magpies `` birds of joy '' or `` happy magpies '' . under the manchu dynasty it also represented imperial rule : a few manchu people in northeast china even thought they were gods . in the west , though , magpies were often a symbol of pride .
