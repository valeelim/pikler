Three Forms of Unity     the three forms of unity is the name that is given to the belgic confession , the canons of dort , and the heidelberg catechism . these three works are about the doctrinal concerns of continental calvinism . they are considered official statements of church doctrine by many of the reformed churches . from 1618 to 1619 , the dutch government , acting for the dutch reformed church , called a series of meetings that would come to be called the synod of dort . members from the netherlands and twenty-seven members from eight other countries met at this synod to discuss and come to an agreement on their views . this agreement is known as the `` canons of dort . '' this meeting then added the canons of dort to two other documents , the belgic confession and the heidelberg catechism . those were both commonly used by the dutch church at this time . the reasons that they chose to do this were : 1. to put in writing their understanding of the biblical teachings on the trinity , the incarnation of jesus , predestination , justification , and the church ,
