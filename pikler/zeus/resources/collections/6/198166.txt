History of the Earth     the history of the earth describes the most important events and fundamental stages in the development of the planet earth from its formation to the present day . the age of the earth is about 4.56 billion years . nearly all branches of science have helped us understand the main events of the earth 's past . the earth is about one third the age of the universe . the formation of earth occurred as part of the formation of the solar system . it started as a large rotating cloud of dust and gas . this cloud , the solar nebula , was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang , as well as heavier elements produced in supernovas . then , about 4.68Ã—10 years ago , the solar nebula began to contract , rotate and gain angular momentum . this may have been triggered by a star in the region exploding as a supernova , and sending a shock wave through the solar nebula . as the cloud rotated , it became a flat disc perpendicular to its axis of rotation . most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up . meanwhile , the rest of the disc began to break up into rings , with gravity causing matter to condense around dust particles . small fragments collided to become larger fragments , including one collection about 150 million kilometers from the center : this would become the earth . as the sun condensed and heated , nuclear fusion started , and the solar wind cleared out most of the material in the disc , which had not yet condensed , into larger bodies .
