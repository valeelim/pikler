Seabird     seabirds are birds that have adapted so they are better able to live at sea or near it . many seabirds live `` at sea '' , that is , far away from land . they may only come on land to breed . other seabirds live in colonies on islands . very often , seabirds use the sea for food , most often fish or shellfish . the first seabirds evolved in the cretaceous period , and modern seabird families first appeared in the palaeogene . the similarities between them are examples of convergent evolution . the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations . seabirds share a number of adaptations to sea life . they live longer , breed later and have fewer young than other birds . they do spend a great deal of time with their young . most species nest in colonies . these vary from a few dozen birds to millions . many species take long annual migrations every year , crossing the equator or circumnavigating the earth in some cases . they feed both at the ocean 's surface and below it , and even feed on each other . seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea .
