Endemism     endemism is an ecological word meaning that a plant or animal lives only in a particular location , such as a specific island , habitat type , nation or other defined zone . for example , many species of lemur are endemic to the island of madagascar . there are two types of endemism - paleoendemism and neoendemism . `` paleoendemism '' means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area . `` neoendemism '' means that a species has recently appeared which is closely related to the main species or one that has formed following hybridization and is now classified as a separate species . this is a common process in plants especially those which exhibit polyploidy . the opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution . endemic types are most likely to develop on islands because they are isolated . this includes remote island groups , like the hawaiian islands , the gal√°pagos islands , and socotra . endemism can also occur in areas which are separated from other similar areas like the highlands of ethiopia , or large bodies of water like lake baikal .
