Phanerozoic     the phanerozoic eon is the current eon on the geologic timescale . it is the one in which abundant animal life has existed . it covers about 541 million years , and goes back to the time when hard-shelled animals first appeared . it was once thought that life began in the cambrian , the first period of this eon . the time before the phanerozoic , formerly called the `` precambrian '' , is now divided into the hadean , archaean and proterozoic eons . the exact time of the boundary between the phanerozoic and the proterozoic is slightly uncertain . in the 19th century , the boundary was set at the first abundant metazoan fossils . but several hundred kinds of proterozoic metazoa have been discovered in the ediacaran . study of the ediacaran biota started in the 1950s . there are three dividing points at the proterozoic-phanerozoic boundary . it might be where the first trilobites and archaeocyatha appear ; or at the first appearance of signs of burrowing ; or at the first appearance of the 'small shelly fauna ' . the three different dividing points are within a few million years of each other .
