Tertiary     the tertiary was an official geological period , but it is no longer used . it included the first part of the cainozoic . this is now divided into the palaeogene and the neogene . the previous use of the term `` tertiary '' explains why the last period of the cainozoic is called the quarternary . there was a big debate about that . these decisions are made by the international union of geological sciences ( iugs ) . this organisation runs an international commission on stratigraphy , which decides how we should name geological strata and stages . in 19th and 20th century scientific literature , tertiary is used where geologists now use palaeogene and neogene .
