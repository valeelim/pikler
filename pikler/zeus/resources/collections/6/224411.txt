Drosera     drosera , sometimes called sundews , are carnivorous plants . they use a thick gluey goo called `` mucilage '' to trap and digest their prey.the mucilage is attached to special hairs called trichomes . they are one of the most common carnivorous plants . they have at least 188 species . they are found everywhere in the world except antarctica . many sundews species usually live for two or more years . others live for only one year and reproduce by seed . some sundew species can live for 50 years . its scientific name is from the greek δρόσος : `` drosos '' = `` dew , dewdrops '' . its english name is `` sundew '' , from latin `` ros solis '' , meaning `` dew of the sun '' . both names describe the sweet-smelling , sticky ( goo ) that comes down the ends of on each flower . this mucilage rolls down the plant , attracting sugar-loving insects day and night . the mucilage has enzymes which digests them so that the plants can get the nitrogen it needs from it . like all plants , the sundew makes its own food , and just uses insects for nitrogen and other nutrients . these tiny flowering plants are about tall , about as tall as an adult 's hand , though some climbing sundews can be much taller . one species of sundew , the `` drosera erythrogyne '' , grew up to . sundew roots are not very strong . they are usually simply for taking in water and keeping the sundew firmly planted to the ground .
