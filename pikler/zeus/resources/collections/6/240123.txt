Optical character recognition     optical character recognition ( ocr ) is a method of automatic data entry . ocr software is used to convert handwritten , type-written or printed text into data that can be edited on a computer . in simple systems , the paper documents are scanned with an image scanner . the ocr software then looks at the image and compares the shapes of the letters to stored images of letters . in this way , it makes a text file that can be edited with a normal text editor . more complex systems look at images , layout and so on . this can make editable electronic versions which look identical to the original documents . ocr works best with clean , clearly printed materials . ocr-software . - adobe acrobat professional ( windows , mac os ) - bit-alpha ( windows ) - exactscan pro ( mac os ) - finereader ( unix , windows ) - ocrkit ( mac os ) - readiris ( unix , windows , mac os ) - nuance omnipage ( windows )
