Wiley's Well    wiley 's well wiley 's well is a remote , natural artesian well in the colorado desert of southern california . it is also the name of the area around it . it is named after palo verde storekeeper and postmaster a.p . wiley . in 1907 , mr. wiley dug deep into a shallow well dug in 1876 by a stagecoach company which used the nearby bradshaw trail . wiley made the well larger since he hoped that he could attract business to his remote desert store . the well was taken care of by local ranchers and cattlemen for years afterward . however , the rapidly falling level of the water meant a drop of the water 's depth to 60'/18m within a dozen years . today , the well 's original depth is only about 20'/6m at best after wet weather . the water in the well is not good for drinking . in 1985 , the bureau of land management drilled a new well 965'/294m deep to support the new wiley 's well campground , one of only two developed campgrounds in the mule mountains long-term visitor area . the water is both hot at 90 °f/32 °c and full of minerals . the water is pumped into a cistern to help cool it to drinking temperature .
