Haptophyte     haptophytes are a phylum of algae , sometimes called the prymnesiophyta . all or most of them are single-celled photosynthetic phytoplankton . the cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella and a unique organelle called a haptonema . this is superficially similar to a flagellum , but differs in its arrangement of microtubules , and in its use . the name comes from the greek `` hapsis '' = touch , and `` nema '' = thread . molecular and morphological evidence places them in five orders ; coccolithophores make up the `` isochrysidales '' and `` coccolithales '' . other groups include phytoplankton which produce the toxic algal blooms .
