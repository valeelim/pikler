Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird     the sr-71 blackbird is a supersonic reconnaissance aircraft . it was built by lockheed 's `` skunk works '' in the 1960s for the united states air force ( usaf ) . in other words , it was a spy plane . the blackbird was designed to fly at more than mach 3 â€“ three times the speed of sound . this meant it would become very hot during flight . to help with this , most of the aircraft was made of titanium . radar absorbing material was also used to make the aircraft more difficult to . sr-71 blackbird used a special fuel called jp-7 . before the flight , the fuel tanks used to leak . this is because at ground altitude the tolerances ( distance between parts of the fuel tank ) were larger than at the plane 's cruising altitude . once in the air , because of the speed and air resistance , the parts became very hot . because of this heat , the distance between the parts shrank stopping the loss of fuel . the aircraft also had cameras and radars fitted to take photographs of targets . the first blackbird flight happened on 22 december 1964 in palmdale , california . in january 1966 , the first aircraft entered service with the usaf . no aircraft were lost in war but one crashed in an accident in 1969. only 32 aircraft were built . its final flight was on 6 march 1990 , blackbird s/n 61-7972. the sr-71 program was retired from service in 1998 .
