Liquid crystal     liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid , but that show certain properties of a solid crystal . a liquid crystal ( lc ) may flow like a liquid , but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way . there are many different types of liquid crystal phases . different phases are different because their optical properties are different . using a microscope and a polarized light source , different liquid crystal phases will have different textures . this is also shown in the image . the contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the lc molecules are rotated in a different direction . within a domain , however , the molecules are well ordered . lc materials may not always be in an lc phase ( just as water is not always in the liquid phase : it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase ) .
