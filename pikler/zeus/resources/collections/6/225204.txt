Velvet worm     the velvet worms ( onychophora â€” literally `` claw bearers '' ) are a minor panarthropod phylum . there are two families and about 200 species . all living species live on land , in moist or wet tropical areas . the two living families are the peripatidae and the peripatopsidae . they show a peculiar distribution , with the peripatids being mainly equatorial and tropical , while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be gondwana . the segmented worm-like organisms have tiny eyes , `` fur '' , antennae , multiple pairs of legs , and , slime glands . the group is thought to be related to arthropods . they prey on smaller animals such as insects , which they catch by squirting a sticky slime . fossils from the early cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms . these fossils , known as the lobopods , were marine . they were a grade from which arthropods , tardigrades , and onychophora arose. < ref name= '' cite doi|10.1038/nature13576 '' > < /ref > they are found in the cambrian , ordovician ( possibly ) , silurian , and pennsylvanian periods .
