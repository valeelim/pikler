Credit default swap     a credit default swap ( or cds for short ) is a kind of investment where you pay someone so they will pay you if a certain company gives up on paying its bonds , or defaults . a credit default swap is like insurance on bonds , but different from insurance in important ways : - insurance companies make sure you own the thing you 're insuring , but you can buy credit default swaps for bonds you do n't own . - the government makes rules ( called regulations ) for insurance , but they do n't make any yet for credit default swaps . - insurance companies have to have enough money in case lots of people need to collect insurance at the same time . because there are n't many rules for cds sellers , they do n't have to be as careful . because nobody makes sure you have the bonds you get credit default swaps for , people can speculate on them by buying credit default swaps on companies they think will get in trouble . when lehman brothers went bankrupt on september 15 , 2008 , it defaulted on its bonds . the insurance company aig had sold lots of credit default swaps for lehman , but they did n't have enough money to pay all the people they had sold them to .
