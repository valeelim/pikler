Netley Hospital     netley hospital or the royal victoria hospital at netley was finished on 19 may 1856. the plans for its building began in 1853 , at the start of the crimean war . the medical department of the army was totally unprepared for the very large number of wounded soldiers being brought from the battles at places like the siege of sevastopol . it saw the first real involvement of florence nightingale . nightingale was a young and determined nurse , sent to scutari to care for the soldiers . she began to develop sanitation and hygiene properly . the boer wars in southern africa between 1880 and 1902 had a very high casualty rate for the british . more than 20 thousand dead and many who died from disease when they returned home . thousands of british soldiers brought back to netley were nearly far too many for the hospital , but others had been built by then and so they were able to deal with the number of troops . netley â€™ s role in world war one was very important in saving the lives of many troops . hundreds of wooden huts were built behind the site of the hospital , increasing the capacity of netley to some 5000 men . this was needed especially during the somme offensive and the battles at ypres .
