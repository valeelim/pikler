Development of the New Testament canon     the christian biblical canon is the set of books in the bible . although the early church mostly used the greek translation of the hebrew bible , the septuagint or the targums among aramaic speakers , the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new scriptures . however saint peter in his letters does refer to paul 's writings , saying : 'the longsuffering of our lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ; as also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do the other scriptures , unto their own destruction . ( 2 peter 3:15-16 ) the new testament as it is today was defined later by the church at the synod of hippo in 393 ad . other websites . - the new testament canon at 4truth - canon of the new testament at catholic encyclopaedia
