Sex determination     sex determination is a process of development by which the sex of an individual is settled . sex is a method of reproduction which is widespread among living things . it requires two individuals of the same species . usually the sexes are separate . sex may be determined in one of two ways : - genetically , by genes and chromosomes the organism inherits from its parents . - environmentally , by some outside agent acting as a trigger to development . where both sexes occur on the same individual , that individual is an hermaphrodite . hermaphrodite systems can be found in some animals , for example snails , and in most flowering plants . for many species sex is determined by environmental factors experienced during development . many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination . the temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism . in some turtles , for example , males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females ; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2 Â°c .
