Seal of Alabama     the great seal of the state of alabama is the state seal of the u.s. state of alabama . it was designed in 1817 by william wyatt bibb , the governor of the `` alabama territory '' and the subsequent first governor of the state . when alabama became a state in 1819 , the state got the design as the official state seal . the seal has a map showing one of the state 's most valuable resourcesâ€”its major rivers . bibb 's design served as the official seal until 1868 , when it was replaced by a design having on it an eagle holding in its beak a banner that read `` here we rest . '' the legislature and governor frank m. dixon restored bibb 's original design in 1939 , and it has remained unchanged since .
