Terminal velocity     terminal velocity is the speed when a falling object is no longer getting faster . terminal velocity happens at the moment in time that the force , because of gravity , called weight , is the same as the opposite force of air resistance or friction . in other words , terminal velocity is the point at which the velocity ( speed of change of the falling object ) is no longer getting greater . the gravitational force minus the force of drag ( or air resistance ) equals zero . an object continues to fall steadily until air resistance becomes so great that it equals with the pull of gravity and the object can fall no faster . besides weight , terminal velocity depends on other factors such as shape and cross sectional area . the terminal velocity of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth ( i.e. , face down ) position is about 195 km/h ( 122 mph or 54 m/s ) . this velocity is the limit of the acceleration process . the forces on the body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal velocity is approached . in this example , a speed of 50 % of terminal velocity is reached after only about 3 seconds , while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90 % , 15 seconds to reach 99 % and so on .
