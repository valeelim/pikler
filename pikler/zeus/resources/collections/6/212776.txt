Somatic cell     all the cells in the body of an organism are somatic cells , except for the haploid gametes ( sex cells like eggs and sperm ) and other cells involved in reproduction . somatic cells are usually diploid , except where there is polyploidy . either way , somatic cells have double the number of chromosomes that gametes in the same organism have . somatic cells divide by mitosis and make identical copies of themselves , while gametes are made when germ cells divide by meiosis . in humans , somatic cells have 46 chromosomes .
