Verismo     verismo is a word which refers to a type of literature and a type of opera that was popular towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century . the italian word `` verismo '' means `` realism '' . in literature the main verismo writers were the frenchman Ã©mile zola , the norwegian dramatist henrik ibsen and the italian writer giovanni verga . the composer pietro mascagni used a story by verga for his opera cavalleria rusticana . this was a short , one-act opera which became extremely popular . several composers were inspired by it and wrote similar works . the only one of these which is still regularly performed is `` pagliacci '' by ruggero leoncavallo . these two short operas are often performed on the same evening . they are known together as `` cav and pag '' . verismo operas are generally based on stories about ordinary people from the working classes rather than about kings or gods or aristocrats . there is often a lot of violence in the stories as people love one another with great passions , which often leads to murder . bizet 's opera `` carmen '' is typical of that kind of story , although it was composed before the verismo tradition was really popular .
