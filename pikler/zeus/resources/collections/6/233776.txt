A-flat major     a major or a-flat major is a major scale that starts on a-flat . its relative minor is f minor and its parallel minor is a-flat minor . this is a very peaceful key . it was used often by franz schubert . twenty-four of frédéric chopin 's piano pieces are in a-flat major , more than any other key . charles-marie widor considered a-flat major to be the second best key for flute music . beethoven chose a-flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his c minor works . this was also followed by antonín dvořák in his only c minor symphony and anton bruckner in his first two c minor symphonies . since a-flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral music of the 18th century , passages or movements in the key often kept the timpani tuned the same way as they were in the movement before it . for example , beethoven 's symphony no . 5 in c minor has the timpani set to c and g for the first movement . with hand-tuned timpani , there is no time to retune the timpani to a flat and e flat for the slow second movement in a flat . in bruckner 's symphony no . 1 in c minor , however , the timpani are retuned between the first movement in c minor and the following in a-flat major .
