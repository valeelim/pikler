Acritarch     acritarchs are early microfossils , the remains , probably , of eukaryote cells . it is the resistant single-layered cell walls , or perhaps a cover secreted by cell walls , that we see in early rocks of the proterozoic era . these structures are organic in their chemical composition , not calcium carbonate . their precise nature is not known , but they look like the resting stages of modern dinoflagellates ( the 'red tide ' organisms ) . acritarchs appear in quantity in organic-rich shales and siltstone strata 1.4 to 1.6 billion years old . they include a wide range of forms , so it is not clear whether or not they are monophyletic . at about 1 billion years ago they started to increase in abundance , diversity , and especially size and number of spines . their populations crashed during the cryogenian period 860 million years ago ( the snowball earth episodes ) . they proliferated in the cambrian explosion and reached their highest diversity in the palaeozoic . they survived at least until the ordovician period .
