National Capital Region     the national capital region is an official federal name for the canadian capital of ottawa , ontario , and neighbouring gatineau , quebec , and the area near them . the national capital region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of ontario and quebec . the area of the national capital region is almost the same as that of the ottawa-gatineau census metropolitan area , although the national capital region has a number of small neighbouring communities that are not contained within the cma . when all the communities are added , the population is 1,451,415. the national capital region is not a separate political jurisdiction , although the national capital commission is deeply involved in political , cultural , and land use planning matters in the national capital region . proposals have sometimes been made to separate the national capital region from its two respective provinces , and transform it into a separate capital district , like the district of columbia in the united states or the australian capital territory . such proposals have never come close to passage , and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option .
