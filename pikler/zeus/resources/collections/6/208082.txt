Wavelet     a wavelet is a mathematical function used to write down a function or signal in terms of other functions that are simpler to study . many signal processing tasks can be seen in terms of a wavelet transform . informally speaking , the signal can be seen under the lens with a magnification given by the scale of the wavelet . in doing so , we can see only the information that is determined by the shape of the wavelet used . the english term `` wavelet '' was introduced in the early 1980s by french physicists jean morlet and alex grossman . they used the french word `` ondelette '' ( which means `` small wave '' ) . later , this word was brought into english by translating `` onde '' into `` wave '' giving `` wavelet '' . wavelet is ( complex ) function from the hilbert space formula_1 . for practical applications it should satisfy following conditions . it must have finite energy . it must satisfy an admissibility condition . zero mean condition implies from admissibility condition . the function formula_5 is called mother wavelet . its translated ( shifted ) and dilated ( scaled ) normalized versions are defined as following .
