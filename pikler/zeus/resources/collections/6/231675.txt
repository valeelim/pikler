Geothermal energy     geothermal energy ( from the greek roots `` geo '' , meaning earth , and `` thermos '' , meaning heat ) is energy made by heat inside the earth 's crust . although the sun does heat the surface of the earth , heat from inside the earth is not caused by the sun . the geothermal energy of the earth 's crust comes 20 % from the original formation of the planet , and 80 % from the radioactive decay of minerals . the earth is hottest at its core and , from the core to the surface , the temperature gets gradually cooler . resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles or kilometers beneath the earth 's surface , and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma . it has been used for bathing from paleolithic times , but is now better known for making electricity . all over the world , geothermal energy has been used to make about 10 gigawatts of electricity in 2007 , and give 0.3 % of the electricity needed around the world . when used to generate electricity , geothermal power plants typically offer constant output .
