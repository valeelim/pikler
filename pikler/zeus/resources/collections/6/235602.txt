Japanese American internment     japanese american internment happened during world war ii , when the united states government forced about 110,000 japanese americans to leave their homes and live in internment camps . these were like prisons . many of the people who were sent to internment camps had been born in the united states and were citizens of the united states . on december 7 , 1941 , japan attacked pearl harbor in hawaii and declared war on the united states . many americans were angry , and some blamed all japanese people for what had happened at pearl harbor . they spread rumors that some japanese people knew about the attack ahead of time and had helped the japanese military . the fbi and other parts of the united states government knew that these rumors were not true , but did not say anything . japanese americans began to feel that other americans were becoming upset with them . for example , john hughes , a man who read the news on the radio in los angeles , california , spent about a month saying bad things about japanese americans . there were reports of businesses that had anti-japanese signs . for example , a barber shop put up a sign saying `` free shaves for japs '' and `` not responsible for accidents . '' a funeral home hung a sign saying `` i 'd rather do business with a jap than an american . ''
