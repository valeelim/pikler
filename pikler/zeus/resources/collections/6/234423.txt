Earthquake engineering     earthquake engineering is the study of the behavior of building structures subject to earthquake impacts . it is a subset of civil engineering . the main goals of earthquake engineering are : - understand what happens between buildings and the ground . - understand what strong earthquakes or tsunamis might do to building structures . - design , build and maintain structures to last during an earthquake while following building codes . a properly engineered structure does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive . the most powerful and affordable tools of earthquake engineering are vibration control technologies and , in particular , base isolation . to test seismic performance of a building structure with experiments , it is may be put on a shake-table that behaves like the earth shaking . the earliest shake-table experiments were performed more than a century ago tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused , mostly , by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for people 's safety and for tsunami protection of buildings and civil infrastructure . those waves can flood coastal areas , destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns .
