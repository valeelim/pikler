Line-item veto     a line-item veto is the power of the president ( or any leader of an executive branch ) to reject ( veto ) certain individual parts ( `` line items '' ) of a piece of legislation ( a bill ) without rejecting the whole thing . in the united states , almost all governors ( leaders of the u.s. states ) are able to use the line item veto . currently , the president of the united states is not able to use the line-item veto . president bill clinton was given the line-item veto by the united states congress for a few years until the supreme court said that it was unconstitutional people who like the line-item veto say that it is good because it allows the president to remove unimportant waste from important legislation . for example , it would be too dangerous to completely veto big pieces of legislation ( like the budget for the military or the budget for other government departments ) , but with the line-item veto , the president could choose to keep what he or she thinks are the good parts of the bill and reject the bad parts of the bill .
