Edaphosaurus     edaphosaurus was a pelycosaur ( early synapsida ) that lived during the later carboniferous and early permian . it was a herbivorous relative of the well-known `` dimetrodon '' . both had a large , thermal regulating sail on the back . fossils of `` edaphosaurus '' have been found in europe and north america . `` edaphosaurus '' species measured from to almost in length and weighed over 300 kilograms ( 660 lb ) . it was slightly taller and stockier than `` dimetrodon '' , but like its pelycosaur relatives had a small head and a long tail . the head of `` edaphosaurus '' was rather small for its body size . the deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the teeth along the front and sides of its jaws could crop bite-sized pieces from tough plants . the roof of the mouth and the inside of the lower jaw had batteries of peglike teeth . they were a crushing and grinding surface . early descriptions suggested that `` edaphosaurus '' fed on molluscs , which it crushed with its teeth plates . however , paleontologists now think that `` edaphosaurus '' ate plants . lack of wear on the teeth suggests `` limited processing of food '' . earlier members of the edaphosauridae lacked tooth plates , and ate insects .
