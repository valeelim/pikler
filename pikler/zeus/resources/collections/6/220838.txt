Mississippian     the mississippian is the first geological epoch in the carboniferous . it began about 359 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended 323 mya . the names mississippian and pennsylvanian are used in north america , because they suit the strata there . geologists from elsewhere mostly use simply 'carboniferous ' , or they use the official terms for stages , as defined by the international commission for stratigraphy . during the mississippian the sea level was high , and much of north america was invaded by a shallow sea . the strata consist mostly of a sequence of marine limestones .
