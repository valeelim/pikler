Interval (mathematics)    interval ( mathematics ) in mathematics , an interval is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end . numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval , and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval . the beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval . an example of an interval might be from 3.3 to 15. numbers such as 4 , 8 , 9.5 , 14 , and even 14.999 are inside this interval . numbers such as -4 , 2 , 3.2 , 20 , and 15.000001 are not inside this interval . to write an interval , write either a square bracket ( [ ) or a parenthesis ( ( ) , the beginning number , a comma ( , ) , the end number , and either a closing square bracket ( ] ) or a closing parenthesis ( ) ) . examples of intervals are ( 4 , 9.6 ) , [ -100 , 100 ] , [ -30 , -4 ) . intervals can be separated by how they act at their ends . intervals can be closed , open , or mixed . an interval that is closed also includes the beginning and the end . a closed interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include 3 , 5.4 , and every number between 3 and 5.4. to write a closed interval , use square brackets ( [ and ] ) . an example of an closed interval is [ 136 , 450 ] .
