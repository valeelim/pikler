Chromatin     chromatin is the complex combination of dna and proteins that makes up chromosomes . it is found inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells . chromatin is divided into heterochromatin ( condensed ) and euchromatin ( extended ) forms . heterochromatin is composed mostly of satellite dna tandem repeats . the active components of chromatin are dna and histone proteins , although other proteins also occur . the functions of chromatin are : - to package dna into a smaller volume to fit in the cell - to strengthen the dna to allow mitosis and meiosis - to control dna replication and gene expression . how this works is not yet clear . chromatin definitions . 1. simple and concise definition : chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a dna macromolecule and protein macromolecules ( and rna ) . the proteins package and arrange the dna and control its functions in the cell nucleus . 1. the `` dna + histone = chromatin '' definition : the dna double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones . the formed protein/dna complex is called chromatin . the basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome .
