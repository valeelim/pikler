Easter Rising     the easter rising was a rebellion in dublin , ireland at easter in 1916. it started on april 24 , 1916 and ended on april 29 , 1916. it was carried out by members of the irish republican brotherhood and members of the irish citizens army . it was done to protest against british rule in ireland . it was the first uprising in ireland since the 1798 rebellion . at first , the irish had planned to have a larger amount of men to attack the city . but a man called sir roger casement was captured on the way back from germany with guns and the irish had very few guns . as a result , only about 1,250 men took part in the rising . out of these about 300 went into the general post office ( gpo ) in dublin led by patrick pearse and james connolly . other groups took over different parts of the city , for example st. stephen 's green , shelbourne hotel , boland 's mills and jacobs factory . at first the british put up no resistance because of easter public holiday , but soon more of them came into dublin to fight the irish .
