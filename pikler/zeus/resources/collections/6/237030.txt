Kwanzaa     kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the united states to honor universal african heritage and culture . people light a kinara ( candle holder with seven candles ) and give each other gifts . it takes place from december 26 to january 1 every year . it was created by maulana karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. non-african americans also celebrate kwanzaa . the holiday greeting is `` joyous kwanzaa '' . kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s . it was created as a way to help african americans reconnect with their african cultural and historical heritage . the name kwanzaa comes from the swahili phrase `` matunda ya kwanza '' , meaning first fruits of the harvest . during the early years of kwanzaa , karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to christmas , that jesus was psychotic , and that christianity was a white religion that black people should shun . however , as kwanzaa became more popular , karenga changed his position so that practicing christians could also feel included . he stated in the 1997 `` kwanzaa : a celebration of family , community , and culture '' , `` kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday .
