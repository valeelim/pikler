Boyce and Hart     boyce and hart were a musical and songwriting duo , who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s . tommy boyce ( born sidney thomas boyce in 1939 and died in 1994 ) and bobby hart ( born robert luke harshman in 1939 ) wrote and produced hit records for the monkees ( `` last train to clarksville '' , `` valleri '' ) , jay and the americans ( `` come a little bit closer '' ) , chubby checker ( `` lazy elsie molly '' ) , and for themselves , with `` i wonder what she 's doing tonight '' and other songs . their biggest success was with the monkees , as writers , producers and performers . many of the early monkees recordings featured boyce and hart 's band , the candy store prophets , before the monkees were even selected from auditions . when the monkees themselves took charge of their recordings , they still recorded boyce and hart 's songs , and praised the duo to the public . ten years after the monkees 's heyday , two former members , micky dolenz and davy jones , teamed up with boyce and hart , touring and performing the band 's hits . they also issued a new album on capitol records .
