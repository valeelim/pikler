White Australia policy     the white australia policy was the name given to laws that stopped non white immigrants from coming to live in australia . these laws were put in place in 1901 , and were repealed from the 1950s to 1970s in 1901 , 98 % of people living in australia were of european background , with `` clean '' skin , and with british laws and customs . the government wanted to keep australia this way . this had an influence on the type of people living in australia . in 2001 , many australians claimed to have fathers from europe . about six percent were asian , and about two percent were aboriginals . most of the remaining 92 % were european . in the 1850s many chinese people , mainly men , came to australia to search for gold . this lead to anti-chinese riots on the goldfields at lambing flat in new south wales , and at the buckland river diggings in victoria . the victorian government tried to stop more chinese from arriving , by charging a special tax of Â£10 for every chinese person who came on a ship to victoria . in 1861 new south wales passed laws to stop chinese people coming , and queensland passed laws in 1877 , and western australia in 1886. later men from the pacific islands , called `` kanakas '' , were brought to australia to work on the sugarcane farms in queensland . this also caused problems because they worked for much lower wages than other people . the new federal government of australia acted in 1901 to stop certain types of people coming to work or live in australia .
