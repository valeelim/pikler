The Rite of Spring     the rite of spring ( `` le sacre du printemps '' ) is a ballet in two parts . the entire ballet was a concept developed by igor stravinsky . he wrote the music . the set and costumes were designed by nicholas roerich . the dances , which stravinsky hated , were designed by vaslav nijinsky . stravinsky complained that nijinsky had no understanding of the rudiments of music . the ballet was first performed by diaghilev 's ballets russes at the theatre du champs-élysées in paris on 29 may 1913. the dress rehearsal met with approval from critics and invited guests , but the premiere was greeted with tumult and riot only stilled by the performance of marie piltz as the sacrificial maiden . subsequent performances were received with growing appreciation , but the ballet 's great difficulties forced it to be presented only six times . the ballet was revived in 1920 by the ballets russes , but the music had been performed in its entirety in concert before the revival . nijinsky 's dances had been forgotten so leonide massine ( who had not seen the original performances ) designed the dances anew . these met with stravinsky 's approval . in 1940 , walt disney used the music to accompany a segment of the animated movie `` fantasia '' . this segment depicted lumbering dinosaurs and smoldering volcanoes .
