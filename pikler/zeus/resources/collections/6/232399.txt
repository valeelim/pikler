Polytetrafluoroethylene     in chemistry , polytetrafluoroethylene ( often shortened to ptfe ) is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene . it is a fluoropolymer , because the polymerization is based on strong bonds of fluorine and carbon . polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive . it also repels oil and water . it is better known by its trade-names , `` teflon '' , and gore-tex . teflon is a coating done to frying pans , among others . gore-tex is a membrane used in clothing . perfluorooctanoic acid is needed to produce polytetrafluoroethylene . perfluorooctanoic acid is because it is very toxic for people and may cause cancer . the precursors for many chemical weapons are highly corrosive , their containers are therefore often treated with polytetrafluoroethylene . for this reason , the export of polytetrafluoroethylene from the european union may need a special permit .
