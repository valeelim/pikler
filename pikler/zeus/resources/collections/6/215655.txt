Pleiotropism     pleiotropism is a central term in developmental genetics . in pleiotropism , a single gene affects a number of phenotypic traits in the same organism . these pleiotropic effects often seem to be unrelated to each other . the usual underlying mechanism is that the same gene is activated in several different tissues , producing apparently different effects . it follows that the phenomenon must be extremely common , since most genes will have effects in more than one tissue . the term may be contrasted with pleiomorphism , in which a genetically uniform group of organisms shows variable phenotypes . pleiotropy has significance for the theory of evolution . it has often been claimed that some heritable features of animals are not the product of adaptation by natural selection . much of this may be explained by pleiotropism . strong selection for one or two aspects of gene function will automatically bring along some other pleiotropic traits . these other traits , though inherited , may be neutral or even slightly deleterious in terms of selection .
