Packet (computing)    packet ( computing ) in information technology , a packet is collection of data that can be used by computers which need to communicate with each other , usually as part of a network . some computers and networks do not use packets to communicate . but most currently do , including nearly all computers on the internet . packets allow many computers on a network to communicate more quickly and easily . a packet consists of two kinds of data : packet information and packet `` data '' ( or `` payload '' ) . if you think of a packet like a letter in the mail , the `` control information '' is like the outside of the envelope . there 's an address that says where to send the letter , and a stamp that says how to send it ( fast or slow ) . similarly , the computer uses the `` control information '' in the packet to decide where , and how , to send the data . people are n't usually interested in the control information . the `` user data '' is like the inside of the envelope . it is the actual information the computer is trying to send . this might be the contents of a web page , or a user 's name and address , for example . it 's generally more for people 's use , and less for the computer 's use .
