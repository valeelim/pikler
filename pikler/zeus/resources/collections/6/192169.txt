TawhÄ«d     tawhid is the concept of god in islam which says that only one god exists . it says that god is unique and one and he has no equal . it also says that since the god is the only creator , there is no room for lesser gods or deities . any lesser gods are therefore false . tawhid is an essential part of islam . to become a muslim it is necessary to accept it . the concept of tawhid has many implications . since god is the only power , both good and bad flow from god . so , whatever good or bad occurs to an individual , both are from god and both should be accepted by the individual . since god is the only power worth worshipping , reliance on any other source for help is not permissible . the qur'an explains the nature of god thus in chapter 112 : say : he is allah , the one and only ; allah , the eternal , absolute ; none is born of him , nor is he born ; and there is no one like him . associating any other thing or person as being comparable to god is called `` shirk '' in islam . this is the only sin in islam which can not be forgiven by god , unless a person turns repentant on earth . the koran tells muslims to not say `` trinity '' spoken by christians . it also says that jesus did not claim to be anything more than a human being , whom god chose as a prophet like other before him .
