Las Meninas     las meninas is an oil painting by the spanish painter diego velázquez . the painting hangs in the museo del prado in madrid , the capital of spain . it was painted in 1656. the word “ menina ” means “ lady-in-waiting ” or “ maid of honour ” , i.e . a girl who serves in a royal court . there is a lot of detail in the painting , and more has been written about it than about almost any other western painting because it is quite complicated . for example : people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there . `` las meninas '' shows a large room in the madrid palace of king philip iv of spain . several people are in the painting , and we know who they are . some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer ( the person who is looking at the painting ) . the person who stands in the middle is the infanta margarita ( the princess , daughter of the king and queen ) . she has two maids of honour , one on each side of her , a chaperone , a bodyguard , two dwarfs and a dog . velázquez has also painted himself , standing just behind the princess and her companions . he is standing at the artist ’ s easel . he has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer . at the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen . this means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting . the king and queen are probably being painted by velázquez , but not everybody agrees with this .
