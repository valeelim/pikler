Monster group     in math , there are many subjects . one of these is group theory . in group theory , the monster group ( shortened to `` m '' or `` f '' ) is important . it is also called the fischer-griess monster , or the friendly giant . it is a group of finite order , which is equal to : it is a `` simple group '' . simple groups have only two normal subgroups : the identity element , and `` m '' . the finite simple groups have been completely classified ( the classification of finite simple groups ) . there are two kinds of finite simple groups in the list of finite simple groups . the first kind has 18 countably infinite families . the second kind has 26 sporadic groups . they are not as systematic . the monster group is the largest of these sporadic groups . it contains all but six of the other sporadic groups inside of it . robert griess has called these six exceptions pariahs . the rest make up the happy family . other websites . - mathworld : monster group - atlas of finite group representations : monster group
