Supersaturation     when talking about chemical solutions , the term supersaturated means that a solution contains more of a substance , that could be solved in it . rain happens in a supersaturated solution of water in air . carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water . at the start , the pressure in the bottle is very high . this means that more carbon dioxide gas can be put into the water than at normal pressure . when the bottle is opened , the pressure falls to the normal level , and the carbon dioxide gas escapes very slowly . certain things such as small bubbles in the bottle can make this process faster . such bubbles can be caused by shaking the bottle . another solute such as sugar powder or a widget can also trigger precipitation.. a diet coke and mentos eruption is an extreme example . some drinks such as ales and stouts rely on this effect to produce the 'head ' on the surface of the poured product .
