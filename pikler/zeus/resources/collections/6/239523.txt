Adrian Edmondson     adrian charles `` ade '' edmondson ( 24 january 1957 ) is in english actor and comedian . he is best known for his roles as vyvyan basterd in tv series the young ones and eddie hitler in bottom . since 2006 edmondson has worked more on music instead of acting . he made the band the bad shepherds and performs and writes for the bonzo dog doo dah band . edmonson was born in bradford , west riding of yorkshire . he is married to comedienne jennifer saunders . they have three daughters . played by adrian edmondson , vyvyan is a psychotic punk metal medical student . he has orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead . in the episode `` interesting '' , he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible on the side of his head . he is extremely violent and regularly attacks neil and rick with pieces of wood , cricket bats and other large objects . he never harms mike , whom he respects , and often addresses as `` michael '' . he despises rick more than he does neil - when rick , mike and neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode `` boring '' , he calls both neil and mike his friends , but not rick , whom he refers to as `` a complete bastard . '' ironically , this antagonistic relationship between rick and vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable , as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates . unlike neil and rick , vyvyan appears to come from a working-class background ( something rick incorrectly believes himself to have ) .
