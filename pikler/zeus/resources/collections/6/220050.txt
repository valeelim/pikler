Thecodontosaurus     thecodontosaurus ( meaning `` socket-toothed lizard '' ) was a very early dinosaur that lived during the upper triassic , a time when the earth was relatively warm and much of the land was dry and desert-like . this was around the time that the dinosaurs were just starting to appear . fossils of `` thecodontosaurus '' have been found in southwest england ( near bristol ) and wales , which were probably dry and desert-like when `` thecodontosaurus '' lived . `` thecodontosaurus '' was first described by h. riley and s. stutchbury in 1836 , and named by morris in 1843. modern cladistic work has not been conclusive . `` thecodontosaurus '' was earlier put under the prosauropoda . more recently was suggested that `` thecodontosaurus '' and its relatives came before the prosauropod-sauropod split . `` thecodontosaurus '' is sometimes placed in a very basal position among the sauropodomorph dinosaurs . new reconstructions show that its neck is proportionally shorter than those in more 'advanced ' early sauropodomorphs .
