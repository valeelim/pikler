Capoeira     capoeira is a combination of martial arts , sport and popular culture that developed in brazil , by african slaves and brazilian natives , starting in the 16th century . it was made to give slaves a chance to escape and to survive . capoeira was illegal in brazil until the 1930s . capoeira uses strong and fast kicks , dodges and fast counter-attacks . it also uses acrobatics and simple take-downs . capoeira 's history probably begins with the beginning of african slavery in brazil . when portuguese colonists began exporting west african slaves , brazil , with its vast territory , received most of the slaves ; almost 40 % of all slaves sent across the atlantic ocean . although rebellions were rare , capoeira was invented as a hope of survival for slaves . if they managed to escape , as after an escape attempt , colonial agents were sent after the escapees . the martial arts were incorporated into a dance , to escape detectionâ€“with music and rhythmic moves , no suspicion could be raised regarding potential martial art training . due to city growth , more slaves were brought to cities and so made capoeira more prominent and allowed it to be taught and practiced among more people . in rio , the colonial government tried to suppress it and established severe physical punishments for its practice .
