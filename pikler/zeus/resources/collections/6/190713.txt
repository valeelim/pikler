Plasma display     televisions with plasma display panel ( pdp ) are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition . only a few television use a pdp . plasma screens are made of two sheets of glass with two gases stored between the sheets . the gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers , or spaces . behind each space are a series of red , blue and green phosphors that give off light when struck by radiation . when electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen . they work in a very similar way to fluorescent lamps used for lighting . plasma screens have been in use since 1964 but only two colors could be produced then . now we have high definition plasma screens up to 150 inches in size . in the early 21st century fewer plasma screens were made as people bought more liquid crystal displays . plasma tvs have more pixels ( tiny dots that when put together can create an image on a picture ) per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube ( crt ) screens so they can produce a much sharper image . in the old style of crt screens the pictures were made up of lines . if you look closely at a plasma screen you will not see any lines . you will find out that most plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters . they are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods .
