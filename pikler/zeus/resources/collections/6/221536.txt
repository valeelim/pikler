Backward compatibility     backward compatibility refers to hardware or software that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems . for example , perl , the scripting language , was designed to be backward compatible with awk , an earlier language that perl was designed to replace . backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible , or extensible , with built-in features such as hooks , plug-in , or an application program interface ( api ) that allows the addition of new features . the term `` backward combatible '' ( notice the `` b '' ) is sometimes used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions , causing the two versions to fight ( or combat ) each other . in this case , the two versions can not share data easily and may have features that cause errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer , often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to . even if the earlier version is removed , remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version .
