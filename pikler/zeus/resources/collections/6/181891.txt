London Victoria station     victoria station is a major national rail , london underground and coach station in the city of westminster . it is the second busiest railway terminus in london after waterloo . it is in travelcard zone 1. it is named after queen victoria . the national rail station is officially named 'london victoria ' , a name that is sometimes used outside london , but never by londoners . the station has two separate parts : - the eastern ( chatham ) side , platforms 1–8 , is the terminus for services to kent on the chatham main line and its branches . - the western ( brighton ) side , platforms 9–19 , is the terminus for services to surrey and sussex , including gatwick airport and brighton on the brighton main line and its branches . this split is generally held to , as the track layout does not allow much swapping , with only a small number of connecting flyovers between the main lines in the battersea area , and a single track connection just outside the station . as the brighton side is the busier of the two , disruption on that line sometimes results in some of its suburban services using the eastern side . this is often true of the gatwick express , which travels along the brighton main line , as it will often divert over chatham side tracks during engineering works in order to maintain service levels .
