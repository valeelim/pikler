Oceanic trench     ocean trenches have relatively steep sides falling to the ocean floor . ocean trenches are typically caused when an oceanic crustal plate slides under a lighter continental plate or another oceanic plate . it is believed to work by density . where one plate slides under another , this is called subduction . as the heavier plate descends , the long , narrow feature caused is called the `` subduction zone '' . it is here that oceanic trenches form . they can be 1,500 miles ( 2,400 km ) long , several miles deep , and as much as 70 miles ( 112 km ) wide . at least five trenches are over 6 miles ( 10 km ) deep . the greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the challenger deep of the mariana trench , at a depth of trenches are active with earthquakes and resulting tsunamis . most volcanism associated with trenches occurs on the continent and not on the sea floor . however , many of the ocean 's volcanic islands and seamounts are found in what are called island arcs , bending chains of islands rising from the sea floor , usually paralleling the concave edges of an oceanic trench . the western pacific has island arcism as do the aleutian islands .
