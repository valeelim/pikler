Seed dispersal     seed dispersal is the way seeds get from the parent plant to a new place . `` dispersal '' means to spread or scatter . the basic idea is as follows . plants , obviously , can not move after they have put down roots . it follows that it is an evolutionary advantage to get their seeds away from the parent plant . if the seeds take root nearby they will compete with each other and the parent plant . also , a species is more likely to survive when its members are widely spread . this is because local disasters still leave plants in other places . from the first land plants in the silurian period for 300 million years to the lower cretaceous , virtually all transport of spores and seeds was done by mechanical means . in fact , for most types of plants both fertilisation and dispersal was done by wind . if not wind , then water was the medium . a great change took place with the appearance of flowering plants in the cretaceous . the story of flowers and insects is one of the best examples of co-evolution . the gut contents , wing structures , and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators . the association between beetles and angiosperms during the lower cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects in the upper cretaceous . the evolution of nectaries in upper cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms .
