Foraminifera     foraminifera or forams , as they are called , are an important group of tiny single-celled rhizarian eukaryotes . they are mostly marine , though a few live in fresh-water , and even on damp land areas . in the sea , they live both in the plankton ( pelagic ) , and in the deeper water ( the benthos ) . they have `` tests '' ( like shells ) made of calcium carbonate ( caco ) . the organism has pseudopodia like an amoeba . it uses these to capture and eat bacteria and small diatoms . also , many of them keep algal endosymbionts . some are `` idioplastic '' , which means they eat the algae , but keep the algal chloroplasts for their own benefit . forams are often used to date strata in palaeontology . the detailed record of forams from deep sea drilling projects are the basis of a fossil index for geological periods or stages . this is called `` biostratigraphy '' . deep sea forams from the mariana trench are below the `` carbonate compensation depth '' , below which all caco dissolves . they have evolved organic tests , instead of calcium carbonate ones . this suggests that the tests are a vital part of their life-style , perhaps protecting them from other micro-predators .
