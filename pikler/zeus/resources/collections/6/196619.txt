Oblate spheroid     an oblate spheroid is a famous shape . it is the shape of the earth and some other planets . it is like a sphere squashed from the top so the diameter from pole to pole is less than the diameter from equator to equator . shapes of this type are called ellipsoids . oblate spheroids have rotational symmetry around an axis from pole to pole . many planets , including the earth and saturn , are oblate spheroids . the difference between a sphere and the earth 's shape is small , only about one part in 300. stars spin , and some spin very fast . the faster the spin , the flatter the oblate spheroid . the sun rotates at 2 km per second , neutron stars have speeds of thousands of km/sec . in 1687 isaac newton published the `` principia '' . he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution ( a spheroid ) . the amount of flattening depends on the density and the balance of gravitational force and centrifugal force . in other words , the earth is a spheroid because it rotates . gas giants like jupiter and saturn are flattened by rotation more than the earth .
