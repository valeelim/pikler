Essjay controversy     the essjay controversy is about a well known wikipedia administrator and salaried wikia worker , essjay , who later said he was ryan jordan . in february 2007 , essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his wikipedia user page and to news reporter stacy schiff during a report for `` the new yorker '' . many people reacted in many ways to the controversy . many articles and comments were made in electronic , print , and broadcast media ; the wikipedia community checked essjay 's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project 's handling of personal identification . in his activities as an editor , essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes . wikipedia co-founder jimmy wales supported essjay 's use of an identity , saying , `` i regard it as a pseudonym and i don â€™ t really have a problem with it . '' later wales changed his opinion and asked for essjay to quit his jobs with wikipedia and wikia . wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned `` that essjay used his false credentials in content disputes '' on wikipedia .
