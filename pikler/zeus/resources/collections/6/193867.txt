Calculator     a calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily . for example , most calculators will add , subtract , multiply , and divide . some also do square roots , and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs . calculators are found everywhere . a smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator . some calculators , like the abacus , will work without batteries . others , like the electronic calculator , require batteries . there are two types of electronic calculators : simple calculators , which can only add , subtract , multiply and divide , and sometimes take square roots ; and scientific calculators , which can do many other things , such as calculate factorials and trigonometry functions . there are different ways to write mathematics on a calculator . for example , after pressing `` 3 '' and then `` + '' and then `` 2 '' and then `` = '' ( or `` enter '' ) the number `` 5 '' will be displayed on the screen . this is called infix notation . many more advanced calculators use postfix notation , that is , `` 3 4 + '' instead of `` 3 + 4 = '' . the third way of noting things , `` + 3 4 '' , called prefix notation , is rarely found on calculators .
