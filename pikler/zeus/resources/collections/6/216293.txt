Pool (cue sports)    pool ( cue sports ) pool , also known as pocket billiards , is the general term for a family of cue sports . these games are played on a pool table with six holes cut into them called pockets , into which balls are deposited as one of the main goals of play . outside the billiards industry , the various games played on these tables are very often called `` pool '' . this is due to an association with the `` poolrooms '' where gamblers `` pooled '' together their money to bet on horse races . because these places often provided billiard tables , the term `` pool '' became linked to billiards . though the original `` pool '' games were played on pocketless carom billiards tables , the name stuck to pocket billiards as it gained in popularity . the traditional view of billiards as a refined and noble pastime did not blend well with the low-class connotations of gambling . because of this , the billiards industry 's attempts to distance itself from the term `` pool '' beginning in the late 19th century . they were largely unsuccessful .
