Computer Misuse Act     the computer misuse act 1990 is a law passed by the british government . the law has three parts . in the u.k. , it is now a crime to : - access a computer without permission . - access a computer without permission , hoping to break another law . - change , break or copy files without permission . most people who break this law can be fined for up to Â£2000 and jailed for up to 6 months if you live in scotland and 12 months in the uk . however , people who do computer fraud , blackmailing through computers , or making computer viruses will get a fine of any amount and be jailed for up to 5 years . it is very difficult to prove that people have committed any of these offences without proper knowledge and use of i.p addresses so the law has not worked very well . there have been very few related pages . - computer legislation - data protection act
