Beating heart cadaver     a beating heart cadaver is the body of a dead person that has been connected to a medical ventilator . this will keep the organs of the dead body , including the heart , functioning and alive for a few days . such a body still functions physically , but the person it belonged to is dead by the law and medicine 's definition because there is no longer any conscious brain function possible . the procedure for caring for a beating heart cadaver is the same as caring for a normal patient . the body must be monitored at all times , and if necessary , `` life saving '' procedures must be taken . since the brain does not work , the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive . measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation . a beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted . surgeons will remove the organs , one after the other , and give them to their patients . the entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours . this process was formerly known as an `` organ harvest '' , but the name has since changed to the milder `` organ recovery . '' many organs can be used , and many lives can be saved by one body . the bodies are generally organ donors , who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs . some donated organs are taken from non-heart-beating donors . organs from brain deaths , however , have a better success rate , and currently most organ donation is from these deaths .
