Just-World phenomenon     the just-world phenomenon is when people think that because bad things happen to someone , they did something to deserve the bad things . the concept is a lot like karma , except it is a fallacy instead of a religious belief . the phenomenon also happens in reverse , with good things being deserved . examples . - amy is watching bob cook . bob gets burnt by the hot frying pan . amy assumes this is because bob did something mean to amy 's friend charles . ( here , the just-world phenomenon is happening in amy 's mind . bob getting burnt has nothing to do with charles . ) - albert is watching brianna walk across the room . when brianna touches the doorknob , she is shocked by static electricity . albert decides that this is because she does not give to charity . ( brianna giving to charity has nothing to do with getting shocked . she was walking across the carpet in socks , which is why she was shocked . ) - brianna watches albert buy a lottery ticket . albert later wins . brianna thinks this is because albert said `` thank you '' when buying the ticket .
