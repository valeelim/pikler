ATP synthase     atp synthase is an enzyme found in cells that make atp from adp and inorganic phosphate . the atp synthase is powered by the difference of concentration of ph between inside and outside the place where the enzyme is located . the exact mechanism in which it does so is unknown , although it is believed to work like a rotating machine .
