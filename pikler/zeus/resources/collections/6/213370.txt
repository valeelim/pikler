Shanxi     shanxi ( 山西 ) is a province of the people 's republic china . it is in the northern part of the country and has the yellow river flowing through it.. in 2005 , 37.2 million people lived there . the number of people was growing each year by just over four per cent . the name `` shanxi '' means `` mountain 's west '' or `` west of the mountains '' , as it is west of the taihang mountains . although in pinyin , the name of the neighboring province to the west , `` shaanxi '' , is spelled exactly the same as `` shanxi '' , the only difference in how the two words are pronounced is that the first syllable in `` shanxi '' is said using the first tone in mandarin , while the first syllable in `` shaanxi '' is said with the third tone . since tone markers are not usually used to show how to pronounce the two different names , the first word in `` shaanxi '' is spelled using the gwoyeu romatzyh method instead , which indicates tones by adding extra letters to a syllable . the abbreviation of shanxi is jin ( 晋 ) , since there is another province , shandong ( 山东 ) , that has the word `` shan '' ( 山 ) in it , meaning `` mountain '' in chinese .
