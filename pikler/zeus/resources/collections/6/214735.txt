Epigenetics     epigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity which are `` not '' caused by changes in the dna sequence . it is the study of gene expression , the way genes bring about their phenotypic effects . these changes in gene activity may stay for the remainder of the cell 's life and may also last for many generations of cells , through cell divisions . however , there is no change in the underlying dna sequence of the organism . instead , non-hereditary factors cause the organism 's genes to behave ( express themselves ) differently . epigenetics works by specific mechanisms , such as dna methylation . epigenetic factors may last into adulthood . a general definition is `` the study of ... gene activity during the development of complex organisms '' . thus `` epigenetic '' can be used to describe anything other than dna sequence that influences the development of an organism . a stricter or narrower definition is `` the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that can not be explained by changes in dna sequence '' .
