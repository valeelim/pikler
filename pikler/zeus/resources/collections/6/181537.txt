Marsupial lion     the marsupial lion , thylacoleo , is an extinct carnivorous marsupial which lived in australia from 1,600,000 to 46,000 years ago . it was the largest marsupial carnivore to have lived in australia . fossil remains on the dry nullarbor plain show that humans and climate change probably caused the extinction of the australian megafauna about 45,000 years ago . the animal was robust with powerfully built jaws and very strong forelimbs . it had retractable claws , unique among marsupials . this allowed the claws to remain sharp by protecting them from wear when walking . the claws were well-suited to holding prey and for climbing trees . the first digits ( `` thumbs '' ) on each hand were semi-opposable and bore an enlarged claw . palaeontologists believe that this would have been used to grapple with its prey , and gave a sure footing on tree trunks and branches . the hind feet had four functional toes , the first digit being much reduced in size but possessing a roughened pad similar to that of possums . it may have assisted with climbing . it is unclear whether the marsupial lion had syndactyly ( fused second and third toes ) like other diprotodonts .
