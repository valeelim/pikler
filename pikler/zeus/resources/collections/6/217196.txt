Resonance     in physics , resonance is the tendency of a system to vibrate with increasing amplitudes at some frequencies of excitation . these are known as the system 's `` resonant frequencies '' ( or `` resonance frequencies '' ) . the resonator may have a `` fundamental frequency '' and any number of `` harmonics '' . an example of useful effect of resonant frequency is a guitar string which makes a characteristic noise when it is touched . the noise depends on how thick or slack the string is . another example can be seen in a playground swing . there is one specific rate at which you must push away a person on a swing to cause the swing to go high . this rate is the resonant frequency . in earthquake engineering , on contrary , any possibility of a resonance is detrimental for the building structure . the kirkwood gap and other connections among orbits are caused by orbital resonance . related pages . - resonator - seismic damper - vibration control - vibration isolation
