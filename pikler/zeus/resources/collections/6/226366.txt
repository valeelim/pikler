Edward Jenner     edward jenner ( 17 may 1749 â€“ 26 january 1823 ) was an english physician known for creating the vaccine for smallpox . vaccination as a concept was known long before jenner . in 1765 , dr john fewster published a paper in the london medical society entitled `` cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox '' , but he did not pursue the subject further . after 1770 , at least five investigators in england and germany ( sevel , jensen , jesty 1774 , rendell , plett 1791 ) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox . for example , dorset farmer benjamin jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774. jenner may have been aware of jesty 's procedures and success , but after jenner 's work some 20 years later the procedure became widely understood at last . it was a common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox . jenner thought that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox ( a disease similar to smallpox , but much less virulent ) protected them from smallpox . he may already have heard of benjamin jesty 's success .
