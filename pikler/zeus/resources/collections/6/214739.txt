Cell differentiation     in developmental biology , cellular differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type . different tissues have different kinds of cells . differentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism as the organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types . differentiation is a common process in adults as well : adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover . differentiation dramatically changes a cell 's size , shape , metabolic activity , and responsiveness to signals . these changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression . with a few exceptions , cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the dna sequence itself . it does involve switching off many genes not needed in a particular tissue . thus , cells in different tissues may have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome .
