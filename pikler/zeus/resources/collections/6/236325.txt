Emperor Sujin     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukansh≈ç '' records that sujin ruled from the palace of `` mizogaki-no-miya '' at shiki in what will come to be known yamato province . sujin is almost certainly a legend ; but the `` kojiki '' and `` nihonshoki '' record his name and genealogy . he was the second son of emperor kaika . some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors . these critics consider sujin to be the earliest to have actually existed . the limited information about sujin does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . sujin was interested in agriculture and irrigation . he established a system of taxation . this emperor 's official name after his death ( his posthumous name ) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to sujin .
