Uranium-lead dating     uranium-lead is one of the oldest and most refined of the radiometric dating schemes . it can be used over an age range of about 1 million years to over 4.5 billion years . precision is in the 0.1-1 percent range . the method relies on two separate decay chains , the uranium series from u to pb , with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from u to pb , with a half-life of 704 million years . the existence of two 'parallel ' uranium-lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall u-pb system . the term 'u-pb dating ' normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes . however , use of a single decay scheme ( usually u to pb ) leads to the u-pb isochron dating method , analogous to the rubidium-strontium dating method . finally , ages can also be determined from the u-pb system by analysis of pb isotope ratios alone . this is termed the lead-lead dating method . clair cameron patterson , an american geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium-lead radiometric dating methods , is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the earth .
