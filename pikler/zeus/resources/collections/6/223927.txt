Photolithography     photolithography is the combination of photography and lithography . its uses include the mass printing of photographs . microphototolithography is the use of photolithography to transfer geometric shapes on a photomask to the surface of a semiconductor wafer for making integrated circuits . photolithography makes integrated circuits such as memory and central processing units . a special light-and-shadow pattern is shone through a photomask , onto a sheet or wafer of silicon that had been covered with a material called a photoresist . the light hardens the photoresist . when the board is dipped into a special acid , the parts that had no light on them are dissolved away . memory chips have thousands or millions of identical cells . because is much easier to make than a cpu , ( a large die with a non-repetitive structure ) , ram chips are far less expensive than processors .
