Carboniferous     the carboniferous was the geological period after the devonian and before the permian . it lasted from about 359 to about 299 million years ago . in the u.s.a. the carboniferous is divided into the mississippian ( lower part , 359–323.2 mya ) and the pennsylvanian ( upper part , 323.2–299 mya ) . in europe the terms lower , middle and upper are used . the early tetrapods split first into two major groups : the amphibians , which laid their eggs in water , and the amniotes , who laid their cleidoic eggs on land . the amniotes gave rise to two groups both of which became dominant at different times . they were the synapsids , which eventually gave rise to the mammals , and the sauropsids , which gave rise to the dinosaurs and other reptiles . these momentous events took place in the lower part of the carboniferous , the mississippian . the carboniferous is named after the `` coal measures '' , the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests . new kinds of vascular plants with thick bark grew in the forests . much of the coal came from this bark . this biota occurred in the upper part of the period , the pennsylvanian , from 315–300 million years years ago .
