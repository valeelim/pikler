Ahab     ahab or ach'av or achab in douay-rheims ( ; ; ) was king of israel and the son of omri . he is written about in the books of kings and the books of chronicles . ahab son of omri did `` more evil in the eyes of the lord than any of those before him '' ( 1 kings 16:30 ) , as it is written in the bible . many think - and say - that it is probably because of his evil wife , queen jezebel , daughter of ethbaal king of the sidonians . she was even more sinful than ahab , and comes out in the bible , commanding ahab to do most of the things she wants . she serves the idol baal and tries to make ahab and all the israelites worship it as well . one of ahab 's most famous enemies is an old prophet ( a man of god ) named elijah . he continually rebukes ahab for being so disobeying to the lord , and when ahab summoned all the prophets of baal against elijah at mount carmel , and set two altars for them , elijah won by calling on god and letting fire come and burn the sacrifice , and the prophets of baal were immediately killed by the israelites . importantly , even here ahab does nothing , either to stop or help elijah .
