70 Virginis b     70 virginis b is an extrasolar planet that is around 60 light-years away from the earth in the constellation of virgo . the finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers geoffrey marcy and r. paul butler . 70 virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it . when first announced , 70 virginis b was thought to be inside its star 's habitable zone , but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit , closer to its parent . 70 virginis b is a jupiter-type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 virginis every 116 days . it has 7.5 times the mass of jupiter . its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of jupiter 's . at the time that it was found in january 1996 , it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the earth . this could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude ( measure of brightness ) . as a result , the planet 's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname `` goldilocks '' ( not too cold or too hot ) . the hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone .
