Friedrich Mohs     friedrich mohs was a scientist who studied minerals and rocks , a german minerologist . scientist mohs was born in germany , and he was a minerologist who studied minerals , chemistry , physics , and mathematics . he was born in 1773 , january 29th , and died in 1839 , september 29. he moved to austria in 1801 where he found a job identifying minerals in a collection that belonged to a rich banker . he used physical characteristics of the crystals to decide what they were . one of the characteristics he used to identify minerals was hardness . he knew that some of the minerals could scratch others and that if a mineral could make a scratch on another , it must be harder than the mineral that was scratched . he found that all minerals could scratch the mineral talc , so it must be very soft . he also found that diamonds were so hard that no other minerals could scratch them . about ten years later , friedrich made a scale from one to 10 to describe mineral hardness . he gave harder minerals larger numbers and softer minerals smaller numbers . talc , the softest mineral , he assigned to one , the smallest number on the scale . diamond , the hardest mineral , he assigned to 10 , the largest number on the scale . this scale was called mohs scale of mineral hardness , named after friedrich mohs .
