Lexeme     lexeme is a term in linguistics . they are units of meaning , independent of any inflectional endings , or whether it is one word or several . `` come in '' is a lexeme ; so is `` raining cats and dogs '' . the largest english dictionaries have about half a million lexemes . `` the true figure is undoubtedly a great deal higher '' . in the english language , `` run '' , `` runs '' , `` ran '' and `` running '' are forms of the same lexeme , conventionally written as run . a similar concept is the lemma ( or citation form ) . it is the form of a lexeme which is chosen to represent the lexeme , for example , run instead of the other forms . lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords . other forms of a lexeme are usually listed later in the entry . so all headwords in a dictionary are lexemes . a `` lexicon '' is made of lexemes .
