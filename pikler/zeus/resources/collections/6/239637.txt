Fault (geology)    fault ( geology ) a fault is a fracture , or break , in the earth 's crust ( lithosphere ) . some faults are active . here , sections of rock move past each other . this sometimes makes earthquakes . faulting occurs when shear stress on a rock overcomes the forces which hold it together . the fracture itself is called a `` fault plane '' . when it is exposed at the earth 's surface , it may form a cliff or steep slope called a `` fault scarp '' . the angle between the fault plane and an imaginary horizontal plane is called the `` dip angle '' of the fault . faults may dip shallowly or steeply . faults are categorized into three types : 1. a normal fault is one where the fault dips toward the downthrown block . normal faults occur in rifted terranes , such as mid-ocean ridges , the african rift , and the basin and range province of western north america . it is shown on geologic maps as a black line with either a block pattern on the downthrown side , or the letters u/d showing the upthrown and downthrown sides . 1. a reverse fault ( if steeply dipping ) or thrust fault ( if shallowly dipping ) is a fault where the fault plane dips toward the upthrown block . it is shown on the geologic map with triangular teeth pointing toward the upthrown side of the fault . reverse and thrust faults shorten ( horizontally ) and thicken the crust . they are characteristic of collision origins .
