Paramecium     paramecium is one of the best-known protists , often taught in school biology courses . it is a ciliate genus . ciliates are a clade of protists which move by synchronous waves of tiny projections from their cuticle . these projections are called cilia ( singular : `` cilium '' ) . the species range from 50 to 350 Î¼m in length . they live in freshwater ponds , and eat bacteria , and other protists such as single-celled algae . paramecium species usually have bacterial symbionts , and some species have green algal symbionts . reproduction in `` paramecium '' has been researched for many years . `` paramecium '' has two nuclei ( a large macronucleus and a single compact micronucleus ) . they can not survive without the macronucleus and can not reproduce without the micronucleus . reproduction is either by binary fission ( asexual ) , conjugation ( sexual ) , or , rarely , by `` endomixis '' , a process of self-fertilisation . during binary fission a fully grown organism divides into two daughter cells . conjugation consists of the temporary union of two organisms and the exchange of micro-nuclear elements . without the rejuvenating effects of conjugation a paramecium ages and dies . only opposite mating types , or genetically compatible organisms , can unite in conjugation .
