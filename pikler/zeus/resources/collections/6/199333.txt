Anthropic principle     the anthropic principle says that the universe is how it is because it must allow for the eventual creation of us , as observers . the anthropic principle was thought of in 1974 , by the astronomer brandon carter . douglas adams explains this concept quite well using a puddle as an analogy : “ if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking , 'this is an interesting world i find myself in — an interesting hole i find myself in — fits me rather neatly , does n't it ? in fact it fits me staggeringly well , must have been made to have me in it ! `` there are two different kinds of anthropic principles : the `` weak anthropic principle '' , and the `` strong anthropic principle '' . the original thoughts that brandon carter had were : weak anthropic principle : `` we must be prepared to take into account the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers . '' strong anthropic principle : `` the universe ( and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends ) must be such as to admit the creations of observers within it at some stage . ''
