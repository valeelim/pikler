Graham's number    graham 's number graham 's number is a very , very big natural number that was defined by a man named ronald graham . graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called ramsey theory . he proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than graham 's number . graham 's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof . even if every digit in graham 's number were written in the tiniest writing possible , it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe . ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following : it turns out that for this simple problem , the answer is `` yes '' when we have 6 or more points , no matter how the lines are colored . but when we have 5 points or fewer , we can color the lines so that the answer is `` no '' . graham 's number comes from a variation on this question . by asking that the 4 points lie on a plane , we have made the problem much harder . we would like to know : for what values of `` n '' is the answer `` no '' ( for some way of coloring the lines ) , and for what values of `` n '' is it `` yes '' ( for all ways of coloring the lines ) ? but this problem has not been completely solved yet .
