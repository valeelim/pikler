Car     a car is a road vehicle used to carry passengers . it is also called an automobile , which comes from the greek word `` auto '' and the french word `` mobile '' . this name means `` self-moving '' , as cars do not need horses or other external sources of power to move . cars usually have four wheels and get their power from an engine , though many new cars made today do not have engines . millions of cars were made during the 20th century . like all other vehicles , cars come in all shapes and sizes , each of which is made for people with different needs . some small `` city '' cars carry only two to four people , and do not have a lot of room for luggage . other types are able to carry many passengers or heavy loads . for example , station wagons or estate cars carry from 5 to 9 people , or fewer people with lots of luggage . there are many different sizes of vans , such as minivans , which are made for families , and even small pickup trucks , which are car-like vehicles made for carrying medium-sized loads ; for example , goods for delivery or plumber 's and builder 's tools and materials . heavy lorries are used to carry deliveries and heavy loads .
