Naval mine     a naval mine is a bomb placed in water to destroy ships or submarines . unlike depth charges , mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship . naval mines can be used offensively , to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily , or trap them into a harbour . they can also be used defensively , to protect friendly ships and create `` safe '' zones . mines can be laid in many ways : by specially built minelayers , refitted ships , submarines , aircraft , or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand . they are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as us $ 1000 . there are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors , and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo . international law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area . this is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines . the warnings do not have to be specific ; during world war ii , britain said simply that it had mined the english channel , north sea , and french coast .
