Homotopy     homotopies are studied in a branch of mathematics known as algebraic topology . a homotopy is a deformation ( change of form ) of one thing into another without cutting it . for example , if we imagine a stretchy object , then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are `` homotopy equivalent '' . one famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut . to a topologist , these two shapes are the same .
