Ordovician     the ordovician is the second period of the paleozoic era . it lasted from about 485.4 million years ( mya ) to 443.4 mya . it follows the cambrian period and is followed by the silurian period . the ordovician was named after the welsh tribe of the `` ordovices '' . it was defined by charles lapworth in 1879. he recognized that the fossils in the disputed strata were different from those of the cambrian or the silurian . therefore , he reasoned , they should be placed in a period of their own . recognition of the ordovician period was slow in britain , but elsewhere it was quickly accepted . in 1906 it was adopted as an official period of the paleozoic era by the international geological congress . the ordovician ended with a series of extinction events that , together amount to the second greatest extinction of the phanerozoic . this was the endordovician extinction event . sea levels were high during the ordovician . shallow ( < 50 metres ) inland seas were the greatest for which evidence is preserved in the rocks .
