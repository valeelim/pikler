A-sharp minor     a-sharp minor or a minor is a minor scale based on a-sharp . its key signature has seven sharps . its relative major is c-sharp major . its parallel major is a-sharp major . this is usually replaced by b-flat major , because a-sharp major 's three double sharps in the key signature makes it generally impractical . exceptions include chopin 's polonaise-fantaisie in a-flat major , op . 61 , which has a short passage of about 6 bars actually written in a-sharp major , putting in the necessary double-sharps as accidentals . this is part of a theme in b major , which modulates to a-sharp major for a little while . a-sharp minor has the enharmonic equivalent of b-flat minor . this is often used in most musical compositions instead of a-sharp minor , because a-sharp minor is not a useful key for compositions and is one of the least used minor keys in music . however , there were some composers in the past that have composed music in this key . christian heinrich rinck wrote his prelude no . 16 from op . 15 in a-sharp minor .
