Corvette     a corvette is a small , manageable and lightly armed war ship . during the age of the sail , corvettes were smaller than frigates and larger than sloops-of-war , they had normally a single gun deck . almost all the modern navies use ships smaller than frigates for coastal duty , but not all of them use the term `` corvette '' ( from the french `` corvair '' ) or equivalent .
