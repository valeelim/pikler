Terraforming     terraforming is changing a planet that we can not live on at present . the idea is to change it so some life from earth could exist there . it would need a suitable atmosphere ( air ) , heat , and water . some think it is possible to terraform mars , our moon , titan , callisto and mercury . it is arguable that we have already succeeded in terraforming right here on earth . thanks to modern technology , humans can now thrive in places that should be impossible to live in such as deserts and the arctic .
