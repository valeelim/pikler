Pauli exclusion principle     the pauli exclusion principle refers to the fact that certain particles can not be at the same place at the same time , with the same energy . only fermions ( examples are protons , neutrons and electrons ) are bound by the pauli exclusion principle , while bosons ( an example is a photon - light beam ) are not . a more precise way to describe the pauli exclusion principle is to say that two of the same kind of fermions can not have the same quantum numbers . this principle was discovered by physicist wolfgang pauli in 1925. it is a very important principle in physics , because the particles that make up ordinary matter are fermions .
