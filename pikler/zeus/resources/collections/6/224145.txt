Mohs scale of mineral hardness     mohs scale of mineral hardness is named after the scientist , friedrich mohs , who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another . rocks are made up of one or more minerals . according to the scale , talc is the softest : it can be scratched by all other materials . gypsum is harder : it can scratch talc but not calcite , which is even harder . the hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms . it is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching . the mohs scale is for natural minerals . for manufactured products other measures of hardness are better . diamond is always at the top of the scale , being the hardest mineral . there are ten minerals in mohs scale , talc , gypsum , calcite , fluorite , apatite , orthoclase , quartz , topaz , corundum , and for last and hardest , diamond . because the mohs scale was made long ago , it is not exactly correct - for example , several minerals are now known to be harder than the diamond . the mohs scale may not be perfect , but field geologists still find it very useful .
