August Weismann     august friedrich leopold weismann ( frankfurt am main , 17 january 1834 â€“ freiburg , 5 november 1914 ) was a german evolutionary biologist . weismann is much admired today . ernst mayr thought he was `` one of the great biologists of all time '' , and ranked him `` the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century '' , after charles darwin . weismann advocated the `` germ plasm '' theory . according to this , inheritance only takes place by means of the germ cells the gametes , such as egg cells and sperm cells . other cells of the body ( somatic cells or `` soma '' ) are not agents of heredity . the effect is one-way : germ cells produce somatic cells , and more germ cells . the germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life . genetic information can not pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation . this is referred to as the `` weismann barrier '' . this idea , if true , rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by lamarck .
