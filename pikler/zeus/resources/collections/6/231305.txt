Giant Gippsland earthworm     the giant gippsland earthworm , ( `` megascolides australis '' ) , is one of australia 's 1,000 native earthworm species . these giant earthworms average at 100 cm long and 2 cm in diameter and can reach 3 m in length . it is difficult to measure length , as the worms will stretch , so scientists use weight to estimate the size . the average weight of a fresh adult worm is about 200 grams . they have a dark purple head and a blue-gray body . the worms are found in the bass river valley of south gippsland , near korumburra and warragul . they are only found in a small area , of about 100,000 hectares . they live in small pockets of blue-grey clay close to water . they live in burrows about 500mm deep , and can burrow as deep as 1.5m . the habitat the worms used to live in was tall eucalypt forests . most of this has been cleared for farming , but the worms have continued to survive because they live deep underground . they have been listed a vulnerable species because of these changes . the worms only lay a single egg , between 4-7cm in size . these can take up to one year to hatch , and the worms take several years to become adults , and be able to reproduce . this slow rate of growth , also makes them a vulnerable species .
