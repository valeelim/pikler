Hypotension     hypotension is low blood pressure . a person with low blood pressure is called hypotensive . everybody 's blood pressure is different . some people have naturally low blood pressure . however , for most adults , a systolic blood pressure of under 90 , or a diastolic blood pressure of under 60 , is low blood pressure . ( systolic is the top number in a blood pressure reading ; diastolic is the bottom number . ) low blood pressure is not always dangerous . however , low blood pressure is dangerous if it causes any of these symptoms : if low blood pressure makes a person faint , the person could hurt themselves while falling . if a person 's blood pressure is very low , the heart will be unable to pump blood and oxygen to important parts of the body . every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to live . without blood and oxygen , important parts of the body , like the heart and brain , can be damaged . if a person 's blood pressure is low enough that they are feeling dizzy , they should lay down on the ground . putting their feet up , or bending their knees , is also helpful . this makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain ( because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain , like it would if the person were standing ) . lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint .
