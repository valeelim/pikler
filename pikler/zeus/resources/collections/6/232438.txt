Fischer-Tropsch process     the fischer–tropsch process ( or fischer–tropsch synthesis or f-t ) is a set of chemical reactions that changes a mixture of carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen gas into liquid hydrocarbons ( like gasoline or kerosene ) . people care about the f-t process for many different reasons , for example , it might be a way to make fuel for cars and trucks that does n't pollute as much as fossil fuels . the fischer–tropsch process involves many kinds of reactions , which lead to both wanted and unwanted results . the desirable reactions create chemicals called alkanes . sometimes the gas methane ( natural gas ) is produced , which is generally undesirable . sometimes , different kinds of alcohol are produced in small amounts . many steps are required to make the gases needed for the f-t process . for example , all chemicals entering the reactor must have all sulfur removed . for factories that start out with methane and want to make a liquid hydrocarbon ( like kerosene ) , another important reaction is `` steam reforming '' , which turns the methane into co ( carbon monoxide ) and h ( hydrogen gas ) .
