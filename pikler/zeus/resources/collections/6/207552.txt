Laika     laika ( ; c. 1954 â€“ november 3 , 1957 ) was a soviet union space dog . she was one of the first animals in space , and the first animal to orbit the earth . she was a mix of either a siberian husky or other nordic breed , and a terrier . nasa refers to laika as a `` part-samoyed terrier . '' the reason for sending a dog into space was to get information about the behavior of living organisms in a space environment . information from the flight led to the discovery of solar ( from the sun ) and cosmic radiation . laika had been a stray dog living in the streets of moscow . she underwent training with two other dogs . she was then chosen as the dog to go up in the soviet spacecraft sputnik 2. it was launched into outer space on november 3 , 1957. not much was known about how spaceflight would affect living animals at the time of laika 's mission . there was also no way , at that time , to bring the satellite back down to earth . so all the scientists knew there would be no way for laika to survive her trip . it was necessary to send a dog first as a test , because it was not thought that humans could live in outer space .
