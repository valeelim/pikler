Parthenogenesis     parthenogenesis is a term in biology . it means `` virgin birth '' . it is an asexual form of reproduction . females lay eggs without fertilization by a male . growth and development of embryos occurs with all genes inherited from the mother . it occurs in both plants and animals and is much less common than sexual reproduction . it even occurs in vertebrates : there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles , amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process . some plants and animals can reproduce either sexually or asexually . a good example are the aphids , ( e.g . greenfly ) which multiply parthenogenetically during the height of summer , but turn to sexual reproduction as the weather gets worse . at different times of the year , they can be viviparous ( live birth ) or oviparous ( eggs ) . during spring and summer , aphids usually produce live young ( nymphs ) parthenogenetically . these female aphids may or may not have wings . males only appear in any number at the close of the season . females then give birth sexually during autumn , laying eggs . therefore aphids are said to undergo 'cyclical parthenogenesis ' .
