Game port     the game port is a port that is present on some pc hardware , and hardware similar to it . this port lets the connection of analog devices used to control computer games , such as joysticks . in most relevant hardware designs for personal computers in 2010 , the port is an integrated component on the sound card , another i/o card , or the motherboard itself . starting with windows vista microsoft no longer supports this port with drivers from the operating system , but third party drivers are still available . there are also drivers that allow to map the game port to an usb device . unlike most other ports present on the pc , the game port is an analog port . this means that signal first needs to be changed to digital form , a task which is usually done by an analog-to-digital converter . in the early days , most joystick designs were digital , which made them easier to build and cheaper . the game port has a 15-pin dsub interface , most home computers that used digital joysticks had a 9-pin one . this made existing joysticks incompatible with the new interface .
