Population (statistics)    population ( statistics ) in statistics , a population is a set of things from which samples may be drawn . this allows statistical inferences to be drawn , or estimates made of the total population . for example , if we were interested in crows , then we would sample the set of crows which is of interest . the population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future . probably , geography will be a limitation in practice . to fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random . population is also used to refer to a set of measurements or values , not only cases actually observed . suppose , for example , we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of cambridgeshire , and we want to know the mean weight of these birds . for each bird in the population of crows there is a weight , and the set of these weights is called the population of weights .
