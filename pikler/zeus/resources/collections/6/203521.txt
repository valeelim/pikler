Homo georgicus     homo georgicus is a species of `` homo '' that was proposed in 2002. it is based on fossil skulls and jaws found in dmanisi , georgia in 1999 and 2001 , which seem intermediate between `` homo habilis '' and `` h. erectus '' . a partial skeleton was discovered in 2001. the fossils are about 1.8 million years old . the remains were first discovered in 1991 by georgian scientist , david lordkipanidze , accompanied by an international team which unearthed the remains . implements and animal bones were found alongside the ancient human remains . at first , scientists thought they had found mandibles and skulls belonging to `` homo ergaster '' , but size differences led them to name a new species . at around 600 cmÂ³ brain volume , the skull d2700 is dated to 1.77 million years old and it is in good condition . the cranium was the smallest and most primitive hominin skull ever discovered outside of africa . in africa , the `` australopithecines '' and early `` homo '' represent two distinctive evolutionary paths sharing a common ancestor . in georgia the specimens , with a brain half the size of anatomically modern humans , were the smallest found until the discovery of `` homo floresiensis '' on the island of flores in 2003 .
