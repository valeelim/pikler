Letter of Jeremiah     the letter of jeremiah , also known as the epistle of jeremy . this is a deuterocanonical ( or apocryphal ) book of the old testament . the letter is believed to have been made by jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into babylon . it is included in catholic bibles as the last part of the book of baruch . it is also in orthodox bibles as a standalone book . most learned people argue that the person who started the book was not jeremiah . jeremiah was a hellenistic jew who lived in alexandria . whoever the starter , the work was written with a purpose : to teach the jews not to worship the gods of the babylonians . instead , to worship only the lord . the letter ( epistle ) is part of the septuagint . there is no evidence of it ever having been rule bearing in the jewish tradition . the earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in christian tradition is in the work of origen of alexandria , as reported by eusebius in his church history . origen listed lamentations and the letter of jeremiah as one unit with the book of jeremiah proper , among `` the canonical books as the hebrews have handed them down '' .
