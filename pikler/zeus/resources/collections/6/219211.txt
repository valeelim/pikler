Coccolith     coccoliths are the microscopic plates which form chalk . they are made by one of the most important eukaryote phytoplankton . these are single celled protists whose full name is coccolithophorids or coccolithophores . the spherical skeleton of coccoliths is a `` coccosphere '' . chalk makes up much of the marine strata in the upper cretaceous period , and is 95 % to 99 % made up of coccoliths , the calcium carbonate ( caco ) plates which coccolithophorids produce . coccoliths were first examined by cristian gottfried ehrenberg ( 1795â€“1875 ) , who thought they were inorganic products . they were named , and identified as made by living organisms by thomas henry huxley , who realised they were a major part of the rock we call chalk . the story of how the tiny cell produces its coccosphere is told by westbroek : coccolithophores are a major contributor to the carbonate in deep sea sediments . in the northeast atlantic during the last glacial-interglacial cycle ( ice age ) , coccoliths make up 70-80 % of the total carbonate during the warm periods , and less during glacial times .
