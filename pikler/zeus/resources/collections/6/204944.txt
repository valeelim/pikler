Metamorphism     metamorphism , in geology , is the change of the structure , texture , or composition of rocks . ( an aggregation of solid matter composed of one or more of the minerals forming the earth 's crust ) . the scientific study of rocks is called petrology . rocks are commonly divided , according to their origin , into three major classesâ€”igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . they are caused by the effects of heat , deforming pressure , shearing stress , hot/chemically active fluids , or a combination of these . all of these changes occur while the rock remains essentially in the solid state . in theory , rocks are formed when the things surrounding them are in equilibrium with ambient physical conditions . if the conditions are changed by movements in the earth 's crust or by igneous activity , metamorphism occurs to reestablish equilibrium and changes the physical character of the rock mass .
