End–Ordovician extinction event     the end–ordovician extinction event is the third-largest extinction event of the phanerozoic eon . the ordovician period followed the cambrian and was followed by the silurian . there were no living things on the land except for bacteria and perhaps some single-celled algae . the biota was almost entirely marine . the extinction came in two steps , at the start and the finish of the `` hirnantian '' stage , which was the last stage of the ordovician . basic mechanism : climate changes from very warm to very cold and back to very warm . changes in ocean circulation were the results of the climate changes . both benthic ( ocean bottom ) and pelagic fauna were faced with conditions they were unable to cope with . more than 100 invertebrate families becam extinct in the end–ordovician extinction event , and a total of almost half the genera . the brachiopods and bryozoans were decimated , along with many of the trilobite , conodont and graptolite families . the cause was probably the rise and erosion of the appalachian mountains . the rise put much co into the atmosphere , and the erosion took it out .
