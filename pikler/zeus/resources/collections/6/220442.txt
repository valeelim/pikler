Brachiopod     brachiopods are a phylum of small marine shellfish , sometimes called lampshells . they are not common today , but in the palaeozoic they were one of the most common types . they lived near the shore ( littoral zone ) , but now they have been pushed into deeper water by competition from bivalve molluscs . at their peak in the palaeozoic era the brachiopods occupied a number of marine ecological niches . they were among the most abundant filter-feeders and reef-builders . many sat on the sea floor , but some swam in the jet-propulsion style of scallops . brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate changes during the paleozoic era . they do look rather like bivalves , but their internal organisation is quite different . their mostly calcium carbonate shells or `` valves '' have upper and lower surfaces , unlike the left and right arrangement in bivalve molluscs . brachiopod valves are hinged at the rear end . the front can be opened for feeding or closed for protection . two major groups are recognized , articulate and inarticulate . articulate brachiopods have toothed hinges and simple opening and closing muscles , while inarticulate brachiopods have untoothed hinges and a more complex system of muscles used to fit the two halves together . in a typical brachiopod a stalk-like pedicle goes from an opening in one of the valves ( the pedicle valve ) . it attaches the animal to the seabed but clear of silt that would block the opening .
