B-flat major     b major or b-flat major is a major scale starting on b-flat . its key signature has two flats . its relative minor is g minor , and its parallel minor is b minor . b-flat major is a good key for most wind instruments , especially those for which it is their home key , such as clarinets , trumpets , saxophones , and the flutes in b-flat . because of this , many works for concert bands ( those you might have played in while you were at school ) are written in this or a closely related key such as f major or e-flat major . haydn 's symphony no . 98 , which had both trumpet and timpani , is known as the first symphony that anyone had written in that key . actually , his brother michael haydn had written one earlier . however , joseph haydn still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an f major key signature ( instead of transposing with a c major key signature ) , something that made things easier and made more sense . five of mozart 's piano concerti are in b-flat major . well-known classical compositions in this key .
