Soda bread     the soda bread is a kind of soft , golden bread made with baking soda . in its most basic form it contains only four ; flour , salt , baking soda , and buttermilk . yet it can be changed when you add other ingredients . for instance , if you add a little sugar , some raisins , then cut in some butter , it may become a `` raisin '' soda bread . soda bread does not use yeast to get its rise , instead the rise comes from baking soda reacting with the acid ( soured milk or buttermilk ) . this makes it a 'quick ' bread that can be made in under 15 minutes . the important thing to remember is to have mix and the dough quickly and lightly . this will give you a bread that is dense , but not doughy , with a tender , slightly . once the dough is formed into a round , a cross is cut on the top of the bread , which divides it into quarters called farls .
