Entoprocta     entoprocta , or kamptozoa , is a phylum of tiny sessile aquatic animals ranging from 0.1 to 7 millimetres ( 0.004 to 0.28 in ) long . mature individuals are goblet-shaped , on relatively long stalks . they are filter-feeders , with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth . both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown . the superficially similar bryozoa ( ectoprocta ) have the anus outside a 'crown ' of hollow tentacles . most families of entoprocts are colonial , and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine . a few solitary species can move slowly . some species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch , and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs . after hatching , the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface . there they metamorphose , and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180Â° , so that the mouth and anus face upwards . both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning .
