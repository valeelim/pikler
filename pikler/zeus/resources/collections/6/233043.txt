Post-impressionism     post-impressionism ( or post-impressionism ) is a term used to describe the development of french art after manet ( 1832â€“1883 ) . the british artist and art critic roger fry used the term in 1910 , and it is now a standard art term . fry organized the 1910 exhibition `` manet and the post-impressionists '' . the post-impressionists were artists of the late 19th century who saw the work of the french impressionist painters and were influenced by them . their art styles grew out of the style called impressionism . the word `` post- '' means `` after '' , so `` post-impressionist '' painting came after `` impressionist '' painting . these artists developed impressionism but rejected its limitations . they continued using the real-life subject matter , with vivid colours , often with thick paint . however , they added other ideas . using geometric forms , to distorting form for effect , and using unnatural colours are some of their ways . the critic rewald said `` the term 'post-impressionism ' is not a very precise one , though a very convenient one '' .
