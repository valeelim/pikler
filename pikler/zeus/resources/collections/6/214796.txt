Fitness     fitness in biology is the relative ability of an organism to survive and pass on its genes to the next generation . it is a central idea in evolutionary theory . fitness is usually equal to the proportion of the individual 's genes in all the genes of the next generation . like all terms in evolutionary biology , fitness is defined in terms of an interbreeding population , which might or might not be a whole species . if differences in individual genotypes affect fitness , then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations ; the genotypes with higher fitness become more common . this is the process called natural selection . an individual 's fitness is caused by its phenotype , and passed on by its genotype . the fitnesses of different individuals with the same genotype are not necessarily equal . it depends on the environment in which the individuals live , and on accidental events . however , since the fitness of the genotype is an averaged quantity , it reflects the reproductive outcomes of `` all '' individuals with that genotype .
