Orientability     in the euclidean space , `` r '' is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure ( for example , ) can not be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image ( ) . otherwise the surface is non-orientable . a concept connected to this is chirality . this means that no matter what , a human right hand , can not be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand . the right hand is therefore orientable .
