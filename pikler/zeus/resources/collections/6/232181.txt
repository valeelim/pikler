Paranasal sinuses     paranasal sinuses are parts of the nasal cavity . they are usually counted to be part of the respiratory system . they are mucous membranes , which are mostly inside bones . these bones are then filled with air , which makes the skull look bigger , without adding much extra weight . prenasal cavities can be found in mammals , most birds , dinosaurs , and crocodilians . since sinuses are in virtually all land vertebrates , they must have a function . they are covered with a mucosa , epidermal cells which are moist and make mucus . this moistens and warms the air on its way into the lungs . the mucus also picks up particles which come in with the air . a variety of possible functions have been proposed : - decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull , and especially the bones of the face . - increasing resonance of the voice . - providing a buffer against face damage . - insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity .
