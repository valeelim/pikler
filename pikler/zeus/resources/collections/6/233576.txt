X86     x86 is a term used to describe a cpu instruction set compatible with the intel 8086 and its successors , including the pentium , core 2 , core i7 , athlon , opteron , sempron , and phenom . this is the cpu architecture used in most desktop and laptop computers . many 21st century workstations and servers also use x86 processors . in 1985 , the original 16-bit x86 architecture was extended to 32 bits with the introduction of the i386 processor . it was extended again to 64 bits in 2003 with the introduction of the amd opteron processor . intel adopted the 64-bit computing bit architecture in 2004 with the later versions of the prescott pentium 4. the different versions are backward-compatible , meaning that a 32-bit x86 cpu can run a 32-bit or 16-bit operating system , and a 64-bit x86 cpu can run a 16 , 32 , or 64-bit operating system . all x86 cpus ( with the rare exception of some intel cpus used in embedded systems ) start in 16-bit real mode . a modern operating system ( or sometimes the bootloader ) switches the cpu into 32-bit protected mode or 64-bit computing64-bit long mode before booting the kernel .
