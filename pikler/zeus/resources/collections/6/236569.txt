Empress Jingū     , also known as was a legendary empress of japan . although her name was once included in the traditional order of succession , she is now considered as a regent . historians consider details about the life of empress jingū to be mythical ; and the name jingū '' -tennō '' was created for him posthumously by later generations . no certain dates can be assigned to this empress 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . jingū is almost certainly a legend ; but the `` kojiki '' and `` nihonshoki '' record her name . jingū was the principle wife of emperor chūai her son would become known as emperor ōjin . the `` gukanshō '' mentions her , but she is not included on the list of persons born within the line of imperial descent . the limited information about jingū does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei .
