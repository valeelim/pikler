Theodosius Dobzhansky     theodosius dobzhansky , or theodore dobzhansky , ( 24 january 1900 â€“ 18 december 1975 ) was a noted geneticist and an evolutionary biologist . dobzhansky was born in the ukraine ( then part of imperial russia ) and emigrated to the united states in 1927. he was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work on the fruit-fly `` drosophila '' . he did research on these flies in california , mostly on populations of `` drosophila pseudoobscura '' . dobzhansky was important in the modern evolutionary synthesis , which was the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics . at school dobzhansky collected butterflies and beetles , and studied biology at kiev university . after graduation he moved to st petersburg ( then called leningrad ) , and studied under yuri filipchenko , who had a `` drosophila '' lab . dobzhansky collected coccinellidae ( ladybird beetles ) in the wild , and explored their genetics . dobzhansky emigrated to the united states in 1927. he worked with thomas hunt morgan at columbia university , who had pioneered the use of fruit flies ( `` drosophila melanogaster '' ) in genetics experiments . he followed morgan to the california institute of technology from 1930 to 1940. dobzhansky took fruit fly research out of the laboratory and into the field . he discovered that regional varieties of flies were more similar to each other genetically than to flies from other regions .
