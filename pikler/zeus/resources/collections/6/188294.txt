Injection     an injection ( often called a `` shot '' ) is putting liquid into the body , usually with a needle and a syringe . there are many different kinds of injections , such as : - intradermal ( just under the top layer of the skin ) - subcutaneous ( into the fat layer under the skin ) - intramuscular ( into a muscle ) - intravenous ( into a vein ) - intraosseous ( into a bone ) - intraperitoneal ( into the abdominal cavity ) injections can be used to prevent illness or to give medicine . injections that prevent illness put a dead or weakened version of the virus they want to prevent into the body . the body then 'remembers ' the virus to make future encounters of the virus easier to manage .
