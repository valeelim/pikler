Turbojet     a turbojet is a kind of jet engine that works by squeezing air into a small space , mixing it with fuel , and setting it on fire . the mixture of fuel and air goes out the back of the engine and pushes it forward . as it leaves the engine it spins a turbine which turns a compressor at the front which sucks in more air and compresses it . turbofan engines are more complex . they are more common today because they can make more power for the same amount of fuel than a turbojet . they also make less noise . supersonic aircraft still use the simpler kind .
