Intensive care unit     an intensive care unit ( icu ) , critical care unit ( ccu ) , intensive therapy unit ( itu ) , or intensive treatment unit ( itu ) is a special part of a hospital . usually , people that are very sick are sent there . they need to be looked at by a nurse or doctor very closely in case they get more sick while at the hospital . some icus may work with only one type of injuries . in 1854 , florence nightingale went to the crimean war . there it was important to separate seriously wounded soldiers from less-seriously wounded . nightingale reduced death rates from 40 % to 2 % by creating the concept of intensive care . because of a polio epidemic , bj√∏rn ibsen established the first intensive care unit in copenhagen in 1953. patients with polio require more ventilation than normal ; this is why ibsen set up a special unit for them . the first person to use this idea in the united states was dr. william mosenthal , a surgeon at the dartmouth-hitchcock medical center .
