Emperor Kōrei     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that kōrei ruled from the palace of `` ihoto-no-miya '' at kuroda in what will come to be known as yamato province . kōrei is almost certainly a legend . the `` kojiki '' records only his name and genealogy . the `` nihonshoki '' includes kōrei as the sixth of . kōrei was the eldest son of emperor kōan . `` jinnō shōtōki '' records that his mother was oshihime , who was the daughter of ametarashihiko-kunio-shihito-no-mikoto . some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors . these critics consider kōrei 's great-grandson ( emperor sujin ) to be the earliest to have actually existed . the absence of information about kōrei does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei .
