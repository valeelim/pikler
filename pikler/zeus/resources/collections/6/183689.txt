History of post-Soviet Russia     because of the end of the soviet union , russia went through a large change politically , economically , and militarily . first off the soviet union became the russian federation . people now consider that the federation is a follow up of the soviet union . however , post-soviet russia lacked the military and political power of the former ussr . now that communism died , russia could elect a president . in june 1991 , boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia . boris yeltsin told his people that he would help the economy . one thing he did was help improve trade with other countries . however , not all his ideas would be good . when yeltsin lifted price controls , a sudden increase in prices occurred ( hyperinflation ) . because the military was hit hard during the fall of the soviet union , many plants laid off workers because the government was not sending the plants any new orders . this lead to large unemployment . in august 1998 the russian government devalued the ruble and defaulted on their debt . this was called the 1998 russian financial crisis . this was due in part to the asian financial crisis and the war in chechnya . many banks were forced to close down . the government stopped making payment of wages , pensions and when workers were paid , it was often with goods rather than rubles .
