Africanized honeybee     africanized honeybees are a hybrid of the european honeybee and african bees . they are more dangerous and defensive than regular honeybees . because of this , some people call them 'killer bees ' . about fifty years ago , scientists brought african and european bees to brazil , in south america , to see if they could mate them . they wanted to do this to make a bee that would make more honey in a hotter place . scientists called these new bees `` africanized honeybees '' . these bees , however , were very different from regular honeybees . they would suddenly leave the colony and build a hive somewhere else . scientists found out that the queen would decide to leave after a few months , usually taking half the colony with her . they could even take over european hives by killing the european queen bee and making their own queen bee the `` queen '' africanized honeybees are much more protective of their beehive and more likely to sting . when one of them get surprised or scared , they all attack together and sting the same animal or person with hundreds of stings . actually , their sting is the same as a regular honeybee 's , but because they sting all together , they are much more dangerous . they usually chase their target much farther than regular honeybees , and they stay angry and ready to fight for a much longer time . they have many more `` guard '' bees than regular honeybees . however , if left alone , they 'll usually not attack .
