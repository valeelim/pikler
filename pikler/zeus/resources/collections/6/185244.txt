Cotyledon     a cotyledon , or seed leaf , is a leaf that is stored in a seed . when the seed sprouts , the cotyledons are the first leaves that the plant has . monocot plants have only one cotyledon , and other plants have two . cotyledons often look very different from the other leaves , so they are not called true leaves . plants use cotyledons to make sugars through photosynthesis . they use the sugars to keep true leaves growing . after a while , the cotyledons often die because the plant does not need them anymore .
