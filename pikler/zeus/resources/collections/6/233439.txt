Battle of Salamis     the battle of salamis was a battle between an alliance of greek city-states and the achaemenid empire of persia . it happened in september 480 bc in the straits between the mainland and salamis island . it was part of the greco-persian wars . although heavily outnumbered , the greek allies were persuaded by the athenian general themistocles to bring the persian fleet to battle again . the persian king xerxes was also anxious for a decisive battle . the persian navy sailed into the straits of salamis and tried to block both entrances . in the cramped conditions of the straits the great persian numbers were an active hindrance , as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised . seizing the opportunity , the greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory , sinking or capturing at least 200 persian ships . as a result , xerxes retreated to asia with much of his army , leaving mardonius to complete the conquest of greece . however , the following year , the rest of the persian army was decisively beaten at the battle of plataea and the persian navy at the battle of mycale . afterwards the persians made no more attempts to conquer the greek mainland . these battles of salamis and plataea mark a turning point in the greco-persian wars ; from then on , the greek cities would take the offensive .
