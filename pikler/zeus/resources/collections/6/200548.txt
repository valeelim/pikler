Rest mass     rest mass ( physics ) , the mass of a body as measured when the body is at rest , but it is relative to an observer who is moving or not , an inherent property of the body . all matter , such as any object , has some rest mass . energy , such as light or kinetic energy ( the energy of a moving object ) has no rest mass because it causes no change in spacetime in a frozen time frame . however , energy affects mass while time passes ; therefore , it affects spacetime , so it has mass .
