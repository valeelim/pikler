Superfluidity     superfluidity is a very special state of matter where a liquid can act very strangely . some of the things a superfluid can do is : - it can flow extremely easily . ( how easily a liquid can flow is called its viscosity . ) in fact , it flows so easily that friction does not change the way it flows ; it has zero viscosity . because of this , it can actually flow out of a container , like a bowl , even when the bowl is not tipped so the liquid can spill out . - it stays still when its container is spun , instead of starting a whirlpool like when a sink full of water is drained . however , a whirlpool does form if the container is spun at and above a certain speed . so far , scientists have only been able to create superfluids at extremely cold temperatures . however , superfluids have quite a few uses in science today , like : - superfluid helium at -271.4 degrees celsius [ -456.2 degrees fahrenheit was used in a special satellite in 1983 to get information on infrared waves in space . - superfluids can be used in gyroscopes , to help machines predict information about gravity movements that ca n't be picked up with regular instruments only .
