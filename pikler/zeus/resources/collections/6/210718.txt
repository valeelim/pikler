Texas Revolution     in the 1820s , americans began to migrate to texas , which was part of mexico at the time . at first the government thought this was good , but soon many more americans than mexicans lived in texas . the leaders of mexico began to worry that they might lose texas to the americans and so they decided to stop all immigration from the united states . to make things worse , mexico had a new president , antonio l√≥pez de santa anna , who threw out the mexican constitution and made himself president for life . he sent soldiers to texas to make sure that the texans would n't try to secede ( separate ) from mexico . americans and mexicans living in texas joined together to fight the mexican army . the war lasted from october 2 , 1835 to april 21 , 1836. a famous battle in this war was the battle of the alamo in which about 200 texans were killed . after the war , texas was declared an independent country , and called itself the republic of texas it remained an independent country for ten years . in 1845 congress voted to admit texas as a slave state , making texas the country 's 28th state .
