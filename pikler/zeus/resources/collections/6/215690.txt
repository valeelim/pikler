Standard error     the standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic . the term may also be used for an estimate ( good guess ) of that standard deviation taken from a sample of the whole group . the average of some part of a group ( called a sample ) is the usual way to estimate the average for the whole group . it is often too hard or costs too much money to measure the whole group . but if a different sample is measured , it will have an average that is a little bit different from the first sample . the standard error of the mean is a way to know how close the average of the sample is to the average of the whole group . it is a way to know how sure you can be about the average from the sample . in real measurements , the true value of the standard deviation of the mean for the whole group is usually not known . so the term `` standard error '' is often used to mean a close guess to the true number for the whole group . the more measurements there are in a sample , the closer the guess will be to the true number for the whole group .
