Dicynodont     the dicynodontia are a group of therapsids . they were small to large herbivorous animals with two tusks , hence their name , which means 'two dog tooth ' . they are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids , with over 70 genera known . all of them had the same basic body plan . they were built like small tanks , with sturdy legs at each corner . they were not fast movers , but were obviously strong and lived in groups rather as many herbivores do today . their body shape was similar to certain types of modern mammals such as pigs and rhinoceros . fossils discovered in poland indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until the latest upper triassic . six fragments of fossil skull bone discovered in australia ( queensland ) may indicate that dicynodonts survived into the cretaceous in southern gondwana . the dicynodonts were a group of therapsids , but were not ancestors to the mammals . the group which evolved into mammals was the cynodonts .
