Ludwig II of Bavaria     ludwig ii ( 25 august 1845 in nymphenburg palace – 13 june 1886 in lake starnberg ) was king of bavaria from 1864 until shortly before his death ( bavaria is now part of germany , but at that time it was a separate country ) . he is well known for his support for the composer richard wagner . he is often referred to as the mad king ludwig because his behaviour was very odd . for example , he would leave his castle by climbing out of the window instead of walking out of the door . he is sometimes referred to as the swan king in english and `` der märchenkönig '' ( the fairy tale king ) in german . this is because he built several very expensive and fancy castles , the most famous one being neuschwanstein . it is not clear whether his death by drowning was suicide or whether he was murdered . today tourists from all over the world visit the castles that he built . they also visit the bayreuth festspielhaus for which he gave a lot of money towards the building .
