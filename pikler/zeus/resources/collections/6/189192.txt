Floating point     real numbers in binary have to be stored in a special way in a computer . there is no decimal point in the binary system so the computer has a method of understanding decimals . this is called floating-point representation . the decimal point in a real number is called a `` floating point '' because it can be placed anywhere - it is not fixed . because of this , a computer will divide a number into two parts . these are called the mantissa and the exponent . the mantissa is found by taking the real number and removing the decimal point , for example : 1101 . 0111 would become 1101 0111 the exponent is the number of spaces the decimal point has moved . in the example above , the decimal point moved 4 places to the left , so the exponent is 0000 0100 ( this is binary for 4 ) . if the decimal point moves to right , the exponent is negative . for example , 0000 . 0111 ( mantissa - 0000 0111 ) < br > here , the exponent is -1. the binary number for this is 1111 1111 ( see negative binary numbers ) the result is found by putting the mantissa and exponent together . the results for the examples above are :
