Deep-level tube lines     deep-level tube lines were built by tunnelling shields and are tunnels that are deep underground that allow trains to run through them . they are commonly found on the london underground . an example is the victoria line . bakerloo , central , jubilee , northern , piccadilly , victoria and waterloo & city lines are the deep level lines . they are very hard to find air ventilation as they are the deepest . but the very deepest line is the northern line . on the northern line it is absolutely difficult to replace the train as it is ultimately the deepest line in the entire network . subject to that , the ventilation is very difficult and there is not a lot of fans that are there to cool the trains down . even in the event of a emergency the people trapped on-board can not get off due to the insufficient space inside the tunnel compared to the subsurface line .
