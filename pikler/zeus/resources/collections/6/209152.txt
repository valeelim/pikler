Five Suns     five suns is an aztec myth about how the world was created . it says that there were four other suns before our own , because different gods served as the sun at different times : 1. the first sun was tezcatlipoca but he fought with his brother quetzalcoatl and was knocked out of the sky . the humans of this age were all eaten by tezcatlipoca 's jaguars . 1. quetzalcoatl himself became the second sun but tezcatlipoca turned all humans into monkeys . quetzalcoatl destroyed these monkeys with a hurricane and left the sky to create new humans . 1. the god of rain , tlaloc , became the third sun but then tezcatlipoca kidnapped his wife . all rains stopped and when humans asked him for water , tlaloc destroyed earth with a rain of fire . 1. the fourth sun was chalchiuhtlicue , who loved humans very much . but tezcatlipoca told her she was selfish and she started crying , causing a flood that killed everyone on earth . 1. the current , fifth sun is huitzilopochtli who fights every day against coyolxauhqui , goddess of the moon . aztecs believed that this sun would disappear , too , if they did n't support huitzilopochtli by killing humans .
