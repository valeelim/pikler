FIDE     fide ( fédération internationale des échecs ) is the world chess organisation . all national federations are members . it decides matters like world championships and changes in rules of the game . fide was founded on 20 july 1924 in paris , france . however , it had little influence until the end of world war ii . the reigning world champion at that time , alexander alekhine , did not want to have anything to do with it . he regarded the world title as his personal property . this only changed when he died with the title , in 1946 ( no other champion has ever died while holding the title ) . it was obvious that some method was needed to find a new champion . fide stepped in and , with russian backing , put forward a solution . the strong soviet chess federation only joined fide in 1946. it had a great influence , with resources and many young strong players . in 1948 a tournament was organized to determine which of the world top players was entitled to call himself world champion . the death of alekhine had left a vacuum . two previous champions , emanuel lasker and josé raúl capablanca had died in the late 1930s . it was clear that a new champion would come from the younger players .
