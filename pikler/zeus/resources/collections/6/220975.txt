Sauropelta     sauropelta was an armoured dinosaur from the lower cretaceous . it looked a lot like its more advanced relative `` ankylosaurus '' , but did n't have the bony nodes at the end of its tail . anatomically , `` sauropelta '' is one of the best-understood nodosaurids , with fossilized remains recovered in the u.s. states of wyoming , montana , and possibly utah . it is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid ; most of its remains date to about 115 to 110 million years ago . it was a medium-sized nodosaurid , measuring about 5 meters ( 16.5 ft ) long . `` sauropelta '' had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length . although its body was smaller than a modern black rhinoceros , `` sauropelta '' was about the same mass , weighing in at about 1,500 kilograms ( 3,300 lb ) . the extra weight was largely due to its extensive armour , including the large spines projecting from its neck . as in other ankylosaurs , thick triangular scutes projected above and behind the eyes , as well as below and behind the eyes . more typically for nodosaurids , leaf-shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws , used for cutting plant material . the front end of the skull is unknown , but there would have been a keratinous beak .
