Chalcedonian Creed     the chalcedonian creed is a creed which was made during the council of chalcedon in the year 451. this council is one of the seven ecumenical councils . it is recognised by the eastern orthodox , the catholics , and by many protestant churches . it is the first council the oriental orthodox church does not not recognize . the chalcedonian creed was written during a controversy between the western and eastern churches . they could not agree about the meaning of incarnation , the influence of the emperor in the church , and the role of the roman pope . the western churches had no problems accepting the creed , but some eastern churches had . the creed became doctrine in the orthodox church . the coptic church of alexandria disagreed . they used cyril 's formula instead . they said that the creed should say that christ be acknowledged `` from two natures '' rather than `` in two natures '' .
