Walther Flemming     walther flemming ( 21 april 1843 – 4 august 1905 ) was a german biologist and a founder of cytogenetics . making use of dyes he was able to find a structure which he named chromatin . he identified that chromatin was correlated to threadlike structures in the cell nucleus– the chromosomes ( meaning `` coloured body '' ) . edouard van beneden ( 1846–1910 ) had also observed them , independently . flemming investigated the process of cell division and the distribution of chromosomes to the daughter nuclei , a process he called mitosis from the greek word for thread . however , he did not see the splitting into identical halves , the daughter chromatids . he studied mitosis , both in life and in stained preparations , using as the source of biological material the fins and gills of salamanders . these results were published first in 1878 and in 1882 in the seminal book `` zellsubstanz , kern und zelltheilung '' ( 1882 ; cell substance , nucleus and cell division ) . on the basis of his discoveries , flemming surmised for the first time that all cell nuclei came from another predecessor nucleus ( he coined the phrase `` omnis nucleus e nucleo '' , after virchow 's `` omnis cellula e cellula '' ) .
