Light-dependent reaction     in the light-dependent reaction , light energy from the sun is used to split water ( photolysis ) . which has been taken in by plants . water , when broken , makes oxygen , hydrogen , and electrons . these electrons move through structures in chloroplasts and by chemiosmosis , make atp . the hydrogen is converted to nadph which is then used in the light-independent reactions . oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis . this all happens in the grana thylakoid of chloroplasts . the movement of electrons . 1. light hits the chloroplast , it absorbs light and traps it . 1. chlorophyll channels the light down to a reaction center . 1. an electron at the reaction center is excited to a higher energy level , and is received by an electron acceptor . this electron is taken from the splitting of water : ( h2o â†’ 1/2o2 + 2h+ + 2e- ) 1. the electron is passed along a series of electron carriers . it is moving down energy levels and losing energy . this energy causes the pumping of hydrogen from the cytoplasm of chlorophyll into thylakoid spaces inside the grana . the hydrogen diffuses and flows back into the cytoplasm through protein channels . as the hydrogen diffuses down a concentration gradient , atp is made from adp and inorganic phosphate .
