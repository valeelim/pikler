Cluster (computing)    cluster ( computing ) in computing , a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand . clusters can have different forms : they can be whole computers working together , or only cpus . these cpus can communicate over a fast network , but they share the same hard disks , for example . depending on the problem , solving it with a cluster of cheaper components can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more . grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem . they are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are .
