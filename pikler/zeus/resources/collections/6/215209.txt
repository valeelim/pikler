Population genetics     population genetics is the branch of genetics which studies the genetic composition of populations . it brings together genetics , evolution , natural selection , breeding , statistics and mathematics . mathematical and computer models are produced , and field research is done to test the models . starting , perhaps , with g. udny yule 's paper in 1902 , population theorists tackled key issues in genetics and evolution . g.h . hardy and wilhelm weinberg showed that if a population had random mating , no selection , migration or mutation , then the proportion of alleles would remain the same generation after generation . this was the hardyâ€“weinberg law , the first great result of this new field of research . population genetics made great progress from 1918 to 1937. during this period , ronald fisher , j.b.s . haldane and sewall wright worked on the connection between evolution and genetics , using new mathematical techniques , such as statistical probability . e.b . ford and theodosius dobzhansky did field research on the genetics of natural populations of lepidoptera and `` drosophila '' , respectively . broadly speaking , this work proved that the newly rediscovered mendelian genetics could be reconciled with darwinian evolution . this laid the groundwork for the modern evolutionary synthesis , which took place in the following years , from about 1937 to 1953 .
