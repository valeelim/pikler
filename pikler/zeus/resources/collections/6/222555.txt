Extremophile     an extremophile is an `` organism '' ( a living thing ) which lives best in extreme conditions that are harmful to most life on earth . they are different from organisms that live in normal places , called `` mesophiles '' or `` neutrophiles '' . in the 1980s and 1990s , biologists found that microbes can survive in extreme environments . these are niches that are extreme in some way . they may be extremely hot , or cold , or dry , or under huge pressure , or very salty or acidic . complex orgamisms , such as animals or plants , can not live in these environments . some scientists suggest that life may have begun on earth in hydrothermal vents far below the ocean surface . environments such as hot oceans , hot springs and deep ocean hydrothermal vents would have been common during the archaean eon , about 3.9 billion years ago . early forms of life lived in those conditions . most known extremophiles are microbes . the domain archaea has well-known examples of extremophiles , but some bacteria are also extremophiles . it is a mistake to use the term extremophile for all archaeans , since some of them are mesophilic . not all extremophiles are unicellular : some extreme environments have animals which are multicellular .
