Emperor Suinin     no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . the conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of emperor kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the yamato dynasty . the `` gukanshō '' records that suinin he ruled from the palace of `` tamaki-no-miya '' at makimuku in what will come to be known as yamato province . suinin is almost certainly a legend ; but the `` kojiki '' and `` nihonshoki '' record his name and genealogy . he was the third son of emperor sujin and empress sukulito sakayamas . the limited information about suinin does not imply that no such person ever existed . very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , emperor kimmei . one of suinin 's daughters was yamatohime-no-mikoto . she established a site for ceremonies honouring the shinto sun goddess ( amaterasu omikami ) . in the region of ise , she founded the ise shrine . she became the first saiō at ise .
