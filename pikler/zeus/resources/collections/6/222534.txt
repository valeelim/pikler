Nucleosome     nucleosomes are the building blocks which make up chromosomes . they consist of a segment of dna wound around a histone protein core . first , dna and a protein make up chromatin . then the chromatin is packed up into nucleosomes . nucleosomes are then packaged up to make a chromosome . the packages do three things : the chromosomes function in cell division ; the very long dna is wrapped up in a shorter package ; and the proteins regulate the gene action in cells . nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin . this packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled . in mammalian cells about two metres of linear dna have to be packed into a nucleus of roughly 10 Âµm diameter . nucleosomes are folded , in a series of higher order structures , to form a chromosome . this folding compacts the dna and adds a layer of regulatory control . the control ensures correct gene expression . nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information , as modifications of their core histones . this information can be passed on to daughter cells , but it usually wiped out by meiosis in germ cells .
