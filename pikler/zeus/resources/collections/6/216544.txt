Book Off     book off ( ) is japan ’ s biggest chain of second hand bookstores . it is operated by book off corporation limited . the first book off store opened in may , 1990. the first franchisee book off store opened in nov , 1991. the success of the business expanded to 917 stores in japan and 14 stores abroad ( 8 in us , 3 in france , 2 in korea , and 1 in canada ) . book off sells books including comic books , magazines , and novels , and also sells cds , dvds , and game software . books are grouped by genres , writers , and prices . the overseas book off stores sell second hand books from japan and also from its own country . book off not only sells the second hand books , but also buys the books from customers . for that reason book off ’ s theme copy is “ お売りください ” which means “ please , sell us your book ” . the company uses this copy rather than ” we buy your book ” to show respect to customers . some book off chains , especially ones abroad , have various signboard designs , but still they share the symbol colors of book off which are yellow , blue , and red . book off has its mascot `` yomuyomukun ( mr. yomu-yomu ) '' holding a book in his hands . `` yomu ( 読む ) '' in japanese means `` read '' . another uniqueness of book off is the employees ’ loud greeting . employees shout “ いらっしゃいませ ! ( irashaimase ! : welcome ! ) ” when customers enter , and `` ありがとうございました ! ( arigatou gozaimasita ! : thank you ! ) ” when customers leave the shop . book off chain stores abroad also greet customers with japanese .
