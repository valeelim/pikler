Literacy test     the literacy test was a test that the african americans had to take to vote . they had to have some kind of knowledge of the united states and the test taker would ask how many states there were and how many senators were in each state . then the african american would have to sit and take the literacy test while the white man only had to pay $ 1.50 . this was another way the jim crow laws segregated or separated whites from blacks .
