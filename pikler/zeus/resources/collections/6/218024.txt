Cleidoic egg     the cleidoic egg ( from greek kleistos = closed ) is the type of egg which reptiles and birds lay . mammalian reproduction has evolved from laying cleidoic eggs to live birth . the cleidoic egg is sometimes called the amniotic egg , because it is characteristic of amniotes . these eggs have a protective shell , and are laid out of water . the shell is porous to air , and may be flexible or calcareous ( hard ) . the eggs contain all the food the embryo needs to develop into a hatchling . as a result , the amphibian 's larval stage , the tadpole , is not needed by reptiles or birds . the special membranes that support these eggs are typical traits of all amniotes , including mammals . the significance of the cleidoic egg is that it enables reproduction out of , and often away from , water . the cleidoic egg has been called `` a private little pond '' , from the way it gives water and nutrition to the embryo . cleidoic eggs must have evolved in the early or middle carboniferous , `` after '' the early tetrapods evolved , but `` before '' the amniotes split into sauropsids ( reptile ancestors ) and synapsids ( mammal ancestors ) .
