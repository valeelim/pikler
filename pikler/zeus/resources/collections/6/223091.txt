Angara (rocket family)    angara ( rocket family ) angara is a family of rockets which are being developed in russia . the family contains many different rockets . for example , there is a rocket for lifting small payloads and a rocket for lifting heavy payloads . the rockets are designed by a company called khrunichev state research and production space center . the first rocket is expected to be ready in 2012. angara is being developed using money given by the russian government . the government decided to finance angara because they wanted to make sure that russia has independent access to space . many of russia 's current rockets can only be launched from baikonour cosmodrome in kazakshtan . many of them also use foreign technology . however , angara is better since it does not use any foreign technology ( it is 100 % russian ) and can be launched from plesetsk cosmodrome , located in russian territory . another reason why it was decided to build angara is because russia needed a rocket which does not use toxic fuels , like some current rockets do .
