Fatty acid     a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid ( -c ( =o ) oh ) , with a long unbranched hydrocarbon tail . it is studied in organic chemistry and biochemistry . fatty acids are important sources of body fuel . when metabolized , they yield large quantities of atp . many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose . in particular , heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids . fatty acids may be either saturated or unsaturated . unsaturated compounds have reactive double bonds ; saturated ones do not . fatty acids are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from , or contained in , an animal or vegetable fat , oil , or wax . natural fatty acids commonly have a chain of four to 28 carbon atoms ( usually unbranched and even numbered ) , which may be saturated or unsaturated . this would include acetic acid , although this is not usually considered a fatty acid ( not a lipid ) . the blend of fatty acids in mammalian skin , together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid , are distinctive . they allow animals with a keen sense of smell to identify individuals .
