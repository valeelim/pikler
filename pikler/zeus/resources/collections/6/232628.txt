Winchester College football     winchester college football , also known as wincofo or winkies , is a style of football that is played at winchester college during the spring term or `` common time , '' as the winchester students refer to it . it was originally played during the autumn term , or `` short half . '' it is very similar to games played at other public schools such as eton 's wall game and harrow game . the school is located in the city of winchester in hampshire , england . it was originally played down kingsgate street , a long street that runs parallel to the college . however , there were very few rules . the only thing that has not changed is that the canvas ( the pitch it is played on ) is the same measurement as the part of the street it was originally played on . nobody knows when the game location was moved . however after a while it was moved away from the town to the grassland on the top of st. catherine 's hill . to stop the ball from going into the canal that is below , they used junior men from the college to go fetch it when it was not caught by the players . to some extent , this continues to be in the game because there are classmates used as watchers to catch stray balls . however , there were problems with this . the biggest is the lines of watchers were depleted due to players being too enthusiastic and colliding with each other , causing injuries . so they introduced ropes to mark out the border of the playing field . these are now essential tactics of the game .
