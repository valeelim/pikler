Kin selection     kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection . some animals cooperate with relatives , even if this brings risk to themselves . the classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals , or in colonial insects such as ants . many mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger . others cooperate in tasks , such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests . in all these cases where animals cooperate , the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves . it is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related . this is because related organisms have ( to a degree ) a shared genetic inheritance . the first to write about the concept were by r.a. fisher in 1930 , and j.b.s . haldane in 1955 , but it was w.d . hamilton who truly formalized the concept . the actual term `` kin selection '' was probably coined by john maynard smith , when he wrote : by cooperating , relatives influence each other 's fitness . under natural selection , a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency . a gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare .
