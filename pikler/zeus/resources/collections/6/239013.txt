3 Maccabees     the book of the 3 maccabees is found in most orthodox bibles . however , the book actually has nothing to do with the maccabees . it does not have anything to do with their revolt against the seleucid empire , either ( as described in 1 maccabees and 2 maccabees ) . instead , it tells the story of persecution of the jews under ptolemy iv philopator ( 222-205 bc ) . the name of the book seems to come from the similarities between this book and the stories of the martyrdom of eleazar and the maccabeean youths in 2 maccabees . the high priest shimon is also mentioned .
