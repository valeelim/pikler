Molar conductivity     molar conductivity is a scientific term . the molar conductivity of an electrolyte is a measure of how well it conducts electricity in solution . it is calculated by dividing the conductivity ( how well the electrolyte conducts electricity ) by the molar concentration ( how much the electrolyte is diluted : a solution means that it has been dissolved in something else : see solution ) . it is measured in siemens per metre per molarity . the symbol for molar conductivity is λ , or λm .
