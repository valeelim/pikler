Otto Loewi     otto loewi ( june 3 , 1873 - december 25 , 1961 ) was a german doctor . he won the 1936 nobel prize in physiology or medicine , along with henry hallett dale , for their discoveries about chemical transmission of nerve impulses in his most famous experiment , loewi took fluid from a frog heart with a slowed beat and applied it to another . that slowed the second heart . this showed that synaptic signalling used chemical messengers . it is now known that there are two different kinds of nerve synapses . one kind releases chemicals , and is a neurotransmitter synapse . the other is an electrical synapse which transmits voltage charges over gap junctions between nerve cells .
