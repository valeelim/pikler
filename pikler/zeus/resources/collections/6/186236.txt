Sexual fetishism     sexual fetishism ( also `` erotic fetishism '' or `` fetish '' ) is sexual arousal caused by an object or body part that is not normally thought of as sexual . the term was made in the late 1800s by alfred binet . partialism is a type of sexual fetishism where the sexual want of a body part is more than the sexual want of the person who has the body part . martin kafka states that partialism is not exactly the same as fetishism , although common use does not agree .
