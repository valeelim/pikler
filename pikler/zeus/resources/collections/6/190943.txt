Assisted suicide     assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide ( wants to die ) is helped to do this by someone else . normally , people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain , so they want someone to help them to die , for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them . some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide . the term euthanasia is sometimes used , although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide , as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves . the law about this varies a lot in different countries . in belgium , the netherlands , switzerland and in three american states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances . however , in many countries it is not allowed , and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison . some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries , such as switzerland , in order to end their life .
