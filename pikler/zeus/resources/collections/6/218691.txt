Homing pigeon     a homing pigeon is a special breed of pigeons . these pigeons have been domesticated . they have been selectively bred to find their way home . they can do this over very long distances . the wild rock pigeon from which these birds are bred also has this homing ability . this means that it will generally return to its own nest and its own mate . this made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances . flights as long as 1800 kilometers have been recorded by birds in competition pigeon racing . their average flying speed over moderate distances is around 48 km/h ( 30 mph ) , but even speeds of up to 95 km/h ( 59 mph ) have been observed . homing pigeons are called carrier pigeons when they are used to carry messages . this is possible where a message is written on thin light paper ( such as cigarette paper ) and rolled into a small tube attached to the bird 's leg ; this is called pigeon post . pigeons can only go back to one `` mentally marked '' point that they have identified as their home . so `` pigeon mail '' can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver 's pigeons . white homing pigeons are used in release dove ceremonies at weddings , funerals , and some sporting events .
