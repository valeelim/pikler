Tic     a tic is a sudden body movement that a person ca n't control . it might be a jerking movement of the hand , or blinking a lot , or a throat sound . even if the person is told that they are doing it , they usually ca n't stop . sometimes if they try really hard , they can make the tic go away for a little bit , but they ca n't make it go away all the time . it 's kind of like when you have something in your throat , eventually you just have to cough . tics can be either `` motor tics '' or `` phonic tics . '' if they are `` motor tics '' it means they 're movements , like blinking or shrugging shoulders . if they are `` phonic tics '' it means they 're sounds , like clearing your throat , sniffing , or yelling . tics are common in childhood , four to twelve percent of all children have from tics . very often they are transitory , they rarely last longer than six months . boys have tics more often than girls . about three times more boys than girls have tics . sometimes , people can have a `` tic '' in the family . some tics can be treated , usually with behaviour therapy . in cases where the tic is difficult to treat , antipsychotics are sometimes used .
