Paul Bunyan     paul bunyan is a fictional giant lumberjack . james macgillivray wrote about bunyan in 1910 , which is the earliest writing about bunyan that we know about . a few years later , in 1916 , william laughead was writing an advertisement , and decided to use bunyan in what he was writing , and decided to make him a giant . james stevens wrote a book called `` paul bunyan '' in 1925. this book said that french canadians people made up the paul bunyan stories during the papineau rebellion of 1837 , when they were fighting against england . this would explain why paul bunyan 's last name is `` bunyan '' , because `` bunyan '' sounds like the french-canadian slang word `` bonyenne '' , which is something that they might say when they are surprised , like how people who speak english might say `` good grief '' or `` my goodness '' . people told other people stories about bunyan , and the stories would change a little bit as they spread from person to person . often , paul bunyan is shown in pictures with a giant blue ox named babe . historians think that babe was not created until the 20th century for advertising .
