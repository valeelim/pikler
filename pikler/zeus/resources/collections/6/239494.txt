Stranger Than Fiction     stranger than fiction is the eighth album by american punk rock band bad religion , released in 1994. this was their first album released on the major label atlantic records ( however atlantic did re-release their previous album , `` recipe for hate '' ) and also its last release with guitarist brett gurewitz , who left just prior to the 1994-1995 world tour , but returned to the band seven years later . on tour , gurewitz was replaced by brian baker , who would stay with the band permanently . because of sales continuing sixteen years after its release , many consider `` stranger than fiction '' to be one of bad religion 's most successful albums , featuring two of their famous hits , `` infected '' and the re-recorded version of `` 21st century ( digital boy ) '' , which both earned airplay on mtv and radio stations , such as kroq . the latter single was originally recorded in 1990 on their fifth album `` against the grain '' . the album included two more , `` stranger than fiction '' and `` incomplete '' , which failed to make any national chart .
