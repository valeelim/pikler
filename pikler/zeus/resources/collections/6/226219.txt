Shawnee Park     shawnee park is a park in louisville , kentucky . it was created by frederick law olmsted , who made 18 of the city 's 123 public parks . along with the rest of the city 's olmsted-designed park system , shawnee park was added to the national register of historic places in 1982. shawnee park was first planned in 1890 to be one of the free flagship parks in louisville 's new park system . all three were found on the geographic edges of the city . in shawnee 's case , it was the western edge bordering the ohio river . the land at the time was still mostly used for truck farms , but it was clear residential development was imminent even without the park . shawnee was the slowest of the parks to create , as much of the land was already owned by investors who thought they could increase the sale price by holding out . the city had to force owners to sell the properties to obtain the land for the park , and won the case in 1895. in 1896 , the city started to create access to the park , another area in which shawnee was behind the other two parks . river park drive was laid out in 1899 , but the broadway entrance remained unfinished until 1914 .
