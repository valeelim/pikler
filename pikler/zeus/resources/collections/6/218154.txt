Carrier sense multiple access     carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) is a media access control ( mac ) protocol . when transmitting on a medium that is shared by many transmitters , the transmitter first checks to see that nothing else is already transmitting . examples of shared transmission medium include an electrical bus , or part of the electromagnetic spectrum . `` carrier sense '' means that a transmitter uses feedback from a receiver to know if the medium is already in use before trying to send . that is , it tries to find a signal from another station before trying to transmit . if a signal is found , the station waits for that transmission to end before starting its own transmission . `` multiple access '' means that many stations send and receive on the medium . transmissions are usually received by all other stations using the medium . related pages . - carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
