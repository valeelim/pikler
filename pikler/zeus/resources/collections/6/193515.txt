G-type main-sequence star     a gv star , or yellow dwarf , is a main-sequence star . it is of spectral type g and luminosity class v on the hertzsprung-russell diagram . the term `` yellow dwarf '' is a misnomer , because g-type stars actually range in color from white , for more luminous types like the sun , to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous g-type main-sequence stars . see spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type . gv stars are small ( about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses ) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 k. like other main-sequence stars , a gv star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion . our sun is the most commonly known ( and most easily seen ) example of a gv star . each second , it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium , changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy . other gv stars include alpha centauri a , tau ceti , and 51 pegasi . our own sun looks yellow through the earth 's atmosphere due to rayleigh scattering . without that , it would look white . even though the name `` dwarf '' is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars , yellow dwarfs like the sun are 90 % brighter than all of the stars in the milky way ( which are largely orange dwarfs , red dwarfs , and white dwarfs ) .
