Ecclesbourne Valley Railway     the ecclesbourne valley railway is a heritage railway in derbyshire . its operations are based at wirksworth station . it is currently planned to extend the railway along the former midland railway branch line which joined the main-line at duffield . when complete it will be one of the few heritage railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length . the line is operated by diesel locomotives , which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units . the `` wirksworth branch '' was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry . since 1835 wirksworth 's citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the north midland railway ( later the midland railway ) at duffield . the midland was initially uninterested , but then realised that the branch could be extended to rowsley . this was difficult , but the branch could avoid the section from ambergate , on its manchester , buxton , matlock and midlands junction railway , which was shared with its rival the london and north western railway .
