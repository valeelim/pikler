Protectionism     protectionism means that a country has laws or other rules that make it easier for their own products and brands to sell by making goods from foreign countries more expensive or harder to get . the idea of protectionism is to stop imports ( when people buy goods from other countries instead of from their own ) . mercantilism is one kind of protectionism . for example , if farmers from argentina are selling wheat at a lower price than french farmers are , french people would buy more wheat from argentine farmers than from french farmers , and french farmers would not get so much money . the benefits to protectionism is that some people in a country would make more money because they would be able to sell things at higher prices , but on the other hand , other people would lose money because they would n't be able to buy the things from other countries that sell them cheaper . many protectionists ( people who believe in protectionism ) support big tariffs ( taxes on a trade involving a foreign country ) because the government can get a lot of money from the tariffs .
