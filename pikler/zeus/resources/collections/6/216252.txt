Beringia     the bering land bridge joined present-day alaska and eastern siberia at times during the pleistocene ice ages . its greatest extension was about 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) north to south . it was not glaciated because snowfall was extremely light as the southwesterly winds from the pacific ocean lost their moisture over the fully glaciated alaska range . the grassland steppe , including the land bridge , that stretched for several hundred miles into the continents on either side has been called beringia . it is believed that a small human population of at most a few thousand survived the ice age in beringia . it was isolated from populations in asia for at least 5,000 years . sometime after 16,500 years ago , it started to populate the americas when the american glaciers that blocked the way southward melted . the bering strait , the chukchi sea to the north and the bering sea to the south , are all shallow seas ( `` maps , right '' ) . during cycles of global cooling , such as the most recent ice age , enough sea water became concentrated in the ice caps of the arctic and antarctica that the subsequent drop in sea levels exposed shallow sea floors that have subsequently re-flooded . other land bridges around the world have been created and re-flooded in the same way : approximately 14,000 years ago , mainland australia was linked to both new guinea and tasmania ; the british isles were an extension of continental europe via the dry bed of the english channel ; and the dry basin of the south china sea linked sumatra , java and borneo to the asian mainland .
