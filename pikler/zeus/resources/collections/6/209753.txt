Snake River Plain     the snake river plain is a valley in the u.s. state of idaho . it covers most of the southern part of the state and is transected by the snake river . the snake river plain was formed by magma rising up below the north american plate . as the plate moved westward , the magma melted rock under the plate . this melting caused the surface to drop and form the snake river plain . underneath the plain is the snake river aquifer . the aquifer is fed by the snake river and its tributaries . much of the soil in the snake river plain is fertile . as a result , today the primary human purpose of the plain is for agriculture .
