GABA     gaba is `` gamma '' -aminobutyric acid ( Î³-aminobutyric acid ) . it is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals . it is an `` inhibiting '' neurotransmitter . normally , when a neuron receives an impulse , it will make the signal stronger . in the case where there is an `` inhibiting '' neurotransmitter , the cell will no longer get the impulse , and the signal as a whole will be weakened . gaba regulates how much neurons in the central nervous system will be stimulated in humans , and other mammals . it plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system . in humans , gaba is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone . in insect species gaba acts only on excitatory nerve receptors . even though chemically it is an amino acid , gaba is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities . the term `` amino acid , '' used without a qualifier , refers to the alpha amino acids , which gaba is not . gaba is also not incorporated into proteins .
