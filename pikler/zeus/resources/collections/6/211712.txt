Paraffin     in chemistry , paraffin is the common name for the alkane hydrocarbons with the general formula ch . paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40 , inclusive . the simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane , ch , a gas at room temperature . heavier members of the series , such as that of octane , ch , and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature . the solid forms of paraffin , called `` paraffin wax '' , are from the heaviest molecules from ch to ch . paraffin wax was identified by carl reichenbach in 1830. paraffin , or `` paraffin hydrocarbon '' , is also the technical name for an alkane in general , but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear , or `` normal '' alkane â€” whereas branched , or `` iso '' alkanes are also called `` iso '' paraffins . it is distinct from the fuel known in ireland , britain and south africa as `` paraffin oil '' or just `` paraffin '' , which is called kerosene in most of the u.s. , australia and new zealand . the name is derived from the latin `` parum '' ( = barely ) + `` affinis '' with the meaning here of `` lacking affinity '' , or `` lacking reactivity '' . this is because alkanes , being non-polar and lacking in functional groups , are very unreactive .
