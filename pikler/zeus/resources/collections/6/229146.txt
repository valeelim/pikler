Eudimorphodon     eudimorphodon is a recently discovered pterosaur , and comes from shale laid down upper triassic rocks in italy . a nearly complete skeleton was found in 1973. this showed it was a member of the long-tailed sub-order of pterosaurs , the rhamphorhynchoidea . `` eudimorphodon '' was small in size , with 110 teeth packed into a jaw only 6 cms long . teeth at the front are fangs , further back the teeth are small and multipointed , many with five cusps . this is unique among pterosaurs , whose teeth are usually of a simple conical form . stomach contents showed it had eaten a small fish , `` parapholidophorus '' . the top and bottom teeth of `` eudimorphodon '' came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed , especially at the back of the jaw . the teeth were multi-cusped , and tooth wear shows that `` eudimorphodon '' was able to crush or chew its food to some degree . wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that `` eudimorphodon '' also fed on hard-shelled invertebrates . juvenile `` eudimorphodon '' had somewhat different and fewer teeth , and may have eaten insects .
