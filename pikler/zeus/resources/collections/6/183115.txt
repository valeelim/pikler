Krebs cycle     the krebs cycle ( or citric acid cycle ) is a part of cellular respiration . named after hans krebs , it is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy . its importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest parts of cellular metabolism to evolve . the krebs cycle comes after the link reaction and provides the hydrogen and electrons needed for the electron transport chain . it takes place inside mitochondria . the diagram below shows how this part of respiration is an ever-repeating cycle which produces atp and gives off co. the atp is a molecule which carries energy in chemical form to be used in other cell processes . to summarize : - two molecules of carbon dioxide are given off - one molecule of atp is formed - three molecules of nad+ are combined with hydrogen ( nad+ → nadh ) - one molecule of fad combines with hydrogen ( fad → fadh ) because two acetyl-coa molecules are produced from each glucose molecule , `` two cycles are required per glucose molecule '' . therefore , at the end of two cycles , the products are : two atp , six nadh , two fadh two qh ( ubiquinol ) and four co .
