Symphony No. 5 &quot;Fate&quot; (Beethoven)    symphony no . 5 & quot ; fate & quot ; ( beethoven ) symphony no . 5 in c minor , op . 67 is a symphony by ludwig van beethoven . it is the fifth of his nine symphonies . it was written between 1804 and 1808. this symphony is one of the most popular and well-known works of classical music . there are four movements : an opening sonata allegro , a slower andante , and a fast scherzo which leads straight in to the finale . the symphony was first performed in vienna 's theater an der wien in 1808. his sixth symphony was also performed for the first time at the same concert . the fifth symphony soon became recognized as one of the most important musical works . the symphony begins with a four-note `` short-short-short-long '' motif which is heard twice ( slightly lower the second time ) : the opening of the symphony is so famous that it has often been quoted . other composers have used it in their compositions , e.g . sergei rachmaninoff in his song `` fate '' . it has often been used in popular culture , from disco to rock and roll , and in film and television . during world war ii , the bbc used the four-note motif to introduce its radio news broadcasts because `` short-short-short-long '' spells the letter `` v '' in morse code . the `` v '' meant `` victory '' . it was played very quietly on a drum . people in nazi occupied countries who wanted to hear the news listened in secret to the bbc news because it was more likely to be true .
