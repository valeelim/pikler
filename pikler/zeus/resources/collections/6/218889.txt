Grazer     a grazer is an animal , usually a herbivorous mammal , which eats grass rather than trees and shrubs . it is contrasted with browsers , which eat trees & shrubs . the life-style , dentition ( teeth ) , and digestive system of grazers is different from browsers , to handle the problems of eating and digesting grass . this is well illustrated in the evolution of such groups as horses . ruminants are the largest group of grazers , though many other animals also graze . when grazers keep eating grass in an area without giving the plants time to grow back , that is called overgrazing .
