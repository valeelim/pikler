G-flat major     g-flat major is a major scale based on g-flat . its key signature has six flats . its relative minor is e-flat minor , and its parallel minor is g-flat minor . this is usually replaced by f♯ minor because g♭ minor 's two double-flats make it generally impractical to use . its enharmonic equivalent is f-sharp major , whose key signature also has six accidentals . in writing music in e major for b-flat instruments , it is preferable to use a g-flat rather an f-sharp key signature . g-flat major is sometimes used as a main key for piano works , such as the impromptus of chopin and schubert , but rarely for orchestra . austrian composer gustav mahler liked to use g-flat major in his symphonies .
