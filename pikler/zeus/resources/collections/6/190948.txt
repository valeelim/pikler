Euthanasia     euthanasia is a word which describes a person who chooses to end his or her life because they have diseases that cause pain , which often make them suffer . this is different from assisted suicide , which is where someone helps another person to kill themselves . it is also different from murder , where the intent is not to end the person 's suffering , but to kill them for the killer 's own ends . euthanasia can be voluntary , where the person who dies specifically asks for help in ending their life . there are cases , where the person is not able to say that they do , or do not , wish to die . these cases are usually called `` non-voluntary euthanasia '' . involuntary euthanasia , where someone is killed against their will , is generally regarded as murder . euthanasia is illegal in most countries . it is permitted in a small number of countries , such as the netherlands and belgium . where it is permitted it is very tightly regulated , and it is only permitted in cases where the patient is terminally ill .
