Cnida     the cnida is the basic term for the stinging apparatus of the phylum cnidaria . the whole life-style of the phylum is based on this device , which enables the animals to catch their prey . the cnida appears in several forms : the most usual is the nematocyst . cnidae are organelle-like capsules with eversible tubules ( they shoot the tubule outwards ) . they are the diagnostic feature of the phylum . all cnidarians possess cnidae ; no loss of the feature is known . there are three main types of cnidae : nematocysts , ptychocysts , and spirocysts , with many variations . depending on the species , one or more types may be on the organism . 1. nematocyst . this is the main type , present in all anthozoa . it is a harpoon-like structure which holds and paralyses small prey . 1. ptychocyst . this puts out a sticky substance . this is used to hold on to prey , and to help make tubes for burrowing tube anemones . 1. spirocyst . this is a lasso-like string that is fired at prey . it wraps around the prey . the cell which produces the cnida is variously called a `` cnidocyte '' , `` cnidoblast '' , or `` nematocyte '' . it is highly specialised for just one function . each nematocyte cell contains an organelle with a hollow , coiled , thread-like structure . the outside of the cell has a hair-like trigger . when the trigger is touched , the shaft of the cnidocyst fires like a harpoon . it penetrates the prey , and the hollow thread comes with it . this takes no more than a few microseconds . after penetration , the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target . the rapid activity of the injected neurotoxins paralyzes the mobile prey , thus allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it .
