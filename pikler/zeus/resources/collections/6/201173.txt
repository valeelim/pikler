Yom Kippur     yom kippur is a jewish festival . it is also known as the `` day of atonement '' . it lasts 25 hours . during this period , jews ask god to forgive them for all their sins . people fast on this day , and they go to synagogue . other things people are not allowed to do during yom kippur include washing , using perfumes and lotions . many wear white as a symbol of purity . even though people fast , yom kippur is considered a happy holiday . this is because jews are sure that god will forgive them on this day . yom kippur is the tenth day of the month of tishrei in the hebrew calendar . in jewish tradition , god writes the fate of each person for the coming year into a `` book '' on rosh hashanah . god waits until yom kippur to `` seal '' the book . during the days between rosh hashanah and yom kippur , jews try to improve their behavior . they ask god to forgive them for sins against god . they also ask `` each other '' to forgive them for anything they did to hurt each other . the evening and day of yom kippur are used for public and private confessions of guilt ( `` vidui '' ) . at the end of yom kippur , jews consider themselves absolved by god .
