Guitar chord     a guitar chord is made up of two or more notes , played on a guitar at one time . chord voicings , that is the choice of individual notes in the chord , can be changed for many different purposes and playing styles . the guitar is very capable and useful for playing chords ; but it does have some differences with other instruments . most guitars only have six strings . this means that for the very largest of chord-voicings it is often necessary to not use one or more tones from the chord . the layout of notes on the fretboard sometimes means that the notes in a chord are not played in tonal order , or make possible a chord that is composed of more than one note of the same pitch . many chords can be played with the same notes in more than one place on the fretboard . guitars can vary both in the number of strings they have . they can also be tuned differently . most guitars used in popular music have six-strings and are tuned : e-a-d-g-b-e. usually the string with the highest pitch ( the thinnest ) is called the first string , and the string having the lowest pitch ( the thickest ) is called the sixth .
