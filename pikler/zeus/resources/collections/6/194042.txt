Computer icon     an icon , when talked about in computing , is a picture which usually stands for a computer program , computer file , folder , or an action for a program to do . icons are usually small pictures , but not always . sometimes the user can change what size an icon is . icons are used in many places on a computer . the desktop contains icons as shortcuts - clicking on these icons opens up the file , folder , or application that they stand for . for example , in microsoft windows the desktop will often have an icon for the recycle bin , and the icon usually looks like a trash can . shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu . these icons work the same as on the desktop . many computer programs use icons on `` buttons '' . when the user clicks on the button , something happens . for example , a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open . while a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something .
