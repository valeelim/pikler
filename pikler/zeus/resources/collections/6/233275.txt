Kaleidoscope     a kaleidoscope is a tube with loose , small , colorful objects inside . these objects can be beads or something similar . the inside is made using three long mirrors . a person looks into the kaleidoscope through one end and sees patterns created by reflections of the objects inside . in 1815 , sir david brewster began work that led to the invention of the kaleidoscope . at that time , he was doing experiments on light polarization . the kaleidoscope was not patented until two years later . his first design was a tube with pairs of mirrors at one end , pairs of translucent disks at the other , and beads between the two . in 1817 , brewster chose the well-known lens developer philip carpenter to be the only manufacturer of the kaleidoscope . it was a big success . two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes were sold in london and paris in just three months . brewster knew that the company could not make as many kaleidoscopes as people wanted . on 17 may 1818 , he asked carpenter to allow them to be made by other manufacturers . carpenter agreed . at first , the kaleidoscope was meant to be a scientific tool . later it was used as a toy . brewster believed he would make money from the kaleidoscope . however , a fault in his patent application allowed others to copy it .
