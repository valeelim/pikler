Lichen     lichens are a symbiosis of at least two quite different organisms . the partnership always involves a fungus , which lives with one or more partners which can do photosynthesis . the photobiont partner may be a green alga and/or a cyanobacterium . the algae or bacteria live inside the fungus , and exchange nutrients with it . the lichen is different in shape and mode of life from any of the partners . it is a distinct form of life . botanists did not know this until about 1875. lichens pose a problem for biological classification , because the three types of organism concerned come from three different kingdoms . after long debate , lichen are now classified as fungi , under the genus and species of the host fungus . this allows specimens to be put into boxes and labelled . by having specific names , researchers know what they are working on : that is one of the basic functions of taxonomy . the system still has its problems . in those fungi which may associate either with an alga , or with a cyanobacterium , the resulting forms ( called `` photomorphs '' ) may look quite different , yet are now referred to by the same name .
