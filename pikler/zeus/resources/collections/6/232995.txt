Second Fleet (Australia)    second fleet ( australia ) the second fleet is the name of the second group of ships sent with settlers , convicts and supplies to colony at sydney cove in port jackson , australia . there were six ships in the fleet : one royal navy escort , four convict ships , and a supply ship . the ships were meant to sail to australia together , and get to sydney cove in 1789. however the escort ship was wrecked on the way and did not arrive , and one convict ship was delayed and arrived two months after the other ships . unlike the first fleet , where great efforts were taken to keep the convicts healthy , the second fleet was run by private businesses who kept the convicts in horrific conditions . when they got to sydney , the sick convicts were a drain on the already struggling colony . the `` lady juliana '' sailed before the other convict ships and is not always counted as part of the second fleet . the supply ship `` justinian '' did not sail with the convict ships and arrived before them . `` hms guardian '' set out before the convict ships but struck ice after leaving the cape of good hope , went back to southern africa and was wrecked on the coast .
