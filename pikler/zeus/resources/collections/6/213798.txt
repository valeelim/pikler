Theodor Boveri     theodor heinrich boveri ( 12 october 1862 – 15 october 1915 ) was a german biologist who made discoveries in cytology , embryology and genetics . his career was devoted to the processes whereby a new individual arises from parental reproductive materials . his work with sea urchins showed that it was necessary to have all chromosomes present in order for proper development of the embryo to take place . this discovery was an important part of the boveri-sutton chromosome theory . his other significant discovery was the centrosome ( 1888 ) , which he described as the `` especial organ of cell division '' . boveri also discovered the phenomenon of chromatin diminution during embryonic development of the nematode `` parascaris '' . 1902–1904 : boveri , in a series of papers , drew attention to the correspondence between the behaviour of chromosomes and the results obtained by mendel . he said that chromosomes were `` independent entities which retain their independence even in the resting nucleus ... what comes out of the nucleus is what goes into it '' .
