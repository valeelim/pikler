Clergyman     a clergyman is an ordained minister of the anglican church , or of some other protestant churches . 'vicar ' and 'pastor ' are other possibilities . 'rector ' is used in some scottish presbyterian churches . 'the clergy ' is often used as a group term . the word 'cleric ' , meaning a clerk , is the root term . it comes from the fact that all clerics could read and write , at a time when this was a rare skill . by general use and convention , anglican ministers are not called priests . this is because the unqualified term 'priest ' or 'father ' is widely used as referring to the catholic church . of course , in modern times an anglican minister may be female , in which case the term 'reverend ' or 'minister ' may be used .
