Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection     carrier sense multiple access with collision detection or csma/cd is a protocol ( or rule ) used by computer ethernet networks . it stops computers from sending information on the same ethernet wire at the same time . with this rule , a computer will check that the wire is not being used before it sends information . this ability to check is called `` carrier sense . '' this rule is used when many computers can use the same connection . this is called `` multiple access . '' if computers do send information at exactly the same time , the computers can tell a mistake has been made and stop sending . this is called `` collision detection . '' when this collision occurs , the computers stop sending information , wait for a random amount of time , and then check before resending the information . other websites . - top bits
