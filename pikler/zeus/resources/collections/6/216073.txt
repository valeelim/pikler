Yaque del Norte River     yaque del norte is the longest river in the dominican republic , and the second longest river of the hispaniola island , after the river artibonite . it is 296 km long and flows to the northwest into the montecristi bay , atlantic ocean . `` yaque '' or `` yaqui '' is a taíno word given to two rivers . one of those rivers , the longest , goes to the north of the island , to the atlantic ocean , and is called the yaque del norte ( `` northern yaque '' ) ; and the second goes to the south , to the caribbean sea , and is called yaque del sur ( `` southern yaque '' ) . during his first visit to america in 1492 , christopher columbus saw for the first time this river , at its mouth , and he called it `` río de oro '' ( `` gold river '' ) because he found many small pieces of gold . but later , during his second visit , he saw the river in other place and called it `` río de las cañas '' ( `` river of canes '' ) because many tall grasses ( as sugar cane ) were growing on the borders of the river . but none of those names were ever used ; it has always been called yaque , or yaque del norte .
