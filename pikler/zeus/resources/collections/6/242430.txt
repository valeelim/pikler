K–Ar dating     potassium–argon dating or k–ar dating is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology . it is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium ( k ) into argon ( ar ) . potassium is a common element found in many materials , such as micas , clay , tephra , and evaporites . in these materials , the decay product ar is able to escape the liquid ( molten ) rock , but starts to build up when the rock solidifies ( recrystallises ) . time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of ar to the amount of k remaining . the long half-life of k is more than a billion years , so the method is used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years . quickly cooled lavas make nearly ideal samples for k–ar dating . they also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field at that time . the geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using k–ar dating .
