Electron configuration     an electron configuration is the arrangement of electrons within an atom . the electron configuration describes where the electrons are inside orbitals . the structure of the periodic table of elements is partly based on electron configuration . there are four kinds of electron configurations : s , p , d , and f orbitals . s orbitals are roughly sphere-shaped , p orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell , d orbitals are usually shaped like a four-leaf clover , and f orbitals form a mathematically complex shape . an atom can have more than one orbital : in fact , all except hydrogen do . similarly , atoms can have more than one of each kind of orbital . the electron configurations fill up with electrons in an unchanging order .
