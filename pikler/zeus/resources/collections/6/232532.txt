Right whale     the right whales ( eubalaena spp . ) are baleen whales with bow-shaped lower jaw and a head that is up to one-quarter of the body length . the head is hairier than most whales ; up to 300 hairs are found on the tip of the lower jaw and 100 are on the upper jaw . there are also callosities ( a series of horny growths ) behind the blowhole , on the chin , above the eyes , on the lower lip , and on the rostrum ( the beak-like upper jaw ) . they weigh about 70 tons . right whales are similar to bowhead whales , but smaller . these whales are rich in blubber and have 2 blowholes . the eyes are very small and lips are large . right whales were named by whalers who considered them the `` right '' whales to hunt , since they were rich in blubber , they were easy to catch ( they are relatively slow swimmers ) and they floated after being killed . hunters needed the right whale 's blubber for meat , because blubber could be boiled to make oil . the right whale 's name came from hunters , who thought that they were the `` right '' whales to hunt . this was because they had lots of blubber . they were also easy to catch ( because they were relatively slow swimmers ) and they floated on the surface of the water after being killed . because of these things , right whales are the most endangered of the great whales .
