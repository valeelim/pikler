Bradshaw Trail     the bradshaw trail , nicknamed the gold road at one time , is a historic trail which used to be a stagecoach route in southern california . this road used to connect san bernardino , california to gold fields in la paz , arizona , known today as ehrenberg . it was the first road connecting riverside county to the colorado river . the part which remains today is a graded dirt road which crosses southeastern riverside county and a part of imperial county , beginning roughly 12 miles/19km east of north shore and ending about 14 miles/23km southwest of blythe for a total of 70 miles/113km . the trail is named for trailblazer william david bradshaw who first crossed the area in 1862. a former forty-niner , bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly emptying and that miners and other people leaving the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new gold strike at la paz . without a direct trail , they would have to travel a great distance southeast to yuma , then north up the river to la paz . bradshaw was a smart man ; he knew there were lots of chances to make money in a gold boomtown .
