Nymphalidae     the nymphalidae is the largest family of butterflies , with about 6,000 species . they live on all continents except antarctica . they are commonly known as nymphalids , brushfoots , or brush-footed butterflies . brushfoots get their name from their front pair of legs . this pair of legs is reduced . they do not have claws at the end . only the middle and last pair of legs are used for walking . this is why they are called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies . many species are brightly colored and include popular species such as the emperors , admirals , tortoiseshells , and fritillaries . most hold their colourful wings flat when they are at rest . however , the underwings are often dull ; in some species they look just like dead leaves , or are much paler . so when they raise their wings in the normal butterfly position , this cryptic effect helps the butterfly disappear into its surroundings . subfamilies . - apaturinae – hackberry butterflies and emperors - biblidinae – tropical brushfoots
