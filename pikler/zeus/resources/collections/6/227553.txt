Economic bubble     an economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value . this inflation is followed by a quick decrease in value , called a `` crash '' or a `` bubble burst '' . economic bubbles can be caused by many things , but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation . an economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a massive loss of investment both by companies and individuals , such as the great depression or the economic crisis of 2007-2010. an economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity . the market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand . however , it is hard to predict when the prices may fall due to increase in supply beyond the demand resulting in the bursting of the bubble .
