Century leap year     in the gregorian calendar , a century leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 400 ( and qualifies for the adding of february 29 , like all other leap years ) . for example , the years 1600 and 2000 were century leap years ; the century years 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 were not century leap years . the next century leap year will occur in the year 2400. century leap years always begin on a saturday , and in such years february 29 always falls on a tuesday .
