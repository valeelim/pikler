Popularity     popularity is the state of being well-liked or well-known . popularity figures are an important part of many people 's personal value systems , and forms a critical part of success in fields such as management , politics , and the entertainment industry , among others . many different varieties of popularity exist , and many ways in which to gain it . general popularity usually involves respect in two ways : a popular person is respected by groups of people and will take that respect . this reinforces the idea that the person deserves the popularity . likewise , amicability ( friendliness ) is an important part of popularity , as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others . this inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people ( particularly the young ) who are attempting to become popular : being loud may be successful in gaining attention , but is unlikely to provide mutual respect .
