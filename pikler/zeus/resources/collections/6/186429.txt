Bungee jumping     bungee jumping is an extreme sport in which people jump from higher ground such as a bridge with an elastic rope tied to their ankles to stop them from hitting the ground . the rope is designed to stretch , not break . when the rope has stretched all the way , the jumper bounces back up . when people jump they wear safety equipment like helmets and a harness . it started as the coming-of-age ceremony in a small village on south pentecost island in vanuatu . the young men jump from the top of a 30 meter high tree to demonstrate their courage as an adult . they tied jungle vines around their ankles so that they would not hit the ground . modern bungee jumping began when four british men jumped off the golden gate bridge in san francisco . in 1987 a.j.hackett became world famous when he jumped from the eiffel tower in paris . later he set up the kawarau bridge in new zealand , with a height of 47 meters , as a commercial bungee jumping area . people could pay money for the fun of jumping . the idea quickly spread around the world .
