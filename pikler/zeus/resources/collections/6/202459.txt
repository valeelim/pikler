Meander     a meander is a curve in a river . meanders form a snake-like pattern as the river flows across a fairly flat valley floor . the position of the curves changes over time . the river erodes sediment on the outside of the curves and drops it on the inside of curves . this is because the water moves fastest on the outside of a turn . water does this because it tries to find the path with the weakest resistance . slip off slopes are formed on the inside of the bend from deposition and river cliffs are formed on the outside of the bend from erosion . eventually meanders turn into ox-bow lakes when two outside bends erode together making a shorter route for the water . meanders were named for a river in anatolia .
