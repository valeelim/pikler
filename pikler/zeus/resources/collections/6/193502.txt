Temple of Jupiter (Pompeii)    temple of jupiter ( pompeii ) the temple of jupiter , capitolium , or temple of the capitoline triad was a temple in the roman city of pompeii in italy . at the beginning this temple was dedicated to jupiter alone , it was built in the mid 2nd century bc at the same time as the temple of apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which roman influence over pompeii was at its height and so roman jupiter beat out the greek apollo and jupiter ( , juno , and minerva ) in towns newly taken over by the romans . this was also true for pompeii , where the temple of jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more roman when the romans took over . pompeii was taken over by the romans beginning in 310 bc . it was still allowed to mostly run itself , however , until the italic revolt against rome at the beginning of the 1st century bc . the building style of the town was largely borrowed from the greeks , but roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style . as opposed to the previous samnite rulers of pompeii , the romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life . pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place . public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city .
