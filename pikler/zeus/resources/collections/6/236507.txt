Invitation to William     the invitation to william was a letter sent by seven famous englishmen . they were later named the immortal seven . they sent this letter to william iii , prince of orange , received by him on 30 june 1688 ( julian calendar , 10 july gregorian calendar ) . in england a catholic male heir to the throne , james francis edward stuart , had been born . the letter asked william to force the ruling king , his father-in-law james ii of england to make william 's protestant wife mary , james 's oldest daughter , the heir . this might possibly be done by saying that the newborn prince of wales was not really james ' son . the letter told william that if he were to land in england with a small army , they would rise up and support him . the invitation shortly told him about their complaints against king james . they said that the king 's son was not really the king 's son and that the english people generally believed him to be false . they complained that william had sent a letter to james congratulating him on the birth of his son . it was carried to william in the hague by rear admiral arthur herbert ( the later lord torrington ) disguised as a common sailor . it was read by a secret code .
