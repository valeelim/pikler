Bluebird K7     bluebird k7 is a boat built for donald campbell to break the world water speed record . bluebird was a special kind of boat , called a hydroplane , that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat . bluebird was powered by a jet engine . it set new world water speed records seven times ; the fastest was 276 mph ( 445 km/h ) . bluebird was destroyed when campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph ( 480 km/h ) on coniston water in 1967. campbell had been using his father 's boat , bluebird k4 , to try and set new records . bluebird k4 was destroyed when its structure broke . after this , donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the american propeller hydroplane slo-mo-shun . ken and lewis norris designed and built k7 based on donald 's ideas . k7 was a three-point hydroplane , meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places , one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons ( the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat , near its front in the photos ) . it was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet .
