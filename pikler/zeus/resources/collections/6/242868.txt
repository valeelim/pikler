Radiation therapy     radiation therapy is the use of radiation to treat many diseases . it is typically used in the treatment of cancer . radiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body . doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor ( for example , early stages of breast cancer ) . radiation therapy works together with chemotherapy . radiation therapy has been used before , during , and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation . radiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth . ionizing radiation works by damaging the dna of exposed tissue thus killing it . to spare normal tissues ( such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through in order to treat the tumor ) , doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor , providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding , healthy tissue . besides the tumor itself , the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area . doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor , or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread . it is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes . so , doctors also expect to include some healthy tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire tumor is hit by radiation .
