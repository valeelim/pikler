Transwoman     a transwoman ( sometimes spelled as trans-woman or trans woman ) is a male-to-female ( mtf ) transsexual or transgender person . many people in this group like the name `` trans woman '' over the many medical terms that are out there . other non-medical names are t-girl , tg-girl and ts-girl . transgender , though , is the more common name . some people who are assigned male at birth feel that this is not who they really are . they feel that the gender they were assigned and the gender they actually are do not match . they may want to show their true gender as a woman . because of this , many trans women want to simply be called `` women '' , as they feel that being called a `` trans '' woman may mean that their new identity is false or not true . `` transitioning '' refers to the act of changing a person 's social and personal gender identity to the gender identity that they feel is their real self , and may or may not include having medical treatments done , or surgery , and the changing of their legal papers to show their new identity ( such as their birth certificate ) and changing the way that they dress .
