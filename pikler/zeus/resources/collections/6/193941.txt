Instant Runoff Voting     instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two , but it can also be used for other group decisions . voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite , with only their top choices being counted each time . ballots are counted , and a series of simulated rounds is conducted . if no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated , and those voters ' next choice votes are then counted . this is repeated until a candidate has a majority . instant runoff voting has been used in australia 's lower house for more than 80 years . that house is strongly dominated by two parties . it has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the united states . voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting . proponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated . they believe instant runoff voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two-party system . by having more candidates on the ballot , incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office .
