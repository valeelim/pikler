Amb (princely state)    amb ( princely state ) amb was a princely state of the former british raj . it governed itself ( it had autonomy ) , but was under the overall suzerainty of the british monarch . amb was ruled by a hereditary prince with the title of nawab . the nawab of amb was the chieftain of the tanoli tribe of the hazara . in the partition of india in 1947 , the nawab gave up the independence the state had previously enjoyed by joining the new country of pakistan . amb continued as a distinct state within pakistan until 1969 , when it was merged into the former north-west frontier province . the royal status of the nawab was abolished by the government of pakistan in 1972. the area in which amb was located is historically known as tanawal . this is in the hazara region in what is now khyber pakhtunkhwa . the part covered by amb is called `` upper tanawal '' , and is now part of mansehra district . `` lower tanawal '' is in the abbottabad district . the name `` tanawal '' comes from the name of the tribe that lives there , the tanoli ( or tanawali ) . the tanoli are muslims . they speak hindko .
