Lazarus taxon     in paleontology , a lazarus taxon ( plural `` taxa '' ) is a taxon that disappears from one or more periods of the fossil record , only to appear again later . the term refers to the gospel of john , in which jesus is claimed to have raised lazarus from the dead . lazarus taxa occur either because of ( local ) extinction , later resupplied , or as a sampling artifact . the fossil record is imperfect ( only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized ) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction , particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon becomes very low . the concept was developed in palaeontology where , after a major extinction event , some groups reappear after millions of years . the usual explanation is that numbers were driven so low that their chance of fossilisation were extremely low . then , gradually , their numbers revived . in 1974 batten pointed out that the lower triassic record lacked genera and species which had been present in the permian , but which reappeared 20 million years later in the middle triassic . jablonski later coined the term 'lazarus taxon ' for species and genera which disappear from the fossil record , only to reappear later when conditions return to normal .
