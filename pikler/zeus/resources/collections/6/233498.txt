Structured Query Language     structured query language ( sql ) is a language used to view or change data in databases . the sentences used in this language are called sql queries . we can use sql queries to add data , remove data , or view data in the database . this is a simple sql query which is used to show a column named 'my_column ' of the data table named 'my_table ' . here is an example of inserting information into a table called 'people . ' the query first names the table , people , then the columns that data is going to be inserted into , ( first name , last name , age , and favorite food ) , and the data that is going into the columns . sql knows which data goes into which column by the order the columns are listed . here is an example of the same thing , but the columns are n't listed . if this is done , sql will insert the data in the order the columns are listed . however , if a programmer does the query in the method that does not name the columns , they need to be careful , because if the columns are not in the order that they listed the data , they could put the wrong type of data in the wrong column , or perhaps the column they put data into may want a different type of data ( for example , a column might want number data , but someone might accidentally put letter data into it ) and it will break .
