Benthos     benthos : the flora and fauna found at the bottom of the sea or lake . covers quite a wide range of uses , for instance , animals in rock pools are benthic , though only a few inches below the surface . in the ocean , used to contrast organisms in the sea depths ( though not actually on the bottom ) , with plankton , living in the upper pelagic zone . the problem is addressed by extending the pelagic zone down below the light to the `` bathypelagic '' and `` abyssopelagic '' zones . these terms , however , are mostly not used .
