Ruminant     a ruminant is a mammal that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass . ruminating mammals include cattle , goats , sheep , giraffes , bison , yaks , water buffalo , deer , camels , alpacas , llamas , wildebeest , antelope , pronghorn , and nilgai . the word `` ruminant '' comes from the latin word `` ruminare '' which means `` to chew over again '' . rumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with , and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to re-chew it and so get the most food value out of it . rumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller , before they can go through the process of digestion . the primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants ( such as people , dogs , and pigs ) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach . the four parts of the stomach are the rumen , reticulum , omasum , and abomasum . in the first two chambers , the rumen and the reticulum , the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material . solids clump together to form the cud or bolus .
