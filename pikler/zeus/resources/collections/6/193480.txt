Playpen     a playpen is where a baby plays in an enclosed structure . it is designed to keep the baby safe when the parent is not there . the earliest use of the word playpen in the oxford english dictionary was in 1902. playpens were once made of wood . they were square shaped , with vertical wooden bars on four sides , so that the child can see out . the floor of the playpen is usually a soft mat . the walls of the playpen are usually higher than the height of the child , so the child can not climb out . modern playpens can be moved easily . they are usually made of a basic metal and plastic support system with mesh , soft plastic or nylon sides . sometimes a bassinet can be put on the top for the baby to sleep in , or be changed in , until four months of age . some have mobiles , side pockets for supplies and toys , night lights , music boxes , or a cd player for the child to listen to music while sleeping or playing . portable playpens come in different sizes , but most can be rolled or folded up for easy storage and transport .
