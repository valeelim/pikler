The Mask: The Animated Series    the mask : the animated series the mask : the animated series is a television animated series based on the comic book superhero , the mask , but with most of its inspiration from the 1994 movie adaptation . the show ran for three seasons , from 1995 to 1997 , and spawned its own short-run comic book series , `` adventures of the mask '' . tina carlyle ( cameron diaz 's character in the movie ) was absent , but reporter peggy brandt had become the main female character . unlike in the movie , ipkiss was able to use the mask in daytime as well as at night . much as with the `` beetlejuice '' cartoon before it , the mask tas took many elements from the source movie but dropped characters and changed certain other characters . peggy 's inclusion also officially discounts the cut scene in the movie where she is killed . tina is never even alluded to . however , the events of the movie are alluded to , as charlie knew that stanley was the mask ( though did not know stanley kept it ) , and stanley was still upset over peggy selling him out to the mob ( given that stanley and peggy were never treated as a potential couple , there may have remained some bad feelings over that though the mask himself sometimes tries to woo her ) . a gypsy at one point claims that the mask is the most powerful artifact in the world when she remarks `` the most powerful artifact in the world and this idiot keeps it with his laundry '' .
