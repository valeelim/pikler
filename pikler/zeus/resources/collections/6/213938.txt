Xerophyte     xerophytes are plants which are adapted to dry/desert areas . they are a type of succulent plant . to survive these harsh conditions they have special features . for example , a cactus has white hairs which help to prevent water loss . another example is manzanita plants , which have a thick waxy coating and keep their leaves vertical to the sun . some xerophytic plants sit out a drought . they can still extract water from soil . they may have very salty cell sap and therefore a very low water potential in the roots ; they may have very extensive or deep roots or may pick up the slightest dew and survive on that ) . others have special features about their shape or structure ( xeromorphs ) . thick waxy cuticle ( `` aloe '' ) ; hairy surfaces ( `` edelweiss '' ) ; dense packing of leaves , reduced leaf size ( species of cypress ) ; reduced density of stomata ( many cacti ) ; pitted and grooved position of stomata ( ammophila ) water storage in stem and tubers , etc . ( baobab ) . they may also protect this water store from animals by spines and chemicals .
