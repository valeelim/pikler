Instinct     animals with nervous systems are born with instincts . an instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism . it is inherited ( innate ) , not learned . however , the term does not include the operation of sense organs , and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system . instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers . releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour . although instincts are not learned , in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice . there are some problems with the term 'instinct ' . it can be used loosely to mean a general tendency , such as `` a man 's instinct is to protect his family '' . it can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin . properly , it is used only of well-defined acts whose causation is inherited , and which are triggered by specific stimuli called releasers . other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns ( fap ) and innate behaviour chains . instinctive behaviours can be variable and responsive to the environment . any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience , that is , in the absence of learning . sea turtles , newly hatched on a beach , will automatically move toward the ocean , and automatically swim when they are in the water . a joey climbs into its mother 's pouch upon being born . honeybees communicate by dance the direction of a food source without formal instruction . other examples include animal fighting , animal courtship behaviour , internal escape functions , and building of nests .
