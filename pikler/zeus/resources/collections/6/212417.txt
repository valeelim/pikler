Swiss Minaret controversy     as of 2009 , there is a controversy in switzerland about the construction of minarets . a minaret is a tower-like structure belonging to a mosque . its main use is to call the worshippers to prayer , much like a belltower of a christian church . on 1st may 2007 , the swiss people 's party and the federal democratic union launched a popular referendum . they want to ban the construction of minarets in switzerland . the swiss people voted in favor of the issue on november 29 , 2009. there are two disputes that form the basis of the controversy : - local associations of muslims wanted to build minarets in different swiss communes ; in some there was opposition to this plan . - there is a broad discussion about whether it should be possible to build minarets , and how building minarets might be bad for the country . the swiss minaret controversy started in the eastern part of switerland , in 2005. a turkish cultural association applied for the permit to build a six metre high tower ( a minaret ) on the roof of the center where they met . the residents around it did not like the idea . they therefore formed an association to oppose it . the people in this association were biased , they had strong ( christian ) religious views . some of the members of the association were also in the committee that had to assess the building plans . as a matter of course , the plans were rejected . the matter was taken to court , and the islamic community lost the case . in 2009 , the tower was built despite the previous loss .
