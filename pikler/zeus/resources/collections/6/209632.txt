Simple machine     a simple machine is a device that can change the direction or the magnitude of a force , or the point where it is applied . this is done so that the force can be used to do work . all mechanical machines are made by combining simple machines . there are six basic `` simple machines '' , as defined by renaissance scientists : 1. the lever ( also called a rope or staff ) can move the point at which a force is applied and may also change the magnitude and direction of the force . 1. the wheel change the direction in which the force is applied 1. the pulley changes the point where a force is applied , and may also change its magnitude and direction . 1. the inclined plane 1. the wedge 1. the screw that converts rotational motion to linear motion , and a rotational force to a linear force . the use of simple machines can be traced back to `` homo habilis '' ( the first humans to use tools ) , but certain animals other than man also use them . a `` compound machine '' is made up of two or more simple machines .
