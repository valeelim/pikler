Brown recluse spider     the brown recluse spider ( `` loxosceles reclusa '' ) is a timid but dangerous spider that lives in the united states . the scientific name of the spider `` loxosceles reclusa '' comes from words that mean `` slanted leg recluse '' . the `` slanted leg '' part comes from the fact that these spiders have their legs touching the ground at an angle instead of straight up and down . the `` recluse '' part is because this spider is very shy and runs away from humans . the brown recluse spider can be light brown , dark brown , or even gray . sometimes it is called the violin spider since its head has a darker mark on it that looks like a violin . not including its legs , it can grow to about long . they have six eyes , which is an unusual number of eyes for a spider . male and female brown recluses can be identified once the spider has molted several times . spiders have a set of appendages on their faces called pedipalps . the pedipalps on the male have much larger ends than the ones on females . these fattened pedipalps serve as the sex organs for the male . the female has her sex organs on the underside of her body . this is perhaps the only way to easily tell a male from a female . scientists who study brown recluses and their relatives can even identify relatives of the brown recluse by studying the shapes of the sex organs .
