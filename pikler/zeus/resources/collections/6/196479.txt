Octane rating     the octane rating is a measurement of how well fuels ( gasoline is a kind of fuel ) resist detonation . modern engines use high degrees of compression . they therefore need fuel that does not detonate easily . such fuel has a higher octane rating . the rating is done by comparing the fuel to the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would detonate in the same way . such a mixture of 90 percent iso-octane and 10 percent heptane has an octane rating of 90. gas is available with lower octane ratings in the us than in europe .
