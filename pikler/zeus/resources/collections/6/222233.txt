Cytoskeleton     the cytoskeleton is a kind of scaffolding present in all cells . it is made of protein . it keeps cell shape , protects the cell and enables cells to move ( using structures such as flagella and cilia ) . it helps transport inside the cytoplasm ( the movement of vesicles and organelles , for example ) , and in cell division . the concept and the term ( `` cytosquelette '' , in french ) was introduced by french embryologist paul wintrebert in 1931. eukaryote cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments , which are `` microfilaments '' ( actin filaments ) , `` intermediate filaments '' , and `` microtubules '' . they give the cell structure and shape . cytoskeletal elements interact closely and often with the cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum .
