Absurdism     absurdism is a type of philosophy . people who support and argue for absurdism are known as 'absurdists ' . absurdists think that the human condition is essentially absurd because humans are always looking for meaning , and also completely unable to find meaning . in philosophy , this is called `` the absurd '' . in this case `` absurd '' means that it is not possible to be done by humans . absurdists , most notably albert camus , believe that when human beings realize this fundamental absurdity they have different reactions . one reaction is suicide , but this is not generally considered to be a viable solution by absurdists ; suicide is in and of itself the most absurd action possible . another reaction is to believe in something higher ( camus gave religion as an example of this , although he went on to criticize its merit as a solution to fundamental absurdity ) , when they see that there is no meaning they can find in the universe ( which is what absurdism says is the basic state of human experience ) . the final reaction is to accept the absurd , and also to keep trying to overcome it . camus believed that a human being could become happy by finding meaning in their relationship with the absurdity of their existence .
