Asylum seeker     an asylum seeker is a person who was forced to flee from their country , due to democide genocide or mass murder . ( endangered ) and routed to nearby countries to seek refuge but , is not accepted yet as a refugee . refugees and asylum seekers are different . the decision whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies with the host country . this can lead to a situation where the country will see an asylum seeker neither as refugee nor as legitimate migrant . then they will be treated as an illegal immigrant ( a person who is not a citizen of the country ) even if their life was endangered in the country they fled from . if a person comes to a country to seek asylum , their refugee status will then be assessed . the government decides whether the person is in danger because of persecution , or if they are just trying to come to that country for free . if a person is not a refugee , they will not have the rights of a refugee . in that case , the government does not have to follow the convention relating to the status of refugees .
