Common scold     in the criminal common law of england and wales , a common scold was a type of public nuisance . the term was applied to a woman who caused trouble and who disturbed the peace by arguing and fighting with her neighbours all the time . the latin language name for this type of woman was `` communis rixatrix '' . this name 's grammar only applies to females . this makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime . when british people first went to the north america , they took this crime with them . the crime was often punished by `` ducking '' . ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond . they were then lowered into the water , until they were all in the water . this was done several times . few people were actually convicted of being a common scold , but it remained a crime listed on the law books of england and wales until 1967. because it applied only to women , it was eventually banned in the united states . this was because the u.s. constitution ( the highest law in the u.s. ) does not allow people to be treated differently from each other . this comes from a section of the constitution called the equal protection clause .
