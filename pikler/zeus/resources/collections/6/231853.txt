Zooid     a zooid is a term for a small individual animal , part of a marine colony . the zooids in a colony are usually clones , and may be cytoplasmically connected . though genetically identical , the zooids in a colony may serve different functions . this is the same as would be the case with a normal metazoan animal , but in a zooid colony the members are more like individuals . the word is pronounced `` z≈ç-oid '' , not like zoo . some examples : - individual members of a bryozoan colony . - individual members of a living coral . - individual members of a portuguese man o ' war .
