Epistasis     epistasis is the interaction between genes at different loci . it was a term invented by william bateson in 1909. when gregor mendel did his experiments on the sweet pea , he chose seven traits , such as round vs wrinkled peas , and tall vs short plants . he found the plants had pairs of 'factors ' ( genes ) which controlled their appearance ( phenotype ) . however , one pair of factors `` never affected the other pairs '' . but with epistasis , the action of one gene does affect another gene , even one on a different chromosome . use of the term has varied somewhat . its original meaning was quite narrow : for instance , a gene for `` no wings '' in `` drosophila '' will obviously mask genes for any other aspect of the wings . in general , however , epistasis denotes any departure from independence of the effects of different genetic loci .
