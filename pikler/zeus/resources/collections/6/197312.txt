Spanish Inquisition     the spanish inquisition was a tribunal started in 1478 in spain . it was started by ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile . during the spanish inquisition many people were burnt in front of crowds in the streets . anyone who was not loyal to the roman catholic church was in danger of being called a heretic and being put to death by being burnt at the stake . not only protestants were put to death , but it was also an excuse to get rid of many jews and muslims . a ceremony at which heretics were burnt was called an auto-da-f√© . the judge was called the inquisitor . the rulers of spain , ferdinand and isabella , called for the inquisition not to exterminate all non-believers of the roman catholic church , but to discourage strong outward belief of other religions . most trials ended with the defendant simply giving up his beliefs and being let go . the inquisition was not completely abolished until 1834 .
