Hand axe     a hand axe is a stone tool of the lower ( early ) and middle paleolithic stone age . it was a bifacial , similar on both sides , and held in the hand , not with a handle like a modern axe . it was held directly in the hand , perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather . this kind of axe is typical of the acheulean and the mousterian cultures , and is the longest-used tool of human history . hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years . they were made by earlier species of man , such as `` homo erectus '' and `` homo neanderthalensis '' ( neanderthal man ) ; it was one of their most important tools . the hand axe culture s were preceded by an even older oldowan culture of primitive stone tools ( 2.6 to 1.7 million years ago ) in africa . now it is known that the first stone tools were probably made by australopithecines . they are found in the great rift valley of africa from about 3.3 million years ago . new archaeological evidence from baise , guangxi , china shows that there were occasional hand axes in eastern asia . however , as the reference shows , the artifacts were overwhelmingly choppers and flakes . the authors say `` the stone tool assemblage shows close associations with the pebble tool industry ... in south china '' .
