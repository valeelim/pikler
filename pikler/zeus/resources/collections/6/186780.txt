Unconscious mind     the unconscious mind is thought to be a deeper part of a person 's mind that works without that person knowing it . feelings , thoughts , desires or emotions appear to come out of nowhere , leaving the person to question where they came from . the unconscious mind is a term coined by the 18th century german romantic philosopher friedrich schelling and later introduced into english by the poet and essayist samuel taylor coleridge . it is , however , an ancient idea which has been noticed in many civilisations and cultures . also , whether other mammals have similar mental mechanisms to man is also a question with a considerable history . the unconscious mind plays a large role in sigmund freud 's psychoanalysis . he discussed the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behaviour . however , the unconscious was not discovered by freud . historian of psychology mark altschule concluded , `` it is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance '' .
