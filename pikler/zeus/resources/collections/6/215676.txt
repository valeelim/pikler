Altruism     altruism ( or selflessness ) is concern for the well-being of others . a truly altruistic act is something done completely for the benefit of another , without concern for the self . it usually involves sacrificing something ( time , effort or possessions ) , with no expectation of receiving anything in return ( including recognition for the act of giving ) . it is considered a virtue in many cultures and a basic aspect of most religions . it is the opposite of selfishness . altruism is different from acts done out of responsibility , loyalty or moral obligation towards a specific individual ( such as a god , a king or a government ) . whether `` pure '' altruism is possible has been debated by scholars for thousands of years . one theory says that no act of giving , helping or sacrificing can be described as truly selfless , because the person will receive personal gratification from it ( that is , a feeling of satisfaction that they have done something good for another ) . whether this theory is correct depends on whether such feelings qualify as a 'reward ' or 'benefit ' .
