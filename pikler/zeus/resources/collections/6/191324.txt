Book cover     a book cover is any protective covering used to bind together the pages of a book . the covering may be of paper , or hard paper boards , or even plastic . the boards may be covered with paper , cloth or leather . they may be laminated , with a plastic layer onto paper . there is a distinction between hardbacks and softbacks , which are usually sold at different prices . hardbacks may be covered with a dust jacket designed to attract readers . softbacks are almost always designed to attract sales in bookshop displays . the evolution of printing methods has made the production of books very much cheaper than was the case with early printed works . as a result , books are bought and read in great numbers . they compete against each other in the marketplace . the function of book design is partly to help the reader , but even more to persuade the reader to buy the book .
