Panpsychism     panpsychism is the theory that everything in the universe is somewhat sentient or conscious . they are all connected parts of the whole . panpsychists believe that all matter in the universe has some degree of consciousness.in other words the substance of the universe is composed entirely of mind or consciousness . this is not to say that rocks have a mind but that the individual atoms and other particles in the rock have some sort of awareness and are aware of each other . panpsychism is opposed to materialism or any doctrine that argues that the reality of the universe is composed solely of matter . panpsychism needs no supernatural miracle to explain consciousness , it is consciousness . in other words we are all part of a grand communication scheme which is the glue that holds the universe together . other websites . - panpsychism.net references . - stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , - catholic encyclopedia of philosophy
