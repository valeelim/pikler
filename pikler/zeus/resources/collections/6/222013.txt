Plastid     a plastid is a self-reproducing organelle of plants and algae . a plastome is the dna genome of a plastid . they are like tiny machines inside cells : each makes or stores important chemicals used by the plant . examples of plastids are : - chloroplasts : photosynthesis ; other plastids may have developed from chloroplasts . etioplasts are chloroplasts which have not been exposed to light . - chromoplasts : pigment synthesis and storage . - leucoplasts : colourless , make terpenes such as resin . sometimes they develop into more specialized types of plastid : - amyloplasts : starch storage - elaioplasts : fat storage . - proteinoplasts : store & modify protein . - statoliths : detect gravity . plastids in algae and hornworts may differ from plant plastids . in algae , the term `` leucoplast '' is used for all unpigmented plastids and their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants . glaucocystophytic algae contain muroplasts , which are similar to chloroplasts except that they have a cell wall , similar to that of prokaryotes . rhodophytic algae contain rhodoplasts , which are red chloroplasts which allow the algae to photosynthesise to a depth of up to 268 metres .
