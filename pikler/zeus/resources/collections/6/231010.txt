Avalon     `` avalon '' is a popular song . it was written by al jolson , buddy desylva and vincent rose in 1920. it was first recorded by jolson and used in the musicals `` sinbad '' and `` bombo '' . jolson 's version became # 2 on the american singles chart . it is possible that rose wrote the song alone , and that jolson 's name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular . at first only rose and jolson were marked as the writers , and desylva 's name was added later . many jazz artists have recorded the song , for example cab calloway ( 1934 ) , coleman hawkins ( 1935 ) and eddie durham ( 1936 ) . benny goodman played the song in his concert in carnegie hall in 1938. the song was also played in the films `` the jolson story '' ( 1946 ) and `` the benny goodman story '' ( 1956 ) . the melody at the beginning of the song was taken from giacomo puccini 's opera `` tosca '' , and rose changed it only a little . because of this , a court later decided that jolson and rose had to pay puccini 's publishers $ 25,000 and all later profits from the song .
