Adaptive radiation     adaptive radiation is rapid evolutionary radiation . it is an increase in the number and diversity of species in each lineage . it produces more new species , and those species live in a wider range of habitats . some definitions phrase it in terms of a single clade : `` adaptive radiation is the rapid proliferation of new taxa from a single ancestral group '' . however , in the most striking cases , such as occurred in the triassic after the greatest extinction event in earth history , many lines underwent rapid radiation simultaneously . this must have something to do with the availability of ecological niches and relative absence of competition . the ediacaran biota were the result of an early metazoan radiation . the greatest radiation of all took place early in the cambrian period , when most of our animal phyla evolved : see list of animal phyla . in the relative absence of competition , groups diversify to fill available habitats and niches . this is an evolutionary process driven by natural selection .
