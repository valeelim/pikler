Hydrozoa     the hydrozoa are a class of the phylum cnidaria . they are small predatory animals which mostly live in the sea . their basic life form is the polyp . some species live singly , others live in colonies . their classification and evolutionary relationships are still under discussion . the hydroids may be best understood by taking some examples . the most widely-known freshwater hydrozoan is `` hydra '' , which is found in slow-moving waters . it is sessile , with a pedal disc which attaches it to substrate . like all cnidarians , `` hydra '' uses nematocysts , stinging cells which disable its prey . hydra eat small crustaceans ( such as brine shrimp ) , insect larvae , and annelid worms . it may reproduce sexually , or by asexual reproduction ( budding ) . the portuguese man o ' war , `` physalia physalis '' , is a large colonial marine jellyfish . it is composed of many tiny individual zooids , which are specialised polyps and medusae . the colony has an air bladder , and floats on the surface . it delivers a massive sting to its prey . humans , if stung , may require medical attention . it is often accompanied by fish which are immune to the stings . this type of hydrozoan is called a siphonophore .
