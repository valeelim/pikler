X chromosome     the x chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals . they decide the sex ( gender ) of an individual . the other sex chromosome is the y chromosome . females have two x chromosomes , males have one x and one y. an egg always carries a single x , while sperms carry either an x or a y. that is how sex is determined in humans , and in most other mammals . although females have two x chromosomes , each cell can only have one x chromosome active . during early development , a process called x-inactivation occurs . in each cell one of the x chromosomes randomly deactivates . this causes different parts of the body to have different x-linked genes , and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats . related pages . - sex determination - karyotype - chromosome
