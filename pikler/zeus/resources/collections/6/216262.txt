Defenceman     defence ( defense in the u.s. ) in ice hockey is a player position whose main job is to stop the other team from scoring . they are often called defencemen , defensemen , d , or `` blueliners '' ( a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which is boundary of the offensive zone ; defencemen generally stay along the line to keep the puck in the zone ) . in regular play , two defencemen play with three forwards and a goaltender on the ice . exceptions include overtime and when a team is shorthanded ( i.e . has been assessed a penalty ) , in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender .
