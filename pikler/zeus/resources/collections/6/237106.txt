Bayesian network     a bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that can not be observed . this can then be used for inference . the graph that is used is directed , and does not contain any cycles . the nodes of the graph represent random variables . if two nodes are connected by an edge , it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other . bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of ( unassisted ) machine learning . they have been used where information needs to be classified . examples are image , document , or speech recognition , and information retrieval . it is based on reverend thomas bayes ' discovery in the 1740s called bayes ' theorem . the term `` bayesian networks '' was made by judea pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects : 1. the often subjective nature of the input information . 1. the reliance on bayes 's conditioning as the basis for updating information . 1. the distinction between causal and evidential modes of reasoning , which underscores thomas bayes ' posthumously published paper of 1763 .
