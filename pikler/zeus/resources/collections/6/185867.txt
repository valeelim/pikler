Foot binding     foot binding is an old chinese custom of wrapping girls ' feet with cloth in order to stop them from growing with age . some chinese legends people started binding women 's feet during the shang dynasty ( 1700–1027 bce ) . however , writing says that foot binding began at the court of the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ce ) . it lasted until the early 20th century , when it was banned by the people 's republic of china . foot binding was a sign of social status . if a woman 's feet were bound , it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work . however , foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status . by the 17th century , chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound . some people think that chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure . some people also see foot binding as insulting to women . but other people argue that this view is biased against the chinese culture in favor of modern western standards .
