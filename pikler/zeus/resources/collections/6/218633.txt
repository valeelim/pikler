Ediacaran     the ediacaran period ( about 635â€“541 million years ago ) , was named after the ediacara hills of south australia . it is the last geological period of the proterozoic eon . the edicaran is followed by the cambrian , the first period of the palaeozoic . the period is famous for the first larger-bodied fossils , which are probably the first recorded metazoans . these were impressions or trace fossils , first found in england 's charnwood forest , leicestershire . geologists did not know what they had found . it was over 60 years later before fossils from the same period were found in south australia . the status of the ediacaran as an official geological period was confirmed in 2004 by the international union of geological sciences ( iugs ) . this made it `` the first new geological period declared in 120 years '' . the ediacaran period was previously called the vendian period . the vendian period was proposed in 1952 by russian geologist/paleontologist boris sokolov . the term `` vendian '' is still widely used .
