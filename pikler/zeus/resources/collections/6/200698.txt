Problem of evil     the problem of evil is the question whether evil exists , and if so does it disprove the existence of god . certain religions say there is a god who is all-loving , all-knowing and all-powerful . in these religions , the question to answer is how an all-loving and all-powerful god could allow evil to exist . responses include the argument that if there is free will , evil must necessarily exist ; that humans can not understand god ; that evil is simply being without god ; or that there is evil because the world is corrupted and fallen ( from grace ) . a version of the problem of evil , perhaps by epicurus , goes as follows : 1. if a perfectly good god exists , then evil does not . 1. there is evil in the world . 1. therefore , a perfectly good god does not exist . another argument goes : 1. god exists . 1. god is all-powerful , all-knowing , and perfectly good . 1. a perfectly good being would want to prevent all evils . 1. an all-knowing being knows every way in which evils can happen . 1. an all-powerful being , who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence , has the power to prevent that evil from happening .
