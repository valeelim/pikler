Fritz Müller     fritz müller ( 31 march 1821 – 21 may 1897 ) , was a german biologist and doctor who went to live in southern brazil . there he studied the natural history . he was an early supporter of darwinism , and lived in brazil for the rest of his life . müllerian mimicry is named after him . unlike most of his contemporaries in britain , müller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of berlin and greifswald , culminating in a doctoral degree . then , he decided to study medicine . as a medical student , he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist . despite completing the course , he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath , which contained the phrase `` so help me god and his sacred gospel '' . müller was disappointed by the failure of the prussian revolution in 1848 , and realised there might be implications for his life and career . as a result , he emigrated to south brazil in 1852 , with his brother august and their wives , to join hermann blumenau 's new colony in the state of santa catarina . the colony , near the coast on the itajaí river , was called blumenau . in brazil , müller , living with his wife caroline , became a farmer , doctor , teacher and biologist , sometimes employed by the provincial government , sometimes surviving on his own efforts , sometimes defending against indians but always collecting evidence of life in the atlantic forest . the climate here is sub-tropical , and the vegetation typical of the brazilian coast : it is not rain forest .
