Glass transition     the glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state . an amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass . supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification . the glass transition temperature `` t '' is always lower than the melting temperature , `` t '' , of the crystalline state of the material , if one exists . above a glass transition temperature , a plastic is rubbery . below the glass transition temperature , a plastic is solid . thermosets , or thermo-setting plastics , burn up before they reach their melt temperature , but most thermosets also undergo glass transition .
