Projectile     a projectile is something that is sent flying through the air , usually as a weapon . any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile . for example , an arrow fired from a bow , a bullet , or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles . projectile weapons have been used for a long time . bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago . now most countries use projectile weapons instead of melee weapons like swords . this is because modern projectile weapons such as guns , rocket launchers , and artillery cannons can shoot at long ranges and are usually more deadly than melee weapons .
