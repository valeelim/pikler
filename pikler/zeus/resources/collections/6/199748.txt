Henry Walter Bates     henry walter bates ( leicester , 8 february 1825 â€“ london , 16 february 1892 ) was an english biologist who explored the amazon rainforest . this naturalist and explorer gave the first scientific account of mimicry in animals . batesian mimicry is named after him . he was most famous for his expedition to the amazon river basin with alfred russel wallace in 1848. he spent 11 years in the rain forest . when bates arrived home in 1859 , he had sent back over 14,000 species ( mostly of insects ) of which 8,000 were new to science . in 1847 wallace and bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the amazon basin . the plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to london , where an agent would sell them for a commission . also , for the travellers to `` gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species '' , as wallace put it in a letter to bates . the two friends , who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists , met in london to prepare themselves by viewing south american plants and animals in the main collections .
