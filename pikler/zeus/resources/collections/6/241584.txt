Satyagraha     satyagraha ( `` satyƒÅgraha '' ) is the idea of nonviolent resistance ( fighting with peace ) started by mohandas karamchand gandhi ( also known as `` mahatma '' gandhi ) . gandhi used `` satyagraha '' in the indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggle in south africa . `` satyagraha '' helped shape nelson mandela 's struggle in south africa under apartheid , martin luther king , jr. 's campaigns during the civil rights movement in the united states , and many other similar movements . someone who does `` satyagraha '' is a satyagrahi . the word `` satyagraha '' is from the sanskrit words `` satya '' ( meaning `` truth '' ) and `` agraha '' ( `` insistence '' , or `` holding firmly to '' ) . for gandhi , `` satyagraha '' went far beyond just `` passive resistance '' ( resisting without taking action ) . his non-violence also became his strength . he said that he chose the name because truth means love , and insistence means force , and the sanskrit name showed it was a force born from truth and love ( non-violence ) . he also wrote that he liked the term `` civil resistance '' better than `` civil disobedience '' . gandhi also translated it as `` love force '' or `` soul force '' .
