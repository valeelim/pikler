Carom billiards     carom billiards , sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole ( and sometimes used as another word for a game called `` straight rail '' ) are a family of billiards games played on cloth-covered tables . in these games , the players strike heavy balls with sticks called cues . carom billiards tables have no pockets or opening where balls are sunk , that snooker and pool tables do have . in its simplest form , the object of carom billiards games is to score points or `` counts '' by bouncing one 's own ball , called a cue ball , off of the other two balls on the table . the date the first carom game was invented is not exactly known . also , how exactly the games developed and which game was first is not clear . however , carom billiards games are believed to have started sometime in the 18th-century ( the 1700s ) in france in europe . there are many different games , each with distinct rules , strategies and objects of play , that are all part of carom billiards . some of the most well known games are `` straight rail '' , `` cushion caroms '' , `` balkline '' , `` three-cushion billiards '' and `` artistic billiards '' . there are many other carom billiards games that combine aspects of these games , but that are not as well known . for example , the `` champion 's game '' was a short-lived game that developed during a period between the invention of straight rail and the invention of balkline . other games are combinations of these games and other games played on tables `` with pockets '' ( pool or snooker games ) , such as `` english billiards '' played on a snooker table and its related games , `` american four-ball billiards '' , and `` cowboy pool '' , played on a pool table .
