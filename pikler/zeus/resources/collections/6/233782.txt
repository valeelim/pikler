B major     b major is a major scale based on b. its key signature has five sharps . b major 's relative minor is g-sharp minor , its parallel minor is b minor , and its enharmonic equivalent is c-flat major . the key signature for b major is the least sharp key signature with three `` lines '' of sharps . in the treble clef , putting the sharp for a where it looks like it should be , next to the sharp for g , would mean that a ledger line would have to be used . in the bass clef it would be possible to do this without a ledger line , but because sight reading is easier when both staves look the same , it is not usually done in piano music . in the alto clef , used in orchestral music , the b major key signature is usually written in just two `` lines '' of sharps . although b major is usually thought of as a `` far away '' key because it has many sharps and is quite far from c major in the circle of fifths , frédéric chopin thought that it was the easiest scale of all to play , as its black notes fit the natural positions of the fingers well . because of this , it was often the first scale he taught to beginning piano students , leaving the scale of c major till last because he thought it was the hardest to play .
