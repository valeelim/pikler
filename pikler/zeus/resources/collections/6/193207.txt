Paratrooper     paratroopers are soldiers trained in parachuting and generally operate as part of an airborne force . using paratroopers is called `` paradrop operations '' . the idea of dropping soldiers from height dates back to benjamin franklin whose idea was to drop soldiers with parachutes from balloons . the idea was not very practical , but the development of aeroplanes in world war i meant that it was feasible ( that is : a working idea ) to drop soldiers with parachutes from air . italy was the first country which founded airborne forces in the 1930s . germany and soviet union soon followed . germany was the first country to use paratroopers , called `` fallschirmj√§ger '' ( german language for `` parachute ranger '' ) in combat in world war two . germany dropped paratroops in netherlands , belgium , denmark and norway in 1940. united kingdom founded its own airborne forces in 1941. the first british paradrop operation was a guerrilla strike against an important water line in italy . in 1941 , the germans launched a massive paradrop operation in crete , capturing the island from the british . the british troops had fought back so bitterly and caused so heavy casualties ( that is : dead and wounded ) to the german paratroopers that adolf hitler forbade any further paradrop operations .
