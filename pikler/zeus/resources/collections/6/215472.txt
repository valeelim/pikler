Tudor period     the tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603 , specifically in relation to the history of england . this was the period when the tudor dynasty ruled in england . its first monarch was henry vii ( 1457– 1509 ) . the term is often used more broadly to include elizabeth i 's reign ( 1558– 1603 ) , although this is often treated separately as the elizabethan era . following the black death and the agricultural depression of the late 14th century , population grew bigger again . the export of woollen products to mainland europe helped the economy rather much . henry vii got favourable trading conditions in 1496. the high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 14th century and early 15th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage . various inflationary pressures , perhaps due to influx of new world gold and rising population , meant that the gap between the rich and poor widened . this was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population , because enclosure started .
