OSI model     the open systems interconnection model ( osi model ) is a method of thinking of computer networking in terms of abstraction layers . different communication technologies with similar functions are grouped into different logical layers on the osi model . each layer of the osi model makes use of functions provided by the layers below it and provides functions that are used by the layers above it . according to the standard osi model there are seven layers . each layer is dependent upon the layers below it to function . some aspects of computer networking , such as management and security , use or are used on every layer . the transport layer is the level at which system reliability and quality are ensured . this layer manages traffic flow through the network layer to reduce congestion on a network , and performs error checking ensuring quality of service by resending data when data has been corrupted . some of the most popular methods of encryption and firewall security take place on this layer .
