Planck length     the planck length is a very small unit of length . it is calculated from three physical constants : the speed of light , the planck constant , and the gravitational constant . it is about 1.6 x 10 m or about 10 times the size of a proton . it is one of the planck units , defined by max planck . it is an important length for quantum gravity because it may be the size of the smallest black holes .
