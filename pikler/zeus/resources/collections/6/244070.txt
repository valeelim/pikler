Kenny Rankin     kenny rankin ( february 10 , 1940 - june 7 , 2009 ) was an american pop and jazz singer and songwriter . he was originally from the washington heights neighborhood of new york city , new york . rankin was raised in new york and was introduced to music by his mother , who sang at home and for friends . the area of washington heights , manhattan was becoming heavily latino during his youth , and exposure to street music may have played a part . he began recording at age 17 ( 1957 ) , eventually working as a songwriter contracted to columbia records . rankin 's earliest composition , `` my carousel '' was written for carmen mcrae , followed by `` a happy guy '' for teen idol rick nelson . he had already developed a serious amphetamine problem by that time . he taught himself classical guitar , at age 24 , inspired by the playing of don costa , who had started on that instrument before becoming one of the most important arrangers in popular music . he played rhythm guitar on some tracks on bob dylan 's album bringing it all back home ( 1965 ) . rankin developed a considerable following during the 70s with a steady flow of albums , three of which broke into the top 100 of the billboard album chart . his liking for jazz was evident from an early age , but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop-oriented course , and he cited singer-songwriter laura nyro consistently as a major influence .
