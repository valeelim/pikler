Hagfish     hagfish are craniates in the superclass cyclostomata , class myxini . hagfish do not have a skeleton , except they do have a skull , which is made of cartilage . because of this , many researchers think myxini should not be in the subphylum vertebrata . however , because of its fins and gills , they are called fish . they are marine , meaning they live in the sea . the original 19th century classification groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes ( or historically , agnatha ) , as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes . an alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish , so vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish . recent dna evidence supports the original scheme . hagfish are usually about half a meter ( 18 in ) long . they have long , eel-like bodies . hagfish 's eyes are small and not very useful , because the hagfish uses mostly its senses of smell and touch to find food . the whiskers near the hagfish 's mouth are called barbels , and are used for touching . they have four hearts , two brains , and no backbone . a fish which looks like the hagfish is the lamprey .
