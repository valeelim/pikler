Sauropterygia     the sauropterygia was a superorder of successful aquatic reptiles that flourished during the mesozoic era . they are united by an adaptation of their shoulder , designed to support powerful paddle strokes . some later sauropterygians like the pliosaurs developed a similar mechanism in their pelvis . the earliest sauropterygians appeared about 245 million years ago , at the start of the triassic period . at first they were small , less than a metre . they were semi-aquatic lizard-like animals with long limbs ( called pachypleurosaurs ) . they developed into a group called the nothosaurs , several meters long . the sauropterygians included another very distinctive group : the placodonts . they were bottom-feeders on shellfish , and possessed flat , crushing teeth to handle their prey . the end-triassic extinction event wiped them all out except for the plesiosaurs . during the earliest jurassic these diversified quickly into the long-necked small-headed plesiosaurs proper , and short-necked large-headed pliosaurs .
