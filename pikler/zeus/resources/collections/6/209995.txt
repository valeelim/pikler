Woodcut     a woodcut is a way of printing . an image is cut into a block of wood . the printing part remains level with the surface . the non-printing parts are removed , often with a tool called a gouge . the areas that are 'white ' are cut away with a knife or chisel . therefore the wood still at the original surface level are black in the final print . the wood block is cut in the direction of the grain of the wood . in europe beechwood was most commonly used . in japan , a special type of cherry wood was used . the surface is covered with ink . it is rolled over the surface with an ink-covered roller ( called a brayer ) . this leaves ink upon the flat surface , but none in the non-printing areas . sometimes woodcuts are referred to by a formal word , xylography .
