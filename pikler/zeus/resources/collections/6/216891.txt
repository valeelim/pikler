Westphalia     westphalia ( ) is a region in germany . the cities of arnsberg , bielefeld , bochum , detmold , dortmund , gelsenkirchen , hagen , minden and münster are in its centre . in 1946 , the state of north rhine-westphalia was created , which includes part of the historical region . westphalia is roughly the region between the rivers rhine and weser , north and south of the ruhr river . during the course of history , different places and regions were called `` westphalia '' , the borders of the region can therefore not be defined exactly , as they depend on the entity and time talked about . for the same reason , there are different specifications of its area and number of people . they range between in land area , and between 4.3 million and 8 million people . there is a consensus that münster , bielefeld and dortmund are part of westphalia . a linguistic definition of westphalia ( see westphalian language ) includes the former prussian province of westphalia ( except siegen-wittgenstein ) , lippe , the region around osnabrück and the greater area of the emsland . present-day common use , however , often restricts the notion to the present part of north rhine-westphalia .
