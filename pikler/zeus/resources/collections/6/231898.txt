Bronchus     bronchi ( one bronchus ) are the large air tubes leading from the trachea to the lungs . they carry air to the lungs . the trachea ( windpipe ) divides to form the right and left main bronchi . these divide to form smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles . eventually the bronchioles end in the alveoli ( small air sacs ) . at the alveoli , oxygen from the air we breathe into our lungs is moved into the blood . the blood then carries oxygen around to the rest of the body , which needs oxygen to survive . without the bronchi , air would never get into the lungs , and oxygen would never get into our bodies . the bronchi 's walls are made of cartilage . the right bronchus ( shown on the left in the image on this page ) is shorter , wider , and straighter than the left bronchus . other pages to read . - bronchitis ( an illness that affects the bronchi ) - asthma ( a disease that makes the bronchi get narrower ) - bronchodilators ( medicines that help the bronchi get wider when they narrow because of a disease like asthma )
