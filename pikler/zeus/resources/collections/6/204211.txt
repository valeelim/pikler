Milkweed     the milkweeds , asclepias ( l. 1753 ) , are a genus of herbaceous perennial , dicotyledonous plants that contains over 140 known species . milkweeds are an important nectar source for bees and other nectar eaters , and a food source for caterpillars . the weeds are eaten by caterpillars of the monarch butterfly and its relatives , and by other herbivorous insects ( such as beetles , and true bugs ) . these insects are able to feed on the plants despite their chemical defences . milkweed is named after its milky sap , which contains alkaloids , latex , and several other complex compounds . some species are toxic . pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner , as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs . the feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees , wasps and butterflies , slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers . the bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect , pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off . pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit .
