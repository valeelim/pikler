Teleost     teleosts are the dominant fish of the present day . they arose in the mesozoic era , and include 20,000 living species . the oldest teleost fossils date back to the late triassic . they evolved from fish like bowfins in the clade holostei . during the mesozoic and cainozoic they diversified . 96 percent of all known fish species are teleosts . they are , in order of evolution , vertebrates , jawed fish ( gnathostomata ) , bony fish ( osteichthyes ) and ray-finned fish ( actinopterygii ) . teleosts have a movable jaw and changes in the jaw muscles . these changes make it possible for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth . this adaptation improves their ability to grab fast-moving prey . the date of origin of the teleosts is a difficult problem . two kinds of evidence are available . there is evidence from the fossil record , in which the first teleost comes from the late triassic period . this date is somewhat later than molecular divergence time estimates ( molecular clock ) . a recent paper finds that fossil dates and molecular clock dates are similar to each other . these researchers atate :
