Cosmic microwave background radiation     cosmic background microwave radiation ( cmb radiation ) is radiation in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum , which comes from all directions in outer space . it is known to come from our earliest infant universe . since the universe is very large , and the speed of light is constant , we know that when the cmb light arrives form the infant universe , it arrives as the oldest signal that we can detect . during the big bang , a lot of high-energy radiation was created . then , the universe became bigger and colder . therefore , the high-energy photons lost most of their original energy . now , as a result , that radiation is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( the microwave part has quite low energy ) . the cosmic microwave background is the radiation that has been travelling without hitting anything ever since the time the universe became transparent , about 380,000 years after the big bang . arno penzias and robert wilson first detected the cmb radiation . scientists think that the existence of cmb radiation is important evidence , with red shift , that the big bang theory is true .
