Opium Wars     the opium wars were two wars between china and western countries . the first was between great britain and china and lasted from 1839 until 1842. the second opium war was from 1856 to 1860. the second opium war was also known as the `` arrow war '' or `` anglo-french war '' in china . french soldiers also took a big part in this war . early in the 19th century , british merchants began secretly taking opium into china . they wanted to balance their purchases of tea for export to britain . in 1839 , china said that opium was not allowed . in canton in south china , which is now called guangzhou , the chinese destroyed a lot of opium that they had taken from british merchants . great britain was unhappy about this and sent gunboats to attack chinese coastal cities . china had no modern weapons so they were defeated . china was forced to sign the treaty of nanjing with the british and another one called the supplementary treaty of the bogue . the wars were about many other things than opium . they were also about opening china to european and american trade and colonizations .
