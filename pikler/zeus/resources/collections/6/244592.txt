Boolean satisfiability problem     the boolean satisfiability problem is a kind of problem . it is from math-based logic . in propositional logic , a formula is `` satisfiable '' if the variables it uses can be given values so that it becomes true . it is important to know that for a given formula , no numbers exist so that the formula becomes true . in other words , the formula will always be false no matter what values its variables have . the formula is called `` satisfiable '' in the first case . it is called `` unsatisfiable '' in the second case . this problem is also known as `` boolean or propositional satisfiability '' . computer scientists usually call it sat . complexity theory believes that the formula should be in a special form , known as conjunctive normal form . a formula that is in this form has clauses . clauses are joined by a `` logical and '' . each clause has several literals . they are joined by a `` logical or '' . a literal and its complement can not appear in the same clause . the problem may also have other names . the names depend on what the logical formula looks like . the names also depend on how many variables are used per clause .
