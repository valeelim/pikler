Dwarfism     dwarfism is used to describe a person of short stature , less than 4 feet , 10 inches ( 147 cm ) . this is often , though not always , because of a medical condition . people with this condition are called dwarves or little people . a similar term for short people is midget ; however , dwarves and midgets are not the same . midgets are perfectly proportioned humans , while dwarves have a large head and misshapen limbs and torsos . dwarfism is often caused by the person inheriting an allele ( a mutant gene ) , which produces a defect in development . defects caused by genetics are the main kind of congenital defects , and usually can not be cured . the most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in bone development called `` achondroplasia '' , in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body . this accounts for 70 % of cases . extreme shortness , but with body parts of normal proportions , may be caused by growth hormone deficiency , once known as `` pituitary dwarfism '' . there are more than 200 other conditions which may cause dwarfism .
