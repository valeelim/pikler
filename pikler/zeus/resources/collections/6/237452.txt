Ogyū Sorai     sorai rejected the moral ways of song confucianism and looked at the older works instead . he argued that allowing human emotions to express themselves was important . for this reason , he tried to strengthen the position that chinese literature had in japan . sorai had a large following with his teachings and created the sorai school , which would become an influential force in japanese confucian scholarship . sorai was born the second son of a samurai ( a warrior ) who served as the personal physician of tokugawa tsunayoshi ( 徳川綱吉 ) . tsunayoshi would become the fifth shogun . sorai studied the zhu xi version of song confucianism , and by 1690 he became a private teacher of chinese classics . in 1696 , he started serving yanagisawa yoshiyasu , a senior councilor to tsunayoshi . tsunayoshi died in 1709. at that time sorai stopped using the teachings of zhu xi and started to develop his own philosophy and school . sorai is credited with the creation of kō shōgi , an unusual form of chess . sorai wrote many influential works where he showed what he thought were the two basic problems of the philosophy of song confucianism . the first was with the bakufu-domain system , which by the eighteenth century was in trouble . sorai doubted that it was enough that each person wanted to find their ethical good . he argued that solving the political crisis of the time required more than perfecting moral character . he also saw that the chinese sage kings were not only concerned with morality , but also with government itself . the second point where sorai disagreed with song confucianism was that he felt it was putting too much emphasis on morality and that it repressed human nature , because human nature was based on emotion .
