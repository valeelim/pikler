Palaeocene     the palaeocene is the first geological epoch in the palaeogene . it started after the end of the cretaceous , and lasted for about 10 million years . it was followed by the eocene epoch . the palaeocene began and ended with an extinction event , each of quite a different character . the epoch began with the k/t extinction event , caused by a combination of a meteorite strike ( chicxulub crater ) and a huge volcanic flood basalt eruption which produced the deccan traps in what is now india . this caused the extinction of many groups , including the dinosaurs and many other reptiles . the epoch ended with the `` palaeocene–eocene thermal maximum '' , a deep ocean anoxic event ( doae ) . this means that the ocean depths were lacking oxygen , so no higher forms of life could survive . this produced a mass extinction of between 35–50 % of deep water forms such as benthic foraminifera , and coincided with a major change of mammalian types on land . after a cooler start , the climate grew warmer during the epoch , far warmer than today , and the world was heavily forested . there were no ice caps at the poles . warm seas circulated throughout the world , including the poles . the earliest paleocene featured a low diversity and abundance of marine life , but this trend reversed later in the epoch . tropical conditions gave rise to abundant marine life , including coral reefs . with the demise of marine reptiles at the end of the cretaceous , sharks became the top predators . at the end of the cretaceous , the ammonites and many species of foraminifera became extinct .
