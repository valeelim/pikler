Mannerism     mannerism is a style of art that was created in the late renaissance period , from about 1520 until about 1600. the mannerist style of painting or sculpture often shows figures that are `` elongated '' ( made longer ) and `` distorted '' ( made into strange shapes '' ) . the aim of the mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked `` elegant '' . the mannerist style began in italy , where the artists were influenced by the figures that michelangelo painted on the ceiling and in the `` last judgement '' in the sistine chapel . during the renaissance , artists like leonardo da vinci and raphael had tried very hard to learn from nature , and to paint things in a way that was very realistic . these two famous painters both died around 1520. many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to `` express themselves '' . they were not going to follow the rules of anatomy and perspective in the way that leonardo and raphael did . mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting , writhing or fighting . the faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness , fear , hatred or sexual feelings .
