Ecological niche     an ecological niche is the part of the environment into which a species fits , and to which it is adapted . a shorthand definition of niche in biology is how an organism makes a living in a place . however , the term has been used in different ways . it is not only a place but a way of life . for example , grazers , insectivores , scavengers and predators can all live their different lifestyles in the same forest . a niche can be occupied by different species in different places even though they 'earn their living ' in roughly the same way . thus the 'bird of prey eating small mammals ' niche would in grasslands include the kestrel , but in an oak wood it would be filled by the tawny owl . the idea of a niche in natural history is ancient : many writers noticed that animals and plants live in places where they are well adapted to live . the word `` niche '' was first used in biology by naturalist roswell johnson , but in 1917 joseph grinnell was the first to use it in a research program . later , he described the niches of a variety of species . grinnell was the first to offer the `` exclusion principle '' in which only one species could occupy a particular niche at any one time .
