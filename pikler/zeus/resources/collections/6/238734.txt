French defence     the french defence is a chess opening , one of the asymmetric replies to 1.e4 , namely 1 ... e6 . it is the third most popular reply to 1.e4 . often , black plays more actively on the queenside while white plays more actively on the kingside . a problem that black often has in the french defence is finding a way for his light squared bishop to become active . although this is true , it may not matter if black knows what he is doing . the defence has a reputation for reliability , and has been played by many great players ( such as botvinnik ) , and has featured in several world championship matches . typical examples go : 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.nd2 c5 ( 3 ... nf6 is popular ) 4.exd5 exd5 5.nf3 nc6 6.bb5 bd6 7.dxc5 bxc5 8.0-0 ne7 and so on . this line is quiet , and mostly about the centre . 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.nc3 bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 bxc3+ 6.bxc3 ne7 7.qg4 qc7 ( 7 ... 0-0 is possible ) 8.qxg7 rg8 9.qxh7 cxd4 10.ne2 and so on . the play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric : white owns the kingside , and black owns the queenside .
