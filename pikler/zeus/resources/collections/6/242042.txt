Substrate (biochemistry)    substrate ( biochemistry ) in biochemistry , a substrate is the molecule acted on by an enzyme to produce a product . the general equation for an enzyme reaction is : an example : sucrase , 400 times the size of its substrate sucrose , splits the sucrose into its constituent sugars , which are glucose and fructose . the sucrase bends the sucrose , and strains the bond between the glucose and fructose . water molecules join in and make the cleavage in a fraction of a second . 1. enzymes increase the rate of reaction up to 10 billion-fold and are effective in tiny amounts . one enzyme molecule may convert 1000 molecules of substrate a minute , and some are known to convert 3 million in a minute . 1. a substrate may be capable of many reactions . one enzyme will only carry out one of the many reactions of which a substrate is capable .
