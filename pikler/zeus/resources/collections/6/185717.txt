Overcharge     overcharge is an economic term used in legal discourse about price fixing violations . an overcharge is the difference between what a buyer or seller `` actually '' paid for a good purchased from a cartel and what the buyer or seller `` would have '' paid in the absence of a price-fixing cartel . the total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits . under u.s. federal antitrust law , buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court . the overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the lerner index , the most common measure of market power in economics . both measures employ the same numerator ( pm - pc ) , where pm is the observed market price and pc is the competitive benchmark price , but use different denominators . the overcharge ratio is ( pm-pc ) /pc , whereas the lerner index is ( pm-pc ) /pm . both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices . the lerner index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market . the overcharge has no upper limit .
