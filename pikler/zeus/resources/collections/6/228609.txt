Xiongnu     the xiongnu ( ) were nomads who lived north of china from about 3rd century bc to 460s ad . their lands were very infertile , so they tried to attack china many times . as this was very irritating , the first emperor of china ( qin shi huang ) built the great wall of china around 214 to 206 bc to keep them out . some han dynasty emperors tried to stop the wars and make friends with them , but they still tried to attack the chinese borders . at first , it was believed that they were related to the huns , and currently many people still believe this . in old times , nomadic tribes often travelled and lived together , even tribes speaking different languages . around 60 bc , there was a struggle for power , and the xiongnu broke up into five smaller tribes . in 202 ad , the leader of the southern xiongnu surrendered to prime minister cao cao of the han dynasty . they are part of the mongolian people now , or some of them have migrated to china for a better life .
