Regeneration     regeneration means that an organism regrows a lost part , so that the original function is restored . it is a term in developmental biology . the ability to regenerate differs in different groups . whereas newts , for example , can regenerate severed limbs , mammals can not . limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps , first de-differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second , development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time . simpler animals like flatworms can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies . these can migrate to damaged parts of the body , then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue .
