Grapeshot     grape shot is a hollow ball , packed with small `` grape '' sized metal balls which can be fired by a gun or a cannon . the hollow balls are fired as a single round that breaks apart upon leaving the muzzle of a black powder cannon , which were common common to the 1700 and 1800 's . grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds . a shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse . the fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target . it is designed to explode when it reaches its target . grape shot begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon . shrapnel , while similar to both , is different and more deadly . invented by a british officer during the napoleonic wars , it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits . when the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force . all three of these rounds , grape shot , shell , and shrapnel , are extremely effective against troops , horses and other livestock . they can also destroy wooden structures from their intense fragmentation impact . shells have historically been particularly effective as incendiaries against wooden targets , which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast . grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern . this is best for people targets , but it may be quite damaging against nearby wooden structures .
