Phoneme     phonemes are the units of sound ( speech ) which distinguish one word from another in a particular language . in most varieties ( accents and dialects ) of spoken english there are about 24 consonantal phonemes and 20 vowel phonemes ( altogether 44 phonemes ) , but only 26 letters in writing . to learn all the phonemes in english , it would be better to use the ipa , which has a unique letter for every phoneme in english , instead of the english alphabet .
