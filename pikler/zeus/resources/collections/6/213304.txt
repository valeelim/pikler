Mandelbrot set     the mandelbrot set is a famous example of a fractal in mathematics . it is named after beno√Æt mandelbrot , a polish-french-american mathematician . the mandelbrot set is important for the chaos theory . the edging of the set shows a self-similarity , which is not perfect because it has deformations . the mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation `` z '' = `` z '' + `` c '' . in that equation , `` c '' and `` z '' are complex numbers and `` n '' is zero or a positive integer ( natural number ) . starting with `` z '' =0 , c is in the mandelbrot set if the absolute value of `` z '' never becomes larger than a certain number ( that number depends on c ) , no matter how large `` n '' gets . mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images , leading to his discovering the mandelbrot set in 1979. that was because he had access to ibm 's computers . he was able to show how visual complexity can be created from simple rules . he said that things typically considered to be `` rough '' , a `` mess '' or `` chaotic '' , like clouds or shorelines , actually had a `` degree of order '' . the equation `` z '' = `` z '' + `` c '' was known long before benoit mandelbrot used a computer to visualize it .
