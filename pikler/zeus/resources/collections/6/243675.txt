Velvet     velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are very evenly distributed , with a short dense pile , giving it a distinctly smooth feel . velvet can be made from many different fibres . it is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time . the two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls . velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile , but modern dry cleaning methods perform well . velvet is made , ideally , from silk . more recently , synthetic velvets have been developed , mostly polyester , nylon , viscose , acetate , and mixtures of different synthetics , or synthetics and natural fibers ( e.g . viscose and silk ) . a small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch . the art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century . king richard ii of england directed in his will that his body should be clothed `` in velveto '' in 1399. the earliest sources of european artistic velvets were weavers in lucca , genoa , florence and venice .
