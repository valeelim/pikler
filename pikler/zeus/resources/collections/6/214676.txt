Atomic radius     the atomic radius of an element is the distance between the nucleus and the edge of the electron cloud . the atomic radius is rather hard to define , because it is impossible to know where all of the electrons are at a given time . in the periodic table of the elements , the atomic radius tends to increase as you move down a group because the number of electrons is greater , and so the radius of the circle of electrons in the element is bigger . as you move to the right across a period , the atomic radius tends to decrease due to the shielding effect .
