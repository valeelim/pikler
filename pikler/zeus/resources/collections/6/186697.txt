The Red Queen     the red queen is the name of an evolutionary theory of leigh van valen and , later , a book by matt ridley . the term is taken from the red queen 's race in lewis carroll 's `` through the looking-glass '' . the red queen said , `` it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . '' the red queen principle can be stated as follows : the hypothesis is used to explain two different phenomena : the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals , and the constant evolutionary arms race between competing species . the book takes van valen 's idea , which is about co-evolution , and extends it into a discussion about sexual selection in humans . it argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex , since human nature is a product of evolution , and evolution in our case is driven by sexual selection . sex is an evolutionary puzzle . in most sexual species , males make up half the population , yet they bear no offspring directly and generally contribute little to the survival of offspring . in birds and mammals that idea seems less true . they often help protect females , and help in some way after the young are born . therefore these males definitely do help in the survival of their offspring . but sexual reproduction is very common in simpler forms of life , where the males have nothing to do with their offspring .
