British Pakistani community     british pakistanis ( also pakistani britons ) are people in the united kingdom of pakistani ancestry . the uk has the second largest overseas pakistani population after saudi arabia . pakistan came into existence in 1947 , so documentation of the life of pakistani britons technically can only start from that year . however , muslim immigrants from the part of british india now known as pakistan , entered the british isles as early as the mid-seventeenth century . following the second world war and the break-up of the british empire , pakistani migration to the united kingdom increased , specifically during the 1950s and 1960s , as pakistan was a part of the commonwealth . the majority of the immigration began in the mid-1950s when manual workers were recruited to fulfil the labour shortage which resulted from world war ii . many people began immigrating from pakistan-administered kashmir after the completion of mangla dam in mirpur in the late 1950s as well , that destroyed hundreds of villages and stimulated a large wave of migration . up to 5,000 people from mirpur ( 10 % of the displaced ) left for britain .
