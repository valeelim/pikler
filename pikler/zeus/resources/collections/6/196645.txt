Venice and Dalmatia     venice and dalmatia were an italian city-state and an eastern adriatic region very much related from the middle ages until the 19th century . venice influenced dalmatia commercially since the times of charlemagne . but only at the end of the first millennium the republic of venice started to conquest dalmatia . indeed , after the fall of the western roman empire , illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other romance languages , progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called `` dalmatian language '' . the earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50,000 people spoke it at that time ( according to the linguist matteo bartoli ) . the dalmatian language is an extinct romance language that was spoken along the eastern adriatic in the dalmatian coast from fiume ( rijeka ) as far south as kotor ( cattaro ) in montenegro . the dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of zadar , trogir , split , dubrovnik and kotor ( `` zara , tra√π , spalato , ragusa '' and `` cattaro '' in italian ) , each of these cities having a local dialect , and also on the islands of krk , cres and rab ( `` veglia , cherso '' and `` arbe '' )
