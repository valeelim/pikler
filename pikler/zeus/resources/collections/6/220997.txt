Morning Musume     in late 1997 , in japan , a male singer-songwriter called tsunku , held a contest to find a girl to be the lead singer of the band sharam q , which he was the frontman of . a lot of young girls came to the contest , and some of them became finalists . there is where tsunku came up with the idea of making a girl group . this new group was called morning musume ( morning daughters ) . the group was formed by kaori iida , yuko nakazawa , asuka fukuda , aya ishiguro and natsumi abe . they became known as the `` first generation '' of the group . there have now been twelve of these `` generations '' . most of these `` generations '' have a few members . but the third , seventh and twelfth generations only had one member each . from the start , the songs performed by these girls sold well . they became very famous in japan ( their fame later reached other countries too , thanks to their fans on the world wide web ) , and tsunku formed other small groups inspired by morning musume . he created hello ! project to hold them all .
