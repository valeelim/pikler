Strepsirrhini     the strepsirrhini clade is one of the two suborders of primates , with 114 species . they are defined by their wet noses , although the greek name means having a curved or bent nose . madagascar 's only primates ( apart from humans ) are strepsirrhines , although others can be found in southeast asia . their eyes have a reflective layer to improve their night vision , and their eye sockets have a ring of bone around the eye . strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin c , whereas haplorhine primates ( and ourselves ) must get it from their diets . the suborder contains the lemurs and lorises . the modern types probably evolved from the adapiforms , an extinct group . the origin of the earliest primates , from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines ( simians and tarsiers ) evolved , is a mystery . both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain . although the fossil record of their initial radiation across the northern hemisphere is very detailed , the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor , particularly around the time that primates and other eutherian mammals were first appearing .
