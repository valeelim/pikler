K/T extinction event     the cretaceous–tertiary extinction event , or cretaceous–palaeogene extinction event , was about 66 million years ago . it may be called the k/t extinction event or even k/pg event for short . this is the famous event which killed the dinosaurs at the end of the cretaceous period . it was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species . the event marks the end of the mesozoic era and the beginning of the cainozoic era . dinosaur fossils are only found below the k/t boundary . this shows they became extinct before , or during the event . mosasaurs , plesiosaurs , pterosaurs and many species of plants and invertebrates also became extinct . mammalian and bird groups got through the event with some extinctions . those that survived became widespread and varied during their later evolutionary radiation . scientists think the k/t extinctions were caused by something sudden and powerful , such as one or more massive asteroid or meteor impacts , and increased volcanic activity .
