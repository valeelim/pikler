Conjugate variables     conjugate variables are special pairs of variables ( e.g. , x , y , z ) that do not commute , if two variables , let us call them m and n , commute , then mn = nm . if two variables , let us call them p and q , do not commute , then pq ≠ qp . one of the best known pairs of conjugate variables was found in 1925 by werner heisenberg and his co-workers . heisenberg changed equations from classical physics to describe and predict quantum events . that way he produced an equation that could be used to figure out the product of momentum ( mass × velocity ) and position ( x , y , z , t ) : in the following equations , n , n-a , n-b , etc . name energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen atom . so in the diagram that shows an electron falling from a higher to a lower orbit , a pair of values such as n and n-a would belong to the beginning orbit and the ending orbit . the first kind of equation could be used to calculate the product of momentum and position : the same kind of equation could be used to calculate the product of position and momentum :
