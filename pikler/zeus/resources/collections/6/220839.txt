Pennsylvanian     the pennsylvanian is the upper carboniferous epoch in the strata of north america . it comes after ( above ) the mississippian , and before the permian . the pennsylvanian started about 323 million years ago ( mya ) , and ended about 299 mya . the `` coal measures '' , which give the carboniferous its name , are the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests . they were formed in the pennsylvanian , from about 315â€“300 million years years ago . these forests were on the equator , and the wetlands , which are always low-lying , stretched from north america in the west , through what is now europe to china in the east , because these continents were all together at the time ( laurussia ) . the river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched 5000km from eastern canada to the ukraine , and was 700km wide . this would make the pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on earth today . the characteristic vertebrates of the coal measures were amphibia , and the plants were mostly giant clubmosses such as `` lepidodendron '' .
