G-sharp minor     g-sharp minor is a minor scale based on g. for the harmonic minor , the f is raised to f. its key signature has five sharps . its relative major is b major . the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary . g-sharp minor is usually not used in orchestral music except to modulate , but it is more common in keyboard music , like scriabin 's sonatas . for orchestration of piano music ( writing it so an orchestra can play it ) , sometimes the music is transposed to g minor or a minor . if g-sharp minor must be used , b-flat wind instruments should have their part written in b-flat minor , not a-sharp minor . in a few scores , 5-sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the a on the top line . references . - a. morris , `` symphonies , numbers and keys '' in `` bob 's poetry magazine '' , iii.3 , 2006 .
