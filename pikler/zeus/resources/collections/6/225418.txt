Caving     caving ( or spelunking ) is the hobby or recreation of exploring caves . people who explore caves are called spelunkers . wise spelunkers explore in groups , to prevent being lost or stranded in a cave . spelunkers need reliable equipment , because the descent into a cave is like mountain climbing in the opposite direction . basic spelunking equipment is similar to what mountain climbers use . strong ropes make climbing possible and special tools attach ropes to cave walls . special footwear makes it easier to explore hard to reach places , and hard hats protect spelunkers from falling rocks above . caves are extremely dark , so spelunkers have to carry at least three light sources ( like torches and flares ) . one torch attaches to a spelunker 's helmet so it is with him or her at all times . caves are also very cold , so most spelunkers wear heavy clothing for warmth . spelunkers tie their ropes with different kinds of knots , like the `` farmer 's hitch knot '' and the `` alpine butterfly knot '' . spelunkers choose different knots for different purposes . some knots work well to hold people as they climb . other knots are best for tying ropes together .
