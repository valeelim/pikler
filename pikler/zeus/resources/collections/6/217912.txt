Nudibranch     nudibranchs are a widespread and successful group of marine gastropod molluscs . the name means 'naked gills ' . they are shelless and uncoiled gastropods , famous for their brilliant colours . there are more than 3000 known species . nudibranchs are one of the groups which are informally known as sea slugs . this is a term which includes other gastropod groups which look similar to nudibranchs . sea slugs is an informal term ; it is not a monophyletic group . the body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly . they are `` opisthobranchs '' , a clade which shed their shells after the larval stage . unlike most other gastropods they are `` bilaterally symmetrical '' . they have undergone secondary detorsion . most species have venomous appendages on their sides . these are used to deter predators . many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a radula . unusually for molluscs , they lack a mantle cavity . nudibranchs are hermaphrodite , and thus have a set of reproductive organs for both sexes , but they rarely fertilize themselves .
