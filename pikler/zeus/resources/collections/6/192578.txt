Bayreuth Festival     the bayreuth festival is a music festival held every year in bayreuth , germany , at which performances of operas by the 19th century german composer richard wagner are performed . it was wagner 's own idea to start a festival for his operas in bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed . the theatre that he designed is called the festspielhaus ( festival house ) . wagner watched the theatre being built , making sure that it was done the way he wanted it . he had some new ideas about theatre design . for example : he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience . when the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the `` der ring des nibelungen '' was performed complete for the first time . the festival immediately became internationally famous . almost every serious musician in europe wanted to go to bayreuth to hear wagner 's music performed there . composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it , or they hated it and reacted against it .
