Equilibrium     an equilibrium is a state of a system where all forces acting on the system is balanced . a system that is in equilibrium does not change . the word has been used for different concepts from different fields of study . - hydrostatic equilibrium applies to liquids . - thermal equilibrium means as much heat is entering and leaving something . - homeostasis is a living thing keeping its internal balance . chemical equilibrium is an idea which describes the behavior of chemical reactions over time . in reactions that have finished reacting and have attained equlibrium , the concentrations of the reactant and product chemicals do not change . an example of an equilibrium reaction is as follows : formula_1 in the example above , the double arrow shows that the reaction is an equilibrium reaction . this means that the forward reaction and the backward reaction can happen , usually due to a small enthalpy change in each reaction . hence , the amount of product chemicals to reactant chemicals remains a fixed value , and such a ratio is called the equilibrium constant ( k ) .
