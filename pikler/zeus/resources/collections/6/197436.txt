Biofuel     biofuel is fuel from recently lifeless or living biological material . it is different to fossil fuels from long dead biological material . biofuel can be in forms of solid , liquid or gas . biofuels are usually used to power cars , heat homes and for cooking . biofuel companies are mainly from europe , asia and the americas . technologies developed at the los alamos national lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel . agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific plants , rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled material . there are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels . one is to grow crops that are high in sugar ( e.g . sugar cane ) or starch ( e.g . corn ) , and then use yeast to produce ethyl alcohol ( ethanol ) . the second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil , such as palm oil , soybean and algae . when these oils are heated , their viscosity is reduced , and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine , or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel . wood and its by-products can also be converted into biofuels such as charcoal , woodgas , methanol or ethanol fuel . it is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts , but this can be expensive .
