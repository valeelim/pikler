Lady Susan     lady susan is an early epistolary novel ( novel in letters ) by jane austen . it tells the story of an widow who does not care about the feelings of other men . she wrote it when she was writing her first version of `` sense and sensibility '' ( which was at that time called `` elinor and marianne '' ) , and which was also at first , like `` lady susan '' , written in letter form . she was at this time 20 years old . the epistolary novel had been popular in the 18th century , but it was not the best style of writing for jane austen 's talents ( which is why all her major novels were written in the third-person style ) . she admired richardson very much ( all of his books are written in letters , like `` pamela ( novel ) '' and `` clarissa ( novel ) '' ) , and she also admired frances burney 's style , but none of their styles came naturally to her . she pointed out at the end of `` lady susan '' : `` this correspondence ( letter-writing ) , by a meeting between some of the parties ( people ) and a separation between the others could not , to the great of the post office ... be continued longer .
