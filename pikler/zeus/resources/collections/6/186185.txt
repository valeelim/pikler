Cell biology     cell biology is the study of how living cells work . this includes the structure and function of the cell organelles , and the carbon-based molecules which cells produce . cell biology is an interdisciplinary subject , and uses ideas from genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , immunology , and other subjects and techniques . the most important molecules in cell biology are dna , rna and proteins . the most important structures in the cell are the nucleus and the chromosomes , but there are others . the structure of eukaryotic cells is much more complex than prokaryotic cells . this is because endosymbiosis has occurred : some or all of the eukaryote organelles are former prokaryotes . examples are mitochondria and plastids . the most important function of cells is to divide by mitosis or meiosis . cells in a multicellular organism also specialise in different functions , and the different types may look quite to each other . - cytology is mostly about the appearance and structure of cells .
