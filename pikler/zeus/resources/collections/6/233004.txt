Lagerstätte     lagerstätte ( plural : `` lagerstätten '' ) is a german word for places ( sites ) of exceptional fossil preservation . adolf seilacher coined the term in 1970 to describe sites , like solnhofen , which yielded the most exceptional fossils . extra-special sites are called `` konservat-lagerstätten '' ( conservation lagerstätten ) . these are deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fine details . there skeletons are mostly articulated ( bones together in life form ) , and the soft parts are preserved as impressions or casts . in lagerstätten the normal processses of decay after death were less active or halted as sediment was deposited . this allowed the preservation of soft parts and exceptional detail . there are several possible causes which allow this to happen : 1. anoxic or near anoxic conditions ( e.g . oxygen-free mud ) which suppresses common bacterial decomposition long enough for the initial casts of soft body parts to register . 1. rapid burial in volcanic ash from a nearby eruption . this prevents scavengers and burrowing animals from reaching the dead body . it also produces a low-oxygen environment .
