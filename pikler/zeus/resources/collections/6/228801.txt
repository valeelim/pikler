Absolute value     in mathematics , the absolute value or modulus of a real number is the number without the sign . the absolute value of `` 2 '' is `` 2 '' , the absolute value of `` -2 '' is also 2. this notation is to express a number 's distance from zero on a number line . the absolute value of 10 would be 10 since the number 10 is 10 numbers away from zero , same follows with negatives . the modulus of a complex number is given by for any real number the absolute value of is denoted by ( a vertical bar on each side of the quantity ) and is defined as the absolute value of is always either positive or zero , but never negative . from an analytic geometry point of view , the absolute value of a real number is that number 's distance from zero along the real number line . the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them . in calculus , the absolute value function is differentiable except at 0. it is everywhere continuous . compare the norm of a vector . the square-root notation without sign represents the `` positive '' square root . so , it follows that
