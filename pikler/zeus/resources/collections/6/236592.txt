Confidence interval     in statistics a confidence interval is a special form of estimating a certain parameter . with this method , a whole interval of acceptable values for the parameter is given instead of a single value , together with a likelihood that the real ( unknown ) value of the parameter will be in the interval . the confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample , and hence differs from sample to sample . the likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called confidence level . very often , this is given as a percentage . the confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level . people may speak about the `` 95 % confidence interval '' . the end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits . for a given estimation procedure in a given situation , the higher the confidence level , the wider the confidence interval will be . the calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process â€“ it is primarily a `` parametric '' method . one common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal . as such , confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics , though changes can be made to add robustness .
