Continuum hypothesis     the continuum hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no set that is both bigger than that of the natural numbers and smaller than that of the real numbers . georg cantor stated this hypothesis in 1877. there are infinitely many natural numbers , the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is infinite . this is also true for the set of real numbers , but there are more real numbers than natural numbers . we say that the natural numbers have infinite cardinality and the real numbers have infinite cardinality , but the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers . this hypothesis is the first problem on the list of 23 problems david hilbert published in 1900. kurt gödel showed in 1939 , that the hypothesis can not be falsified using zermelo–fraenkel set theory . the zermelo–fraenkel set theory is the set theory commonly used in mathematics . paul cohen showed in the 1960s that the zermelo-fraenkel set theory can not be used to prove the continuum hypothesis , either . for this , cohen was awarded the fields medal .
