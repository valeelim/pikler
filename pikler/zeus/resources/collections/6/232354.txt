Numbat     the numbat ( `` myrmecobius fasciatus '' ) is a marsupial from open woodlands in western australia . it is also called the banded anteater , because it eats termites . it is unusual in being one of the few diurnal ( daytime ) marsupials . it has no pouch , but the mother carries round her four young on her stomach . at night , they take shelter in hollow logs . the numbat has a life span of 5-6 years under human care . these solitary , long-tailed termite-eaters are in danger of extinction ; very few remain in the wild . when europeans arrived , the numbat was found across the new south wales and victorian borders west to the indian ocean , and as far north as the southwest corner of the northern territory . it was at home in a wide range of woodland and semiarid habitats . the deliberate release of the european red fox in the 19th century wiped out the entire numbat population in victoria , nsw , south australia and the northern territory , and almost all numbats in western australia , as well . by the late 1970s , the population was well under 1,000 individuals , concentrated in two small areas not far from perth , dryandra , and perup .
