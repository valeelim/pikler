Eocene     the eocene was the second geological epoch in the palaeogene . it began 56 million years ago , and ended 33.9 million years ago . before it was the palaeocene and , after it , the oligocene . the eocene , like the palaeocene before it , had a climate much warmer than today . at the start of the eocene the `` palaeoceneâ€“eocene thermal maximum '' was reached . this lasted for 100,000 years , and caused a large extinction event . at the end of the eocene another extinction event occurred , this time probably caused by meteorite strikes in siberia and chesapeake bay . the land was heavily forested , with temperate forests into the polar regions , and the many herbivorous mammals were browsers , not grazers .
