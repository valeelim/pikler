Meselson–Stahl experiment     the meselson–stahl experiment was an experiment done by matthew meselson and franklin stahl in 1958 , using `` e. coli '' dna . with their experiment , they concluded that dna replication was semiconservative . the dna consists of two helices that are combined . when the two helices are copied , each will have one part coming from the original cell . the other part will be newly made . in chemistry , this is called `` synthesis '' . there are three different way this replication could happen : - `` conservative replication '' : the original dna is kept as it is . two new helices will be synthesized from it . - `` semi-conservative replication '' : half of the dna is kept , the other half is synthesized . - `` disperse replication '' : the mechanism is the same as semi-conservative replication ; but the synthesized links could be added to either the old or new helix . meselson and stahl concluded that dna employs semi-conservative replication . they placed the bacteria in an environment which contained a selected nitrogen isotope . they first used n. the bacteria then integrated this isotope into their dna . later they used an environment that contained n. they then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial dna contained . they found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen , which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion . by having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication . some helix strands were all n. other helix strands from the time in the n environment had n .
