Centromere     the centromere is a special region of a chromosome , usually near the middle . it is where the two identical sister chromatids stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis . the region contains specific types of dna , which are tandem repetitive sequences ( satellite dna ) . these sequences bind specific proteins called `` cen '' -proteins . during mitosis the centromeres can be seen during the `` metaphase '' stage as a constriction at the chromosome . at this centromeric constriction the two halves of the chromosome , the sister chromatids , are held together until late metaphase .
