Staurozoa     the staurozoa are a class in the phylum cnidaria . it includes the stalked jellyfish . it was an order within the class scyphozoa , but recent genetic work has shown it to be a class of its own . this is a small class of about 50 species , mostly inshore and quite small . the recent discovery of some staurozoa near deep sea hydrothermal vents was a surprise , and makes it clear that there is much more to learn about them . the staurozoa are unique in not having an alternation of polyp and medusa life cycle phases . they have an attached `` medusa '' stage , with a life style looking rather like polypoid forms . members of this class are commonly found in relatively cold waters , close to the shoreline . after the larvae crawl across the sea floor and find a suitable place , they attach themselves to rocks or algae .
