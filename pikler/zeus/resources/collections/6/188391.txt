Traffic congestion     traffic congestion is when vehicles travel at slower speeds because there are more vehicles than the road can handle . this makes trip times longer , and increases queueing . this is also known as a traffic jam . congestion may result from a decrease in capacity , for example accidents on the road or roads being closed . bad road layouts can also restrict capacity . increased traffic , for example by many cars leaving a sports stadium at the same time , can also cause congestion . where congestion is common , for example because of commuting in big cities , several methods are used to relieve it . cars may be banned in certain districts or certain times , or made to carry passengers or pay a fee , or people may use public transport , such as rapid transit , which travel independently of car traffic and are not affected by traffic jams .
