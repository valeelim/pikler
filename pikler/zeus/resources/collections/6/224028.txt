Parasitoid     parasitoids are parasites whose larvae develop inside another organism 's body . this usually results in the death of the host , which sets them apart from 'traditional ' parasites . there are twelve superfamilies of parasitic wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid . the largest family are the ichneumons , with over 80,000 species . in parasitoids the adult stage is free-living : it finds the 'host ' for the next generation . their mother places them , as eggs , on or in the body of a 'host ' , which provides food for their growth . normal parasites use vectors as their main means of getting to other hosts . in hymenoptera , there are many variations , and the distinction between the 'parasitic ' and the 'traditional ' hymenoptera can run very thin . in britain there are about 6500 species of hymenoptera more than in any other insect order and just one of the parasitoid superfamilies , ichneumonoidea , contains nearly half of them . most workers now recognise only two families in ichneumonoidea . these are ichneumonidae , with over two thousand british species , and braconidae , with nearly 1200 representatives in britain . they are , respectively , the largest and the second largest families of british insects . only a beetle family , the staphylinidae , is near the thousand mark . ichneumonoids also include the largest parasitoids .
