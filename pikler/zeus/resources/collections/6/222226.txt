Centrosome     in cell biology , the centrosome is an organelle that is the main place where cell microtubules are organized . they occur only in animal cells . also , it regulates the cell division cycle , the stages which lead up to cell division . the centrosome was discovered by edouard van beneden in 1883 , and was described and named in 1888 by theodor boveri . the centrosome has apparently only evolved in metazoan eukaryotic cells . fungi and plants use other structures to organize their microtubules . although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells , it is not necessary . a centrosome is composed of two centrioles at right angles to each another . they are surrounded by a shapeless mass of protein . the centrosome is copied only once per cell cycle so that each daughter cell inherits one centrosome , containing two centrioles . the centrosome replicates during the interphase of the cell cycle . during the prophase of mitosis , the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell . the mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes . upon division , each daughter cell receives one centrosome .
