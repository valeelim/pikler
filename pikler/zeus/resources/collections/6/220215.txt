Comparative anatomy     comparative anatomy is the scientific comparison of animal bodies . the purpose of comparative anatomy is to see their working structure , and to decide upon the phylogenetic relationships between different groups of animals . the separation of animals into phyla is done mainly by comparative anatomy : see list of animal phyla . the main techniques used are dissection and microscopy . dissection is an ancient method used to find out the inside structure of a living thing ( usually done after it is dead ) . it is still used by medical students to learn about the details of the human body . simple microscopes were first invented in the 17th century , and the compound microscope ( still used today ) became available in the 19th century . the purpose of microscopy is to let us see the small details of structure . also , the careful comparison of large collections of animals ( usually in museums ) is often done . the great era of comparative anatomy was from about 1800 to about 1950. it was used by those who did not believe in evolution , such as georges cuvier , and by those who did , such as thomas henry huxley . charles darwin himself used comparative anatomy as the main tool in his work on barnacles . nowadays , the main method used to find out relationships is molecular evolution , which uses dna sequence analysis . however , for many research purposes , zoologists still dissect animals . to get a degree in biology , you need to know about the structure of animals ( and plants ) .
