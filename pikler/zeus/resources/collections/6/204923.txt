Pakicetus     pakicetus is a genus of extinct cetaceans found in the early eocene ( 55.8 ± 0.2 - 33.9 ± 0.1 ma ) of pakistan , hence their name . the strata where the fossils were found was then part of the coast of the tethys sea . the first fossil , a lone skull , was thought to be a mesonychid , but gingerich and russell recognized it as an early cetacean from characteristic features of the inner ear , found only in cetaceans : the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only . this suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans . complete skeletons were discovered in 2001 , revealing that `` pakicetus '' was primarily a land animal , about the size of a wolf , and very similar in form to the related mesonychids .
