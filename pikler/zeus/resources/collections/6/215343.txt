E. B. Ford     edmund brisco ford frs ( 23 april 1901 – 2 january 1988 ) was a british ecological geneticist . he was a leader among those british biologists who investigated the role of natural selection in nature . as a schoolboy ford became interested in lepidoptera , the group of insects which includes butterflies and moths . he went on to study the genetics of natural populations , and invented the field of `` ecological genetics '' . ford was awarded the royal society 's darwin medal in 1954. later , in 1968 , he was awarded unesco 's kalinga prize for the popularisation of science . specialising in genetics , he was appointed oxford university reader in genetics in 1939 and was the director of the genetics laboratory , 1952–1969 , and professor of ecological genetics 1963–1969 . ford was one of the first scientists to be elected a fellow of all souls college since the seventeenth century . ford had a long working relationship with r.a. fisher . by the time ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism , fisher had got accustomed to high selection values in nature . he was most impressed by the fact that polymorphism concealed powerful selective forces ( ford gave human blood types as an example ) . like fisher , he continued the natural selection versus genetic drift debate with sewall wright , whom ford believed put too much emphasis on genetic drift . it was as a result of ford 's work , as well as his own , that dobzhansky changed the emphasis in the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection .
