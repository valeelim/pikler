Goliath     goliath ( ) was a philistine warrior in the old testament . he was the champion of the warriors of town of gath . the name refers to greek name alyattes . goliath was unusually large . his height was said to be `` six cubits and a span '' - some 290 cm - and he fought as armoured charioteer . the bible describes how he challenged the israelite warriors for single-handed duel , but nobody dared to fight with him . david , who was fourteen years old at this time , finally answered to challenge . he was skilled on use of sling , and he found out a way how he could win him . he accurately slung a stone on goliath 's forehead , just below his helmet . the stone knocked goliath out . david then ran to unconscious goliath , pulled his sword off the scabbard , and cut his head off . seeing a fourteen-year-old boy killing their champion , the philistine army demoralized . the dead sea scrolls say goliath 's height was a more credible `` four cubits and a span '' , in modern measurements 202 cm . at the era when man 's average height was some 160 cm , he would still have looked like a giant .
