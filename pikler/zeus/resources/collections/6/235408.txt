Elevated building foundation     elevated building foundation ( ebf ) is a kind of seismic base isolation technology which is made a major part of a building superstructure . it is made to protect the building 's superstructure against damage from the shaking caused by an earthquake . this goal can be met with the right building materials , size , and setup of ebf for the building site and local soil conditions . as a result of multiple wave reflections and diffractions , as well as energy dissipation of the seismic waves as they move up through the ebf , any movement of seismic wave energy into the building superstructure will be decreased , which will lower seismic loads and improve seismic performance of the structure . in other words , the building does not shake as much because it is sitting on the elevated building foundation , and will probably take less damage from the earthquake .
