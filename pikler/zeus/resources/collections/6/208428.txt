General intelligence factor     the general intelligence factor , often shortened to g , is a construct from psychology . it is the common factor in intelligence tests . it is the result of measuring intelligence in different ways . charles spearman , an early statistician and psychologist , found that school children 's grades across unrelated subjects were strongly related to each other . that is to say , children who were good at one area ( such as reading ) were also good in another area ( such as math ) . he then proposed that these relationships reflected the influence of a dominant factor , which he called `` g '' for `` general '' intelligence . he developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors . the first is the factor specific to an individual mental task : the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another . the second is `` g '' , a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks . after 120 years of cognitive testing , `` g '' s central role is still a meaningful measure . other models have also been proposed , and there is significant controversy about `` g '' and its alternatives .
