Secure Digital card     a secure digital card ( sd card ) is a kind of memory card . such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras . as of 2008 , different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made . the card has a rectangular design , but one edge is `` chipped off '' . this means that the cards can not be inserted into the cameras ( or other devices ) the wrong way . there are different kinds of cards : - those labeled `` sd '' , with capacities up to 2 gb - those labeled `` sdhc '' , with capacities between 4gb and 32gb - those labeled `` sdxc '' , with capacities of up to 2 tb ( largest made is currently 512gb or 256 gb for microsd ) . sd and sdhc are not compatible , but devices that accept sdhc also accept sd cards . the interface of sdhc and sdxc cards is the same , but sdxc uses a different file system . some devices ( for example the wii ) that originally shipped only with support for sd can be made to support sdhc with a firmware update . there are also different `` classes '' . these refer to the read and write speeds . currently in use are `` class 2 '' - which means 2 mbytes/second , `` class 4 '' - 4 mb/sec and `` class 6 '' at 6 mb/sec . the problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it , some measure write speeds , others read speeds . there are also differences because some give guarantees , and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions .
