Waltzing Matilda     `` waltzing matilda '' is one of australia 's best known songs . the bush ballad , a country folk song , has been called `` the unofficial national anthem of australia '' . the title , waltzing matilda , is australian slang for walking through the country looking for work , with one 's goods in a `` matilda '' ( bag ) carried over one 's back . the song tells the story of a traveling farm worker making a drink of tea at a bush camp and capturing a sheep to eat . when the sheep 's owner arrives with three policemen to arrest the worker for taking the sheep ( a crime punishable by hanging ) , the worker drowns himself in a small watering hole . the worker 's ghost stays to haunt the site . the words to the song were written in 1895 by a poet and nationalist banjo paterson . it was first printed as sheet music in 1903. there are many stories about the song and how it was written . the song has its own museum , the waltzing matilda centre in winton , queensland . the music , based on a folk song , was written by christina macpherson . paterson wrote the words while staying at the dagworth homestead , farm in queensland . while he was there the owners played him an old celtic folk tune called `` the craigeelee '' . paterson decided that it would be a good tune to write words for and completed during his stay at the farm .
