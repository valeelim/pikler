Opcode     an opcode identifies which basic computer operation in the instruction set is to be performed . it is used when writing machine code . it tells the computer to do something . each machine language instruction typically has both an opcode and operands . the opcode is like a verb in a sentence , and the operands are like the subject in a sentence . operands are typically memory or registry addresses . opcodes are used in machine code for a number of functions , including float addition of registers , two 's compliment addition of registers , shifting register values to memory , or to a hard drive , sopping a program , etc . there are quite literally hundreds of common opcodes employed in modern computers . due to the nature of a computer 's architecture , opcodes take the form of binary numbers . alternatively , opcodes can be represented by hexadecimal digits , ( for example , 10110101 = a5 ) for ease of reading and coding when designing or emulating a machine-code program . these values are then transformed into their binary equivalents to be saved . modern opcodes are at least two hex characters in length which take up 1 byte of storage space .
