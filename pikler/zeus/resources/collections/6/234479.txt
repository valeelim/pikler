Base isolation     base isolation is a collection of a building â€™ s units resting on its foundation to provide separation of the building from shaking ground thus improving seismic performance . base isolation system consists of `` isolation units '' with or without `` isolation components '' , where : 1 . `` isolation units '' are the basic elements of `` base isolation system '' which provide the mentioned separation effect to a building structure . 2 . `` isolation components '' are the connections between `` isolation units '' and other parts of the building having no separation effect of their own . from the very beginning , the theory of base isolation rested on two pillars : `` heavy damping '' and `` frequency separation '' . unfortunately , nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a `` substructure '' and `` superstructure '' , and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good . anyway , to virtually test-drive any design concept of base isolation , some online help is available now .
