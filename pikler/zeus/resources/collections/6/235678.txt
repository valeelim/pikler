Strength training     strength training is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build the `` physical strength '' and `` endurance '' . there are many different methods of strength training , the most common being the weight/gravity training and the training with the help of resistive equipment . when properly performed , strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being , including increased bone , muscle , tendon and ligament strength , improved joint function , reduced potential for injury , increased bone density , a temporary increase in metabolism , improved cardiac function . training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental increases of weight , elastic tension or other resistance , and uses a variety of exercises and types of training equipment to target specific muscle groups . strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity . strength training differs from `` bodybuilding '' , `` weightlifting '' , `` powerlifting '' , and `` strongman '' , which are sports rather than forms of exercise , although training for them totally depends on strength training . many other sports use strength training as a part of their training regimen , notably football , lacrosse , basketball , hockey and track and field .
