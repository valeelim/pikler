Snowball Earth     snowball earth or icehouse earth refers to times when the earth 's surface was nearly or entirely frozen . the occurrence of snowball ( or slushball ) earths is still controversial , but it is now probable that widespread glaciation occurred in periods of the proterozoic . what is still debatable is how widespread those glaciations were . proponents claim the theory explains sedimentary deposits of glacial origin at tropical latitudes and other enigmatic features of the geological record . opponents do not draw the same inferences from the geological evidence , and doubt the geophysical feasibility of an ice or slush-covered ocean . palaeoproterozoic . - huronian glaciation 2,400 2,100 million years ago ( mya ) the snowball earth hypothesis explains glacial deposits in the huronian supergroup of canada . the palaeomagnetic evidence , which suggests ice sheets at low latitudes , is contested . the glacial sediments of the makganyene formation of south africa are slightly younger than the huronian glacial deposits ( ~2.25 billion years old ) and were deposited at tropical latitudes . perhaps the rise of free oxygen that occurred during this part of the paleoproterozoic removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation . as the sun was notably weaker at the time , the earth 's climate may have relied on methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , to maintain surface temperatures above freezing . in the absence of this methane greenhouse , temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred .
