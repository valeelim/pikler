Goomba     goombas are an enemy in the mario series . they are short brown mushroom shaped enemies that are easily killed by jumping on their head . they appear in almost every mario game . goombas first appeared in the video game `` super mario bros. '' , and was the last enemy put into the game . people stated that the koopa troopa was too hard an enemy , so the designers decided to introduce the goomba as a basic enemy . when they decided to do this , however , they had very little space left in the game . they used a single picture twice to make people think the goombas are walking , rotating it back and forth , causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the motion the appearance of a trot . the goomba 's resemblance to the super mushroom forced designers to change what the super mushroom does and what it looks like . they used the goomba 's ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the super mushroom . the goombas are designed after a kind of mushroom called shiitake . early pictures for the `` super mario bros. '' film showed that the design of the goombas were originally intended to be for koopa troopas , another kind of `` mario '' enemy . a separate company from the primary makeup departments designed the goombas in the film .
