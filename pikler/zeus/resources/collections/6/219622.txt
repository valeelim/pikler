Cryogenian     the cryogenian is a geological period , from ~720 million years ago ( mya ) to 635 mya . it lies in the middle proterozoic eon before the ediacaran period . the period is important to both earth science and biology because it contains the two longest and most severe ice ages of all time : - the sturtian ice age 717 mya to 660 mya - the marinoan ice age 650 mya to 635 mya these two snowball earth events were previously put together as the `` varangian '' glaciation . they covered much , possible all , the earth with ice . the root cause of the temperature drop may have been the removal of co from the atmosphere by photosynthesising bacteria and eukaryotes in the previous periods . much else happened : the supercontinent rodinia broke up and another , pannotia , began to form . fossil steroids suggest the presence of early sponges , and amoeboid cells with tests ( coverings ) appear in the fossil record .
