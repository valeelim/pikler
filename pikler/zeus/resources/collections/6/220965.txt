Red-tailed hawk     the red-tailed hawk ( `` buteo jamaicensis '' ) is sometimes called a chickenhawk , even though it does not normally eat chickens . it is a bird of prey . it breeds throughout most of north america , from western alaska and northern canada and as far south as panama and the west indies . it weighs from to and its wingspan goes from to . the red-tailed hawk is a carnivore and eats shrews and mice . they have keen eyesight to see even the smallest mouse scamper across a field . it can swoop down at least 80mph per hour . it will pick up its prey , dig its talons into its body and kill it and eat . it can swoop down so fast that it can pick up its prey in less than 5 seconds . because they are so common and easily trained , most hawks got for falconry in the united states are red-tails . falconers may take only 'passage hawks ' ( which have left the nest , are on their own , but are less than a year old ) . this is so not to affect the breeding population . adults , which may be breeding or rearing chicks , may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so .
