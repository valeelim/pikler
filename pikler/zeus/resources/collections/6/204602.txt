Andrewsarchus     andrewsarchus mongoliensis ( andrews + greek ἀρχός , `` ruler '' ) , was a mammalian mesonychid predator . this large heavily-built , wolf-like , mammal lived during the eocene , about 45 to 36 million years ago . it walked on four short legs and had a long body , a long tail , and feet with hoofed toes . it had a long snout with large , sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones . because `` andrewsarchus '' is only known from a skull and a few other bones , whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate , as is its exact time range .
