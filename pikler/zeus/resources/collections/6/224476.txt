Flag of Colorado     the flag of the state of colorado has three horizontal stripes of the same width ; the top and bottom stripes are blue , and the middle stripe white . on top of these stripes sits a circular red `` c '' , filled with a golden disk . the blue is meant to represent the skies , the gold stands for the sunshine enjoyed by the state , the white represents the snowcapped mountains and the red represents the earth . the flag was thought up by andrew carlisle johnson in 1911 and adopted by the state 's general assembly on june 5 of the same year . however , the legislature did not specify the size of the `` c '' or the exact shade of blue or red . because of this , some flags were in slightly different colors and had the `` c '' wholly within the center stripe . on february 28 , 1929 , the general assembly added to the statement that the flag would be the same color blue and red as the flag of the united states . on march 31 , 1964 , the legislature further dictated the diameter of the gold disc to be equal to the center stripe .
