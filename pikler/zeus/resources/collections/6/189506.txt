Historical geology     historical geology uses the principles and techniques of geology to work out the geological history of the earth . it looks at the processes which change the earth 's surface and rocks under the surface . geologists use stratigraphy and paleontology to find out the sequence of the events , and show the plants and animals which lived at different times in the past . they worked out the sequence of rock layers . then the discovery of radioactivity and the invention of radiometric dating techniques gave a way to get the ages of the layers ( strata ) . we now know the timing of important events that have happened during the history of earth . the earth is about 4.567 billion ( 4,567 million ) years old . the geological or `` deep time '' of earth 's past has been organized into various units . boundaries on the time scale are usually marked by major geological or palaeontological events , such as mass extinctions . for example , the boundary between the cretaceous period and the palaeogene period is defined by the cretaceousâ€“tertiary extinction event . this marked the end of the dinosaurs and of many marine species .
