Prosauropod     prosauropods were a group of early herbivorous dinosaurs that lived during the later triassic and early jurassic periods . they were the largest herbivores in their environment , and quickly reached ( 6 to 10 meters long ) . all prosauropods had a long neck and small head , forelimbs shorter than the hindlimbs , and a very large thumb claw for defense . they were originally thought to be the ancestors of the sauropods , but are now considered by some as a parallel lineage . prosuropoda was named by huene and defined by sereno as all animals more closely related to `` plateosaurus engelhardti '' than to `` saltasaurus loricatus '' . recent cladistic analyses suggest that the clade prosauropoda is a synonym of plateosauridae . both contain the same taxa . the issue is still active , and debated .
