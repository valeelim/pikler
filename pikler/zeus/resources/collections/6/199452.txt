Ordnance Survey National Grid     the ordnance survey national grid is a system used to map great britain . it is different from using latitude and longitude . the ordnance survey ( os ) created the system . it is used a lot in their survey data . it is also used in maps based on those surveys . the system divides the map into squares . each square is labelled with two letters . the first letter refers to squares that are 500 km by 500 km . those squares are outlined in dark grey on the map to the right . only four of these have very much land area in great britain : s , t , n and h. the o square has a tiny area of north yorkshire . most of that tiny area is usually underwater at high tide . for the second letter , each 500 km square is divided into 25 squares that are 100 km by 100 km . each of those has a letter code from a to z . ( the letter `` i '' is not used . ) the letters start with a in the northwest corner and go to z in the southeast corner . these squares are outlined in light grey on the map . the ones that have land have letters shown .
