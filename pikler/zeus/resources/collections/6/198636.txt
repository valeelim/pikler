Federation of Australia     the federation of australia was the way that the six separate british colonies of new south wales , queensland , south australia , tasmania , victoria and western australia joined together to become one country . when the constitution of australia came into force , on 1 january 1901 , the colonies became states of the commonwealth of australia . people had been trying to get the colonies to join together in a federation of australia during the 1850s and 1860s . in the 1890s , a number of big meetings , called conventions , were held to write a constitution for australia . sir henry parkes , premier of new south wales , was the main person supporting this idea . fiji and new zealand were going to be part of the federation but decided not to join the federation . as soon as the federation happened , sir edmund barton was put in charge as prime minister of australia until the first australian elections were held . barton won the election and continued to be the prime minister .
