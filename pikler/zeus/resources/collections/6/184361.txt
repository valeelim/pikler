Integrated Services Digital Network     integrated services digital network is an international standard for a communication network . it is often shortened to isdn . it is used for telephone lines . before isdn , telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls , so the main idea was to use circuit switching . when a phone call is made , a line is set up between the two participants . this phone call is analogue . with isdn , this view changes . as the signal is now digital isdn can be used to offer a number of services , which use the telephone line to transport data . there were different services , like telex or teleprinters before isdn , but they used their own networks . at specific locations , there were gateways between these networks . with isdn , this changes . there is only one network , and it offers different services . some of them are for voice , to make phone calls , others are for data , for example to send telefaxes . isdn offers a number of data channels , and a signalling channel . the data channels carry the actual service data . the two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently . the usual setup has two such data channels . that way , it is possible to send a fax through one channel , while doing a phone call over the other channel , for example . if the main focus is on a high quality voice connection , the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically .
