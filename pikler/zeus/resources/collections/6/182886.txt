Vailala Madness     the vailala madness was a religious movement . it was active between 1919 and 1922. many people think it was one the first cargo cults , even though that term was first used in the 1940s . the vailala madness was active in the papuan gulf , which was a territory of australia at the time , but now belongs to papua new guinea . the vailala madness got its name from the behaviour of people who took part in it . this behaviour included glossolalia ( or `` speaking in tongues '' ) , shaking , and signs of mental or emotional disturbances . in the indigenous language , people who were taking part in the vailala madness called it `` iki haveve '' , or `` belly-do n't know , '' which was another way of saying `` dizziness . '' the people in the movement thought that a 'ghost steamer ' would come . this ship would be piloted by dead people who were coming back . the dead people would bring with them cargo with tinned food and tools . in one version of the story , the dead people would bring guns to kick the white colonizers out , but not everybody agrees that this was what people in the vailala madness actually believed .
