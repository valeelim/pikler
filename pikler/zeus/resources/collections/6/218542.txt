Lower Cretaceous     the lower cretaceous is the first geological epoch in the cretaceous . it began 145 million years ago , and ended 100.5 million years ago . lasting for about 46 million years , this is the longest stage in the phanerozoic eon . it is longer than some of the geological periods in the phanerozoic . the lower cretaceous is best displayed in england , where it is composed of two series of rocks . between the two is a major rise in sea level . - lower , the `` wealden beds '' , laid down in freshwater or brackish conditions . sands came from the flood plain of a huge tropical braided river . clays came from a coastal lagoonal plain . - upper , the `` greensands '' , an olive-green sandstone deposited in the sea ; and the `` gault clay '' , a formation of stiff blue clay deposited in a calm , fairly deep water marine environment . it overlays the lower greensand formation . the two parts of the cretaceous represent the sea level where the divisions were first defined . in the lower cretaceous , the sea level was much lower than in the upper cretaceous . in the wealden , southern england was a huge tropical river delta ; in the greensand the same areas were just offshore . however , in the upper cretaceous the deposits were made in deeper water , on what was then the continental shelf . sea level then stood at its highest level in the mesozoic .
