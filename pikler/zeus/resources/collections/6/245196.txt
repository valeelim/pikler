Ganglion     in anatomy , a ganglion ( plural ganglia ) is a mass of tissue in the nervous system . it is a group of nerve cells which act as a junction between different parts of the nervous system . with invertebrates , ganglia often do the work of a brain . in these cases , like the earthworm , there is a ganglion above the gut at the front . this is linked to another under the gut by nerve fibres running down each side of the gut . the rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut . this type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate phyla , and contrasts with the vertebrates , who have their spinal cord above ( dorsal to ) their gut . in another usage , ganglion cells are found in the retina of the vertebrate eye .
