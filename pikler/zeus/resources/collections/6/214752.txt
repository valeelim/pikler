Morphogenesis     morphogenesis ( meaning the `` beginning of shape '' ) , is the biological process that causes an organism to develop its shape . it is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of cell growth and cellular differentiation . the process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the embryonic development of an organism . morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by hormones , by substances produced by other organisms , or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells . morphogenesis can take place in an embyro , a mature organism , in cell culture or inside tumor cell masses .
