Suppressor     a suppressor , often called a `` silencer '' is a device used to make a gun less loud . suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel , usually by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel . some guns have a built-in suppressor . even though many people use the name `` silencer '' when talking about a suppressor , it does not really make the gun silent . how much quieter it makes the gun depends both on the cartridges and the suppressor . a suppressed gun usually is between 120 to 135 decibels ( db ) . this is much quieter than without the suppressor , but is still loud enough to cause hearing loss without protection such as earplugs . an unsuppressed firearm usually produces 140 to 165 db . for comparison , a typical jackhammer produces about 130 db . in many places , suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police . this is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime . in most states in the united states , suppressors are legal for civilians to own , but the national firearms act requires that buyers must go through a special background check and pay a $ 200 tax . owning an untaxed suppressor is illegal , except for licensed class 3 firearms dealers , the military , and law enforcement .
