Free fall     free fall is what happens when an object is let to fall on its own without propulsion or resistance . someone who is standing is not in free fall , but someone jumping from an airplane is , until air resistance builds up , ending in terminal velocity . an artillery shell is in free fall from the time it is fired until it hits something . even the time when it is going up is free fall . spacecraft are in free fall when their engine is not on and they are not sitting somewhere , which means most of the time . in most mathematical calculations the acceleration due to gravity ( g ) is 9.81 newton ( unit ) per kilogram .
