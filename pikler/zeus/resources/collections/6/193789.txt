Vasopressin     vasopressin ( adh , avp ) is the hormone which controls the production of urine in the bladder . it is secreted by the pituitary gland based on the salt concentration of the blood . it is negative feedback : the more concentrated the salt in the blood is , the more vasopressin is secreted , which in turn makes the kidney tubules more permeable , allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood and creating less , but more concentrated , urine . it also triggers feelings of thirst .
