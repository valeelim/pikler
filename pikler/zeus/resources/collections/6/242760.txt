Derivative (mathematics)    derivative ( mathematics ) in mathematics , the derivative is a way to represent rate of change , that is - the amount by which a function is changing at one given point . for functions that act on the real numbers , it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph . the derivative is often written using `` dy over dx '' ( meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x. the `` d '' 's are not variable , and therefore can not be cancelled out . the derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x , as the distance between formula_2 and formula_3 becomes infinitely small ( infinitesimal ) . in mathematical terms , that is , as the distance between the two x points ( h ) becomes closer to zero , the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line . derivatives of linear functions ( functions of the form `` a '' `` x '' + `` b '' with no quadratic or higher terms ) are constant . that is , the derivative in one spot on the graph will remain the same on another .
