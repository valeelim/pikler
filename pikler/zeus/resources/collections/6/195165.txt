Sic     sic is a latin word meaning `` thus '' , `` so '' , `` as such '' , or `` in such a manner '' . in writing , it is put in square brackets and italic type – [ `` sic '' ] – to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling , phrases , punctuation , or other quoted material have been copied ( word for word ) from its original source . at first , it was said like the english word `` seek '' ( ipa /'sik/ ) ; however , it is normally said like the english word `` sick '' ( /'sɪk/ ) . the word `` sic '' may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully : for instance , quoting the u.s. constitution : it is often used , though , to highlight an error , sometimes to ridicule , such as here in `` the times '' : sometimes , `` sic '' is said to be an abbreviation for `` said in context '' , `` spelled in context '' , `` said in copy '' , and other phrases . while incorrect , this still gives the same meaning when used .
