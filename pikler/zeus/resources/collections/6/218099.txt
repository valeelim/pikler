Cainozoic     the cainozoic ( cenozoic ) is the current geological era . it began 66 million years ago and continues today . before it was the mesozoic . during the cainozoic the continents moved into their present positions . the climate started warm , but cooling continued steadily . finally ice ages occurred . the word cainozoic is derived from greek `` kainos '' = `` new '' , and `` zoe '' = `` life '' . 'cainozoic ' may be spelled 'cenozoic ' . it has three periods , and the periods are split into stages . - cainozoic - palaeogene - palaeocene - eocene - oligocene - neogene - miocene - pliocene - quaternary - pleistocene - holocene previously , what is now the cainozoic was divided into two periods , the tertiary and the quaternary . the tertiary corresponded to the palaeogene+neogene . now , the term 'tertiary ' is not used . officially , it is 'deprecated ' . on land , the cainozoic is the era of mammals , and of birds and flowering plants . grassland became a major habitat . aquatic mammals took over the roles of predatory reptiles like the mosasaurs and plesiosaurs . as a result , the ecological landscape of the cainozoic has become quite different from the mesozoic .
