Intercropping     intercropping is growing two or more crops next to each other at the same time . the main purpose of intercropping is to produce more crops in a given area . it also makes use of resources ( nutrients ) that would otherwise not be used by a single crop . crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different . this way , the crops can give the same returns but require less space . things to consider when choosing which crops to mix include the soil , climate and varieties . it is very important not to have crops competing with each other for space , nutrients , water , or sunlight . an example of an intercropping strategy is planting one crop that has deep roots with another that has shallow roots . intercropping has been proposed as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming , which is very bad for the environment . conserving soil intercropping also helps to conserve soil . when one crop is harvested and it starts raining the second crop grown in that farm will not let to erode the soil easily by water . hence the soil is conserved .
