Homo rhodesiensis     homo rhodesiensis is a hominin species described from a single fossil skull . it was found in the colony of northern rhodesia , ( now zambia ) at a mine called broken hill ( now kabwe ) in 1921. the skull lacks the lower jaw , but otherwise is almost complete . in addition to the cranium , an upper jaw from another individual , a sacrum ( bone of the pelvis ) , a tibia , and two femur fragments were also found . rhodesian man is dated to be between 125,000 and 300,000 years old . cranial capacity of the broken hill skull has been estimated at 1,100 cmÂ³ . bada & al ( 1974 ) published a direct date of 110 ka for this specimen . the brain size is rather small for such a late date . the destruction of the paleoanthropological site has made layered dating impossible . the skull is from an extremely robust ( = strong ) individual , and has the comparatively largest brow-ridges of any known hominid remains . it was described as having a broad face similar to `` homo neanderthalensis '' ( i.e . large nose and thick protruding brow ridges ) , and has been interpreted as an `` african neanderthal '' . there are several features intermediate between modern `` homo sapiens '' and neanderthals . most current experts believe rhodesian man to be within the group of `` homo heidelbergensis '' . other names , such as archaic `` homo sapiens '' and `` homo sapiens rhodesiensis '' , have also been suggested .
