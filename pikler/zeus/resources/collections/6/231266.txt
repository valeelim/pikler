Molecular evolution     molecular evolution is the process of evolution in dna , rna , and proteins . molecular evolution emerged as a scientific field in the 1960s as researchers from molecular biology , evolutionary biology and population genetics sought to understand the structure and function of nucleic acids and protein . some of the key topics have been the evolution of enzyme function , the use of nucleic acid changes as a molecular clock to study species divergence , and the origin of non-functional or junk dna . recent advances in genomics , including whole-genome sequencing , and bioinformatics have led to a dramatic increase in studies on the topic . in the 2000s , the role of gene duplication , the extent of adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral genetic drift , and the identification of molecular changes responsible for various human characteristics especially those pertaining to infection , disease , and cognition . molecular systematics is the process of using data on the dna , rna , or proteins to resolve questions in phylogeny and taxonomy . the idea is to place groups in their correct position on the evolutionary tree . this corrects their biological classification from the point of view of evolution . the technique has already led to major changes in the taxonomy of living things , including the names for higher categories , which had been stable for well over a century .
