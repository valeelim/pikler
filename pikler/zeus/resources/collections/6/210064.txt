Rotifer     the rotifers are a phylum of tiny animals which are common in freshwater environments , such as ponds and puddles . some rotifers are free swimming , others move by inching along , and some are fixed . a few species live in colonies . rotifers were first described when early microscopes became available , around 1700. they are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton . also , many species help decompose organic matter in soil . rotifers eat fish waste , dead bacteria , and algae . they eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size . a rotifer filters 100,000 times its own volume of water per hour . they are used in fish tanks to help clean the water , to prevent clouds of waste matter . about 2200 species of rotifers have been described . they are placed in the phylum rotifera . this phylum is subdivided into three classes , `` monogononta '' , `` bdelloidea '' , and `` seisonidea '' . the largest group is the monogononta , with about 1500 species , followed by the bdelloidea , with about 350 species . there are only two known species of seisonidea .
