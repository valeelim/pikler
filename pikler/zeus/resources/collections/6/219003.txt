Canonic Variations on &quot;Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her&quot;    canonic variations on & quot ; vom himmel hoch da komm ' ich her & quot ; the canonic variations on `` vom himmel hoch da komm ' ich her '' ( `` from heaven above to earth i come '' ) , bwv 769 is a well-known piece of music for organ by johann sebastian bach . an organ with two manuals ( keyboards ) and pedals is needed to play this work . there are five “ variations ” . all the music is based on a christmas hymn called “ von himmel hoch ” which was very well known to the people who went to the lutheran church where bach was organist . bach composed the piece when he became a member of mizler 's music society in leipzig in 1747. it was printed in 1747. another version was published later . this was an autograph manuscript which also included other organ music : the six trio sonatas and the great eighteen chorale preludes . the most important difference bach made in this version is that the fifth variation was moved to the middle . in june 1747 , bach was allowed to become a member of the `` correspondierde societät der muscialischen wissenschaften '' ( `` corresponding society for the musical sciences '' ) . there were 14 members when bach joined . the society studied and encouraged people in leipzig to compose music . to celebrate becoming a member , bach gave to the society a version of the canonic variations and also a portrait of himself that had been painted by elias gottlob haussmann . in the portrait bach is seen holding up a copy of another composition which uses a lot of canon .
