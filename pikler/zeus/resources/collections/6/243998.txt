Gastrotrich     the gastrotricha , often called `` hairy backs '' , are a phylum of microscopic ( 0.06-3.0 mm ) animals abundant in fresh water and marine environments . marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles , while terrestrial species live in the water films round grains of soil . adults have a fixed cell number . about 700 species have been described . gastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric , with a transparent body and a flat underside . many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end . the body is covered with cilia , especially about the mouth and on the lower surface . its two end projections have cement glands . this is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive . like many microscopic animals , their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics . gastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells ; further growth comes only from an increase in cell size . as is typical for such small animals , there are no respiratory or circulatory organs . nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall , as part of respiration . the nervous system is relatively simple . the brain consists of two ganglia , one on either side of the pharynx . each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord , which runs the length of the body and includes further , smaller ganglia . the main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface . some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli ( eye spots ) .
