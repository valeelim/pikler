Child abandonment     child abandonment is when a parent leaves their child . there are many causes of child abandonment , including poverty or mental illness . in many countries , if a children are abandoned , they become orphans and live in an orphanage . they are raised there until they reach 18. in the united states , `` safe haven laws '' allow parents to leave their infants at certain safe places . the goal of these laws is to keep parents from leaving their infants in unsafe places , or killing them . in some states , leaving a baby at a safe haven is thought of as child abandonment , and a complaint may be filed in family court . but as long as the baby has not been hurt , the parents can not be charged with a crime for leaving their baby at a safe haven . the baby is given to state child protection workers , who find a safe place for the baby and try to get him or her adopted . hospitals , fire stations , and police stations are common safe havens . abandonment ( or exposure ) was a widely used method of getting rid of babies that parents did not want . babies would be left outside , often in a pot or a vase , to die . it was practiced in ancient times , especially in athens . the babies at the most risk were girls ; babies with physical disabilities ; ugly babies ; children born to poor families ; and babies who looked unwell . women had no say in whether their babies were left to die . the fathers were the only ones who had a say .
