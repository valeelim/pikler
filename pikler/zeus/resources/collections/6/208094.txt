Princely state     a princely state ( also called a native state or indian state ) was a state within the former british indian empire where a native indian prince held rule on behalf of the british rather than them holding direct control over the state . in reality the british still controlled the state as they had control over the local ruler . such states could not have relations with other states without british approval . the rulers of these states held various titles : e.g . raja ( a hindu ruling prince ) ; maharaja ( a greater hindu ruling prince ) ; nawab ( a muslim ruling prince such as the nawab of bhopal ) ; nizam , the title of the nizam of hyderabad . only 21 of the 565 princely states existing in 1947 had state governments of their own , and only four were large states ( hyderabad ( princely state ) , mysore , kashmir and jammu , and baroda ) . of these three became part of the dominion of india while the status of jammu and kashmir was disputed .
