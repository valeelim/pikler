Narwhal     all narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw . after the first year of a male narwhal 's life , its left tooth grows outward , spirally . there are some narwhals that are double-tusked , but they are not as common . this long , single or double tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be 8.75 feet ( 2.7 meters ) long . tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and are hollow inside . the tusk 's function is uncertain , perhaps used as a formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry , in getting food , and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses ( which they emit ) . the tusk is not used in hunting . long ago , narwhal sightings probably reinforced ( or started ) the unicorn legends . in fact , when people found the horn of a dead narwhal washed up on shore , they thought that they had found the horn of a unicorn . narwhal can dive deep into the sea to around 800 meters , but can also sometimes dive up to 1,500 meters . this makes them one of the deepest diving sea mammals .
