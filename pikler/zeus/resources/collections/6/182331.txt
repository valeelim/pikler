Distribution (mathematics)    distribution ( mathematics ) in mathematics , a distribution is a generalisation of a function . distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by laurent schwartz , who received a fields medal for his work on them . the fields medal is comparable to a nobel prize in mathematics , which does not exist . distributions were introduced to model certain concepts from physics . physics has the concept of a `` mass of points in space '' . the dirac delta function can model an electromagnetic charge of a point in space . the dirac delta function is zero everywhere , except at one point , where it is infinitely large . this needs to be the case , because the density function needs to be 1. there is no function that can meet this criterion , except if integraton is taken as a `` function '' in the mathematical sense . today , distributions are used in different fields of mathematics and physics , for example to model partial differential equations or fourier analyses , which are important for quantum electrodynamics or signal processing .
