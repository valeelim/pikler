Quadrature mirror filter     the quadrature mirror filters ( qmf ) are two filters with frequency characteristics symmetric about formula_1 of sampling frequency ( i.e . formula_2 ) . they are used especially in process of orthogonal discrete wavelet transform design . in notation of z-transform , we can create the quadrature mirror filter formula_3 to ( original ) filter formula_4 by substitution formula_5 with formula_6 in the transfer function of formula_4 . by doing it , the transfer characteristic of formula_3 is shifted to formula_4 by formula_11 . impulse characteristic is therefore according to the picture above , the signal split and passed into these filters can be downsampled by a factor of two . nevertheless , original signal can be still reconstructed by using reconstruction filters formula_16 and formula_17 . reconstruction filters are given by time reversal analysis filters . for orthogonal discrete wavelet transform formula_3 is given by impulse characteristic is reconstruction filters are still given by same equations .
