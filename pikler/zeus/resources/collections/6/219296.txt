Amphicoelias     amphicoelias was a genus of sauropod dinosaur , which may have included the largest dinosaur ever discovered ( `` a. fragillimus '' ) . if it truly existed , `` a. fragillimus '' would be the longest vertebrate by a considerable margin , and it would have a mass that rivals the heaviest animal known , the blue whale . however , because the only fossil evidence for its existence was lost shortly after being discovered in the 1870s , evidence survives only in drawings , and doubt has been expressed about their accuracy . the fossil was found in the morrison formation .
