Endoplasmic reticulum     endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is a cellular organelle . it is the transport network for molecules going to specific places , as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm . the endoplasmic reticulum is in cells that have a nucleus : in eukaryote cells but not in prokaryote cells . it takes these forms : - rough endoplasmic reticulum ( rer ) , so called because it is studded with ribosomes , and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm . - smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( ser ) . among its functions is the production of proteins and steroids , the maintenance of plasma membranes , and a pathway for molecules to move along . similar to the er is the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( sr ) found only in muscle cells . the sr stores and pumps calcium ions . the sr contains large stores of calcium , which it releases when the muscle cell is stimulated . another type of cytoplasmic network is the plate-like golgi apparatus . the lacey membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by scientists using an electron microscope .
