Mycorrhiza     a mycorrhiza ( greek for `` fungus roots '' ) is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant . in a mycorrhiza , the fungus lives inside the plant roots , and in the earth . the fungal hyphae are more efficient than plant roots at absorbing nutrients . mycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many ecosystems . at least 80 % of all land plant species ( and over 90 % of families ) have mycorrhiza . they depend on it for survival . they are the most common symbionts in the plant kingdom : they involve about 6000 species of fungi and 240,000 species of plants . mycorrhizas are divided onto two main types : ectomycorrhiza and endomycorrhiza . the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root , while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane . the mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient , dating to at least 400 million years ago . this mutualism gives the fungus sugars , such as glucose and sucrose produced by the plant in photosynthesis .
