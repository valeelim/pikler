2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations     the second rugby league tri-nations tournament ( known as the gillette tri-nations due to sponsorship ) was played between 16 october and 27 november of 2004. the format of the competition was different from the previous event . in that event the teams played each other twice instead of once before the final . the tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair . the british team was considered a small favourite after finishing at the top of the league table . instead , it was a one-sided match as australia produced their best performance of the tournament . the game was basically over by half-time when australia led by 38-0. during the series , australia and new zealand played additional tests against france . a one off match was also played between an anzac side made up of touring australian and new zealand players and a cumbira side . other websites . - 2004 tri-nations , information
