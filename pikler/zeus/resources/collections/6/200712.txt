False analogy     a false analogy is an informal fallacy . it applies to inductive arguments . it is an `` informal '' fallacy because the error is about what the argument is about , and not the argument itself . an analogy proposes that two concepts which are similar ( a and b ) have a common relationship to some property . a has property x , therefore b must also have property x. in a false analogy , the objects may have some similarities , but they do not both have property x. that way , both objects may have the same color , but this does not mean that they have the same size . even if bananas and the sun appear yellow , one could not conclude that they are the same size . one who makes an invalid analogy or comparison is often said to be `` comparing apples and oranges '' . the following are examples of false analogies : - `` love is like a spring shower . it brings refreshment to a person 's body . '' ( does it also sometimes lead to thunderstorms and being hit by lightning ? ) - `` children are like dogs . they need to be strongly disciplined and housebroken . '' ( should they also eat from a bowl on the floor and see a vet regularly ? )
