List of animal phyla     list of animal phyla is a list of the major groups of animals usually classified as a phylum . modern sources have been used : the list is different from that of linnaeus or cuvier . a list of this type may be arranged alphabetically ; but equally it might be arranged according to evolutionary relationships . no list will be completely satisfactory . authorities differ in what they consider a phylum , and in the actual name of the phylum . despite this , there is agreement on most phyla . most modern surveys include groups above the phylum : superphyletic groupings based on evidence of common descent . differences of opinion about evolutionary relationships have been reduced by the use of molecular evolution and molecular clock research . these make use of protein amino acid sequences , and whole genome dna sequence analysis . these modern techniques have led to changes and renaming of many higher categories . classification based on traditional comparative anatomy had errors which needed to be corrected . so , for example , the old phylum coelenterata , which had stood for almost two hundred years , was split down into two separate phyla , the cnidaria and the ctenophora .
