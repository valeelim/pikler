Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees     the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees is an international agreement that defines who is a refugee . it lists the rights of people who are granted asylum ( allowed to live in another country because it is not safe to live in their home country ) . it also lists the responsibilities of countries that give asylum to refugees . the convention also says which people are `` not '' seen as refugees , like war criminals . the convention was approved at a special united nations conference on 28 july 1951. at first , it only talked about protecting european refugees after world war ii . there were limits on how long the convention would last , and who it protected . but in 1967 , a `` protocol '' ( change ) to the convention took away these limits . this protocol made the convention apply to all refugees . because the convention was approved in geneva , it is often called `` the geneva convention . '' but it is not one of the more well-known geneva conventions that talk about what kind of behavior is allowed during wars .
