Cornish nationalism     the cornish self-government movement ( sometimes referred to as cornish nationalism ) is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for the distinctive area of cornwall . the movement 's advocates argue that cornwall is not merely a county of england ( which is its current administrative status ) but a duchy and a distinctive british nation which has never been formally incorporated into england via an act of union of 1707. supporters of cornish self-government who assert that cornwall is , or ought to be , a separate legal entity from england do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the united kingdom , but rather seek official recognition for cornwall as one of the constituent countries or home nations of the uk . some supporters of cornish self-government question the legitimacy of english rule in cornwall , due to the failure of the former parliament of england to ever pass an act of union , although their claims are not generally recognised within the united kingdom ( or sometimes within cornwall itself ) . however , many see some degree of autonomy as a stepping stone towards this , and are supportive of the cornish assembly campaign . the cornish national party ( cnp ) is a social democratic political party in cornwall to which some cornish nationalists belong . it wants cornish independence from the united kingdom .
