Symmetry (biology)    symmetry ( biology ) symmetry in biology is about the overall shape of the body and its parts . the body plans of most multicellular organisms have some form of symmetry , radial symmetry , bilateral symmetry or spherical symmetry . a few have no symmetry , and are asymmetric . in nature and biology , symmetry is approximate . for example , plant leaves , which are more or less symmetrical , will rarely match up exactly when folded in half . there are three basic forms : - radial symmetry : the organism looks like a pie . this pie can be cut up into roughly identical pieces . - bilateral symmetry : there is an axis ; on both sides of the axis the organism looks roughly the same - spherical symmetry : if the organism is cut through its center , the resulting parts look the same . in nature and biology , symmetry is approximate . for example , plant leaves , while considered symmetric , will rarely match up exactly when folded in half . when symmetry is not complete or not present at all . other websites . - evolutionary theories of asymmetrization of organisms , brain and body s. geodakyan .
