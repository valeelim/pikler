Glass lizard     glass lizards , or glass snakes , are a genus of reptiles that look like snakes . although most species have no legs , their head shapes , movable eyelids , and external ear openings show they are lizards . a few species have very small , stub-like legs near their rear vent ( cloaca ) . these are vestigial organs . most described species are native to asia , a few occur in north america , and at least one can be found in north africa . like many lizards , they have the ability to drop off part of the tail when attacked . it can break into several pieces , like glass . the tail stays mobile , distracting the predator , while the lizard keeps still .
