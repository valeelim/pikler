Cha-cha-cha     cha-cha-cha is the name of a latin american music and dance , of cuban origin . it is dance music introduced by cuban composer and violinist enrique jorrín in 1953. the rhythm was developed from a previous dance , the danzón , by a split fourth beat . the name is derived from the shuffling of the dancers ' feet . many consider the `` orquesta aragón '' and the orchestra of josé fajardo to have been particularly influential in the development of the cha-cha-cha . outside cuba , the big bands of tito puente ( in new york ) , and pérez prado ( in mexico city and california ) introduced the cha-cha-cha to a much wider audience . musically , the cha-cha-cha was perhaps not a great innovation . however , it became hugely popular because people found it easy to dance to . monsieur pierre and his colleagues went to cuba in the early 1950s to study it . they came back to london and codified the dance ( sorted it out and wrote it down ) . it became a standard dance in latin american ballroom dancing . it is one of the five latin dances in international competitions governed by the world dance council . today it is still popular as a dance , and is still danced in cuba .
