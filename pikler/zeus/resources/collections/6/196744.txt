In Your House     in your house was a pay-per-view ( ppv ) series made by the world wrestling federation ( wwf ) . the original idea was in months where the wwf was not producing a major ppv event ( wrestlemania , king of the ring , summerslam , survivor series , and royal rumble which ran for three hours ) they would produce a two hour ppv event for a lower price of $ 19.95 . when world championship wrestling ( wcw ) started producing three hour ppv 's on a monthly basis , the wwf was forced to drop the concept . the events were numbered numerically ( example : in your house # 1 , # 2 ) until in your house # 7 where specific subtitles were added which usually referred to the main event , starting with in your house # 7 : good friends , better enemies ( refers to the shawn michaels vs. diesel match ) . gradually the subtitles became `` in your house '' ( example : unforgiven : in your house ) . current ppv 's no way out , backlash , judgment day and unforgiven all came from the in your house series . related pages . - list of wwe pay-per-view events
