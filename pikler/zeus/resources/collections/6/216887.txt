'pan ' in pansori means 'a place where many people gather ' , and 'sori ' means 'sound ' . pansori represents voluntariness and impromptu which are the characteristics of korean traditional music . for example , before heung-rok song period it had been orally narrated without any exact scripts by extemporarily inserting songs handed down orally and witty remarks into the stories taught by a master . pansori is a professional art which requires sorikkun to have a high level of singing skill . also , it is a performing art because one singer takes roles of various characters in a story . music , literature , and play are the key elements that coexist in pansori . it was established as an independent performing art by associating with many adjacent genres of korean traditional music such as minyo , mooga ( songs that shamans sing in a performance of exorcism ) , sijo , japga ( a folk music sung by common people during the latter part of joseon dynasty ) , and gasa . it is also the only genre that started with popular arts and led to ethnic arts in korea .
