Mantle (mollusc)    mantle ( mollusc ) the mantle is a significant part of the anatomy of molluscs : it is the dorsal body wall which covers the organs of digestion , reproduction and movement . in many , but not all , species of molluscs , the epidermis ( skin ) of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and conchiolin , and creates a shell . the word `` mantle '' means cloak or cape , and does often resemble a cloak . the edges of the mantle may extend far beyond the main part of the body , forming flaps , double-layered structures adapted for many different uses , including for example , the `` siphon '' . the `` mantle cavity '' is a central feature of molluscan biology . this cavity is formed by the mantle skirt , a double fold of mantle which encloses a water space . this space contains the mollusc 's gills , anus , and organs for taste , excretion and reproductive organs . the mantle cavity functions as a respiratory chamber in all molluscs . in bivalves it is usually part of the feeding structure . in some mollusks the mantle cavity is a brood chamber , and in cephalopods and some bivalves such as scallops , it is a locomotory organ .
