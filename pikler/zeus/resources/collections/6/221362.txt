Thought disorder     in psychiatry the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g . with spoken and written language . the people who have this condition use language that is disordered , or sometimes hard to follow . according to the psychiatrists , language is a reflection of thought processes . people who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking . thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness , but there can also be other causes for it . the condition it describes is permanent . it affects speech and writing . those affected may speak all the time , or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence . they may also use different words that do not fit together at all ; this is known as 'word salad ' . eugen bleuler , who named schizophrenia , held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process . however , although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought , the term `` formal thought disorder '' applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language . this is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate , more commonly used but abbreviated term , 'thought disorder ' , is used .
