Liverwort     the liverworts are a group of simple plants . molecular evidence based on mitochondrial dna suggests strongly that they are the stem group from which mosses , hornworts and all higher plants evolved . liverworts are usually regarded as bryophytes , together with mosses and hornworts . recent taxonomy places them separately in a division called the marchantiophyta , or even the antheroceratophyta . however , since the classification is not yet settled , we keep the old terms for convenience . liverworts , as the illustration shows , are small plants with flattened bodies , or with flattened stems bearing overlapping scales . liverworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle . this is a type of alternation of generations similar to that of mosses . cells in a typical liverwort plant are haploid for most of its life cycle . their stalked sporophytes ( diploid ) are very short-lived , withering away soon after releasing the spores .
