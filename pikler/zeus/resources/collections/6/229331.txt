Computus     computus ( latin for `` computation '' ) is the method for calculating the date of easter . in the early 4th century there was confusion about when christian easter or the resurrection should be celebrated . at the arles council , in 314 , was obliged to all the christianity to celebrate easter the same day , and that this date was going to be assigned by the pope , that was going to send epistles to all the churches in the world with the necessary instructions . however , not all the congregations followed those precepts . in the first council of nicaea , in 325 , this subject was solved . was established that the resurrection easter had to be celebrated fulfilling some norms : - easter had to be celebrated on sunday . - it can not coincide with the jewish festival of passover , celebrated independently which day of the week it was . - christians can not celebrate easter twice the same year . this is explained because the new year started in the spring equinox , so the celebration of easter before the real equinox was prohibited .
