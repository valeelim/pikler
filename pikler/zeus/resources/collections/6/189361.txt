Dialysis     dialysis is where a machine is used to replace a kidney after kidney failure . the word `` dialysis '' comes from the greek word `` dialusis '' , `` dia '' meaning through , and `` lusis '' meaning loosening . dialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time , or for people who no longer have working kidneys . the purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body . these minerals include sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , phosphorous , magnesium and sulfate . the kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood . dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance . however the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol . dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney 's function . dialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration . a very fine material , called a membrane , allows blood and fluid to flow through it . in the machine , the blood flows in one direction , and on the other side of the membrane , a special fluid , dialysate flows in the opposite direction , this process is known as osmosis . dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it , such as potassium and calcium . a doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient . the dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have . the blood and dialysate mix together . the waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane .
