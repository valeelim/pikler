I Vow to Thee, My Country    i vow to thee , my country i vow to thee , my country is a british patriotic song created in 1921 when a poem by sir cecil spring-rice was set to music by gustav holst . the lyrics come from a poem by cecil spring-rice that he wrote in 1908 when he was working at the british embassy in stockholm , sweden . at first called `` urbs dei '' , or `` the two fatherlands '' , the poem is about how a christian owes his loyalties to both his homeland and the kingdom of heaven . the first verse , as written , had a very direct and heated patriotism that has become less popular since the first world war . in 1912 , rice was sent to washington , d.c. as the british ambassador to the united states of america . while serving as ambassador , he tried to get president woodrow wilson to give up on neutrality and join britain and her empire in the war against germany . after america entered the war , rice was called back to britain . shortly before he left the united states , in january of 1918 , he re-wrote and re-titled `` urbs dei '' , after making big changes to the first verse to talk more about the huge losses that british soldiers were having in the war years .
