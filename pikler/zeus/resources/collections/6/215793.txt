George Gaylord Simpson     george gaylord simpson ( 16 june 1902 â€“ 6 october 1984 ) was an american paleontologist . simpson was perhaps the most influential paleontologist of the twentieth century , and a major participant in the modern evolutionary synthesis . he was an expert on extinct mammals and their migrations , especially the great american interchange between the americas . simpson opposed alfred wegener 's theory of continental drift , so his work on animal migration lacked this idea . simpson dispelled the myth that the evolution of the horse was a linear process culminating in the modern `` equus caballus '' . he coined the word `` hypodigm '' in 1940 , and published extensively on the taxonomy of fossil and living mammals . born in chicago , illinois , simpson was raised mostly in denver , colorado . he got his degrees from yale university in 1923 and 1926. his dissertation , `` american mesozoic mammalia '' ( 1929 ) , was the first step in his lifelong interest in the evolution of mammals . after a post-doctoral year at the british natural history museum , simpson returned in 1927 to take up a post in the american museum of natural history .
