Inference (statistics)    inference ( statistics ) statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data that is subject to random variation . examples would be observational errors or sampling variation . for the most part , statistical inference makes statements about populations , using data drawn from the population of interest by some form of random sampling . the result is some kind of statistical proposition , such as : - an estimate ; i.e. , a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest - a confidence interval . that is an interval from a dataset such that , under repeated sampling , the interval would contain the true parameter value with the probability at the stated confidence level - a credible interval ; i.e. , a set of values containing , for example , 95 % of samples would include the true value of the parameter . - rejection of a hypothesis - clustering or classifying data points into groups
