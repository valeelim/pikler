Slate     slate is a metamorphic rock . it is formed from shale by being under pressure and moderate heat . shale itself is formed from muddy clay , splits into thin plates . this characteristic splitting is carried over into slate . schist is a rather similar type of metamorphic rock . roofing slates are used in many countries , though ceramic tiles have gradually taken over . heavier slates can be used for flooring ( inside and outside ) . slates are used for the cladding ( surface skin ) of buildings , and sometimes in wales there are whole buildings of slate . gravestones and memorial plaques are another use . thick slate is used for billiard tables and laboratory bench tops , where its resistance to temperature changes and chemicals is useful . slate was used for blackboards and writing tablets in schools .
