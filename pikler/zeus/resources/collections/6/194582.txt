Absolute temperature     absolute temperature , also called thermodynamic temperature , is the temperature of an object on a scale where 0 is taken as absolute zero . absolute temperature scales are `` kelvin '' ( degree units celsius ) and `` rankine '' ( degree units fahrenheit ) . absolute zero is the temperature at which a system is in the state of lowest possible ( minimum ) energy . as molecules approach this temperature their movements drop towards zero . it is the lowest temperature a gas thermometer can measure . no electronic devices work at this temperature . common temperatures in the absolute scale are : - 0 °c ( freezing point of water ) = 273.15 k - 25 °c ( room temperature ) = 298.15 k - 100 °c ( boiling point of water ) = 373.15 k - 0k ( absolute zero ) = - 273.15 celcius to convert from the celsius scale into the absolute temperature , you add 273.15 and change °c to k. to get a temperature on the absolute scale to the celsius scale , subtract 273.15 and change k to °c . this is normally used in the science world .
