Schefflera actinophylla     schefflera actinophylla ( syn . `` brassaia actinophylla '' ) is a tree in the araliaceae family . it is native to tropical rainforests and gallery forests in australia ( eastern queensland and the northern territory ) , new guinea and java . common names include umbrella tree , octopus tree and amate . the elegant schefflera is popular with people who want a big , tree-size plant . in time it will easily reach seven or eight feet ; in its home environment in australia , it gets to be fifty feet tall . much of its appeal as a houseplant comes from the unusual leaves . a leaf is composed of a number of leaflets , all set in a circle around a central stem and stretching out horizontally , like the ribs of an umbrella . eash leaflet is a pointy oval , size to eight inches long , and rich shiny green . as it gets older , schefflera loses leaves from the lower part of the stem , increasing its tree shape . the broad leaves tend to collect dust , and this in turn seems to be attractive to red spider mites . to help keep them under control , and to keep your plant looking its best , keep the leave dusted .
