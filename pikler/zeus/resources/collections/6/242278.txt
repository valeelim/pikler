Late Heavy Bombardment     the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) or lunar cataclysm , is a period of time about 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago . during this time , a large number of impact craters formed on the moon . by inference the same thing happened on earth , mercury , venus , and mars as well . the evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time . many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroidal or cometary material got into the inner solar system , but no consensus yet exists . one popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time , causing objects in the asteroid belt and/or kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planets . some think that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling .
