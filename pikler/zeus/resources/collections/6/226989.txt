Oligosaccharide     an oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars . oligosacchardides are carbohydrates . when they are hydrolized , oligosaccharides give 2 to 9 monosaccharides . oligosacharides arre formed when 2 to 9 monosaccharide units cmbine with each other by the loss of water molecules , resulting in the formation of glycosidic linkage conversly hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 2 to 9 monosaccharide units . those oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide ... those oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides units are called as trisaccharides e.g raffinose ( c18 h32 o16 )
