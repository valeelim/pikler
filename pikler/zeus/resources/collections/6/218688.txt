Abelian group     in group theory , an abelian group is a group that is commutative . an abelian group is a set , `` a '' , together with an operation `` • '' . it combines any two elements `` a '' and `` b '' to form another element denoted . for the group to be abelian , the operation and the elements must follow some requirements . these are known as the `` abelian group axioms '' : - closure : for all `` a '' , `` b '' in `` a '' , the result of the operation `` a '' • `` b '' is also in `` a '' . - associativity : for all `` a '' , `` b '' and `` c '' in `` a '' , the equation ( `` a '' • `` b '' ) • `` c '' = `` a '' • ( `` b '' • `` c '' ) is true . - identity element : there exists an element `` e '' in `` a '' , such that for all elements `` a '' in `` a '' , the equation holds . - inverse element : for each `` a '' in `` a '' , there exists an element `` b '' in `` a '' such that `` a '' • `` b '' = `` b '' • `` a '' = `` e '' , where `` e '' is the identity element . - commutativity : for all `` a '' , `` b '' in `` a '' , `` a '' • `` b '' = `` b '' • `` a '' . an abelian group is a commutative group . a group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a `` non-abelian group '' or `` non-commutative group '' .
