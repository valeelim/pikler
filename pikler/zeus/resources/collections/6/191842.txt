The Point!    the point ! the point ! is a 1971 animated cartoon movie , written by singer-songwriter harry nilsson and carole beers , and directed by fred wolf . it first appeared on abc television , in the united states . it starred the voices of mike lookinland ( `` bobby '' of `` the brady bunch '' fame ) , and actor dustin hoffman . ( later editions replaced hoffman 's voice with that of alan thicke , then musician ringo starr . ) `` the point ! '' tells a story about a boy named oblio , who is the only round-headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads . banished to the pointless forest for not to what is `` normal '' , oblio and his dog arrow ( whose head was pointed , but he was still loyal to oblio ) meet many different people , and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a `` point '' ; a purpose for being what they are . oblio and arrow return home , bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone . nilsson said later the inspiration for `` the point ! '' was an lsd experience . resting on the ground , he noticed everything ( trees , buildings ) that reached into the sky from the ground came to a `` point '' , leading nilsson to believe that `` everything has a point , and if it does n't , then there 's a point to that '' . nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance , and acceptance of in others .
