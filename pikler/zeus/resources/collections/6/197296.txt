Don Carlos     don carlos is an opera composed by giuseppe verdi . it was composed to a libretto in the french language by camille du locle and joseph méry . it was based on a famous german play called `` don carlos , infante of spain '' by friedrich schiller . schiller ’ s story is based on the true story of the life of carlos , prince of asturias ( 1545-1568 ) who was promised that he could marry elisabeth of valois , but then his father , philip ii of spain , changed his mind and married her himself . it was part of the peace treaty ending the italian war of 1551-1559 between the houses of habsburg and valois . the opera was first performed at the théâtre impérial de l ’ opéra in paris on 11 march 1867. it has five acts . don carlos was written for performance in paris . this has made a problem for the reputation of the opera , because it was tradition in france to write very long operas . they always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing . verdi ’ s opera was in five acts , and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for people ’ s tastes , so many cuts were made , including , at first , the whole of act i. this is a great pity , because a lot of the music in act one is very important , with tunes which also come later in the opera . since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of act i is usually performed . there have been many different versions performed , with different parts of the opera cut . when the opera is sung in italian it is called `` don carlo '' .
