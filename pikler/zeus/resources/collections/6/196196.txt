MissingNo.    missingno .  , also known as missingno , is the name of a glitch pokémon that is short for `` missing number '' . missingno . pokémon are used as error handlers by game developer game freak ; they appear when the game tries to access data for a pokémon species that does not exist . first documented by nintendo in the may 1999 issue of `` nintendo power '' , encountering missingno . results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the player 's sixth item in their inventory . it has a unique effect upon the pokémon community unlike anything else . there are two reasons why the player encounters missingno. , both as a result of programming bugs . the first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the old man script in viridian city . when traveling from one area to another , the game assigns numbers for pokémon that the player encounters to a data buffer , read by the game when they encounter a wild pokémon . however , on the right side of the cinnabar and seafoam islands , no data is actually assigned to this buffer , and the information from the previous location is used instead ( the player 's name data ) .
