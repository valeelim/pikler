Axolotl     the axolotl , ambystoma mexicanum , is the best known of the mexican mole salamanders : it belongs to the tiger salamander complex . the axolotl shows neoteny : the larvae do not undergo metamorphosis , so the adults stay aquatic , with external gills . the species evolved in the lake underlying mexico city . axolotls are used a lot in scientific research because they can regenerate most body parts , are easy to breed , and have large embryos . axolotls are closely related to waterdogs , the larval stage of the closely related tiger salamanders `` ambystoma tigrinum '' and `` ambystoma mavortium '' . these are common in much of north america and also sometimes become neotenic . the mudpuppies , `` necturus '' , are fully-aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance . wild axolotls are now near extinction due to population growth in mexico city , and the polluted waters of the lake . non-native fish , such as african tilapia and asian carp , have also recently been introduced to the waters . these new fish have been eating the axolotls ' young , as well as its primary source of food . the axolotl is currently on the iucn red list of threatened species .
