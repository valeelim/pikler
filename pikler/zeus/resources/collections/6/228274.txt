Phase change     a phase change is the process by which forms of matter are altered . for example , when a solid melts and becomes a liquid , it goes through a phase change . when a solid changes into a gas , it is called sublimation . when a gas changes into to liquid , it is called condensation . when a liquid changes into a solid , it is called solidification . when a gas changes into a solid , it is called deposition . when a liquid changes into gas , it is called evaporation . as the states of matter change from solid , to liquid , to gas , respectively , their composition changes as well . for example , in a solid , the bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds . that allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape . however , when heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid , the bonds are considerably weaker , and in water , are simply hydrogen bonds . a liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape , and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is . when `` more '' heat is added , the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas , which has no bonds at all . a gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container . if a gas is not confined , the space between the particles will continue to increase . a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape .
