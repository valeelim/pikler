Age of the Earth     the age of the earth is estimated at a little over 4.5 billion years . working this out was a difficult problem to solve . for most of human history , the basic facts about the planet were unknown . the problem was tackled by earth scientists in the twentieth century . modern estimates are based on radioactive dating methods . the oldest minerals on earth – small crystals of zircon from the jack hills of western australia – are at least 4.4 billion years old . ca-al-rich inclusions – the oldest known solid bits in meteorites formed within the solar system – are 4.567 billion years old . this gives an age for the solar system and an upper limit for the age of earth . the first facts about the earth were worked out by the ancient greeks . a good estimate of the earth 's size was made by eratosthenes ( 276 –194 ) , using trigonometry . the first estimate of the earth 's age based on evidence was by benoît de maillet ( 1656–1738 ) , a french diplomat , philosopher and naturalist . he thought the earth must have developed by slow , natural forces . he studied geology in the field . he could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea . he hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an indian philosopher , to avoid conflict with the catholic church . his work stayed in manuscript until after his death , when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it . now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts . de maillet estimated that the earth was older than two billion years . he also recognized the true nature of fossils , and had early ideas about evolution .
