Astrometry     astrometry is a part of astronomy that has to do with measuring the motion of objects in space such as stars . two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax . proper motion is an object ’ s change in position over time when seen from the earth . just like anything else that moves , a star 's proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved . the difference with stars is that , from earth , they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year . when a star has a large proper motion , it usually means that it is nearby . barnard ’ s star , the star with the largest proper motion , only moves 1 degree across the sky ( 3600 arcseconds ) in 348 years . parallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places . when an object is seen from a new place , there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance . parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight .
