Taxicab number     a taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a series of special numbers : 2 , 1729 etc . a taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in `` n '' distinct ways . it has nothing to do with taxis , but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians : godfrey hardy and srinivasa ramanujan . godfrey hardy was a professor of mathematics at cambridge university . one day he went to visit a friend , the brilliant young indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan , who was ill. both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers . when ramanujan heard that hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was . hardy said that it was just a boring number : 1729. ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all : it was a very interesting one . he explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways .
