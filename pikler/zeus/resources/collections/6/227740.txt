The Rugby Championship     the rugby championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport 's four strongest southern hemisphere nationsâ€”new zealand , australia , south africa , and argentina . it began in 1996 , a year after the sport became professional , as the tri nations . at the time , new zealand , australia , and south africa competed for the tri nations trophy . beginning in 2012 , argentina joined the competition . during the tri nations era , the contest began in july , during the southern hemisphere winter , and ran through september . for most of that era , each team played every other team twice , once at home and once away . later on , each team played the others three times . when the competition added argentina , it returned to a pure home-and-away format , with a total of 12 games played . also , due to a slight change in the sport 's calendar , the rugby championship now begins in august and runs through october . this format is used except in years in which the rugby world cup is played ( every four years , in the year before the summer olympics ) . in those years , each team plays the others only once , with a total of six games played .
