Selectivity (electronic)    selectivity ( electronic ) the principle of selectivity ( discrimination ) is based upon an analysis of several circuit breaker characteristics . these include time-current ( tripping ) curves , peak-let-through-current ( ipeak ) and energy let-through ( iÂ²t ) . the maximum selectivity level with two nominated breakers in series under short-circuit conditions is often stated by vendors in technical reference manuals . selectivity can be enhanced beyond the breaking capacity of the downstream breaker provided it is backed up by an appropriately selected upstream breaker , which should not trip ( unlatch ) under the stated short circuit current . selectivity works as the upstream breaker heats up under fault conditions providing impedance in the fault circuit reducing the overall fault severity . electrical engineering
