Archaean     the archaean ( or archean ) eon is the geological period after the hadean and before the proterozoic . it is one of the four main time periods ( eons ) of earth history . the archaean lasted from 4,000 million years ago ( mya ) to 2,500 mya . it contains the first sedimentary rocks , and the first fossil life forms , which were cyanobacteria , and acritarchs . most of the rocks which survive are volcanic ( igneous ) and metamorphic in origin . volcanic activity was everywhere . when the archaean began , the earth 's heat flow was nearly three times higher than it is today . it was still twice the current level when the archaean ended , 2,500 mya . this high level of heat flow may have made plate tectonics more vigorous than today . the question of when plate tectonics began is a major research area . the large supercontinent vaalbara formed in the archaean . there were oceans already , before the archaean . the atmosphere almost entirely lacked free oxygen , and instead , it was mostly methane and co. fossil bacterial mats , called stromatolites , are found throughout the archaean after about 3,500mya . these were formed by cyanobacteria , which used photosynthesis and gave off oxygen as a by-product . initially , this oxygen was absorbed by combining with iron ions in solution . not until much later did oxygen build up in the atmosphere .
