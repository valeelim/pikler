Errors and residuals in statistics     statistical errors and residuals occur because measurement is never exact . it is not possible to do an exact measurement , but it is possible to say how accurate a measurement is . one can measure the same thing again and again , and collect all the data together . this allows us to do statistics on the data . what is meant by errors and residuals is the difference between the observed or measured value and the real value , which is unknown . if there is only one random variable , the difference between statistical errors and residuals is the difference between the mean of the population against the mean of the ( observed ) sample . in that case the residual is the difference between what the probability distribution says , and what was actually measured . suppose there is an experiment to measure the height of 21-year-old men from a certain area . the mean of the distribution is 1.75 m. if one man chosen at random is 1.80 m tall , the `` ( statistical ) error '' is 0.05 m ( 5 cm ) ; if he is 1.70 tall , the error is âˆ’5 cm .
