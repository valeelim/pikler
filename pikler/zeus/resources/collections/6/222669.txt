Lent     lent , in the christian tradition , is a period of about six weeks before easter . it is a time in which christians are supposed to be quiet and thoughtful , preparing themselves for easter . they should pray a lot , give money to charities and give up some of the things they might otherwise do for pleasure . the period of lent ends at easter , which is a time of great celebration as the christians think of how jesus had died on the cross but then rose again from the dead . lent is traditionally supposed to be forty days long . that is because the bible says that jesus spent forty days in the wilderness , preparing for his death and resurrection . lent begins on ash wednesday . in the catholic church , it ends at the ninth hour of maundy thursday ( 44 days ) . in the anglican catholic church , it ends on holy saturday ( 46 days ) . churches in the byzantine tradition ( for example , eastern orthodox and eastern catholic ) count the days of lent differently . there are also different local traditions in the oriental orthodox church .
