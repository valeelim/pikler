Process     a process is a series of stages in time where the last stage is the product , result or goal . processes may be `` planned '' or `` unplanned '' . a process planned by humans has a purpose . it is a course of action , or a procedure , to achieve a result , or an end-product . the sequence from start to finish is the plan . a plan may be written , or programmed , or just held in the mind . examples include building a house , fighting a battle . sowing crops ; organising a wedding . natural processes are not planned by humans . they are investigated and described . examples : volcanic eruption , the evolution of the solar system ; biological evolution ; the melting of ice and other phase changes ; the process of development from egg to adult . processes often repeat whenever certain conditions hold . example : car low on petrol/gas , visit garage and refill . most computer programs are of this type . processes may be circular : planets revolve around sun ; eggs produce chickens , and chickens produce eggs . rain water flows into rivers , evaporates , and returns as rain .
