Ahaziah of Israel     ahaziah or ochozias ( אחזיהו המלך ) ( israel , ca . 870 bc – ca . 850 bc ) was king of israel and the son of ahab and jezebel . in the bible , it says that he is very bad , and that he walked in the ways of his evil father king ahab . ahaziah son of ahab was king of israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah , and he reigned over israel two years . he `` did evil in the eyes of the lord , because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of jeroboam son of nebat , who caused israel to sin . he served and worshiped baal and provoked the lord , the god of israel to anger , just as his father had done '' ( 1 kings 22:51 - 53 ) . after ahab 's death , moab rebelled from israel , and ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in samaria and injured himself . so he sent messengers , saying to them , `` go and consult baal-zebub , the god of ekron , to see if i will recover from this injury . '' but god was angry at this , because ahaziah did not consult him , but only a god of ekron , so on the way , elijah went and met the servants , and told them ( 2 kings 1:6 ) as the lord had instructed him , `` go back to the king who sent you and tell him , 'this is what the lord says : is it because there was no god in israel that you are sending men to consult baal-zebub , the god of ekron ? therefore ( because of this ) you will not leave the bed you are lying on . you will certainly ( surely ) die ! ' '' and the messengers did has he was told . at king ahaziah 's questions , they described elijah as `` a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist '' . king ahaziah recognized him at once , and sent a captain with fifty men to call elijah .
