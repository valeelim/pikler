Castling     castling is a special move in chess that uses both a rook and the king . in castling , the king is moved two squares toward the rook , and the rook moves past the king to the square right next to where the king has moved . castling takes one move , and is the only way for a player to move two of his own pieces on the same move . castling can be done on either side of the board . castling can either be done on the king-side ( also known as castling short ) or on the queen-side ( also known as castling long ) . castling is only possible if each of the following things are true : - neither the king nor the rook being used to castle have moved in the game . - the king is not in check , and is not moving into check or through check . ( it is okay if the rook is being attacked , though ) . - there are no pieces between the king and the rook . good players castle in most of their games . it is normally a good idea because it often moves the king into a safer place . the middle of the board is normally not a very safe place for the king to be early in the game . it also makes it easier to get the rook into the game . castling king-side is generally viewed as being safer , while castling queen-side is viewed as being more aggressive .
