Power Purchasing Agreement     a power purchasing agreement ( ppa ) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner . the contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner 's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider . this deal is often done using solar technology , where the electricity provider will install , operate , and maintain solar panels on the land owner 's roof . then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof . part of the ppa is to set a price for the electrcity ( often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity ) . if the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner , then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines . if the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs , then he will sell the excess to the power lines . schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof . large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels .
