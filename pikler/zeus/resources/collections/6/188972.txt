National Health Service     the national health service is a government run health care organization that provides health and medical services to citizens and residents of the united kingdom . it was started in 1948 and intended by its creators to be `` free at the point of service '' . this meant that people who use the nhs would not be required to pay for services each time they used them . the nhs is paid for out of employee contributions from their wages and also from general government money raised in the form of taxes . the promise of a health service that would be free at the point of service was broken almost right away with the start of prescription charges . prescription charges are a set price that people within england must pay for each item on a prescription form . this charge is currently Â£8.60 for each item and is raised each year . the nhs is made up of four systems : national health service ( england ) , health and social care in northern ireland , nhs scotland , and nhs wales . each system is ran by its government . for example , national health service ( england ) is ran by the uk government .
