Curve fitting     curve fitting is constructing a mathematical function which best fits a set of data points . curve fitting may involve either interpolation or smoothing . using interpolation requires an exact fit to the data . with smoothing , a `` smooth '' function is constructed , that fit the data approximately . a related topic is regression analysis , which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors . fitted curves can be used to help data visualization , to guess values of a function where no data is available , and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables . extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data . this is subject to a degree of uncertainty , since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data .
