Non-coding RNA     a non-coding rna ( ncrna ) is a functional rna molecule which is not translated into a protein . less-used synonyms are non-protein-coding rna ( npcrna ) , non-messenger rna ( nmrna ) and functional rna ( frna ) . the term small rna ( srna ) is often used for short bacterial ncrnas . the dna sequence from which a non-coding rna is transcribed is often called an 'rna gene ' . non-coding rna genes include abundant and important rnas such as transfer rna ( trna ) and ribosomal rna ( rrna ) ; also rnas such as snornas , micrornas , sirnas , snrnas , exrnas , and pirnas and the long noncoding rnas ( long ncrnas ) . the number of ncrnas in the human genome is unknown . however recent studies suggest the existence of thousands of ncrnas . since the function of newly identified ncrnas has not been proved , it is possible that many are non-functional . the first non-coding rna to be analysed was an alanine trna found in baker 's yeast . its structure was published in 1965 .
