Linear mapping     in mathematics , a linear mapping ( or linear transformation ) is a mapping `` f '' between vector spaces that preserves addition and scalar multiplication . let `` v '' and `` w '' be vector spaces over the same field `` k '' . a function `` f '' : `` v '' → `` w '' is said to be a `` linear mapping '' if for any two vectors x and y in `` v '' and any scalar α in `` k '' , the following two conditions are satisfied : sometimes a linear mapping is called a linear function . however in basic mathematics , a linear function means a function whose graph is a line . related pages . - linear algebra
