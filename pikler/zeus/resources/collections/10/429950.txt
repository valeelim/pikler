Decomposition     decomposition , or `` rotting '' , is what happens to living things when they die . it also happens to organic material of any kind , such as foodstuffs . the reason it happens is that organic molecules are stores of building blocks and energy . whatever breaks down organic material uses the energy and building blocks to reproduce itself . one whole kingdom of living things does nothing except break down organic material : the fungi . their life style is called 'saprophytic ' , because they break down and intake organic matter through their cell walls . a large part of decomposition is done by microbes , especially bacteria . also common is digestion of flesh by maggots . if insects lay eggs , maggots hatch and begin to feed on the body 's tissues . lastly , decomposition can take place by inorganic processes . all organic materials break down over time because they are in higher energy states than ordinary inorganic materials .
