Calculus of variations     the calculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis . it usually deals with functions defined on the real numbers , and with finding minima and maxima of such functions . when finding a minimum or maximum , there are often additional conditions that need to be satisfied . in the 18th century , mathematicians such as leonhard euler and joseph-louis lagrange made this kind of calculus popular . other people who influenced it include adrien-marie legendre , alfred clebsch , carl gustav jacob jacobi and karl weierstra√ü . today , calculus of variations is used in different fields of science , such as geodesy , theoretical physics , classical mechanics and quantum mechanics .
