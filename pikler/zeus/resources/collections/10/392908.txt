Celestial equator     the celestial equator is a term in observational astronomy . it is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere , in the same plane as the earth 's equator . in other words , it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space . as a result of the earth 's axial tilt , the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4Â° with respect to the ecliptic plane . an observer standing on the earth 's equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing directly overhead through the zenith . as the observer moves north ( or south ) , the celestial equator tilts towards the southern ( or northern ) horizon . at the poles , the celestial equator is parallel to the horizon . the observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west , regardless of the observer 's position on earth .
