The Jew of Malta     the jew of malta is a play by christopher marlowe . marlowe 's source is unknown . it is possibly a forgotten story , or he may have studied jewish life first-hand in london . the exact date the play was written is uncertain . it is certain though that it was written no earlier than december 1588. it was first printed in 1633. the play is unbalanced ; the first two acts show a masterful hand while the last three do not . the character of barabas , the jew , is a portrait of depth in the first two acts , but he descends to nothing more than a typical stage villain in the last three . one critic believes the play was ordered on short notice by the players , and marlowe had only enough time to sketch the character of barrabas .
