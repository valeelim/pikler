Representational state transfer     representational state transfer ( rest ) is a programming architectural implementation intended to increase the efficiency of communication in computing systems . it embodies the idea that the best way to share large amounts of data between multiple parties is to make that data available on-demand by sharing references to that data rather than a complete copy of the data itself . systems which implement rest are called 'restful ' systems . an example of a non-restful real-world system would be the traditional home movie collection . in order to have access to any given movie , the library owner must obtain a physical copy of it . this results in substantial waste as more copies are in existence than are in use at any given moment . also , the time required to add new titles to the library is generally non-trivial . streaming video is the restful counterpart to the home library . instead of having a complete copy of every movie stored in the home , the movie is referred to by its title only and the content of the movie is streamed on demand .
