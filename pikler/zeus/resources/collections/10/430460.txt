United States v. Windsor     united states v. windsor was a court case heard by the united states supreme court . the court 's decision was historically important for marriage law in the u.s. it was also important for lgbt rights . the court decided that defining `` marriage '' as a union between one man and one woman ( as husband and wife ) was unconstitutional ( against the constitution ) . this specifically related to section 3 of the defense of marriage act ( doma ) , a law passed in 1996. this defined `` marriage '' for federal ( national ) law in the united states . it defined it as being between one man and one woman . in `` united states v. windsor '' , the court decided that this definition was against the due process clause of the fifth amendment . in the u.s. , the constitution protects the rights of citizens , and no individual law can take those rights away . the basis for the case was the right to benefits for same-sex married couples ; the same right held by heterosexual married couples . edith windsor and thea spyer , a same-sex couple living in new york , were married in canada in 2007. spyer died in 2009 , leaving everything she owned to windsor . under the law , widows do not have to pay tax on anything they inherited from their dead spouse . windsor tried to claim this exemption . she was barred from doing so by section 3 of doma , which said that the word `` spouse '' only applies to a marriage between a man and woman . the internal revenue service denied windsor 's claim , and demanded that she pay $ 363,053 in inheritance taxes .
