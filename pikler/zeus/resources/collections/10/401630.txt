Hydrogenosome     a hydrogenosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle of some anaerobic ciliates , trichomonads , fungi and a few metazoa . the hydrogenosomes of trichomonads ( the best studied ) produce atp by a complex metabolic cycle . unlike mitochondria , this cycle does not use oxygen . it is thought that hydrogenosomes evolved from mitochondria ; their structure is rather similar . in 2010 , scientists reported their discovery of the first known anaerobic metazoans with hydrogenosome-like organelles . these organisms were loricifera living in sediments under deep-water brine pools like the l'atalante basin . these brine pools are completely without any oxygen ( anoxic ) .
