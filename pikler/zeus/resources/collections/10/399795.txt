Sedimentology     sedimentology is the study of sediments such as sand , mud ( silt ) , and clay . how they are laid down today is used to understand how rocks were formed . sedimentologists use their understanding of modern processes to interpret sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures . sedimentary rocks cover most of the earth 's surface , record much of the earth 's history , and contain the fossil record . sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy , which is the study of the physical and temporal ( time ) relationships between rock layers or strata . the idea that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is called uniformitarianism . it is the basis for finding out how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed . by comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example , by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments .
