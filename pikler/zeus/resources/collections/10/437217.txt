Metre Convention     the metre convention is the treaty that set up the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm ) . the bipm is an inter-governmental organization that is responsible for harmonizing systems of measurement across the world . the treaty was first made in 1875 between 17 countries . the member countries agreed to share the costs of running a laboratory on neutral territory . the international prototype metre and the international prototype kilogram would be kept at the laboratory . member state 's national prototype metres and kilograms would be compared with the international prototypes at regular intervals . member states would have regular meetings to discuss developments in measurement technology . in 1921 the treaty was extended to cover electrical and all other physical measurements . this enabled the bipm to published the standards for the international system of units ( si ) . under si , units of measurements that are used in science and engineering were defined in a logical manner . the rules for si also standardized the way in which physical quantities are written .
