Titration     titration is a type of quantitative chemical analysis . it is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance . it makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely , pipette and burette . external indicators like phenolphthalein or methyl orange and internal indicators like kmno4 ( potassium permanganate ) are used to mark the end point of titration . a known concentration and volume of a reagent , called the `` titrant '' or `` titrator '' , is added to a known volume of another reagent , the `` analyte '' or `` titrand '' . this is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached . the volume added before the end point is reached is noted . because one of the solutions , the titrant , has a known concentration , that of the other , the titrand , can be calculated . professionals now use a ph meter , which is potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of h+ ions in the solution . the ph of the solution is measured throughout the titration , more accurately than with an indicator . at the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured ph .
