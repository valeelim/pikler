Diving bell     a diving bell was an early system for underwater diving . the basic idea of a bell is that a hollow object , even with an open bottom , will hold air when put under water ( this can be seen with a glass in a sink ) . if the bell is heavy enough it will sink below the water . a swimmer can be inside the bell and breath , or hold his breath and swim outside the bell for a short time , and come back to the bell to breath again . the idea had been around for a long time , but became useful in the 1600s . scuba diving has mostly replaced diving bells although they are still used sometimes .
