Pilliga forest     the state forests of the pilliga , also called the pilliga scrub , covers an area of 3000 km in north-central new south wales , australia . it is the largest area of semi-arid woodland in the state . the forest is near the towns of baradine and narrabri and the villages of pilliga and gwabegar . author eric rolls wrote a book about the pilliga called `` a million wild acres . '' he argued that the forest used to be an open woodland forest and that european influence has let the cypress pines take over . however , many scientific authors now disagree , using historical records from as early as the 1870s which say that the types of plants in the forest have not changed as much as rolls suggests . however most of his history of the region is an important document for understanding the area . the geology of the area is mainly pilliga sandstone . this is a coarse red to yellow jurassic sandstone containing about 75 % quartz , 15 % plagioclase and 10 % iron oxide.in the south are sandstone outcrops with basalt-capped ridges . in the north there are plains of alluvium from flooding creeks . there are small , shallow , usually dry lakes , called gilgais , in some areas . in the west there are dry sandy creeks , called `` sand monkeys '' . in the east is a heavily eroded sandstone mountain range , which can be seen as sandstone outcrops such as those around gin 's leap between baan baa and boggabri .
