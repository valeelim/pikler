Law of sines     the sine rule or law of sines , is a theorem in mathematics . it says that , if you have a triangle like the one in the picture , the equation below is true . this is another version , which is also true . d is equal to the diameter of the triangle 's circumcircle . the law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known . this is known as triangulation . however , this calculation can have a numerical error if an angle is close to 90 degrees . the law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known . in some such cases , the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle . this is called an `` ambiguous case '' . the law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations which is used to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles . the other is the law of cosines . the area formula_3 of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height ( drawn from the vertex not on the base ) . depending on which side one chooses to be the base , the area can be given by
