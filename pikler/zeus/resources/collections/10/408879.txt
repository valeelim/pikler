Haemolymph     haemolymph ( hemolymph ) is a blood-like fluid in the circulatory system of insects and other arthropods ( spiders and crustaceans ) . molluscs also have a similar circulatory system . insects and their relatives use a molecule called haemocyanin , which does the same job as haemoglobin does in vertebrates . haemocyanin has a greenish colour , not red . the insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries . their haemolymph moves around in the space called the haemocoel . the organs sit in the haemocoel and are bathed in the haemolymph . the 'heart ' is little more than a single tube which pulses ( squeezes ) .
