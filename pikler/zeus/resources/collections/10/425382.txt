Determinant     linear algebra uses matrices . in that context , a determinant is a mathematical function that allows to associate certain matrices with a scalar . only square matrices have determinants . that is to say that the matrix needs to have the same number of columns as it has rows . originally determinants were associated with systems of linear equations : these scalars `` determined '' whether a system had a unique solution .
