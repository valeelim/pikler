Gauss (unit)    gauss ( unit ) the gauss ( symbol g ) is the cgs unit used to measure magnetic fields . one gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter . there are 10,000 ( 10 ) gauss in one tesla . the unit is named in honor of the german mathematician and physicist carl friedrich gauss . example values . - 10–10 gauss – the magnetic field of the human brain - 0.31–0.58 gauss – the earth 's magnetic field at its surface - 25 gauss – the earth 's magnetic field in its core - 50 gauss – a typical refrigerator magnet - 100 gauss – a small iron magnet - 600-70,000 gauss – a medical magnetic resonance imaging machine - 10–10 gauss – the magnetic field on the surface of a neutron star - 4×10 gauss – the quantum electrodynamic threshold - 10 gauss – the magnetic field of some newly created magnetars - 10 gauss – the upper limit to neutron star magnetism ; no known object in the universe can generate a stronger magnetic field
