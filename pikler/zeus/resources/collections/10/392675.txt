Star formation     star formation means the earliest stages in a star 's life . dense regions of particles exist in molecular clouds known as `` stellar nurseries '' . the clouds collapse under gravitation into spheres of plasma to form stars . high density regions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) form clouds , or `` nebulae '' , where star formation takes place . in the dense nebulae where stars are produced , much of the hydrogen is in the molecular ( h ) form , so these nebulae are called molecular clouds . the largest such formations , giant molecular clouds , have densities of 100 particles per cm , diameters of , and masses up to 6 million solar masses , and an average interior temperature of 10 k. about half the total mass of the galactic ism is found in molecular clouds . in the milky way there are about 6,000 molecular clouds , each with more than 100,000 solar masses . the nearest nebula to the sun where massive stars are being formed is the orion nebula , away . however , lower mass star formation is occurring about 400–450 light years distant in the ρ ophiuchi cloud complex .
