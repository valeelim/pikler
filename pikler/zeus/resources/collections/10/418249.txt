Blind experiment     a blind or blinded experiment is a test or experiment in where the experimenter does not know which treatment is given to a subject . the idea is to avoid bias which the experimenter might otherwise introduce . if both tester and subject are blinded , the trial is a double-blind trial . suppose consumers are asked to compare the tastes of different brands of a product . obviously , the identities of the product should be hidden – otherwise consumers tend to prefer the brand they are familiar with . similarly , when testing a pharmaceutical drug , both patients and experimenter should not know the dosage being given in each case . the opposite of a blind trial is an open trial . the terms blind ( adjective ) or to blind ( transitive verb ) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone . blind experiments went on to be used outside of purely scientific settings . in 1817 , a committee of scientists and musicians compared a stradivarius violin to one with a guitar-like design made by the naval engineer françois chanot . a well-known violinist played each instrument while the committee listened in the next room to avoid prejudice .
