Prolog     prolog is a programming language that uses first order logic.it is the most widespread logic programming language . it is declarative . alain cormerauer , a french computer scientist developed prolog in the early 1970s . prolog is rather different from other programming languages . it uses facts and rules . given the facts , the rules can be used to derive new facts . note that prolog uses a paradigm called negation as failure , which means that formula_1 is assumed if formula_2 can not be derived . this is different from true logical negation . while negation is failure has its benefits , it often confuses people starting to learn prolog , as they expect true logical negation . prolog also uses horn clauses . it is a turing-complete programming language .
