Partial discharge     a partial discharge ( pd ) is an electric discharge that breaks through a small portion of the insulation between two conductors . a discharge is when electrical charge that has accumulated is suddenly released ( like a spark ) . a partial discharge does not completely cross the insulation between the two conductors , only a small portion of it in one area . it may happen under the stress of high voltage . it is caused by a small opening ( void ) inside the insulating material . the insulating material can be either solid or fluid . the charge passing through this insulation is called electrical breakdown .
