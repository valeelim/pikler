Relative atomic mass     a relative atomic mass ( also called atomic weight ; symbol : `` a '' ) is a measure of how heavy atoms are . it is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom . in other words , a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12 . the word `` relative '' in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12 . relative atomic mass values are ratios ; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity . relative atomic mass is the same as `` atomic weight '' , which is the older term . the number of protons an atom has determines what element it is . however , most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons . an atom of an element with a certain number of neutrons is called an isotope . for example , the element thallium has two common isotopes : thallium-203 and thallium-205 . both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons , but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons , 2 more than thallium-203 , which has 122. each isotope has its own mass , called its isotopic mass . a relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom . the relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number , which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus . like relative atomic mass values , relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units .
