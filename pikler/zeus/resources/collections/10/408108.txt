Secret society     a secret society is an organisation run in secrecy . there would be little or no physical evidence to prove that the society exists . an example of a large secret society is the illuminati , which ceased to exist in 1785 but is believed by some to still exist and be in control of large businesses , banks and individuals , but there is no evidence of this .
