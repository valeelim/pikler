Gliese 581     gliese 581 is an m-class red dwarf star that is not far from the earth . it is 22 light years away from the solar system . this makes it the 89th closest known star to the sun . it is also known as ho librae , gl 581 , or gj 581. astronomers have discovered some planets that orbit gliese 581. the astronomers agree that four of the planets are real , but some think there are two more planets . gliese 581 has a radius , and mass , about a third that of the sun . its estimated temperature is 3,498 kelvin ( 4125 celsius , 7457 fahrenheit ) . its luminosity is 0.01205 times the luminosity of the sun . people on earth can see gliese 581 in the constellation libra . the star 's apparent magnitude is 10.57. this means that a person on earth would need to use a telescope to see gliese 581 , because the star is not bright enough for the naked eye to see . in the 2005 , scientists found a planet orbiting gliese 581. the scientists , led by stephen vogt , used a method called doppler spectroscopy to find the planet and some facts about the planet . they said that the planet , named gliese 581b , has a size close to the size of neptune ( the eighth planet in our solar system ) . they found that 581b weighs 16.6 times as much as the earth , and that its orbit around gl 581 lasts for 5.366 days .
