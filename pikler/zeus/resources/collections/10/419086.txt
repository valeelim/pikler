Gewisse     the gewisse latin : `` gewiss√¶ '' ) were a political group or band of anglo-saxons . they originally settled in the upper thames river valley area . the gewisse were the most powerful group in what would become the kingdom of wessex . the name 'gewisse ' comes from an old english word for `` reliable '' or `` sure '' , in the genealogy of king alfred of wessex , is a supposed ancestor of cerdic named gewis . ( also spelled gwis ) . the true origin of the name can not be determined accurately . the name was old in bede 's time . bede stated the original name for the west saxons was the gewisse . the change in name from the gewisse to the west saxons seems to have taken place in the latter part of the 7th century . the gewisse , like the 'cantwara ' ( kent-men ) and the 'meonwara ' of hampshire were political units , not tribes . in 577 the anglo-saxon chronicle claims the kings of the gewisse captured cirencester , bath and gloucester . the date is questionable but the gewisse did hold those territories . the gewisse found themselves limited in their ability to expand into new territories by the growing power of mercia . the anglo-saxon chronicle for 628 says that cyngils and cwichelm his son 'fought with penda at cirencester and came to an agreement with him there ' . the 'agreement ' meant giving cirencester to penda . it was a permanent loss of cirencester . by the second half of the 7th century gewisse was expanding towards the southwest and devon . at about the same time they lost territory in the thames valley to mercia . the change in name to wessex may have reflected more a change in their territory .
