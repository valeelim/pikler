Honeypot ant     honeypot ants , or repletes , are sterile worker ants which are used as food stores . they develop swelled abdomens , filled with food by other worker ants . they are living storage containers . there are five genera of honepot ants . ant species often have polymorphs : different forms of the same type . the soldier ants which defend colonies are genetically the same as the normal workers . the way they develop is different . this is done by changes in food , or by pheromones . young honeypot ants are more or less force-fed until their gasters ( =stomachs ) are swelled up . then they act as living food storage vessels . these food storage workers are called `` repletes '' . these replete workers develop in the north american honeypot ant `` myrmecocystus mexicanus '' . rissing found that usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes ; and , if repletes are removed from the colony , other workers become repletes . this shows the flexibility of this polymorphism . honey ants use their own bodies as living storage , but they have more function than just storing food . some store liquids , body fat , and water brought to them by worker ants . they can later serve as a food source for their fellow ants when food is otherwise scarce . when the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed , the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant , causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid .
