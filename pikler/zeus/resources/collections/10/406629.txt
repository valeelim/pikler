Sulfonamide (drug)    sulfonamide ( drug ) a sulfonamide ( or sulphonamide ) is a kind of drug . it is a man-made antibiotic . their ability to kill infectious bacteria is their main function , but some types have other medical uses . for example , sulfasalazine , in addition to its use as an antibiotic , is also used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease . sulfonamides ( sometimes called sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs ) contain the sulfonamide chemical group . the best known of the antibiotic sulfonamide drugs is called sulfanilimide . in bacteria , antibacterial sulfonamides inhibit the enzyme dhps . the enzyme makes folic acid , a b vitamin . the microorganism is `` starved '' of folate and dies . humans , unlike bacteria , get folate ( vitamin b ) through their diet . sulfonamide drugs were the first antimicrobial drugs . they paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine . experiments with the first sulfonamide began in 1932 in the laboratories of bayer ag , at that time a component of the huge german chemical trust ig farben . after years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of compounds , a team led by physician/researcher gerhard domagk finally found one that worked : a red dye synthesized by bayer chemist josef klarer which had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice . the first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935 , more than two years after the drug was patented by klarer and his research partner fritz mietzsch .
