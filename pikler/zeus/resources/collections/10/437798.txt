Happisburgh footprints     the oldest hominin footprints in europe are in britain . they are about 800,000 years to a million years old . they were found on happisburgh beach , east anglia in may 2013. the archaeologists describe them as `` the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside africa at between ca . 1 million and 0.78 million years ago '' . the site is known for its preservation of sediments with early pleistocene fauna and flora . since 2005 flint tools have been found . this means humans occupied northern europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before . the footprints were found in sediment , partially covered by beach sand , at low tide on the shore at happisburgh . stormy weather had washed away the sand , leaving the sediment exposed . because the sediment was soft , and lay below the high tide mark , the tides quickly eroded the exposed sediment , and in two weeks the footprints had all been destroyed . the team worked during low tides , often in pouring rain , to record 3d images of all the footprints .
