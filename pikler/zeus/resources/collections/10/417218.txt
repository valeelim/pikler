Beorhtric of Wessex     beorhtric ( also brihtric ; meaning 'magnificent ruler ' ) ( â€  802 ) was the king of wessex from 786 to 802. he ruled wessex as a king . his wife and father-in-law exercised most of the power . the names of his parents and his ancestry are unknown . in 786 , cynewulf , king of wessex , was killed by cyneheard , brother of the former king sigeberht . either with help of offa of mercia or quickly coming under his influence , beorhtric became king of wessex . in 787 , he held the synod of chelsea jointly with offa . in 789 he married eadburh , offa 's daughter . that same year vikings appeared off the coast of devon . believing they were traders the local went to meet them and was killed . this was the first encounter with vikings in southern england . after offa 's death in 796 , mercian power over england was weakened . there was a period of three years when some west saxons tried to break free of mercian control . but beorhtric and cenfulf , the new king , signed a peace treaty . from that time on wessex remained subordinate to mercia . three west saxon coins have survived from beorhtric 's reign . in style they are very similar to coins struck by offa . they were probably minted at southampton after offa 's death .
