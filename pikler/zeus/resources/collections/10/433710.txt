Criminal law     criminal law is the part of law that is about social norms . people who violate these norms are punished for their violation . it is different from civil law . criminal law wants to protect certain values , such as life and limb , or property . criminal law has different objectives : - retribution – criminals ought to `` suffer '' in some way . this is the most widely seen goal . because of what they did , they profited from others , or they caused harm to them . as a consequence , criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to `` balance the scales '' . people submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if other people act against these laws , they surrender the rights granted to them by these law . for this reason , one who murders may be executed himself . a related theory includes the idea of `` righting the balance . '' - deterrence – `` individual '' deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender . the aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . `` general '' deterrence aims at society at large . by imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other people are discouraged from committing those offenses .
