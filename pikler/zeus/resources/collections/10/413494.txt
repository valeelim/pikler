Endogenous and exogenous     the earth is shaped by many different geological processes . the forces that cause these processes come from both above and beneath the earth 's surface . processes that are caused by forces from within the earth are endogenous processes . by contrast , exogenous processes come from forces on or above the earth 's surface . endo is a prefix meaning `` in '' while exo is a prefix meaning `` out '' . there are three main endogenous processes : folding , faulting and volcanism . they take place mainly along the plate boundaries , which are the zones that lay on the edges of plates . these zones are weak . endogenous processes cause many major landform features . many exogenous ( extra-terrestrial ) forces are as a result of other bodies in space . for example , the moon causes tides in the earth 's oceans and other big bodies of water . impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the earth . when they strike the earth , they create craters which are holes , which can be very big or small , in the ground . radiation from the sun can cause aurorae , which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles .
